Report on the results of parallel checks on value added tax management between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic carried out in 2005
Introductory word
The material submitted informs the progress and results of parallel checks carried out by the Supreme Supervisory Authority, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic's Supervisory Authority, which focused on the field of value added tax management and the use of the VIES information system (Value Added Tax Information Exchange System) on value added tax).
In May 2004, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic joined the European Union, so the revenue from value added tax affects not only the national budgets of both countries, but also the European Union budget as a whole.
Parallel control actions focused mainly on the control of the tax administrators procedure when checking the amount of value added tax paid in commercial transactions between Member States of the European Union.
The introduction of the VIES system enabled an electronic exchange of information on the registration of value added tax payers in individual Member States of the European Union and on commercial transactions carried out by these payers.
The inconsistency between VIES data and the data in the value added tax return submitted by the payer should draw the attention of the tax manager to suspicious cases and allow tax evasion to be detected or. scams.
The contribution of parallel checks carried out consisted not only in exchange of information on the financial or financial procedure. the tax authorities in the management of value added tax, but especially in the verification of the use of VIES in checking the application of value added tax exemption in intracommunitary transactions.
The knowledge gained during the implementation of parallel checks is a benefit for the development of cooperation between them and will be used in carrying out further parallel checks in cooperation with the control institutions of Member States of the European Union.
Report on the results of parallel Value Added Tax Administration checks for the period from 1. 5. 2004 to 30. 6. 2005
Introduction

Subject of inspection: (CZ) Value added tax management, (SK) Control of the tax authority's procedure for the management, control and enforcement of value added tax and performance of tasks within the VIES system to exchange information between EU Member States
The Supreme Supervisory Authority, the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as ′′ NKÚ, the Czech Republic ′′) and the Slovak Republic's Najvyšší SR (hereinafter referred to as ′′ NKÚ SR ′′) concluded a cooperation agreement in the control activity on 12. August 2005
The subject of the contract was cooperation in the parallel control events ′′ Value added tax management ′′ included in the plan of control activity NKÚ, Czech Republic for 2005 under no. 05/19 and ′′ Control of the procedure of tax authorities in the management, control and enforcement of tax on added value and full of tasks within the VIES system on the exchange of information mediated by the Member Landscapes. ", included in the control plan of the NKÚ SR under No. 22/2005.
The parallel control actions performed were the character of coordinated checks.
The result of the joint coordinated inspection was processed within the meaning of the European Implementing Regulation No. 31 for INTOSAI control standards.
The cooperation consisted of exchanging information within the scope of the contract concluded and drawing up a joint final report on the result of parallel checks.
The purpose of a coordinated inspection was to verify selected delivery and acquisition cases in suspicious commercial transactions between value added tax payers from the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the Czech Republic) and the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as the ′′ SR ′′).
Both parties contractually committed to each other to provide information from public sources, VIES electronic system (Value Added Tax Information Exchange System) and data on accepted and sent requests to verify commercial transactions between the Czech Republic and SR.
The checks were carried out parallel between June and December 2005.
In the Czech Republic, the inspection was carried out by the department of the state budget and territorial unions of Central Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.
The Ministry of Finance and 12 financial authorities were controlled by the Ministry of Finance and 12 financial authorities: the IRS in Mladá Boleslav, the Finance Office in Kolín, the Finance Office in Teplice, the Finance Office in Karlovy Vary, the Finance Office in Tábor, the Finance Office in Brno III, the Financial Office in Znojmo, the Financial Office in Znojmo Office in Zlín, Finance office in Šumperku, Ostrava I, Finance office for Prague 7 and the Financial Office for Prague 9.
The inspection in the territory of the SR was carried out by the financial and tax section of the NKÚ SR Banská Bystrica and Košice on 9 selected tax offices: Bratislava I tax office, Komárno tax office, Trenčín tax office, Prievidza tax office, Tax office Elected, Dolný Kubín tax office, Košice II tax office, Košice V tax office and Michalovka tax office.
Objective of checks:
The aim of parallel control actions was to examine the progress of financial and / or financial. tax authorities in the management of value added tax (VAT) after the inclusion of the Czech Republic and the SR into the single internal market of the European Union (hereinafter referred to as the EU) and verify the use of the VIES electronic information system, especially when checking the application of the VAT exemption claim I'm sorry.
The controlled period of coordinated inspection was the period from 1. 5. 2004 to 30. 6. 2005.
Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions In EU Member States, an electronic VIES system is in place, allowing tax administrators to check whether the supplier was entitled to exempt taxable transactions from VAT and in the country of destination it allows the customer to check whether the acquired goods have been properly admitted and taxed.
VIES system is not centralized within the EU, each Member State is developing its own system.
The inspection revealed different variations of national VIES systems in the Czech Republic and SR in the following areas:
Summary reports indicate the values of delivery of goods to other EU Member States, the values of services provided are not included in the summary reports.
Data from summary reports submitted by Czech payers are processed in the Czech Republic at the level of the financial authorities where they compare with data on supplies of goods to other EU Member States given in VAT tax returns.
The financial authorities transmit data from summary reports to the Ministry of Finance (CLO), which sends them to other EU Member States.
In SR, data from summary reports submitted by Slovak tax payers are only converted into electronic form and processed centrally at the SR Tax Directorate (CLO).
In the Czech Republic, payers show the value of supplying goods and the value of providing services to other EU Member States on separate lines of tax returns for VAT, which allows comparing the values given in the summary reports with the value of the supply of goods according to VAT tax returns and identifying their differences.
In the SR, the values of the goods supplied and services provided to other EU Member States are reported summarily on the common line of VAT return.
As a result, the SR system does not automatically identify the differences between the value of the supply of goods according to VAT returns and summary reports.
Separate reporting of the value of supplies of goods in VAT tax returns allows you to use the results of comparison of data when checking the exemption of goods to the EU from VAT.
The data delivered from summary reports submitted by payers in other EU Member States are processed into CLO and compared with the value of acquisition of goods given by the payer from the Czech Republic or. SR in VAT tax returns.
In SR, these data are sent to tax authorities and tax administrators will decide which cases of differences will check.
In the Czech Republic, the Ministry of Finance (CLO) will determine which quantified differences between the value of delivery and acquisition of goods must be checked by the tax administrators and transmit a list of such cases to the local authorities.
This ensures that the most significant variations will be verified whether VAT has been granted to the right amount of the goods.
The inspection further highlighted some problems in the VAT management system complications caused by different reporting of intracommunitary transactions (i.e. delivery and acquisition of goods made by payers from different EU Member States):
Summary reports are submitted in the EU for each calendar quarter and the maximum time limit for processing and sending data to other EU Member States is set at 3 months from the end of the relevant quarter.
A shortening of the period for which summary reports are submitted to one month, together with a shortening of the deadline for processing them, would allow earlier access to VIES data.
Tax administrators could thus verify more effectively whether VAT was awarded to the correct amount of intracommunitary acquisitions.
At the same time, filing tax returns and summary reports for the same tax period (month) would allow faster verification of whether the payer reported the same value of the delivery of goods to the EU in the summary report and VAT return.
Differences between the values of supply of goods declared by EU payers and the values of acquisition of goods declared by the payers from the Czech Republic or. SR was caused by MJ. different reporting of intracommunitary supply and acquisition data in individual EU Member States.
For example, it was the introduction of advances received into summary reports, or the reporting of intracommunitary deliveries in a summary report of the supplier in a different quarter than intracommunitary acquisitions in the tax return to the customer's VAT.
Unification of the conditions for reporting such data within the EU would lead to a streamlined monitoring activity of the Member State s' tax administrations.
The cooperation of NKU, Czech Republic and NKU SR was also focused on the examination of selected intracommunitary transactions between the two states.
A total of 40 cases of commercial transactions between 29 Czech and 32 Slovak tax entities were examined together, where there were doubts about their effectiveness or. suspicion of tax evasion on VAT.
NKÚ, Czech Republic and NKÚ SR found out, among others. the following facts:
tax entities have reported in their VAT tax returns for the purpose of unauthorized tax deduction of excessive VAT transactions, which were not actually implemented;
tax operators showed intracommunitary delivery within the carousel shops, which caused a deliberate reduction in the value of deliveries to draw excessive VAT deductions;
suppliers reported in their tax returns for VAT and summary reports intracommunitary supply of VAT exempt goods to buyers who were so-called. ' lost company s' and tax on goods acquired;
suppliers carried out an intracommunitary supply of goods exempted from VAT for tax entities not registered in another Member State.
In these cases the VAT supply should not have been exempted and should have been taxed in the country of the supplier;
suppliers reported intracommunitary delivery at higher value in their VAT tax returns than the intracommunitary acquisition, in some cases VAT was incorrect.
The knowledge gained in the control action showed that VIES provides tax administrators with the information necessary to check the correct application of VAT in intracommunitary transactions.
Tax administrators should pay increased attention especially to the thorough examination of the differences between VAT payers and VIES data and the use of all information in tax proceedings.

5.1 Intracommunitary transactions
The procedure for processing information by tax administrations of the Czech Republic and SR during intra-communitarian delivery and acquisition of goods shows the following scheme.
5.1.1 Intracommunitary delivery
If a VAT payer makes an intracommunitary delivery, he / she is obliged to submit SH by the 25. th day after the end of the calendar quarter.
The payer in the Czech Republic presents in SH summary information about supplies of goods to another EU Member State exempted from VAT for previous calendar quarter.
The payer in SR is obliged to state the value of goods exempted and delivered from the country to other EU Member States during the calendar quarter period.
Data on the value of the goods supplied are always available in Czech or Czech. in Slovak currency broken down by individual tax entities, indicating their tax ID, under which they were registered in their country.
Service data are not included in SH.
If the payer in the Czech Republic finds out that he has reported false data in SH, he is obliged to submit subsequent SH.
If the SR payer finds that the data provided in SH were incomplete or incorrect, he will submit a correct SH before the expiry of the deadline for submission of SH, after expiry of this period he is obliged to submit additional SH.
VIES system allows exchange of VAT registration data for VAT registered in EU Member States.
Payers from Czech Republic or. The SR can verify whether the customer's VAT is registered in a given EU Member State.
The data from the SH submitted are on MF CLO or. DR CLO by VIES system grouped according to individual customer's tax.
A cumulative value of all deliveries for each customer's tax and a code of the way they are filling from all their Czech or Czechs. Slovak suppliers, so-called. L1QD files.
Data from L1QD files shall be sent to the relevant EU Member States no later than three months after the end of the quarter to which the data relate.
The total value of intracommunitary fulfilments between Czech Republic and SR (from L1QD files) is shown in the following table.
If the VIES system in another Member State detects erroneous customer's tax ID in the sent L1QD files, it will generate the so-called. O _ MCTL report containing all erroneous VAT with error type.
This message is then sent to MF CLO or. DR CLO.
The O _ MCTL report can contain 4 types of errors: formally incorrect VAT ID, VAT is not registered in a given state or has never been assigned, the customer with a certain VAT number was not a VAT payer in a given quarter, the VAT registration of the customer was terminated during the quarter.
In the Czech Republic, MF CLO transmits data from received reports O _ MCTL to the financial authorities.
If an EU payer's malfunctioning tax ID is used in one of the sh or subsequent SH lines, the ADIS system is generated by the ADIS system. ′′ Notice of doubt to VAT ID ".
The IRS will verify whether the delivery of the payer registered for VAT in another EU Member State has actually occurred and will record the result of the verification in the system.
In SR, the DR CLO in VIES processes all O _ MCTL reports and sends them electronically to the local tax authorities together with identification of tax payers who have reported the wrong ID in their SH.
The tax authorities subsequently invite the payer to submit additional SH and to provide valid VATs or VATs. The tax office will check the delivery of goods with the relevant payer when reporting an invalid VAT in the SH filed.
The data on the number of erroneous VATs related to intracommunitary transactions between the Czech Republic and the SR are given in the following table.
Out of the total of 41 728 Czech payer VATs, listed in the SH Slovak payers between the 2. th quarter of 2004 and the 1. th quarter of 2005, there were 929 wrong IDs, i.e. 2,23 %.
Out of the total of 62 997 VAT of Slovak payers, listed in the SH of Czech payers during the same period, there were 416 wrong IDs, i.e. 0,66 %.
When reporting intracommunitary transactions between the Czech Republic and the SR, Czech VAT payers reported on average less bad tax than SR payers.
When checking the activities of financial or financials tax authorities found that VIES did not provide up-to-date information on the validity of tax payer s' VAT registrations in all cases.
For example.:
- although the VIES system confirmed the validity of the registration of the tax body in the 4. th quarter of 2004, the report O _ MCTL was subsequently generated due to the termination of the payer registration in this quarter.
The investigation established that the registration ended until 1. August 2005;
- NKÚ SR further found that 6 tax entities filed a SH, which reported the wrong ID, but the O _ MCTL reports did not contain this ID.
In SR the filed SH will be converted into an electronic form at the tax authorities and the data from them to DR CLO.
Following subsequent processing of this data in VIES system, DR CLO will send the so-called tax authorities to the relevant tax authorities. breakdowns of errors in SH filed by tax entities for the respective quarter.
NKÚ SR compared data on the occurrence of erroneous data in SH to 26. 7. 2005 (i.e. data processed before the start of the inspection) and 2. 2. 2006 (i.e. data processed after completion of the inspection).
The comparison of data contains the following table.
From the above data, it is apparent that the NKÚ SR control affected not only the reduction of the number of SH with the wrong ID (average of 199 SH / quarter) but also the reduction of the number of unpaired errors in SH (average by 431 errors per quarter).
In the Czech Republic, the value of intracommunitary deliveries given by the payer in the relevant DAP lines is compared with the value of intracommunitary delivery specified by this payer in quarterly SH.
The ADIS system automatically indicates the differences between these values.
The tax administrator should check the differences, eliminate any inconclusiveness and use the data obtained when determining the tax liability.
NKU, Czech Republic found that controlled financial authorities did not verify these differences in 27 cases.
The total difference between the values shown in SH and DAP was 537 thousand in these cases...
Since the 3. th quarter of 2004, the ADIS system enabled the tax administrator in the Czech Republic to consider the difference between the values given in SH and DAP of up to 0,5 % of the total value of intracommunitary delivery according to SH as a conformity and set it in ADIS system.
For payers with a large volume of intracommunitary delivery in one quarter, 0,5 % of the value is an insignificant amount, therefore tax administrators should not set SH and DAP conformity without clarifying the causes of differences.
For example: the tax administrator set a match without verification in case of difference in values of 1 thousand...
Verification of differences in the Czech Republic and SR was complicated by the fact that SH was served by payers within 25 days after the end of this quarter.
Tax administrators could not compare the intracommunitary supply values given in these DAP with the monthly taxation period at the time of DAP for the first two months of the calendar quarter.
In these cases, tax administrators learned about any non-compliance of data in DAP and SH only when tax liability or excessive deduction of VAT was collected, or. Returned.
5.1.2 Intracommunitary acquisition
The VIES system provides inter alia information on the values of intracommunitary transactions carried out within EU Member States.
Buy goods in Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, data from SH submitted by payers from other EU Member States (delivered by L2QD) are processed by MF CLO.
During processing the data are converted by the minimum and maximum daily currency rates of the Czech National Bank for the relevant period and then compared with the value of the acquisition given by the Czech payers in DAP for the respective quarter.
The value of the acquisition of goods declared by the payer in DAP should be within the minimum and maximum conversion values L1QD (L1min and L1max values).
If the value reported in DAP is lower than the L1min value, the so-called is generated for the payer with the most significant irregularities. verification order.
Orders to verify the acquisition of goods are a warning to problematic tax entities and are transmitted to local competent financial authorities, which must be investigated by the data transmitted.
The number of verification orders for controlled financial authorities in the Czech Republic is shown in the following table.
NKÚ, Czech Republic found that the inspected financial authorities did not verify irregularities in the values of intracommunitary acquisitions, which were highlighted by delivered verification orders.
The total difference between the values shown in the SH of payers from other EU Member States and the DAP of Czech payers was at least 148 thousand in these cases...
NKÚ, Czech Republic selected 533 tax entities files for which controlled financial authorities received a verification order from MF CLO.
The following common causes of differences between the values given in the DAP of the customer and the supplier's SH: on the side of the customer (Czech payer) in 263 cases, the customer did not indicate the acquisition of goods in proper DAP, in 93 cases the payer admitted the acquisition of goods in another taxation the period before he was entitled to tax, in 6 cases the customer stated the value of the goods acquired in the wrong DAP line, on the part of the supplier (EU payer) in 88 cases, EU payers included the values of the services provided to Czech in their SH payers, of which in 54 cases it was a payer from SR, in 39 cases the suppliers included the delivery of goods in a different tax period from the Czech Republic to their DAP, in 22 cases the suppliers reported incorrect ID in SH Czech payer, in 16 cases, suppliers reported incorrect values of delivery of goods in SH, in 12 cases suppliers included the value of goods delivered to the Czech Republic before 1. 5. 2004, in 5 cases suppliers included in the Czech Republic SH value of advances received.
The most commonly misconception of the value of the services provided in SH was on the side of the SR payers.
54 such cases were identified in the inspected financial authorities.
For example: when investigating the verification order, it was found that the difference of 10 thousand. Kč was created by introducing the Slovak payer to SH for the 1. th quarter of 2005 services (construction work and delivery of goods including assembly in the Czech Republic).
Another reason for differences was to include the values of advances received in SH, e.g. 2 Slovak payers announced advances received from Czech payers in SH, resulting in a generated order to verify the difference of 3 thousand...
Orders for verification of goods purchased are generated only once in one quarter.
In cases where the SH data changes in EU Member States such as: change of customer of goods in the Czech Republic or increased value of delivery of goods to the Czech Republic, new verification orders are not generated.
Since the VIES system does not automatically alert these changes, the local competent tax manager of the goods purchaser without any other impulse about facts applicable to the correct determination of the tax liability of the goods acquired and there is a strong probability of tax evasion on VAT.
By checking NKU, the Czech Republic found that this situation occurred e.g. in the following cases:
Slovak payer stated in SH for the 2. th quarter of 2004 the value of delivery of goods for a Czech payer of 1 thousand. Sk.
On June 1., 2005, the tax office sent a request for information to the Czech payer to SR, because the Czech payer admitted the acquisition of goods only 425 thousand...
Based on the tax procedure, the Slovak payer filed an additional SH on 3. 1., in which he corrected data on the supply of goods to the Czech Republic by reducing the value of the supply for the originally mentioned Czech payer to 538 thousand. Sk and by increasing the value of the supplied goods for another Czech payer from 194 thousand. Sk to 160 1 thousand. Sk.
Four Slovak payers announced intracommunitary delivery to the Czech Republic for the 2. th quarter of 2004 240 thousand. Sk (i.e. 8 183 thousand..).
However, Czech buyers did not show intracommunitary acquisition in DAP.
Based on international exchange of information, it was found that the goods were delivered in all cases to another Czech payer, which was not listed in SH by Slovak payers.
During the 1. th quarter of 2005 Slovak payers increased the value of intracommunitary delivery for this Czech payer by 10 thousand in additional SH regarding the 2. th quarter of 2004 Sk.
Due to the above facts, the local tax manager in the Czech Republic could not have doubts about the accuracy of the data in the DAP for the 2. th quarter of 2004, although the real customer failed to fulfil the obligation to admit intracommunitary acquisition for this quarter.
NKÚ Czech Republic found that based on international exchange of information between tax administrations, VAT was additional for the tax period 5 and 6/2004 of 3 thousand. Kč and for the 3. th quarter 2004 of 3 305 thousand. Kč from goods purchased during these periods.
From the above, it is evident that tax administrators had to check not only the differences caused by the errors of the DAP by the purchaser, but also the differences caused by different reporting of intracommunitary supply and acquisition data in individual EU Member States.
Unification of the conditions for reporting such data would lead to a streamline of the control activities of tax administrators.
Buy goods in SR
In the SR, the APV DIS system allows comparison of the value of goods acquired through the VIES system from other EU Member States with the data contained in the DAP by Slovak customers.
The method by which data are compared is called the ′′ MIN-MAX Method ".
Using this method, a conversion of the value of delivery of goods specified in SH payers from other EU Member States at the minimum and maximum exchange rate for the relevant quarter.
There will be an interval of MIN-MAX, which is used for comparing with the values of acquisition of goods specified in DAP by Slovak payers.
DR CLO will send tax administrators information on intracommunitary acquisitions values listed in DAP and EU delivery values in VIES.
The tax administrator will decide for which VAT registered persons will be tested, taking into account other risk analysis criteria.
Based on data provided by the DR CLO, the NKÚ SR selected 57 writings of Slovak goods from the inspected tax authorities, of which 25 payers acquired goods from the Czech Republic, where the highest differences between acquisitions obtained from VIES and values were found declared in DAP.
The controlled NKÚ SR inspection confirmed that the tax administrators did not thoroughly check the differences obtained using the MIN-MAX method and thus did not verify the accuracy of the data contained in the DAP of Slovak customers.
NKÚ SR asked tax authorities to carry out 47 local investigations with specific tax entities as part of the inspection.
During the NKÚ SR inspection at tax authorities, 31 local investigation was terminated.
For Slovak companies, which VIES showed significant differences in MIN-MAX values when acquiring goods from EU Member States from EU Member States. found the following facts:
In DAP for the 4. st quarter of 2004, the Slovak payer did not indicate the value of acquiring goods from the EU.
The tax office found that the company from the Czech Republic accidentally reported the payer's VAT in the SH for the 4. th quarter of 2004, with goods worth 19 thousand. Kč actually delivered to another Slovak payer.
According to VIES, the Slovak company was supposed to buy goods from the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Austria in the 4. th quarter of 2004 thousand. Sk and max 105 715 thousand. Sk.
This company submitted DAP for the period in which it stated the value of acquisition of goods from the EU of only 480 thousand. Sk.
The tax administrator carried out a local investigation, finding that the tax operator bought electricity from the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Austria.
Suppliers did not indicate intracommunitary delivery to SH and DAP according to the date of issue of invoices, but according to the date of delivery.
Due to other discrepancies in the acquisition of goods from these EU states, the tax manager will request a review of the value of the goods supplied via SCAC forms.
The acquisition of goods from EU Member States in the 4. th quarter of 2004 was not stated by the Slovak payer in DAP.
According to VIES, this payer should have bought MIN 11 thousand goods. Sk and max 845 11 thousand. Sk.
The tax office conducted a local investigation, the inspection showed that the tax operator did not acquire any goods from EU Member States in the 4. st quarter of 2004
The NKÚ SR recommended the tax office to request inspection of the supply of goods from EU Member States via the SCAC form.
In VIES system VIES the delivery of goods for Slovak customers worth MIN 557 thousand was reported. Sk and max 565 thousand. Sk.
The payer showed no acquisition of goods in DAP during the tax period of months 10 to 12/2004
Local investigation of the tax administrator found that the tax agency received an invoice from the Czech Republic for material used in repair of hydraulic loader on 10. June 12.
NKÚ SR recommends a tax check on the payer.
During the NKÚ SR inspection in 16 cases, the tax authorities did not complete the local investigation.
In 10 cases NKÚ SR asked the tax administrator to carry out a tax check on tax entities.
Reports on the results of local investigations and tax checks will be submitted by the tax authorities following their implementation of the NKÚ SR.
These cases were, for example:
The Slovak customer did not mention the acquisition of goods from EU Member States in DAP for the 4. th quarter of 2004 and paid no tax for the 10 to 12/2004 tax period and claimed the right to pay excess VAT deduction of total 1 236 Thousands. Sk.
The tax administrator carried out a local investigation, which showed that the tax body bought goods worth 683 thousand from the Czech Republic. EUR (approx. 27 080 thousand. Sk).
These goods were transported from the Czech Republic by a Czech supplier to customs in Čiernej nad Tisou, from where the transport continued to the Russian Federation.
Slovak payer for customers in the Russian Federation issued an invoice of 683 thousand. EUR, which he did not mention in the DAP filed.
The tax manager is carrying out a tax check on the tax body.
The difference between the DAP data of the Slovak payer for the 3. st quarter of 2004 to 1. quarter of 2005 and the supply data reported by payers from EU Member States in each quarter was totaling 4 thousand I'm sorry. Sk.
The tax office found that the tax agency bought goods from suppliers from Czech Republic and Belgium and sold these goods to Ukraine.
The invoices were accompanied by export uniform customs declarations.
The acquisition of goods in DAP was not stated by the tax agency, according to the company manager, the goods under the transit procedure were transported directly from the Czech Republic to Ukraine.
The tax operator did not submit any VAT registration during the local investigation.
A tax check was started with the payer.
5.2 International exchange of information level L3
The exchange of information at úrovni level is initiated by local tax administrators who send their requests for information (hereinafter referred to as ′′ ŽOI ′′) or spontaneous information (hereinafter referred to as ′′ SPI ′′) related to a tax entity or transaction via MF CLO or via MF.
DR CLO to another EU member country. The goal of ŽOI is for example demonstration of the implementation of the transaction within intracommunitary transactions, certain ID, etc.
In the case of SPI, it is a communication of information relevant to tax administrators in another EU Member State.
Cooperation in the field of information exchange is governed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
The maximum deadline for the response to the ŽOI has been set in Article () of the 8 of this regulation for 3 months.
The conditions for admissibility of applications are regulated by the Commission Decision of the European Communities of 15. 11. 2004 stipulating that unless the participating States agree otherwise, the ŽOI must relate to commercial transactions worth at least EUR 1 500 without VAT.
If the JOI concerns a commercial transaction of less than EUR 15 000 without VAT, the requested authority may refuse to respond with regard to its load.
The procedure for handling of the ŽOI received by the tax administration of the Czech Republic, including the indoor time limits set for processing at individual organizational levels, shows the following scheme.
In the SR, the deadline for the handling of the ŽOI by the tax authorities was internally set for 2 months so that the three-month deadline under Council Regulation (EC) No 2 can be observed. 1798/2003.
The MF CLO received ŽOI and SPI from SR from 1. 5. 5. to 30. 30. 2005 2005 ŽOI and 3
Out of 29 accepted ŽOI were 26 (i.e. 89,7 %) finished within the specified time limit of 3 months and 3 (i.e. 10,3 % were done after this deadline.
During the same period, DR CLO received a total of 71 ŽOI and 7 SPI from the Czech Republic.
Out of the 71 adopted ŽOI were 64 (i.e. 90,1 %) finished within the specified deadline of 3 months, 5 (i.e. 7,0 %) was finished after this period (in the other 2 cases, it was not possible to determine the deadline of the materials transmitted).
More details of the time of handling of the ŽOI received MF CLO or DR CLO contains the following graph.
Grounds for sending ŽOI, specified on SCAC forms, contains the following table.
Conclusion
On the basis of international cooperation, compliance with Council Regulation (EC) No has been examined. 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT and further use of VIES system to exchange information between EU Member States, especially in checking the application of the VAT exemption claim.
International cooperation enabled the selected intracommunitary transactions between VAT payers from Czech Republic and SR.
The examination of the selected transactions found that, based on international exchange of information, tax administrations of both countries revealed cases of companies carrying out fictional intracommunitary commercial transactions to obtain excessive VAT deductions and also cases where the buyers did not pay VAT on the goods received at the correct amount.
The inspection further identified differences in the processing and use of VIES data by tax administrations of both countries.
The inspection also highlighted problems caused by different reporting of data on intracommunitary supply and acquisition of goods in individual EU Member States.
Unification of the conditions for reporting such data within the EU would lead to a streamlined monitoring activity of the Member State s' tax administrations.
By checking the financial or financial procedure tax authorities in the management of VAT and the use of VIES system have been found to be financial or. the tax authorities did not use sufficiently all VIES options and relevant legal permissions.
It was also found that VIES did not provide up-to-date information on goods supply and validity of VAT registration in all cases.
NKÚ SR compared data on the occurrence of erroneous data in SH, processed before the start of the inspection, with data processed after the completion of the inspection.
From the comparison of these data it was apparent that the check of the NKÚ SR had an impact not only on the reduction in the number of SH with the wrongly mentioned ID, but also on the reduction of the number of unmixed errors in SH.
In case of irregularities in reported NKÚ SR data, the tax authorities asked for local investigations or tax checks to be carried out.
NKU, Czech Republic did not have such an option within the valid legislation in the Czech Republic.
The knowledge gained by the control actions showed that VIES provided tax administrators with the basic information necessary to check the correct application of VAT in intra-communitarian transactions.
Since there is still room for tax evasion in this area, increased attention should be given to intracommunitary transactions when managing VAT.
Communicating
This report was drawn up in Czech, English and Slovak languages and signed by the President of the Supreme Supervisory Authority, the Czech Republic and the chairman of the Slovak Supervisory Authority.
Parallel control of the value added tax and excise duty management between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic
Introductory word
This information material provides an overview of the progress and results of parallel control actions carried out by the High Supervisory Authority and the Slovak Republic's Supervisory Authority, which focused on the field of administration given from added value and excise duties.
Cooperation between the top supervisory authorities of both countries was carried out under a cooperation agreement in control activity concluded in February 2004.
The topic of parallel control actions has been selected considering the fact that indirect taxes are significantly involved in the revenue of the state budget of both countries.
The design of value added tax, allowing refund of excessive deduction, provides room for tax fraud or tax fraud. Escape.
High excise duty rates, especially for tobacco and tobacco products, alcohol and mineral oils, make a high profit for those who escape taxation by the illegal sale of these goods.
Tax fraud is a problem not only in the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic, but also in other countries of the European Union.
Due to the need to address this issue in a comprehensive way across the European Union, the VAT Working Group has been created by the highest inspection institutions of the Member States of the European Union, which also includes the highest control offices of both countries.
The greatest contribution of the control actions carried out can be seen not only in exchange of experience, but especially in a common effort to identify the problem areas of indirect tax management in order to reduce space for tax evasion.
Experience gained and knowledge will be used in the planned checks of indirect taxes, mainly focused on the involvement of tax administrators of both states in the VIES system, allowing the movement of goods between Member States of the European Union.
Report on the results of value added tax and excise duty control for the years 2002 and 2003

The controlled period was 2002 and 2003.
2. Recap of inspection results
2.1. General evaluation of the control activity
As part of the international cooperation of the NKÚ SR from the Czech Customs database, the NKÚ SR handed over 22 items of uniform customs declarations (hereinafter referred to as ′′ JCD ′′) on imports and exports of goods between the Czech Republic and SR and on the contrary, the NKÚ SR handed over to NKÚ from the Customs database SR 30 221 JCD items.
A comparison of the listed JCD items from the Czech Customs database and the SR Customs database was made.
Out of 5 selected JCD items from the Czech Customs database, a total of 43 % of the related JCD items were assigned.
Out of 12 selected JCD items from the SR Customs database, a total of 26 % of JCD related items were assigned.
Based on the unassigned JCD items, he was on financial or. the tax offices selected the tax agency files for which imports and exports were further verified in cooperation with the customs administrations of the Czech Republic and SR.
Based on the exchange of information from the documents of the customs administrations of the Czech Republic and SR and financial or. tax authorities have been verified in the territory of the second state that reported imports and exports between the Czech Republic and SR were reported.
NKÚ and NKÚ SR performed a joint pilot inspection at the border customs crossing of Starý Hrozenkov - Drietoma, where both interested parties cooperated closely in verifying the accuracy of data on the movement of goods between the Czech Republic and SR.
The inspection did not detect deficiencies in the registration of selected cases of imports and exports of goods made in 2002.
International cooperation enabled the examination of commercial transactions between trading partners from both States and highlighted the shortcomings in the registration of imports and exports.
2.2. Summary of the results of the inspection
In the field of international cooperation, the NKÚ and NKÚ SR control focused on imports and exports of spirits and spirits, tobacco and tobacco products, computers and computer components, mobile phones and their components, or other types of goods.
Based on the inspection of tax entities files on selected financial and / or the NKÚ tax authorities asked for verification of exports of goods declared at 40 JCD total statistical value of CZK 15 and NKÚ SR for export verification in statistical value of 56 989 Sk.
NKÚ and NKÚ SR found out the following facts among other things:
- commercial transactions were not declared on both sides in the same way, which made it difficult to identify the corresponding imports and exports in the Czech Republic customs database and the customs database of the SR,
- error in entering data into customs databases prevented certain imports from identifying or identifying. exports,
- some exports from the Czech Republic have not been demonstrated by adequate imports into SR.
In these cases, there is reason to suspect fictional exports of goods for the purpose of unauthorized application of value added tax deductions,
- tax agencies did not comply with certain statutory obligations when reporting imports and exports in value added tax returns,
- in the activities of financial or financials tax offices were identified in the management of value added tax and excise duty and in their synergy with customs authorities.
In the field of value added tax and excise duty, attention will continue to be needed to be paid to international trade in order to minimize tax evasion effectively.
The improvement of tax administrators's activity in the performance of value added tax administration is important.
The basis of effective control of excise duties is the control of documents circulation, systematic physical inspection of goods and exchange of information with each other when goods are imported and exported.
3. Description of value added tax and excise duty status

The share of SpD in the tax revenue of the state budget in the Czech Republic was around 16 % in 2003 and in SR about 19 %.
The total SpD collection selected in the Czech Republic by the financial and customs offices in 2003 was 85,6 billion. Kč and in SR it reached 38,0 billion. Sk.
4. The course of the inspection action
Cooperation between NKÚ and NKÚ SR took place in two stages.
In the first stage, a comparison of imports and exports of selected commodities from customs databases of the Czech Republic and SR, in the second stage the results of this comparison were used in mutual verification of the realization of selected commercial transactions between the Czech Republic and the SR and during checks carried out in the territory of both states.
4.1.
Preparation of control action
The first proposal for cooperation in parallel VAT and SpD checks was presented at a working meeting of representatives of NKÚ and NKÚ SR in April 2003.
In November 2003 there was a coordination meeting, including him. selection of commodities agreed - types of goods that posed a significant risk in compliance with customs and tax rules: - alcohol and spirit drinks, customs tariff items No 2207 and 2208, - tobacco and tobacco products, customs tariff items No. 2401, 2402 and 2403, - computers and computer components, tariff items and subheadings No. 8471 and 30 8473, - mobile phones and their accessories, tariff subheadings No. 8525 91 20, 8525 99 20, 8529 90 40.
The two parties agreed that the selection of tax entities for inspection will be carried out: (a) from unassigned items found by comparing exports and imports of selected commodities between the Czech Republic and the SR, (b) from entities making imports and exports regularly or on a single basis in large volume, (c) based on findings from checks carried out by selected financial and tax authorities.
4.2. Comparison of customs databases of the Czech Republic and SR
In the first stage, a sample of imports and exports of selected commodities tested for the month of October 2002 tested the mechanism for the mutual allocation of JCD items registered in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and SR.
Subsequently, part of the exports from the Czech Republic was compared with imports into SR for 2002 and on the contrary, for selected commodities according to the customs tariff:
- 2207 Ethyl alcohol undenatured with an alcoholic strength of 80 % vol. or more; ethyl alcohol and other distillates denatured, with any alcohol content,
- 2208 Undenatured Ethyl alcohol with an alcoholic strength of less than 80 % by volume, distillates, liquors and other alcoholic beverages,
- 2401 Unworked tobacco; tobacco waste,
- 2402 Cigars (whether or not with cut ends), cigars (cigarillos) and cigarettes made of tobacco or tobacco substitutes,
- 2403 Other tobacco products and tobacco substitutes; homogenized or reconstituted tobacco; tobacco extracts and penalties (essence),
- 8525 91 20 Transmission devices containing admissions: For cellular network (mobile phones),
- 8525 99 20 Broadcasting devices containing admission devices: Others,
- 8529 40 90 Parts suitable for use solely or mainly with apparatus of headings 8525 to 8528.
Other: Parts of apparatus falling within subheadings 8525 10 10, 8525 8525 91, 8525 8525, 8525 8527 and 8527 90 92.
JCD items from customs databases of the Czech Republic and SR were mutually assigned based on the agreement of individual paragraphs of JCD (e.g. invoiced price, quantity, weight, registration plate of car transporting cargo, date of crossing state border, customs tariff item, etc.).
The results of the comparison are shown in the following tables and charts.
Mutual attribution of individual imports and exports made it difficult, among others. the fact that commercial transactions were not declared on both sides in the same way.
For example, exports from the Czech Republic, declared on one export JCD, were declared on multiple import JCD in the territory of SR, or export JCD had a different number of items from the import JCD.
Other factors that affected the success rate of attribution were the different composition of data in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and SR, as well as the time shift between the registration of exports in the customs database of one country and the registration of the corresponding imports in the customs database of the other country.
The results of the comparison were used in the selection of control samples on controlled financial or. tax authorities.
Some tax entities that made imports or imports were selected prioritized. exports between the Czech Republic and the SR, which have failed to identify in both databases.
In addition, some tax entities with import data were selected to verify the commercial operations reported in VAT tax returns. exports between Czech Republic and SR found in both databases.
4.3. Pilot inspection at border customs crossing Drietoma Hrozenkov-Drietoma
The border customs crossing for pilot control was selected based on a joint analysis of unassigned JCD items in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and SR.
Based on a bilateral agreement between the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and the SR, the use of control sheets was introduced at border customs crossings between the Czech Republic and SR from 1.6.1998
The aim of this measure was to eliminate customs and tax evasion as far as possible, to ensure an overview of the movement of means of transporting goods of commercial character in the customs area and to create conditions for comparing customs records with each other.
Joint pilot inspection was carried out from 8. 3. to 2004 26. 3. and focused on the inspection of this customs control system.
Procedure for the use of checksheets at the border customs crossing of Starý Hrozenkov-Drietoma:
1) Consideration of the vehicle, issue of the inspection certificate and handing it over to the driver.
2) Vehicle weaning in the marked sector in the parking lot.
Customs discussion in the clearance hall of the police of the Czech Republic, police of the SR, Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, Customs Administration of the SR.

Performance of physical inspection by relevant components.
Vehicle discharge from the customs area.
Attention: When importing goods into the Czech Republic, weighted vehicles were directly carried out by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.
When the goods were imported into SR, the weighted vehicles were carried out by the personnel of the delegated legal person.
Vehicles were registered in computer records after consideration.
4.3.1 Control sample
Exports from Czech Republic to SR
The inspection sample was selected based on an analysis of the records from the customs export database of the Czech Republic in 2002.
The composition of the control sample for exports is shown in Table 4.
4.3.2. Check-ins and their registration Exports from Czech Republic to SR
During exports from the Czech Republic to SR, the Customs Administration of the SR issued and registered.
Customs administration of the Czech Republic recorded the registration numbers of these checksheets in the electronic export database.

Exports from SR to Czech Republic
During exports from the SR to the Czech Republic, inspection certificates issued and registered by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.
Out of the total of 339 JCD items of the selected inspection sample NKÚ in cooperation with border crossing workers Starý Hrozenkov, the corresponding registration numbers of the checksheets were assigned to 295 JCD items.
The remaining 44 cases were identified by the workers of the border crossing of Drietoma in their registration and exports of goods from SR to Czech Republic confirmed.
The inspection of the NKÚ and NKÚ SR did not detect deficiencies in the registration of selected cases of imports and exports of goods in 2002 at the border customs crossing of Starý Hrozenkov-Drietoma.
4.4. Selected control findings when verifying commercial transactions

VAT has been paid in SR to the competent customs office.
4. Society dealing with MJ. buying goods for the purpose of resale and reselling them, did not report any exports of goods in the filed tax returns to VAT in 2002 and 2003
According to the customs database of the Czech Republic, the statistical value of exports of goods in 2002 was CZK 3
Based on these facts, NKÚ selected 5 export JCD (5 items) for verification, total statistical value of CZK 669
NKÚ SR identified 5 corresponding import JCD (5 items) in statistical value of 1 012 Sk.
The NKÚ SR control at the relevant tax office demonstrated the implementation of declared imports and the VAT payment.
5. The company whose business was also the subject of the business. the purchase of goods for resale and sale, manufacture, installation and repair of electrical machinery and equipment, reported exports of goods worth 12 966 706 CZK in VAT tax returns.

The competent tax office in SR verified these imports with the tax body.
The tax agency, listed on JCD as importer to SR, stated in the local investigation that imports declared on Czech export JCD were not made.
The NKÚ SR therefore asked the local competent tax authority to carry out a tax inspection of VAT and corporation tax for the 2002 and 2003. tax period.
6. The company dealing with the import and sale of cigarettes exported tobacco stickers in 2002 with a statistical value of 7 338 CZK and in 2003 with a statistical value of 12 228 545 CZK.

Therefore, it is not possible to point out that these exports were not made.
- on the 4th export JCD from the Czech Customs database, imports corresponding to exports from the Czech Republic to SR have not been demonstrated at a statistical value of CZK 399 (see paragraph 5).
In these cases, there is reason to suspect fictional exports of goods for the purpose of unauthorized application of VAT deduction.
5. Control of imports and exports of goods and services as part of the inspection of selected financial or financials tax authorities
5.1. Control sample
In order to verify the fulfilment of tax entities duties in imports and exports of goods and services and to evaluate the level of cooperation between the financial and customs authorities, the financial and controlled financial or. tax offices selected files of tax entities according to the following criteria:
1. tax entities were selected from the customs databases of the Czech Republic and the SR: (a) with the highest import volume, (b) with the highest amount of VAT collected, (c) with the highest export volume,
2. from the financial records, or. tax authorities have been selected according to the above: (a) import VAT deductions applied, (b) excessive VAT deductions applied, (c) right to refund spd, (d) exemption from VAT applied on export,
3. tax entities for which tax checks were carried out.
Sampling was done regardless of country of destination with a focus on risk commodities.
5.2. Control findings in the Czech Republic
Overview of imports into the Czech Republic and exports from the Czech Republic for risk commodities in 2002 and 2003 is shown in the following table:
5.2.1. Check of selected sample at the financial authorities
NKÚ focused mainly on controlled financial authorities:
- the procedure of the financial authorities in verifying the accuracy of the VAT declared,
- cooperation of the financial authorities with customs administration,
- comparison of data from the customs database with the JCD database at the financial offices with a focus on comparing the declared value, applying the correct VAT rate following the customs classification of goods or services, or. comparison of data on JCD and attached invoices with data in the customs database,
- comparison of VAT tax return data on transactions made and received from abroad with data in the JCD database at financial offices or customs database,
- the method of verifying the right to exemption from VAT on export of goods or services abroad,
- comparison of the volume of exports of goods or services reported in VAT tax returns with data from the customs database.
The JCD database at the financial authorities only contained records of those imports and exports where tax entities were obliged to introduce imports or exports into their tax return.
The inspected financial authorities examined tax agencies files reported imports totalling 60 396 thousand in VAT tax returns in 2002 and 2003 Kč and the corresponding VAT totaling 12 644 052 thousand...
The tax corporations reporting in tax returns for 2002 and 2003 were also checked, totalling 47 323 111 thousand...
Tax entities for which imports and exports between the Czech Republic and the SR were examined, according to the customs database of the Czech Republic, in 2002 and 2003, made imports into the Czech Republic from SR with a total VAT base of 3 759 thousand I'm sorry. Kč, VAT of 767 607 thousand. CZK and exports from Czech Republic to SR with a total statistical value of 1 989 090 thousand...
Differences found between records in the JCD database at the financial offices and the Czech customs database were checked as follows:
- JCD items, which were missing from the customs database of the Czech Republic, were requested directly at the Directorate-General of the Czech Republic,
- JCD items that were missing from the IRS database were verified whether these were cancelled documents,
- for JCD items, where different values were found between the customs database of the Czech Republic and the database of the financial authorities, the relevant JCD were requested at the Directorate-General of Customs of the Czech Republic, including the attached invoices.
During the examination, it was found that the JCD database at the financial authorities did not contain, for example, records of import JCD totalling VAT 3 622 thousand. Kč and records of export JCD totalling 9 359 thousand...
5.2.1.1. Differences found
The following differences were found by comparing the JCD database at the financial authorities and accumulated tax liability for 2002 and 2003 in VAT tax returns for the selected sample of tax entities:
The differences in values were mainly caused by:
- Time shift between the implementation of imports and the claim to deduct VAT measured on importation of goods.
The tax agency could claim the tax deduction on imports of goods within 3 years of the end of the tax period in which the goods were placed under the relevant procedure or. in the case of temporary importation regime, no later than 3 years after the end of the tax period in which the scheme was terminated.
- The time shift between exports and the moment the tax body received JCD.
The tax body was obliged to provide information on exports exempted from the obligation to apply tax on the output tax return to VAT tax return first for the tax period in which the goods came out of the country, provided that it also had a tax document which was JCD.
- Failure to comply with tax entities obligations when reporting imports and exports in VAT tax returns.
In some cases tax entities did not include correct data on imports and exports in VAT tax returns.
Since tax entities did not have to attach JCD lists to VAT filed tax returns, it was difficult to check the right to deduct VAT or VAT exemption by the tax authorities.
5.2.2. Co-operation of the financial and customs authorities
During the period controlled, the customs authorities decided to repay or exemption from import or export duties and VAT.
Tax entities were lawfully imposed to reduce the previously applied right to deduct VAT by the amount of tax refunded by the customs office in the tax return for the period in which the tax was refunded.
No legislation provided for the transmission of information on changes in the amount of customs duties and VAT from customs offices to the tax authorities.
Some inspected financial authorities received this information, however irregularly or with significant delay and only from certain customs offices.
One controlled financial authority did not receive this information at all.
If the tax office has not received information about changes in customs duties and VAT directly from the customs office, it did not have the information needed to check compliance with the legal obligation of tax entities.
In 2002 the customs authorities paid VAT back more than 319 miles. Kč and in 2003 in over 398 miles...
The results of the inspection pointed out the ongoing deficiencies in the activity of tax administrators, some systemic errors in cooperation of the financial authorities with customs authorities and failure to comply with certain duties of tax payers filing tax returns and spd.
The management of VAT and SPD identified shortcomings especially in the following areas:
(a) when VAT registrations were cancelled, the payer s' obligation to pay VAT on the commercial property of the registered owner, or which should have been registered on the date of cancellation of the registration for which the payer applied the tax deduction, was verified only in a rare way,
(b) the financial authorities did not thoroughly use the opportunity to carry out a tax check or a local investigation.
This in some cases caused a lack of verification of the right to deduct VAT,
(c) the official records and oral conduct protocols did not contain all the necessary data demonstrating the legitimacy of the excess VAT deductions applied;
(d) the financial authorities did not adequately verify imports and exports declared in VAT tax returns.
5.3. Control findings in SR
5.3.1. Check of selected sample at tax authorities
For the selected sample NKÚ SR verified or the tax authority carried out a tax check for the 2002 and 2003. tax period.
After analysing the tax returns filed and tax refund applications for selected tax entities NKÚ SR, the tax authority asked to provide the relevant JCD evidence of imports and exports, invoices and documents of tax payment.
Subsequently, the NKÚ SR checked whether the JCD submitted were registered in the customs database of imports and exports and the fulfilment of the deciding facts and statutory conditions for the application of the tax deduction on entry from the importation, the refund of excess VAT, the application of the exemption from the export title and the refund SpD.
NKÚ SR verified selected cases of imports and exports of goods between SR and Czech Republic in a structure according to the tribute to JCD items and the sum of statistical values listed in the table below.
In total, imports at 856,2 mil statistical value were checked. Sk, representing 5,11 % of the total value of imports of selected commodities from the Czech Republic to SROV.
Exports of selected commodities were checked totalling 176 miles. Sk, from the total value of exports of selected commodities from SR to the Czech Republic represent 6,87 %.
618 cases of imports of other goods and services (mainly white equipment, packaging and software) from EU states to SR were also checked. Sk.
5.3.2. Co-operation of tax and customs authorities
NKÚ SR by checking at tax offices found irregularities between data registered in the SR customs database and data reported in specific VAT tax returns, e.g.
- 2 tax entities (natural persons) reported imports of goods totalling 1 589 261 Sk in tax returns, which made them entitled to excess VAT deductions.
In local investigations carried out at the NKÚ SR complaint, tax agencies failed to demonstrate to the tax authority the right to apply the entry tax by relevant documents of imports and VAT payment,
- the tax body (s.r.o.) declared in tax return for the taxation period January 2003 the taxable amount of 167 77 576 Sk, export of goods worth 18 006 041 Sk and has applied excessive VAT deduction of 17 157 Sk.
The VAT tax returns filed for 2003 show that the difference between the volume of purchase and exports of 535 59 161 Sk resulting from January 2003 was not compensated throughout 2003
In the above mentioned cases, NKÚ SR asked the competent tax authorities to carry out a tax check of excessive VAT deductions applied.
- in another case, the tax body (s.r.o.) for the tax period January to June 2002 reported exports of goods totaling 87 199 Sk in VAT tax returns.
The verification in the customs database of SR found that the tax body made exports at statistical value of 296 747 Sk during that period.
The tax office carried out multiple local inquiries at the company's headquarters, finding that the company manager (UK citizen) had traveled and the company left the leased premises without terminating the lease in August 2002.
At the time of the NKÚ SR control, the tax administrator reported to the criminal proceedings authorities a notice of suspicion of non-tax failure to commit a crime.
Based on the results of the inspection at selected tax authorities, the NKÚ SR states that the biggest problems in the exercise of VAT and VAT control and SpD were mainly in the following areas:
- non-use of the possibility to carry out a tax check of VAT on problematic tax entities, especially in cases of high value of excessive VAT deductions,
- tax inspection protocols did not contain a list of checked documents
- JCD on import and export of goods,
- insufficient examination of declared imports and exports of goods in tax returns,
- the lengthy management of tax administrators when making decisions, especially in the context of the assessment procedure, as well as the result of the demise of the right to measure sanctions,
- non-compliance with legal conditions when providing tax deferrals,
- noncompensation of VAT arrears within the deadline for the refund of excessive VAT deduction,
- insufficient use of all forms of security and tax arrears.
Based on the check of the identified deficiencies of the NKÚ SR, the competent tax authorities asked for a tax inspection of VAT with a focus on the legitimacy of the excess VAT applied for 14 tax entities.
All inspected tax authorities have been taken measures to eliminate the control of the identified deficiencies, which will be monitored and controlled by the NKÚ SR.
6. Conclusion
International cooperation enabled the examination of commercial transactions between trading partners from both States and highlighted the shortcomings in the registration of imports and exports.
The result of the checks was also the finding of persistent deficiencies in the performance of VAT and SPD payers duties, in financial or financial activities. tax authorities, in the system of cooperation and exchange of information between tax and customs authorities, which ultimately decreased the effectiveness and effectiveness of tax checks.
The knowledge gained also revealed that the financial authorities in the Czech Republic have basic data on imports and exports from the Czech Customs database within the tax information system. There is no similar system in SR for transmitting information on imports and exports of goods between customs and tax administration.
The procedure for verifying the performance of VAT and SpD management was not the same due to different rules and conditions in both countries.
NKÚ verified the necessary data from the information obtained from the customs administration of the Czech Republic and from the documents available at the inspected financial offices. NKÚ SR verified the execution of commercial transactions from tax entities requested via tax authorities.
In case of irregularities, the tax authorities asked to carry out tax checks.
Parallel checks carried out in the VAT and SpD area evaluated the state of management of these taxes during the period before joining the European Union and pointed out the need for further cooperation in this area.
The cooperation between each other will further deepen during the monitoring of financial and financial activity. tax authorities in connection with the adoption of a new VAT law.
One of the new duties related to the supply of goods to other Member States of the European Union is the submission of the so-called. summary report.
This report must be submitted by all VAT payers who made the delivery of goods to another Member State to a VAT registered person in another Member State.
Tax administrators are obliged to enter data from summary reports into VIES (VAT Information Exchange System), to which tax administrators of Member States of the European Union have access to.
Financial, resp. tax authorities then have the opportunity to compare these data with the data given in the VAT tax returns filed.
This system is also used to verify the validity of VAT tax persons, verification of the validity of the VAT exemption applied for delivery of goods to another Member State and to check the proper taxation of goods.
The implementation of parallel control actions showed the possibilities of cooperation between NKÚ and NKÚ SR.
Results of these control actions will be confronted with outputs of prepared inspection actions, which will, among other things, focus on vetting the VIES system to prevent tax evasion in the so-called. ′′ intracommunitary deliveries ".
Given the importance of VAT and SpD for budgetary revenue, control activity should be focused mainly on monitoring and identifying risk areas in order to reduce the space for tax evasion in indirect taxes.

1. Introduction
Migration of the population is one of phenomena that has a global character and have become an inseparable part of the current development phase of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.
Its cause is especially the escape of citizens from the country of origin or the last permanent residence from persecution, especially for reasons of racial, religious, national, political, and the consequences of military conflicts and ethnic cleansing.
Their goal is to acquire asylum and integrate into society, especially in one of Europe's developed democratic countries.
The large group is also made up of foreigners, whose reason for migration is adverse economic and living conditions.
Migration is not a new phenomenon.
The adoption of the Geneva agreement of 1951 and the New York Protocol 1967 on the status of refugees accepted by the governments of signatory countries to apply them in their foreign-political orientation.
The Czech and Slovak Federative Republic ratified the New York Protocol in 1991 and the Geneva Agreement in 1992.
After the division in 1993, the Czech Republic declared their position on the refugee issue by continuing to fulfil the international documents adopted and confirmed their commitment within national legislation by a legal act.
Both republics have enshrined asylum in their constitutional laws.
Parallel checks carried out by the Supreme Supervisory Authority, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic's highest control office and the Slovak Republic related issues were focused on the asylum process and the related issues, whose results are contained in a joint final report.
Cooperation between the top supervisory authorities of the two countries was carried out on the basis of the ' Contract for Cooperation in Control Act ' (hereinafter referred to as ' the Treaty ') concluded in April 2004.
Both parties committed in the contract to provide each other with information on legislation governing asylum proceedings in the state of the other Party, selected statistical data concerning the number of asylum seekers and the results of the asylum process, as well as information on asylum facilities.
The effort of parallel control action was to identify identical troubled circuits and highlight the consequences of this for population migration.
The cooperation consisted of unifying the programme of control actions, exchanging information within the scope of the Treaty and drawing up a common final report on the outcome of the checks.
At the first joint action between 5.4. and 7.4.2004, the same circuits of controlled issues and control procedures were established during the preparation of control actions.
The second meeting, which took place from 28.6. to 30.6. 2004, specified common points for the programme of control action.
The third joint meeting held during the inspection event from 8.11. to 10.11.2004 was exchanged experience from ongoing inspections.
The forms of output from the checks were specified and the structure and content of the Joint Final Report, which was drawn up between 14.2. and 17.2. 2005 at the last common meeting.
The checks were carried out parallel between September 2004 and January 2005.
In the Czech Republic, the inspectors of the Defense and Security Department and selected territorial unions carried out the inspection.
The controlled persons were the Ministry of Interior (hereinafter referred to as ′′ MV ′′) and the Ministry of Interior Refugee Facilities (hereinafter referred to as ′′ SUZ ′′).
In the Slovak Republic, the section of defence, internal and staunch offices carried out a check.
The controlled body was the Migration Office of the Ministry of Vnutra SR (hereinafter referred to as ′′ MÚ ′′).
The controlled period was 2001, 2002, 2003 (hereinafter referred to as the period controlled).
In some cases, statistical data for a longer period are used in the joint report.
2. Recap of inspection results
2.1. Assessment of control activity
The subject of parallel checks was: - asylum process, - asylum facilities, - management of funds and state property, - internal control system.
The interchange of experience gained between the Supreme Supervisory Authority, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic's High Supervisory Authority took place at the stage of preparation and implementation of inspection events.
This exchange enabled more thoroughly evaluated the documents submitted, analyzing the causes of the identified differences in security of the asylum process.
So it was possible to concentrate on decisive problems affecting the activity of asylum devices.
Finally, this positively impacted the quality of the inspection activity.
2.2 Summary of the results of the inspection
Harmonization of asylum law of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic with European Union documents (hereinafter referred to as the EU) was the subject of European Commission evaluation reports to the preparedness of both countries for EU accession.
The adoption of legislation regulating this area continues even after both countries join the EU with the aim of further harmonization with EU law.
The number of applicants for asylum in the Czech Republic increased significantly in 2001.
In the Slovak Republic, the number of applicants has a continuously growing trend, with a significant increase in applicants in 2001.
The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic provide financial and material security to asylum seekers within the meaning of international agreements.
The national budget of both countries allocates the necessary funds for this purpose.
The amount of expenditure drawn from the state budget of both countries is mainly affected by the number of applicants, the duration of asylum proceedings until the granting or granting of asylum and also the health status of applicants.
The amount of some selected benefits is comparable in both countries.
The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic established asylum facilities in which they gradually created suitable conditions for the stay of the parties to the asylum proceedings.
Accommodation, eating, healthcare and basic material equipment and hygiene supplies are provided in asylum seekers during their stay.
At the same time, courses are organised in leisure activities and applicants are created conditions for cultural and sports activities.
Asylum facilities include admission centres and residence centres, in the Czech Republic and integration centres.
The cost of one stay day depends on the occupancy and equipment of the Centre and are comparable in both countries.
In the Czech Republic, the capacity of asylum facilities is basically stabilized.
The Slovak Republic is projected to increase by nearly 1 000 places in the next two years.
The aim is to create conditions for applicants whose increasing numbers are expected to continue in the context of the Dublin Convention application in the years to come.
In the Czech Republic, the highest part of approved budgetary expenditure was spent on service security. The decisive spending of this item was the accommodation and eating of applicants in asylum facilities operated under contract, healthcare expenses provided to asylum seekers and the cost of permanent security service ensuring the protection of asylum facilities.
Expenditure on salaries, payments for work done and insurance were significantly involved in the overall expenditure.
In the Slovak Republic, the budgetary management of migration policy and asylum process was marked by many budgetary measures, which addressed legitimate requirements related to the increase in asylum seekers.
Expenditure on wages, salaries and insurance premiums, material and services expenses and security services were crucial in drawing up current expenses.
The results of the inspection in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic highlighted some similar shortcomings that did not have a fundamental impact on financial management and state property management.
These were shortcomings especially in the area of the use of state budget funds in contrast to the purpose for which the state budget law was determined when the current expenditure was covered by an action with the character of technical assessment of long-term material assets.
The accounting law in inventory and non-compliance with the account curriculum was also violated.
In the Czech Republic, minor deficiencies were found in the handling of state property when it was left to another person without a contract.
Non-compliance with the deadline for reporting changes in the real estate cadastral data violated the Real Estate Cadastral Act and leaving waste to a person who was not a person entitled to waste management was violated.
In the Slovak Republic, shortcomings were also identified in the Slovak Republic when disproportionately high advances for the collection of electricity and natural gas, shortcomings in public procurement and management of state property, when its records were not sufficiently secured and no evidence of the disposal of unnecessary property was demonstrated.
The internal control system has been ensured in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic within the meaning of the generally binding legislation that regulates the way financial control is carried out.
No deficiencies were found in the written documentation submitted.
The Supreme Supervisory Authority, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic Supervisory Authority, despite some deficiencies identified, evaluate positively the SUZ and MÚ procedure in providing services for asylum seekers.
Based on the knowledge gained during the inspection, the Supreme Supervisory Authority, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic's Highest Supervisory Authority find that despite the significant increase in the number of asylum seekers in recent years, the relevant organisational components of both countries have managed tasks related to asylum seekers at an appropriate level I'm sorry.
The evaluation shows that the system is functional and stable.
The results of the inspection were discussed with stakeholders of the relevant state organisational components on both Czech and Slovak sides.
Based on the results of the inspection, we recommend that positive methodological experience of control be used in other joint control actions in the international cooperation of the highest control institutions.
3. Legislative framework
In the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, asylum law is based on the Geneva Convention 1951 (Convention on the Status of Refugees and the follow-up of the New York Protocol 1967).
The first regulation was implemented by law no. 498/1990 Coll., about refugees.
In the Czech Republic there is an effective law no from 1. 1. 325/1999 Coll., on asylum and amendment of law no. 83/1991 Coll., about the police of the Czech Republic.
This law has been amended five times in total (law no. 2/2002 Coll., by law no. 217/2002 Coll., by law no. 320/2002 Coll., by law no. 519/2002 Coll. and by law no. 222/2003 Coll.).
In the legislative process there are currently two other amendments to Act No. 325/1999 Coll., asylum and adoption of other amendments will be bound to European legislation.
At the time of law making no. 325/1999 Coll., on asylum, the area of asylum was part of the 3. th pillar of the EU and asylum documents were in terms of commitment by political documents.
As part of the adoption of this law, efforts have been made to make it as compatible with EU law as possible.
A significant change for asylum policy within the EU was the move of asylum issues from the 3. th to the 1. th pillar, when asylum law became part of the community law from 1.5. 1999 under the Amsterdam Treaty.
This shift triggered the need to create adequate legislation, i.e. create legal instruments in the corresponding legal obligation.
The compatibility of Czech asylum law with EU documents was the subject of regular evaluation reports by the European Commission.
Key communitarian regulations in the area of asylum were adopted shortly before or after the Czech Republic joined the EU and their transposition period at the time of the inspection of the Supreme Supervisory Authority, the Czech Republic has not yet elapsed.
After their implementation into the Czech law, the Czech Republic will be obliged to inform the European Commission how it has performed the transposition.
In the Slovak Republic, the procedure for the granting of refugee status proceedings and the determination of duties of foreigners who applied for refugee status or who were granted temporary refuge in the territory of the Slovak Republic was established with effect from 1.1.1996 the law of the National Council of the Slovak Republic No. 283/1995 Z. from., about refugees.
Since 2003 the Refugee Act has been replaced by Act No. 480/2002 Z. from ′′ on asylum and amending and supplementing certain laws in which the harmonization of the Slovak Republic legislation with Council of Europe 20. 2001/55 2001 on minimum standards for provision of temporary protection in case of mass influx of displaced persons and measures to support the balance of efforts between Member States in the adoption of such persons and endurance of the resulting consequences.
After two amendments to law no. 480/2002 Z z., asylum, in 2003 and 2004 a third amendment was approved at the beginning of 2005, which means further harmonization of the Slovak Republic law with EU legislation in migration and asylum.
Its important elements are, for example, the determination of the duty for asylum to attend the courses of the Slovak language during their stay in the integration center, the determination of the guardian of the courts in non-age foreigners, when they stay in the Slovak Republic without a legal representative, allowing applicants to enter into a working relationship under certain circumstances, specified in the amendment to the law.
Harmonization of the Slovak Republic law with EU law in migration and asylum process was evaluated in regular reports by the European Commission on preparedness for the entry of the Slovak Republic into the EU.
In 2002 the report highlighted the lack of staff capacity MÚ which did not correspond to the increased number of asylum seekers.
4. Asylum process
In the Czech Republic, since 1990, matters concerning refugees have fallen within the competence of MV.
Effective from 1. August 1., the MV established an organizational component of the SUZ state. The reason was to separate the state administration's performance in the area of asylum procedure, which is performed through the MV asylum and migration policy department, from providing services to asylum seekers.
The task of SUZ is to provide accommodation, food, health and other services to participants in asylum and asylum proceedings for MV.
In the Slovak Republic they perform decisive tasks in the area of the azylového asylum process, especially in terms of financial and material-technical security of the asylum process to the extent defined by specific regulations.
Priority tasks are questions related to decisions on foreigners applications for asylum in I. degree of administrative management and complex operation of asylum facilities in the area of accommodation, meals, health, financial and material security of asylum seekers.
In addition, he is preparing a concept for state migration policy.
Results achieved in the area of asylum system production in the Slovak Republic in recent years have significantly influenced cooperation and support from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
A special contribution was his financial complicity in the reconstruction of the housing fund for asylum.
UNHCR co-financed social, cultural and sports activities for applicants.
4.1 Development of asylum seekers and asylum results
The development of the number of asylum seekers in the Czech Republic is shown in the graph.
There was a significant increase in 2001 due to the Kosovo crisis and in 2003 there was an increased number of refugees from Chechnya.
Overview of the results of the asylum proceedings in the Czech Republic is given in Table No. 1.
In the controlled period, asylum was granted in total 394 cases, of which 83 in 2001, 103 in 2002 and 208 cases in 2003.
Asylum was not granted in total in 22 cases in the controlled period and in 22 cases the asylum proceedings were terminated.
The number of parties to proceedings at 1.1. includes both persons who have not yet been subjected to the decision and those who have not been forwarded to the decision.
Additionally, there are persons who have been forgiven for missing the deadline for filing an appeal or who have been annulled a previous decision and have not yet been issued a new one.
In the Slovak Republic, the number of asylum seekers has a growing trend.
If 96 applicants were registered in 1993, in 2003 it was already 10 358 people.
There was a significant increase in the number of applicants in 2001, with 8 131 applicants registered, representing an increase of 423 % against 2000, where 556 1 people applied for asylum.
The information on the results of the asylum procedure in the Slovak Republic during the controlled period is given in Table No. 2.
A total of 49 asylums were granted in the controlled period and their number did not exceed 0,22 % of the registered number of applicants in each year.
Asylum was not granted in 860 cases.
Asylum proceedings were stopped in total in 23 cases.
Most of the applicants voluntarily left the asylum procedure before ending it, by staying outside the asylum without permission.
More than 82 % of the total registered applicants in 2002 and more than 94 % of people in 2003
The length of one applicant's stay in one of the asylum facilities, converted into an average number of days, was 13 days in 2001, 18 days in 2002 and 19 days in 2003.
The poznatků knowledge also shows that most applicants entering the asylum process in the Slovak Republic are looking for better living conditions, i.e. the so-called. economic migration that has no support in documents adopted by the international community, which the Slovak Republic has also signed up for.
In these cases the asylum system is purposely used by the applicant.
An application for asylum based on economic reasons such as job seeking or better living conditions is not a reason to grant asylum.
Such an application should be according to the provisions of § 12 ods. 1 (1) (a) Act No. 480/2002 Z. z., asylum, considered apparently unjustified and should be decided within 30 days.
So far, internationally recognized principles are not established to identify economic migrants that distinguish them from those persecuted in the country of origin and which would allow the asylum process to accelerate.
Given the above, it can be stated that the Slovak Republic is transit countries and migration target countries were and remain West European states in terms of international migration.
The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic after accession to the EU acceded to the agreement defining the state responsible for assessing asylum applications submitted in one of the Member States of the European Communities (Dublin Convention).
The Convention prevents multiple purpose applications for asylum in multiple EU countries.
Applicants return to the country of first registration after positive identification in the EURODAC system.
The Slovak Republic is part of the outdoor border of EU countries, therefore the application of the Dublin Convention may result in an increase in the number of applicants who will need to create conditions for residence in the Slovak Republic until the decision to grant or not grant asylum.
4.2 Pumping of funds
The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic are obliged to provide financial and material security to asylum seekers within the meaning of international agreements and their forthcoming national legislative arrangements.
The national budget of both countries allocates the necessary funds for this purpose.
The amount of expenditure derived from the state budget is mainly influenced by the number of applicants, the duration of asylum proceedings until the final decision on asylum and their state of health.
The growing number of persons entering the asylum process has a direct impact on higher drawing of law-adjusted benefits for applicants, such as food, allowance, expenses on basic material equipment, other material equipment and other social contributions.
The amount of some benefits collected is comparable in both countries.
In the Czech Republic, during the controlled period there was a meal of CZK 58 per person per day, allowance CZK 12 per person per day and CZK 6 per child up to 15 years of age.
The cost of one asylum seeker for one stay day was on average 351 CZK in 2001, 383 CZK in 2002 and 345 CZK in 2003.
Outside of pocket money, applicants for asylum lodged in residential centres with separate cooking and applicants who are private outside asylum facilities may be given a contribution up to the minimum of life.
Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on asylum, as amended, inter alia, in § 84 municipalities, entitles to a contribution to cover costs incurred in connection with asylum facilities in its territory.
The amount of the contribution was set annually by government resolutions and in the controlled period it was CZK 7 per person and residential day.
At the same time, municipalities are entitled to a contribution to cover the non-investment costs of primary schools visited by asylum seekers.
The amount of the contribution was 120 CZK per pupil per month during the controlled period, provided that the person attended school for at least 10 days in a given month.
In the Slovak Republic, during the controlled period, 70 Sk per person per day, pocket 12 Sk per person per day and 8 Sk per child under 15 years of age.
The cost of one asylum seeker for one stay day was an average of 442 Sk in 2001, 447 Sk in 2002 and 445 Sk in 2003.
The municipalities in whose territory there is an asylum facility, are in accordance with Law No. 480/2002 Z. from., asylum, a contribution to partial reimbursement of the expenditure incurred by the municipality in connection with the establishment and activities of the asylum facility.
Meanwhile, municipalities have only partly used the opportunity to apply for a contribution set at 1 500 Sk per bed and calendar year.
National legislation in both countries for asylum decisions sets a 90-day deadline from the opening of the asylum procedure and at the same time admits an extension of this period in justified cases.
The most common reason for extending the procedure for asylum, which affects the amount of state budget spending, is the appeal against the decision not to grant asylum.
In the Czech Republic, the highest number of final decisions was issued between 90 and 180 days (31,54 %).
The second highest number was within 90 days of the date of application for asylum (17,61 %).
In total, 73 % of asylum proceedings initiated between 2001-2003 were decided within one year of their opening.
92 % of asylum applications were decided on within two years of the opening of the asylum procedure.
According to. data, up to 90 % of asylum seekers in the Slovak Republic use the legal possibility of extending the deadline by appeal to the court.
In some cases, the extension was over a year and at the time of the inspection, the court proceedings were not closed.
A certain contribution in the shortening of asylum proceedings is expected from the establishment of common workplaces MÚ and the Úradu of the border and chadzinec Policy in the admission centres in Adamov-Gbeloch, Opatovskej Novej Village and in Liptovských Vlachoch, which was attended at the time of inspection from 1.10.2004.
This implies simplification of procedures and reducing the deadlines of proceedings between the two components of the asylum process.
5. Asylum devices
The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic established asylum facilities in which they gradually created suitable conditions for providing services to participants in asylum proceedings.
Asylum facilities provide accommodation, meals, health care, pocket and basic material equipment and hygiene supplies during the stay.
At the same time courses are organised in leisure activities and conditions for cultural and sports activities are created for applicants.
5.1 Asylum facilities in the Czech Republic
SUZ manages and runs asylum facilities and is competent to manage state property in the premises of the reception center Vyšní Lhota, the reception and residence center Červený Újezd, Bělá-Jezová, Zastávka near Brno, Kostelec nad Orlicí, Havířov and in the objects of the integration asylum centres of Jaromer and Stop near Brno.
At the beginning of 2002, an admission center was established in the transit space of Prague-Ruzyně Airport.
SUZ further ensures the operation of asylum facilities in Stráži pod Ralsko, Seči, Bruntál, Zbýšově and Kashava, which are operated by a legal person based on § 80 (80). Article 3 of Law No. 325/1999 Coll, asylum.
The total accommodation capacity of the admission centres is 747 places and the total accommodation capacity of the residential centres is 1 places.
Receiving centres are closed facilities that asylum seekers must not leave until the prescribed medical examinations and basic admission procedures referred to in Act No. 325/1999 Coll., asylum.
Violence of the duty to stay in the admission center is considered a misdemeanor.
Residence centres where asylum seekers from reception centres are used to accommodate applicants for asylum until the time of legal power is acquired, decisions on their application for or not granted asylum.
Under certain conditions, asylum seekers are allowed to leave residence centres or. stay in private.
Asylum seekers have the right to free accommodation, food, other services and allowance in the admission and residence centres in which they are reported, where they are entitled to free accommodation, provision of food, other services and allowance, provided that they have suffered the necessary actions to identify their financial and property ratios, and these ratios are such that they cannot be fairly asked for even partial payment of the services.
Integration asylum centres serve temporary accommodation of persons who have been granted asylum.
Clients are staying in the center based on a accommodation contract, which is usually concluded for 6 months with the possibility of extension until adequate housing is provided for them, or will be secured by themselves under the state integration program.
In the integration center, clients pay for all accommodation costs and eat individually.
Persons with a confessed refugee status have the same rights and duties as Czech citizens and have the same access to social security.
5.1.1 Cost of asylum equipment
For comparison of asylum facilities, the best indicator of the amount of costs per physical stay day was chosen.
It is based on the factual number of persons who were actually provided daily services provided by asylum equipment.
In table no. 3 and in the graph are devices operated by SUZ designated as own and facilities operated by legal persons under Section 80 of Law No. 325/1999 Coll., asylum, as contractual.
The cost of one stay day in the own asylum facility operated by SUZ decreases with the increasing fulfillment of these facilities. The cause is that the fixed cost of operating objects is calculated on multiple asylum seekers.
The volume of total costs incurred to provide services for asylum seekers is directly increasing with their growing number.
Between 2001 and 2003, applicants in crisis capacity were lodged in their own asylum facilities.
In part of 2003, exceptional accommodation capacity in residential containers (320 beds) was used to solve the capacity crisis of asylum asylum seekers caused by the mass arrival of asylum seekers from Poland.
This capacity was secured by renting 80 residential and 6 sanitary containers.
One applicant's spending for one stay day was then lower in these years.
However, long-term maintenance of high fulfilment of these devices is not possible.
It is necessary to take into account the risks of unexpected flows of refugees and the associated requirement for higher accommodation capacity.
At the same time, it is not possible to carry out some repairs, maintenance and investments with fully occupied accommodation capacity.
The form of asylum installations operated contractually allows the adoption of operational solutions in the area of asylum facilities, where necessary.
5.2 Asylum facilities in the Slovak Republic
Asylum facilities are reception centres and stay centres.
The MÚ has Adamov-Gbely, Rohovka, Opatovská Nová Ves and the stay center Brezová pod Bradlom in its administration.
The total capacity of the admission centres is 470 seats and a residential center of 100 seats.
The growing number of asylum seekers handled. by setting up a residential center in Gabčíkově in rented premises of the Slovak Technical University Bratislava with flexible available capacity from 250 to 940 places.
According to the contract concluded, the leaseer also ensures the provision of services related to the operation of the centre.
In this form, MÚ was dealing with lack of its own staff.
The residential center was also temporarily established in 2002 and 2003 in rented premises in Jazierciach with a capacity of 160 places.
The admission centres had an average of 57 % to 62 % during the controlled period, on average from 33 % to 50 % in the residential centres.
The occupancy changed according to the season and the highest was in the last months of the year, when he applied for asylum for a much larger number of applicants compared to other months of the year.
Another increase in accommodation capacity by about 450 places will be possible after reconstruction of resorts in Opatovskej Novej Village and Vlachoch.
After the construction of the Humennom resort in 2006, the number of places will increase by another 550 people.
5.2.1 Cost of asylum equipment
Data on the amount of costs of asylum installations are shown in Table No. 4.
Their analysis shows that the operation of an asylum facility by another body that provides spaces and ensures the operation of the facilities including related activities is one of the ways to ensure, at reasonable costs, the tasks resulting from the residence of asylum seekers in the Slovak Republic.
6. Management of funds and state property
6.1 Analysis of management
In the Czech Republic, the approved budgetary expenditure of SUZ was increased by 077 103 thousand in 2001..
Of which 89 thousand. Kč (87,29 %) were purposely intended. The large part was intended to address the consequences of the Kosovo crisis (44 538 thousand. Kč) and provision of health care provided to asylum seekers (38 870 thousand..).
In 2002 SUZ spending was increased by 88 88 thousand by 362 budgetary measures...
Of which 62 thousand. Kč (70,48 %) was purposely designated means, of which mostly (53 200 thousand. Kč) was intended for healthcare provided to asylum seekers.
In 2003 SUZ spending was increased by 88 88 thousand by 078 budgetary measures...
Of which 82 thousand. Kč (93,09 %) amounted to purposely designated funds released from the General Treasury Administration.
Amount 51 thousand. Kč was intended for healthcare provided to asylum seekers, 24 000 thousand. Kč to solve the tide of Chechen refugees and 7 000 thousand. Kč for the program of humanitarian evacuation of disabled people of Iraqi Republic.
Overview of the draft SUZ spending during the controlled period is shown in Table No. 5.
From the above overview, it is clear that the highest part of the spending was spent on providing services.
The amount of costs incurred for the purchase of services ranged between 37,07 % and 38,23 % of total expenditure.
The outrageous expenditure under this item was expenses for accommodation and eating applicants in asylum facilities operated under contract, medical expenses provided to asylum seekers and the cost of permanent security service ensuring security at individual asylum facilities.
Expenditure on salaries, payments for work done and insurance (23,99 %-24,97 %).
Last but not least, the purchases of material (around 14 %) were significantly involved in the total expenses of SUZ, with the highest share of these expenditures being the purchase of food (7,61 %? 9,83 % of total spending).
In the Slovak Republic, the budget management of MÚ to ensure migration policy and asylum process was marked by more budgetary measures that addressed legitimate requirements related to the increase in asylum seekers.
The draft and breakdown of the budget in the spending part was characterised in particular in 2001 and 2002 by the nerovnováha requirements, which were based on an increase in the number of applicants for asylum and the needs of financing their legal claims and resources provided mainly in the main category of ordinary spending.
Over the course of the year, the budgetary chapter manager handled multiple budgetary measures, increasing the current spending limit by 41,8 % in 2001 and by up to 71,7 % in 2002
Overview of the application of selected MÚ expenses during the controlled period is given in Table No. 6.
Expenditure on wages, salaries and insurance ranging from 24,47 % to 30,51 % and material and services costs ranging from 21,04 % to 38,82 % of total costs.
More than 10 % consisted of security costs and from 3,92 % to 7,20 % food purchase costs.
Another significant part was the spending of accommodation and food services from 10,82 % to 26,96 %.
The relatively low share between 1,03 % and 6,25 % was capital spending.
6.2 Deficiencies detected
The results of the inspection in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic highlighted some similar shortcomings that did not have a fundamental impact on the management of funds and state property.
These were shortcomings, especially in the following areas: (a) the use of state budget appropriations in violation of the purpose for which the state budget law was determined when ordinary expenses were covered by actions having the character of technical assessment of long-term material property; (b) infringement of the accounting law in the field of inventory and non-compliance with the indicative accounts curriculum.
In the Czech Republic, minor deficiencies were found in the management of the state property, when it was left to use another person without an appropriate contract; failure to comply with the deadline for reporting changes to the real estate cadastral data was violated by the law on the cadastral of real estate; leaving waste for disposal to a person who was not a person entitled waste management has been violated.
In the Slovak Republic, shortcomings were found in the provision of disproportionate advances for the collection of electricity and natural gas, shortcomings in public procurement and management of state property, when its registration was not sufficiently secured and the method of disposal of unnecessary assets was not demonstrated.
7. Internal control system
In the Czech Republic, an internal control system within the meaning of the law no was introduced at SUZ on 1.7. 2002 320/2001 Coll., on financial control, determining the competences of individual employees responsible for carrying out preliminary, interim and subsequent checks.
At the same time, an internal audit system has been established and an internal auditor of SUZ has been appointed.
Every year SUZ is issued a plan of financial, socio-economic and operational technical checks aimed at comprehensive verification of the management of funds and state property in individual asylum facilities managed by SUZ.
In 2002 there were 42 management checks and in 2003 there were 54.
In the Slovak Republic, the direct exercise of control activities in the departments and organizations of the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic in terms of compliance with generally binding laws and internal rules, the Office ensures the Minister's Control.
During the period controlled, no inspection of tasks on the section of asylum policy was carried out.
The internal control system MÚ is mainly focused on the implementation of preliminary and interim financial control under Law No. 502/2001 Z. from., about financial control and internal audit.
The execution of financial control is also regulated by the internal rules of the director of MÚ
The factual focus of the control activity as part of the management of individual departments was established under the annual MÚ plan.
Designated by union directors were responsible for the exercise of control in this area.
According to the documentation submitted, no shortcomings were found.
Since the Ministry of Interior regulation of the Slovak Republic No. 28 out of 23. 4. 4. 2004 is obliged to handle and investigate complaints under the complaints law.
The organizational security of this task will need to be resolved in the upcoming period.
Communicating
This report was drawn up in Czech, English and Slovak languages and signed by the Vice President of the Supreme Supervisory Authority and the chairman of Najvyšie's control office of the Slovak Republic.
Joint report on parallel checks on spending on the construction of the Prague - Dresden highway
Introductory word
Without the existence of trans-European transport networks, modern, dynamic and above all united Europe would be hard to imagine.
Quality transport networks are a necessary condition for maintaining and increasing the standard of living of Europeans.
Creating conditions for fast, safe, reliable and cheap transport of persons and costs is an important task for the government.
It is a very demanding task both organisational and technical and financial aspects.
European efforts for sustainable mobility often and hardly find compromises with Europe's interest in maintaining a healthy and suitable environment for humans.
Construction of transport infrastructure, thanks to the necessary measures for the benefit of the environment, buildings are financially demanding.
Appropriate procedures and decision-making by the state administration in the preparation and acquisition of transport buildings can bring significant savings of public financial resources, which can be used differently for the benefit of citizens.
One of the tasks of control institutions is to actively look for shortcomings that led to lower than achievable economy, efficiency and effectiveness of spending on construction of transport infrastructure.
Control institutions should not only draw attention to the identified deficiencies, but recommend measures to improve the state, for the benefit of citizens, for the benefit of Europe.
Short summary
The two top supervisory institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the Czech Republic) Bundesrechnungshof (hereinafter referred to as ′′ BRH ′′) and the Supreme Supervisory Authority (hereinafter referred to as ′′ NKÚ ′′) carried out parallel checks on expenditure on 2005 and 2006 construction of the highway Prague - Dresden (highway D 8 in the Czech Republic and highway A 17 in Germany).
Highways are connected by a border bridge co-financed by both countries.
Thanks to cooperation with NKÚ, the BRH was able to carry out a thorough check on the efficiency of the funds spent on the construction of the border bridge.
Based on close cooperation with BRH, NKÚ obtained the necessary data on the amount of German bridge and tunnel costs for comparative purposes.
The Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany closed in 2000th border bridge construction contract.
According to the construction procedure, the completion date was finally planned for the end of 2006.
However, during the award of the contract, the Directorate of Roads and Highways of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as ′′ RSD ′′) caused mistakes that led to an extension of the competition period and shortening the time for construction.
The contract with the contractor was thus signed later than expected.
The contractor agreed to build the bridge in shorter time and ensure its completion in 2006.
As a result, however, RSD had to accept a significant increase in the price of the bridge.
The prices of bridges on the D 8 and A 17 highways were compared with the calculation to m2 of the bridge construction area.
Statistical price analysis allowed bridges with high costs per m2 area to be identified.
Analysis revealed that the border bridge was the most expensive bridge in a group of large bridges with a length of over 100 meters.
The price increase could also be attributed to the delay caused by the contract procedure.
When analyzing the cost of building tunnels, the inspectors found that the prices of tunnels on the D 8 highway are significantly higher than the prices of comparable tunnels in Germany.
BRH and NKÚ now have a database of prices for bridges and tunnels, which they will be able to rely on for future checks on the effectiveness of the means used for transport infrastructure purposes.
Both control institutions recommend to build bridges: standardization of bridges and the use of coupled steel-concrete and special structures only when pre-strung iron concrete bridges are not adequate.
The main features of cooperation included her team spirit and informality.
During the parallel inspection, the inspectors participated in their specific knowledge and skills.
Introduction
This report informs about the progress and results of parallel checks on funds spent on the construction of a highway connecting Dresden and Prague (D 8 in Czech Republic and A 17 in Germany).
The checks were focused on the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the costs incurred.
Parallel checks were carried out by BRH in Germany and NKU in the Czech Republic.
Parallel checks took place in 2005 and 2006.
NKÚ controlled the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of spending of approximately CZK 20 billion including VAT (approximately přibližně 690 million) on the border section of the D 8, highway, which has number 0807.
Of this amount, 64 64 million from European funds (ISPA) was planned to be used.
In addition to a parallel inspection carried out together with NKÚ, BRH controlled the preparation and construction of the A 17 highway in 2003 and 2005.
The resources spent on the construction of all three sections of the A 17 highway amounted to about 670 670 million and of which. 277 million co-financed by European funds (EFRE).
The highway from Prague to Dresden is part of the Trans-European Transport Corridor IV. Dresden - central and southern part of Eastern Europe - Istanbul.
The D 8 highway leads from Prague through Ústí nad Labem to the state border.
Highway A 17 leads from the state border of the Czech Republic / Germany to Dresden.
At the time of the inspection, border sections of both highways were under construction.
These sections were launched on December 21., 2006.
On the German side, the highway is completed all the way to Dresden, while on the Czech side of the D 8 highway is not finished, because section no. 0805 in length 16,4 km across the Czech Mountains between Řehlovicemi and Lovosice is still in the preparatory phase.
According to the plan, section no. 0805 between Prague and Ústím nad Labem to walk through the protected landscape area of Czech Mountains.
According to the forecasts made in the Czech Republic in 2001, it should be in r. 2008 on the border section no. 0807 highway D 8 traffic intensity 22 vehicles per day.
According to German forecasts, the traffic intensity at the Czech border will amount to about 25 vehicles per day in 2010
Germany and the Czech Republic concluded in 2000 a contract between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic on the connection of the German highway A 17 and the Czech highway D 8 on a common state border by building a border bridge.
Both states are involved in the construction of the bridge, so the control of the construction of this bridge was an important aspect of parallel checks carried out by both control institutions.
Cooperation of BRH and NKÚ
Since mid-2005, the two top control institutions acted on close cooperation in the inspection of the highway building connecting Prague and Dresden.
Both parties had serious reasons for such cooperation:
1.
Germany is financially involved in building a border bridge.
Its planning and construction is based on RSD.
Therefore, BRH himself did not have the opportunity to inspect this construction project.
2.
NKÚ did not have a comparative database needed to assess whether the funds were used economically in terms of the total cost of bridges and tunnels on D 8.
3.
NKÚ needed to be sure about the effectiveness of spending, taking into account the main technical parameters of the highway, especially the arrangement of bridges and tunnels, which should allow the same quality of driving on both sides of the border.
Following preparatory negotiations, on 4. January 2006, the Presidents of the two top control institutions were signed an agreement on coordinated inspection of the highway D 8 / A 17.
Joint work discussions between the BRH and the NKU inspectors took place throughout 2006 at an interval of approximately six to eight weeks.
The negotiations were dealing with current problems and tasks, especially the preparation of a uniform methodology for control of prices of bridges and tunnels, exchange of findings from border bridge control and preparation of joint reports.
An important sign of cooperation was the continuous exchange of information.
While the BRH has done most of the work to compare the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels and procurement procedures, NKÚ has prepared for the most part a methodology for the price of bridges and tunnels.
The applicable legal standards for control in the state administration differ in both countries in the way control actions are closed.
For these reasons, the two top supervisory institutions have drawn their own control conclusions on their findings obtained during their checks.
This report reflects the results achieved during parallel checks.
The cooperation will be concluded with the signing of the final komuniké in the first half of 2007.
Construction of the border bridge
The Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed in the 2000 contract on the date of completion of the border bridge construction as possible in 2005.
The two parties then agreed to postpone this deadline until the end of 2006.
The RSD was an investor.
Germany financially contributes to the construction of a bridge from 42,13 %.
In the period until 1999, the RSD proposed that the border bridge should have a pre-concrete concrete structure.
In 1999, after agreement with its partners in Germany, the RSD agreed a coupled steel-concrete construction.
This decision was justified by reducing the number of double pillars from seven to five and the subsequent ecological benefit of such a solution for the valley.
In addition, comparative calculations performed by the RSD stated that coupled steel-concrete construction should be a less expensive option.
But there was a mistake in the calculations.
It stated that the new coupled steel-concrete construction will only be 397 m long.
In reality it is 5 % longer.
During the award of the border bridge contract, the RSD made serious mistakes.
It did not prepare a contract documentation to adequately describe the assessment criteria and the partial criteria for comparing tenders.
This error led to the Commission's Assessment and Assessment of Bids and the Director-General evaluating offers in a subjective and problematic way.
The failed candidate contested the results of the contract procedure.
The subsequent investigation of the Competition Authority led to the contract awarding of the construction contract being signed later than originally expected.
This meant that the summer construction season 2004 after the evaluation of offers was wasted and the construction time has been shortened.
The construction company agreed to build the bridge in a shorter time, but at the cost of a substantial increase in costs.
The procedure offered included double installation of the bridge top, change in pillar construction and installation and equipment of assembly premises.
Moreover, the construction company was not able to acquire the originally designed steel type in the necessary term.
A new type of steel - at a price higher by about zhruba 4 million, which had to be fully paid by the RSD - allowed the time to be reduced to anti-corrosion protection, which subsequently allowed to shorten the total time of construction of the border bridge.
Compared to the net price of 18,3 18,3 million offered in the tender, the total cost of building the border bridge due to accelerated progress and other financing adjustments will increase considerably.
The shortened time reserved for works led to an increase in the price of about 5,9 5,9 million.
Currently, the net cost amount is around kolem 25,9 million, without taking into account automatic price increases (as of October 2006).
Price comparison of bridges and tunnels
Both top control institutions analyzed the prices of bridges on D 8 and A 17 highways to identify bridges whose price was too high and to compare bridges on the German and Czech side.
The analysis was based on methods of mathematical statistics.
The tunnels on D 8 were also compared with similar tunnels on the highways in Germany (A 71, A 38 and A 4).
There are no similar tunnels on the A 17 highway.
When preparing this part of the inspection, it was important to identify the relevant prices accurately.
The two top supervisory institutions established the following principles to compare bridges prices: based on the actual price paid for a bridge without value added tax (VAT rates vary in the Czech Republic and SNR and are subject to changes); do not take into account prices for special foundations of the bridge; transfer prices in CZK na na according to the European Central Bank rate valid on 30. 12. 2005 (CZK 29 = = 1).
On D 8 and A 17 there are bridges of various structures (steel-concrete, pre-concrete, coupled steel-concrete and steel) and various sizes.
In order to ensure homogeneity of the structures examined, bridges were divided into groups according to the type of construction.
Within these groups the size of the bridge was also taken into account during the analysis.
By far the most common type of construction were concrete bridges (20 bridges on D 8, 36 bridges on A 17).
The analysis focused mainly on this group of bridges, as the number of the file enabled the use of mathematical and statistical methods with a high level of reliability of results.
The checks found that the prices for m 2 concrete bridges on D 8 i A 17 depend on the size of the bridge (its length, area): the larger the bridge, the lower the price per m2 of the bridge construction.
For German bridges, the price dependence on size was stronger than for Czech ones (see below charts).
Two concrete bridges on A 17 and four on D 17 have been identified, whose price is significantly higher.
To search these bridges, a method was used to enable atypical values to be detected in a set of numbers, and a regression analysis reflecting the dependency of the price of the bridge to its size (to determine atypical expensive bridges, the standard distance from the regression curve is upward).
However, information on the atypically high price of these bridges should be considered only as an indicator on which bridges need to be targeted.
In order to draw a generally applicable conclusion, the causes of high price in each identified case should be analysed.
One such cause may be an inefficient administrative measure, or also environmental requirements or other acceptable reason.
Given that Czech concrete bridges are on average longer than German (see table below), the proven negative dependency of the price of the bridge on its length could lead to the assumption that Czech bridges should be cheaper.
The hypothesis about lower prices of Czech concrete bridges is also supported by lower labor costs in the construction industry in the Czech Republic compared to Germany.
However, the results of the analysis show that concrete bridges prices on D 8 are higher than the A 17.
Two possible causes of this situation were identified during joint negotiations:
1.
In Germany most bridges are awarded as separate contracts.
Such an assignment allows small and medium-sized regional firms to participate in the contract competition.
In the Czech Republic many bridges are awarded as part of a contract for part of the highway route, which is several kilometers long.
Small and medium-sized companies do not participate in such a competition because the contract is too big for them.
2.
In the Czech Republic there is more variability in the construction of bridges than in Germany.
NKÚ found in this context that the type of bridge construction is decided long before its construction.
The decision is taken at the time when the RSD translates the application for territorial decision.
RSD is choosing types of bridges from multiple variants at this time, but economics plays a smaller role in deciding.
The general conclusion on the prices of bridges in the Czech Republic and Germany could only be expressed on the basis of a thorough analysis of the construction work market in both countries, which would go beyond this control action.
The border bridge is the most expensive steel concrete bridge on D 8 and A 17.
In the case of tunnels, it was found that the prices of tunnels on D 8 were twice the size of the tunnels in Germany.
However, comparison of main construction-technical parameters of tunnels to D 8 with tunnels in Germany showed no significant difference.
Significant price differences could be attributed to the fact that there is no real competition in the Czech Republic in the construction of tunnels.
However, a small number of tunnels did not allow for generally applicable conclusions.
The effectiveness and efficiency of the construction of the Dresden highway - Prague
The independent Czech Republic was created in 1993.
The government approved the concept of highway network development in the same year.
The D 8 highway should have been gradually extended from Prague to the state border with Germany.
Section No. 0805 through the Czech Mountains should have been purchased earlier than the border section no. 0807.
The Czech Republic acquires the D 8 highway as part of programming.
In program no. 327 220 ′′ The construction of the highway D 8 Prague - Ústí nad Labem - the state border of the Czech Republic / Germany ′′ set two goals for construction of the D 8 highway:
1.
improve the connection of Prague and Ústí nad Labem - national goal;
2.
improve the connection of Prague and Berlin within IV. trans-European transport corridor Berlin - Istanbul - international goal.
According to the program, the construction of the section of the leader across the Czech Mountains was supposed to be completed in June 2008 and the construction of the border section no. 0807 in June 2007.
It should be added here that the date of completion is not identical to the date of commissioning.
NKÚ found out that the preparation of the construction of the section of the head over the Czech Mountains is now at the stage of an official territorial decision.
Environmental activists contested this decision by lawsuits.
The lawsuits are not decided legally.
Therefore, it cannot be excluded that the section leading through the Czech Mountains will be completed several years later than stated in the program documentation.
In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed to postpone the deadline for completion of section No. 0805 for 2010.
Due to these facts, the construction of the border section of the national goal has not achieved a better link between Prague and Ústím nad Labem.
RSD has made an estimate of capital costs for border section D 8 No. 0807 and section no. 0805 through Czech Mountains from 1999 to 2001.
The estimate of these capital costs included in the investment costs is about 639 639 million together for both sections No. 0805 and no. 0807.
Table 2: Economic Assessment Results (EIRR EIRR Internal Revenue Rate)
All considered highways and speed roads open, both sections D 8 open in r. 2007.
On the northern part of the border section, traffic intensity of 18 vehicles per day in r. 2010
All considered highways and speed roads open, both sections D 8 open in r. 2007.
On the northern part of the border section, traffic intensity of 22 vehicles per day in r. 2010
All considered highways and speed roads open, both sections D 8 open in r. 2007.
On the northern part of the border section, traffic intensity of 25 vehicles per day in r. 2010
The economic analysis carried out in 2001 based on the assumption that the border section and section across the Czech Mountains will be completed on time.
However, at the time of inspection, it is clear that the section across the Czech Mountains will not be open in the original term.
This will reduce the above EIRR values.
The cost of both sections without VAT, calculated at 31. 12. 2005, was 897 897 million, i.e. higher 27,4 % than the cost level with which the economic analysis worked in 27,4 2001.
However, there is a risk that section no. 0805 will be guided in a different, costly route, which would affect the abovementioned economic viability limit.
Economic analysis showed that construction of both sections of the highway is economically viable with at least 18 vehicles per day in 2010.
The forecast for 2008 amounted to 22 vehicles, but the study dealing with the issue of bypass routes for the missing section across the Czech Mountains anticipates the traffic intensity of 12 to 13 vehicles per day, which moves an investment below the economic viability limit.
With the higher load of bypass routes for the missing section across the Czech Mountains, there is a high probability of congestion and thus an increase in external costs, which were not expected during the original economic analysis.
The abovementioned reduction in revenue and cost increase means that the already low EIRR that the construction of the border section D 8. will not be achieved.
Construction of the D 8 border section is therefore inefficient.
The construction of the A 17 highway was similar cost overrun as in the case of these two sections on D 8.
As part of the overall economic assessment of the Federal Road Development Plan for Long-distance transport for 1992 The Federal Ministry of Transport of Germany counted about náklady 320 million.
The resulting cost / income ratio was then 4,6.
Meanwhile, however, costs have risen sharply to about 670 670 million and the cost-income ratio has decreased by more than half.
In addition to a parallel inspection carried out together with NKÚ BRH, he controlled the preparation and construction of the A 2005 highway in 2003 and 17.
In doing so, BRH found that the competent approval state authority requested a field tunnel for the third section A 17 that was not needed.
During the inspection event, BRH managed to convince the Federal Ministry and the German road construction administration that the tunnel is not necessary.
The result was the achievement of savings, which amounted to about 10 10 million and 0,15 million on annual operating costs alone.
Assessing the first section A 17 BRH found that the construction project was not properly prepared.
The following example shows this:
At the preparatory stage, the road construction administration did not research the conditions of the rock base in the rocks of Dölzschen because the place was difficult to access.
This was done only after the tunnel stamping machine hit the rock.
Tests showed that the rocks are more weathered inside than expected during the selection process.
Therefore, costly measures such as anchoring, injecting and protective net against stone falling, which required about 3,3 3,3 million.
Road and Highway Directorate had to bear costs not only for other emergency operations such as security measures in the Dölzschen rocks, but also measures that would not be necessary if the construction project was properly prepared first.
Expenditure of this kind includes costs associated with interruption of construction operations ((3,2 million), further training of drilling workers ((0,5 million) and increasing wages and goods costs due to overrun of the project duration (7 7 million).
The cost exceeding amounted to about zhruba 10,7 million, which was not equal to any added value.
Based on the lessons learned from this and other controlled projects, BRH asked the Federal Ministry to apply more strict leadership in its supervision of road construction work.
The Federal Ministry should give the directors of roads and highways the necessary incentive to introduce quality assurance systems.
Benefits of cooperation for BRH and NKÚ Cooperation fulfilled the intention of both control institutions.
BRH gained control knowledge about the preparation, assignment and progress of the border bridge construction.
Both top control institutions have built a database of bridges and tunnels prices, which will be able to base future checks.
NKÚ found that the main construction-technical parameters of bridges, tunnels and route of the D 8 highway are no different from parameters A 17.
Controllers of both cooperation institutions have gained new experience to use in further checks.

Coordinated control of funds for financing projects carried out under the Operational Programme of Cross-border Cooperation Czech Republic - Poland 2007-2013
INTRODUCTION
The emerging community of Europe's population is the driving force behind cross-border cooperation as an integral part of the wider territorial cooperation that has been part of our lives for the last 20 years.
So let this community provide the opening word for this joint report of the two highest control institutions of neighbouring countries:
′′ 185 million EU citizens (i.e. 37 % of the population) live in border areas.
These areas are usually underdeveloped and peripheral territories, often the remains of the darker parts of Europe's history.
The main aim of cross-border cooperation is to help to mitigate the existence of borders as administrative, legal and physical barriers and to further help develop the dormant potential of border regions.
Programmes cover various border regions: some cover seaside areas, other inland borders within the EU or borders shared with candidate countries.
Most programs are bilateral, but some include more than two neighboring countries."
The programmes last seven years and a total of 5,7 billion is earmarked from the EU budget. EUR
′′ The programmes cover the following activities: repairs and reconstruction of cross-border roads, cycling trails and bridges, investments in cross-border waste management systems, medical facilities, research centres, flood measures, etc., common management of natural sites or tourist goals, development of common services for the local population, employment advice, thematic networking and clusters for innovation.
Support from the program is provided on the condition that the organization from both sides of the border (for example regional authorities, universities or SMEs) combines to implement projects based on the needs of the border region.
Leaders of cooperating regions, relevant ministries and other local partners regularly meet and decide which projects will be supported.
This system should lead to a sustainable form of cooperation even after the program itself is finished.
Funds are provided with the condition that project partners from both sides of the border cooperate in a way that fulfils at least two of the following four characters: joint preparation, joint implementation, joint staff, joint financing."
Within the partnership, tasks and responsibilities for the preparation, implementation, financing and control of project activities are clearly defined and distributed to the relevant partners.
Among the main attributes of partnership include: Joint Leader's Choice, Joint Project Development and Application, Joint Partnership Agreement signed by all partners, taking over overall responsibility for the implementation of the project by the leading partner, total payment of support receives by the partner and executes their transfer to the relevant project partners.
Eligible projects carried out in the territory of regions and voivodeship adjacent to a common border may be supported.
OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE OF CHECK
On 11. December 2007, the European Commission (EC) approved the operation programme of cross-border cooperation Czech Republic - Poland 2007-2013 (OPPS Czech-POL).
258 187 467 €. has been earmarked for the implementation of the operational programme.
The total amount included a contribution from the European Funds (ERDF) totalling 459 219 344 (85 %) to be exhausted by the end of 2015.
Financial data on the drawing of EU funds from the Cross-border Cooperation Operational Programme Czech Republic - Poland 2007-2013 at the end of 2013 are given in the following table:
The agreement on cooperation of the highest control institutions of the Czech Republic (NKU) and the Republic of Poland (NIK) was concluded by the presidents of both offices on 27. February 2013 following previous negotiations at the meeting of the heads of the highest control institutions of the Visegrad four, Austria and Slovenia in September 2012 in Lovasberény, Hungary.
The aim of the cooperation was to check whether the implementation of the operational programme is in accordance with the legislation and with binding programming documents or agreements, whether the management and control system works reliably, whether the operational programme goals are achieved and whether the selected projects are implemented in accordance with the specified conditions of the aid granted I'm sorry.
This cooperation took a form of parallel control, whereby the inspection authorities independently examined topics whose content was discussed in advance by their legal mandate.
This segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The inspection carried out also included elements of the performance audit.
The selected topics were tested on a sample of projects with project partners on both sides of the border.
The results of the checks carried out were the checks foundations published in the usual way by both authorities.
Based on both control conclusions set out in the Annex, this Joint Report was created.
The selected common control sample included six projects (Annex 1) that fall within the aid area 1.1-Strengthening transport availability and support area 2.2-Supporting tourism development.
Before the start of the inspection, the drawing of funds from these two areas of support accounted for more than 60 % of the funds paid to beneficiaries by the end of 2012 from ERDF for all projects implemented throughout the OPPS Czech Republic-POL.
This segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In addition to checking a common sample of six projects, NKÚ checked 13 other projects and NIK two more (all from support area 1.1 and 2.2).
The funds paid to beneficiaries of ERDF aid, controlled by NKÚ and NIK, amounted to a total of 362 25 (NKÚ) and 174 8 (NIK).
The controlled amount of funds accounted for 41 % of all funds paid to the beneficiaries of the aid areas 1.1 and 2.2.
MAIN CONTROL CONCLUSIONS
Both checks independently carried out by NKÚ on the Czech side and NIK on the Polish side showed that the level of identified irregularities did not exceed the level of importance.
The implementation of OPPS Czech Republic-POL, involving the functioning of the management and control system and the implementation of selected projects, was successful.
Controlled persons, who were part of the management and control system, took steps to reduce the risk of misuse of funds and unused ERDF funds provided.
Proof of the effectiveness of the projects implemented under the operational programme is the high level of achievement of the set goals, which were supported by the results of the social evaluation of project implementation.
SUMMARY OF CHECK RESULTS
And. Assessment of the management and control system
A coordinated approach enabled the control and control system of the OPPS Czech Republic-POL implemented by the following institutions in both countries: managing authority (Ministry of Local Development of the Czech Republic), national coordinator (Ministry of Local Development POL) and controllers (Center for Regional Development and Voivodeship).
At the same time, the coordinated audit enabled the evaluation of tasks and functions carried out by the Joint Technical Secretariat and the Monitoring Committee.
During the evaluation of the management system, the inspection focused on the activities carried out in connection with the set-up and performance of the function of the managing authority and the national coordinator, especially in the context of setting the programme's goals and monitoring of progress, evaluation activities and annual reports, evaluation, selection and approval project applications, drawing up program funds and fulfilling the obligation to publish correct, complete and up-to-date information on subsidies, further with the control activities of the managing authority, setting up the performance of the activities and output from the audits of the delegated audit body, and with the reporting and monitoring system of irregularities and compliance with the irregularities monitoring, at the same time it has been verified coordination of tasks and cooperation between institutions involved in the OPPS Czech Republic-POL.
The activities of the competent authorities in the field of risk analysis and the compilation of project monitoring plans were further examined and evaluation of project applications carried out by independent evaluators was assessed.
Verification of the control system included a review of administrative checks and on-the-spot checks, which allowed approval, e.g. supply of goods and co-financed services, eligibility of expenses submitted for reimbursement, while consistency of the payment of such funds and related activities (or parts thereof) with national and EU legislation.
Significant shortcomings have been identified by NKÚ control in the area of publishing correct, complete and up-to-date information on subsidies provided.
In the area of evaluation and approval of projects, the risk of non-transparentness of the process was identified.
Other shortcomings were identified in the area of monitoring indicators settings and in the settings of irregularity reporting system.
Based on these findings, the Supreme Supervisory Authority evaluated the control and management system implemented by the managing authority as partially effective.
Irregularities identified by NIK regarding the functioning of the management and control system in Poland in relation to violations of applicable laws and rules were not considered significant.
These irregularities only affected individual projects and did not have a significant impact on the implementation of the whole OPPS Czech Republic-POL.
Despite identified irregularities, NIK evaluated the functioning of the system positively.
B. Assessment of project results
The check did not show a contradiction between indicators and targets set for individual projects and those defined by the operational programme.
Expected results were achieved in all projects, funded activities were implemented and the indicators (measurable parameters) set out in the project applications of the operational programme were met.
The check conclusions are in line with the result of the survey of the social evaluation of projects described below in the text.
An important aspect that NKÚ and NIK have given attention to in their conclusions is the limited possibility of objective evaluation of the project's performance with regard to project goals and at the same time to the aims of the entire operational programme.
The Supreme Supervisory Chamber initiative took place in the summer of 2013 at the place of implementation of projects selected for the common control sample.
The survey and evaluation was carried out by the School of Higher Vocational Training in Nyse (Poland).
After agreement with the Supreme Supervisory Authority, the investigation was carried out on both sides of the border between 2 820 respondents, both with the public in Poland in relation to part of the project implemented by Polish project partners and with the Czech public in relation to the part of the project implemented in Czech Republic.
The survey mainly covered the suitability, quality, exchange of information, use of funds and social function of projects including investments made.
The number of respondents for each project is shown in Annex 2.
The survey response assessment suggested that the overall social evaluation of projects was good and reached a 4,8 point (on a scale with a maximum of 8 points), which means that the project results were positively perceived by most respondents both in terms of goals and according to other parameters specified in project applications.
According to respondents, the projects examined met the criteria expressed in the operational programme.
Respondents also noticed the positive impact of investments on improving the quality of transport and tourist infrastructure, accessibility, tourist attractiveness, business conditions, quality of life of citizens and renewal of contacts between residents of the border region.
On the other hand, the overall evaluation of the answers suggested a certain difference between the actual level of achievement of the goals / parameters (actual impact rate) and the expected respondents.
This difference applies to evaluation of the results of individual projects, where in some cases there is a significant difference.
The results of the survey were in line with the views of participants in panel discussions (target groups) conducted in the context of the NIK control on the Polish side, who highlighted the need for project implementation and confirmed their positive acceptance by the public and the expected results.
C. Assessment of the legality of controlled projects
The beneficiaries of the aid examined the consistency of the factual and time implementation of the project schedule and the content of the project application, further examination of the achievement of the set goals and purpose of the project, fulfilment of binding monitoring indicators, management of changes in projects, management of possible project revenue, fulfilment of the obligation separated project accounting records transaction, compliance with the ban on financing projects from other EU sources, implementation of project partnerships and compliance with its conditions, fulfilment of compulsory publicity regarding in particular the spread of awareness of sources of financing projects from the EU, compliance with the conditions of eligibility of project expenditure, selection of suppliers and verification of suppliers delivered on the basis of public awarded orders.
The total financial value of the shortcomings of qualified NKÚ and NIK as unfit for funding from EU funds was found at 094 85
However, this amount did not exceed the specified level of importance related to the total controlled amount of funds for sample projects.
Despite the discrepancies identified, NKÚ and NIK evaluated the implementation of selected projects positively.
In most cases, the commitments resulting from the conditions of the aid were properly fulfilled by the beneficiary.
Funds intended for the implementation of controlled projects were spent in accordance with EU regulations and national law.
Nonetheless, seven of the eight beneficiaries of the aid controlled by NIK were found to be inconsistencies in the fulfilment of factual and financial commitments.
These were individual cases of non-systemic nature and were concerned especially inconsistent preparation of project documentation and violation of public procurement rules, but did not affect the selection of contractors or supply of contracted works.
Only in one of all projects controlled by NIK can the discrepancies detected as an unfit spending of PLN 43 003 of which was financed by z 8 ERDF).
On the other hand of the border, the NKÚ identified in three of the 19 controlled projects ineligible spending of CZK 2 098 (of which 863 76 financed by the ERDF).
Irregularities included non-delivery of paid material and works or expenses for modernizing property owned by a person who had no connection to the project or as a beneficiary of the aid or as a project partner.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Joint recommendation of the NKÚ and NIK concerns the improvement of the monitoring system especially with regard to the consistent determination of proper monitoring indicators for all specific objectives of the priority axis of the operational programme.
In general, it is also necessary to aim to identify such indicators at program level and projects to enable more reliable verification of the performance of the established impacts.
Notes and recommendations resulting from checks carried out on both sides of the border are included in separate check conclusions of NKÚ and NIK on CD.

Procurement of public works contracts and corruption prevention
Joint report on parallel control carried out by the Czech Supreme Supervisory Authority (NKÚ) and the German Federal Court of Auditors (BRH)
Introduction and overview
Procurement of public procurement for goods and services by contracting authorities is very important for both the state and private sphere.
The role of the state is to use public resources in the most efficient and economical way possible and ensure fair and regulated free competition.
In the European Union (EU) public procurement is a key factor for the success of the single economic space.
The EU has set limits in its regulations, where the contracting authority must meet certain requirements to guarantee a wide and unlimited competitive environment across the EU.
EU Member States therefore need to transpose the European procurement right into their national rules and put it into practice.
The Czech Republic and Germany have already done so.
For public procurement that is value below EU limits, regulation of their award remains within the scope of individual countries.
Moreover, public procurement is prone to corruption with subsequent high potential of damage.
Therefore, contracting entities are obliged to take reasonable measures in their procurement procedures to prevent corruption and incorrect advantage (corruption prevention).
In January 2011, the Supreme Supervisory Authority of the Czech Republic (Czech SAI - NKÚ) and the Federal Court of Auditors of Germany (German SAI - BRH) agreed to carry out parallel checks in the field of procurement procedures and prevention of corruption in land and transport buildings.
Cooperation was also focused on the area of European procurement law as it was transposed into national legislation.
The checks included procurement below European limits to affect corruption prevention.
The control findings of the two top control institutions are summarized in a joint report, which is addressed, among other things, to international organisations such as the International Organization of Highest Supervisory Institutions (INTOSAI).
Control areas and controlled institutions
The BRH assessment is based on the area checks of the above mentioned areas, which were carried out on German construction administrations responsible for federal transport and ground buildings between 2011 and 2012.
For example, highway construction and large-scale projects of ground construction were evaluated.
BRH included findings from past checks in the evaluation.
The NKÚ evaluation is based on checks carried out between 2008 and 2012, which focused on the construction of roads, railway lines, water projects, large buildings (hospitals, cultural facilities, universities) and some other buildings in the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the award of federal public procurement is mostly carried out by regional construction administrations.
In the Czech Republic, the state institution for road and rail construction is responsible for the award of public transport infrastructure contracts.
In the field of ground construction, public procurement is carried out by beneficiaries of budgetary resources.
In both countries, external experts services are also used in individual procurement stages.
The evaluation must take into account differences in legislation on public procurement and the specialities of the construction market in both countries.
The structure of the public procurement law in both countries
In Germany, the process of European procurement procedures is governed by laws and regulations.
The procurement procedure limited to Germany is governed by budgetary law and relevant administrative acts.
Internal administrative rules contain numerous additional provisions for both European and national procurement procedures.
Further details regarding the requirements of European procurement law and corruption prevention are enshrined in the so-called. federal government procurement manuals where requirements are divorced or formulated into greater detail with regard to legal precedents in the field of procurement law.
In the Czech Republic, public procurement is governed by the public procurement law and other legislation concerning contracts with value above and below European limits.
The procurement right made substantial changes in 2012
The new rules strengthened the transparency of procurement procedures, opened room for more competition and reduced corruption opportunities during the procurement procedure.
Fundamental aspects of procurement in both countries
As regards European procurement procedures, open and narrower procedures must be applied in both countries.
In Germany, contracts below the European limit are awarded in accordance with national rules (public call for competition, limited call for participation, negotiated procedure), but these are virtually identical to the abovementioned conditions for European procurement procedures.
Public procurement in Germany is characterized by the principle of preference for open proceedings (where interested in European scale are invited) and public calls for participation (only in the case of national proceedings).
In open proceedings and in the invitation to participate in the competition, any interested person can submit an offer.
Another significant sign of German procurement law is the support of small and medium-sized companies.
This is mainly achieved by dividing the total public contract into commercially specific parts and by dividing into partial contracts.
Procurement of contracts divided into these parts gives the opportunity to participate in the proceedings as many candidates as possible.
The two characteristics of German procurement law are time-proven tools to gain good value for money.
More than 330 construction companies with 1,9 million employees are registered in Germany.
In the Czech Republic it is necessary to apply the conditions of European proceedings even in cases of public procurement with value below the EU limit.
The exception is a simplified sublimit procedure, where the contracting authority can use less demanding procedures.
In accordance with European law, Czech procurement law includes conditions under which the contract must be awarded in order to ensure competition and achieve a bargain price.
Current Czech legislation allows contracting entities to choose between open procedure and narrower procedures.
85 construction companies registered in the Czech Republic, of which about 1 have 20 employees.
Total volume of contracting entities for public works and the share of different types of proceedings in both countries
In 2011 the total volume of construction works in Germany amounted to 7 675 billion.
Kč, of which 1 138 billion. Kč (15 %) was the share of public procurement, which included contracts awarded by individual spolkovými and municipalities in addition to contracts awarded by the Federal Government.
The total volume of projects of the Federal Road and Land Construction (without railway and water buildings) reached 212,5 billion...
In 2011, the composition of the Federal Procurement of Land Construction and Transport Construction was as follows: 80,7 % open proceedings and public calls; 12,7 % closer proceedings and narrower calls;
6,6 % negotiated procedure and direct procurement; 33,2 % is the share of European procurement procedures.
The volume of public construction contracts in the Czech Republic reached 118,6 billion in 2011 Kč, which was about 25 % of the total volume of all construction works.
In 2009 it reached 194,0 billion. Kč, which was 37 % of the total volume.
Structure of procurement types in 2011: 65,1 % open procedures; 14,3 % narrower procedures; 9,5 % negotiated procedures; 8,4 % simplified procedures for sublimit contracts; 2,7 % other procedures.
The data included all public supply contracts, services and works contracts awarded by contracting authorities in 2011.
The mentioned figures show that: parallel checks in both countries focused on a substantial part of public procurement procedures; prevention of corruption to be held still has a significant financial impact; open meaning. procurement procedures are crucial.
Summary of main results
NKÚ and BRH performed parallel checks on the award of European works contracts with an emphasis on corruption prevention in their countries.
The checks were aimed at comparing legislation in both countries and the EU and the implementation of public procurement in the field of land and transport buildings.
Key findings below are:
EU public procurement directive has been transposed into national rights of both countries (points 1. and 3.1).
The prevention of corruption is not only the aim of the EU directive, but the national procurement rules of both countries, which differ in part in the focus and in the details.
In both countries, the essential requirement for the contract documentation to meet is the inclusion of all information needed for the preparation of tenders.
Specifications must be neutral and must contain no requirements limiting competition.
The specification documentation in Germany meets these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, the problem is insufficient definition of the subject matter of the contract.
In Germany, division of contracts is required into parts where possible to support a competitive environment.
According to the findings of BRH, this requirement is observed in Germany.
NKÚ checks showed that in the Czech Republic large public works in the area of road buildings are awarded without being divided into parts or divided, but only on volume very significant parts. This method can distort competition and lead to restrictions on only a few large companies.
These restrictions on market potential can result in significant cost increases and incur a risk of non-serious price negotiation and inadmissible conventions.
Legislation in both countries allows contracting entities to supplement additional construction work under certain conditions if this need arises only after the contract is concluded (paragraph 4.1).
In both countries the requirements for proper designation of the type of procurement procedure are met.
In the Czech Republic, contracting entities can identify one of the open procurement procedures, open proceedings or closer procedures according to the applicable rules.
German rules in procurement and budgetary law enshrine the priority of open procedures for both European tenders and national, known as public calls for competition.
Open procurement procedures in both countries allow a larger range of candidates to submit an offer and also reduce the risk of corruption, because they make unlawful price negotiation among candidates difficult.
At the same time, the best results in value for money are achieved.
In the case of large procurement, whose expected total price exceeds or exceeds the limits laid down by the EU, controlled contracting entities have always written a European procurement procedure.
In determining the type of procurement procedure, correct determination of the expected value of the contract plays a very important role.
In Germany, databases are used to determine the price of public works, where the values are based on completed construction projects.
This is an objective enough tool.
In the Czech Republic, databases are used only in the area of road construction, but are not yet an effective tool (paragraph 4.2).
Preliminary information and notice of the opening of the procurement procedure must be published in accordance with European procurement procedures, due to strengthening competition by allowing candidates to prepare in time for submission of tenders.
As a rule, the construction authorities audited with this requirement.
In isolated cases, errors in the information released, incorrect application of provisions and / or a lack of controls may have impaired competition (item 4.3).
There is a greater risk of manipulation when selecting candidates to participate in a closer procurement procedure.
According to EU law, the number of candidates invited must be high enough to guarantee real competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, non-discriminatory and be published in advance.
Beyond the EU requirements, contracting entities in both countries should rotate as often as possible, who call for participation in the proceedings when selecting suppliers.
In Germany there are partly very detailed requirements for preventing the risks of manipulation.
In some cases, controlled contracting authorities did not follow these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, selection decisions were not always credible (paragraph 4.4).
In both countries, contracting entities must ensure that all candidates wishing to submit a tender receive the same information.
Any agreements between these candidates and between them and third parties involved in the preparation of specifications must be prevented to the extent possible from limiting competition through illegal agreements.
In Germany, the relevant measures are more thorough than in the Czech Republic.
However, the controlled German contracting authorities did not meet the said requirement in several cases (paragraph 4.5).
The principle of cross control and transparency must be applied in both countries when opening envelopes.
Labelling requirements, documentation, protection and confidentiality of offers are supposed to restrict the space for manipulation and are especially detailed in Germany.
Checks in both countries found only a few cases of irregularities (point 4.6).
Assessment and evaluation of tenders is procedurally regulated in both countries.
The relevant German measures are more complex, but have not always been respected by controlled contracting entities.
For example, contracting entities handed over their bids to third parties for consultation without properly documenting any suspicious circumstances.
The tenders were thus insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulations (paragraph 4.7).
Participants must be informed about the intended award of the contract before the latter is finalised due to legal protection of enterprises are to be informed about the intended contract award.
This legal protection rule also is designed to prevent corruption action.
The law of the Czech Republic provides for judicial review of contract award procedures also for national tenders.
Only in few cases, the notification of the enterprises was not appropriately ensured (item 4.8).
Procurement documentation was not always complete or completely credible for controlled contracting entities in both countries.
In case of several procurement procedures, the transparency requirements applied at European level were not always adequately observed in the proceedings.
In addition, some found deficiencies decreased the preventive anti-corruption function of documentation.
Contracting entities in both countries mostly fulfilled their notification duties (point 4.9).
Summary of the main principles of European procurement law and corruption prevention
European procurement law
The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have adopted, inter alia, a directive on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, supply and services in order to ensure the free movement of goods and services and a directive on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to review procedures on the award of public supply contracts and public works contracts (review directive), with these two directives being transposed into national law.
The EU general procurement principles include in particular: a requirement for a competitive environment; a requirement for equal treatment or a discrimination; a requirement for transparency.
EU procurement principles include the directive on the coordination of procedures for public procurement includes provisions on construction projects whose total expected value is or exceeds 5 miles. €.
These clauses affect: Content documentation content; type of procurement used; publication of certain information before, during and after the end of the procedure; compliance with the deadline for acceptance of tenders; qualifying requirements that may be required of tenderers; criteria for the selection of the most suitable offer.
The legal protection of applicants follows the review proceedings directive.
In the event of a potential breach of the procurement law, tenderers may have the contracting authority reviewed according to review procedures.
Both countries transposed EU requirements into national legislation.
Prevention of corruption
The importance of prevention of corruption
There is no legal definition in any of both countries what corruption actually means.
In general, corruption is seen as an abuse of a personal (confidential) position in its own favor.
Usually this means that such abuse is incited by persons who gain benefit.
Corruption can be an obstacle to competition and can cause serious economic losses.
According to estimates, the total corruption related damage accounts for 5 % of the world's economic performance.
For the EU area, these costs are estimated at 1 % of the EU's economic performance.
If a contracting authority is involved in the contract, conventions limiting competition or allowing dishonest conduct can weaken confidence in integrity, ability and overall work of public administration.
Therefore, prevention of corruption is an essential task of contracting entities.
Practice and procedures must be controlled especially in areas particularly prone to corruption in order to allow adequate measures to prevent it.
Taking preventive measures and carrying out effective checks can significantly reduce the susceptibility of the decision-making process to corruption.
Procurement of works contracts is usually considered to be particularly prone to corruption.
Corruption prevention measures
In Germany, corruption is prosecutable under criminal and labour law, which concerns active and passive bribery, accepting and offering significant benefits.
The German Federal Government has issued a manual with recommendations on the prevention of corruption in the federal administration and according to which the following principles are applied throughout the procurement process outside the risk analysis: priority of open procurement; principle of multiple control and transparent decision making; division of planning, procurement and accounting phase; accurate and complete documentation of the procurement procedure.
Moreover, other measures with preventive influence against corruption became part of the procurement law.
In 2011, the relevant Federal Ministry of Information Technology established a system for monitoring contract for construction of federal roads.
Using this system, data such as estimated costs, total value of the contract and the involvement of private projections offices can be fully recorded and analyzed to detect possible irregularities.
In the Czech Republic, corruption is prosecuted under criminal law, the level of employment or civil law is also considered.
Legal requirement for transparency, equal treatment and no discrimination throughout the procurement process (preparation and implementation) is the most important part of corruption prevention.
Anti-corruption measures in this area were established by the government in the ′′ Government's strategy to fight corruption for the period 2011 to 2012 ′′ updated for 2013 and 2014.
Part of the said measures were incorporated into the public procurement law and follow-up implementing regulations.
New legislation contains the following basic provisions: lowering limits for small-scale contracts; obligation to prior notice by the contracting authority including justification of the contract; prohibition to limit the number of tenderers in a narrower procedure and cancellation of the general possibility to limit the number of tenderers by drawing; obligation to publish contracts including attachments; obligation to publish actual and lists of subcontractors I'm sorry.
Results of checks related to subsequent stages of the procurement procedure
Procurement documentation
The procurement documentation must contain all the information needed to allow applicants to prepare their tenders in an appropriate form.
In particular, the documentation must allow the offer price to be processed.
In order to do this, applicants must not be exposed to risks they could not expect.
The specification of the contract documentation contains mainly specifications, and the requirements to demonstrate candidate s' qualifications and the criteria for choosing the best bid.
Demands of European law and prevention of corruption
European law contains in particular requirements regarding technical specifications.
Specifications must limit competition to the least possible extent and all interested parties must have equal access to it.
Specifications must be neutral.
Requirements for specific products are allowed on a very limited scale in the procurement documentation.
The basic principle of prevention of corruption is that the procurement documentation does not contain requirements that could restrict competition.
Documentation should further avoid ambiguity or inaccurate data that create room for speculation and manipulation during the evaluation of offers.
German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
Both countries transposed EU legal provisions into their national legislation.
The basic principle is that the specifications be given in general without reference to a particular product or brand.
Specifications must define the required supplies and services accurately and indicate in detail the number of units of work and supply.
In normal cases prices should be reported according to units of work or supply (e.g. in CZK / m or CZK / item).
Defining the required work in terms of their functionality is only acceptable in exceptional cases.
Basically, the rule is that the specifications need to be prepared completely and unequivocally.
They must contain accurate amounts and must not include work and deliveries, the necessity of which is not quite obvious.
Payment in the form of flat-rate amounts or according to the time worked must be avoided wherever possible.
These parts of the procurement documentation must exclude speculation and manipulation based on ambiguous specifications.
Specifications must allow each candidate to prepare their offer with certainty and without excessive preparatory work.
The invitation to tender must be published only when the procurement documentation is complete.
Different clauses
In the Czech Republic, there is no obligation for contractors to award construction contracts in parts.
The contracting authority may divide the contract into several separate parts, provided that the nature of the subject matter of such a contract.
In Germany, the application of the rule to divide works into parts, either quantitatively (partial supply) or according to special aspects (specialized parts of the contract).
This allows small and medium-sized entities to participate in the competition, increases the number of potential applicants and makes price fixation difficult.
This type of assignment is usually considered the most appropriate in terms of providing value for money.
In the Czech Republic, the procurement documents must contain evaluation criteria for national and European procurement procedures.
This should inform the candidate in a comprehensive and exhaustive manner of the criteria according to which his offer will be evaluated.
In Germany, the requirement for evaluation criteria in the notification applies only to European calls for tender.
In national procurement procedures it is necessary to include evaluation criteria only in the contract record, which is an internal administrative document.
If the contract documentation is prepared by authorized independent experts, German regulations require any information from it to help identify specific interested companies, architects or designers.
The reason is to prevent individual construction companies from acquiring any additional information or other inadmissible competitive advantages without the knowledge of the contracting authority.
This is also why independent experts are not allowed to publish documents regarding tenders and allow their accessibility for verification.
The contracting authority is the only focal point for construction companies.
The Czech Republic currently does not have a similar provision.
In the case of large construction projects, after the original contract is concluded, there will almost always be a need for more work or modification of existing works.
Legislative of both countries allows a multi-work contract to a certain limit to the same supplier without publishing and implementing a new procurement procedure.
The volume of multiple work under European and German legislation must not exceed 50 % of the original value of the contract.
In addition, more work must be necessary and must have the nature of a special component of the main contract.
In the Czech Republic, a stricter limit of 20 % is applied to the assignment of multiple work.
This can bring the risk of more time delay in the execution of the contract and possible integration of a new entity into an already running project.
If a multi-work contract is awarded to the supplier of the original contract, German law contains a provision that prevents suppliers from arbitrary increase in the price of modified works or multiple works.
Calculations must be made taking into account prices negotiated in the original contract.
In addition to multiple works, less work can occur during construction, i.e. jobs that were not needed.
Less work and more work cannot be compensated in the Czech Republic.
Main inspection findings
BHR
Technical specifications and product neutral invitation to bid
In rare cases, the specifications were referring to national technical requirements or standards, but were replaced by EU standards in the meantime.
In some cases the specifications included data demanding a certain brand, e.g. for the system of resilience of public inscriptions, to prevent water breach or for noise tiling, although it was not necessary.
In some cases the specifications were so detailed that only one product met the requirements.
Quantitative specifications divided into items
BRH has not observed a disagreement with the general requirements for the invitation to tender for supply and services according to the quantitative specifications divided into items.
Complete of the specifications
In most cases controlled, tendering documents were prepared without the rest before the invitation to tender was announced.
However, in various cases, documents during the procurement procedure had to be modified when changes in items or timetable had to be taken into account.
In rare cases, the contract documents contained work and deliveries needed insecure.
One procurement documentation for demolition work contained almost exclusively such items.
Dividing the contract and award criteria
In many cases, the desired justification for not to divide the supply into parts has not been demonstrated.
The criteria for evaluating tenders before the contract award, BRH found no shortcomings.
Inclusion of names of authorized independent experts
In many documents, interested authorized experts were presented.
Names were listed on the opening pages of documents or on plans or attached opinions.
In one case, the contracting authority even urged tenderers to contact an explicitly named architect with their procurement questions.
These cases were found mainly in procurement documentation, where self-employed experts were entrusted with the processing of the specifications.
Contracting authorities stated that they did not have sufficient staff capacity to check the procurement documents in detail.
NKÚ
Technical specifications and product neutral invitation to bid
In the case of a public contract to build a house with 12 apartments, there was a link directly to specific manufacturers and brands of products.
The contracting authority has not allowed the use of other similar product types or justified why it calls for the delivery of specific products.
For the construction of the university facility, the procurement documentation contained links to specific business companies and specific product designations.
Overview of the specifications and sub-specifications
For the construction of certain industrial zones, the contracting authority did not clearly define the quantity and type of required works, supplies or services in the statement and established only the built-in space in cubic meters for each building as a unit.
Complete of the specifications
During the procurement procedure for the construction of the road circuit, the procurement documentation for closer proceedings was changed four times from August to September 2009
The reason was the changes in project documentation caused by extension of the scope of the contract and by changing technical conditions.
For the construction of social objects, the procurement documentation had defects, which forced the creation of multiple work (precise focus was missing, sufficient construction research was not done, drawings were missing).
The contract documentation for the construction of a large library stated interior elements only descriptively, without specification of quality product requirements.
Delivery of the interior of the building was provided by subcontractors, who bought some superior and very expensive equipment.
Parts and criteria for awarding the contract
In the Czech Republic there is no obligation to award a contract in parts.
Analysis of three large road buildings during the construction of the road circuit showed that savings of up to 790 miles were possible when they were awarded in open proceedings (separately after selected objects). Kč from the price of public procurement achieved 15 508 miles...
For example, six building objects as a separate part of the public contract could have been a savings of 62,5 miles.
Kč, i.e. 25 % of the contrasted price and 20 bridges as a separate part of the public contract could have been a savings of 287,8 miles. Kč, i.e. also 25 %.
The contracting authority established qualification criteria during the construction of road roads in the procurement documentation, which restricted the participation of small suppliers in the procurement procedure.
In the contract conditions of open procedure for the contractor at one highway construction construction, the contracting authority requested, inter alia. contractor's practice consisting of the implementation of at least three road buildings with a financial volume of more than 700 miles each. Kč, completed or working in the last five years.
There are only nine companies in the Czech Republic that meet the condition of completion of buildings over 700 miles. Kč in the last five years.
The public contract for the supply of another highway construction in an open procedure included six separate buildings, for which the contracting authority requested a minimum annual volume of construction works in the last three years of 12 billion.
Two thirds of financial volume of road construction works (i.e. i.e. 2.5 billion out of of 3.7 billion) in the period of 2008-2009 were realized by 5 suppliers or individually either in form of consortium.
For 46 orders for a total of 13,2 billion. Kč there were only two or even one candidate.
NKÚ pointed out that reducing market potential can lead to a huge increase in costs.
Multiple work area
In two cases, the contracting authority did not enter into a written contract for the delivery of multiple works of construction and did not enter into any of the procedures laid down in the law during the construction of the road circuit.
The value of pre-approved multiple work in one case was 1 591,4 miles. Kč without VAT (increase by 21 %) and in the second case 4 135,8 miles. Kč without VAT (increase of 91 %).
The cause of multiple work was primarily ambiguous definition of the quantity and type of work required.
For the construction of a university facility, the contracting authority did not include some work and supplies in the procurement documentation, which it already knew about the necessity for completion and housewarming of the construction.
For these works and supplies, he made additions to the work contract with the construction contractor with the price increase, in the negotiated procedure without publication, although the volume of multiple works exceeded the national limit of 20 % of the original contract value.
In connection with the construction of the court palace, the contracting authority reserves the right to enter additional works without procurement.
During construction, the contracting authority increased the scope of the contract by 50,5 miles...
Unit prices of additional work established without competition were significantly higher than comparable works performed by the same supplier.
Other findings
NKÚ on a selected sample of buildings found that the average construction cost of building one kilometer of a four-current highway in the Czech Republic is 355,0 miles...
According to long-term data obtained from the German Ministry of Construction, the average cost in Germany per kilometer section of the four-current highway is 260,0 miles...
This comparison suggests that buying a highway in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.
Summary
The legal provisions regarding the procurement documentation are almost identical in both countries and are in accordance with the requirements of European law.
The goal is to ensure complete and straight competition and prevention of corruption.
Specifications must be accurate enough to allow candidates to calculate costs and prepare their offers.
Moreover, this requirement restricts space for speculation and the contracting authority is protected against the need to assign more work.
In Germany, the basic legal provisions on procurement documentation are complemented by other rules to reduce the possibilities for limiting competition and for manipulation.
Although there are no detailed requirements of this type in the Czech Republic, there is greater transparency achieved by publishing the award criteria.
In both countries, the specification requirements are mostly met.
However, in some cases, weaknesses have been identified that could lead to a reduction in competition.
The current rule in Germany demanding the division of large construction projects into parts seems suitable for strengthening the competitive environment and achieving cost-effective results.
NKÚ found that in the Czech Republic, the award of contracts for large-scale projects without awarding parts or dividing into a large part of the volume of interested parties can limit a small number of large suppliers to small number of large suppliers.
The result of the strict requirement for references of applicants, which is applied in the Czech Republic for the selection of road works applicants, is that public contracts are awarded only to a small circle of tenderers, so small and medium-sized companies do not have a chance to compete.
A limited number of applicants also increases the risk of price fixation and other illegal conventions.
Regulatory approaches are different in both countries with regard to the award of additional contracts for multi-work or modified work.
If the value of additional works under European and German law does not exceed 50 % of the value of the original contract, the multi-work may be awarded without a procurement procedure and its notice.
The stricter limit of 20 % applies in the Czech Republic.
This segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
This limit is often exceeded by the contracting authority.
This segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
If the 20 % limit is exceeded, multiple work must be awarded on the basis of a new procurement procedure.
By dividing the work into part, it is possible to avoid limiting competition and subsequent unfortunate consequences.
Determination of the type of procurement procedure with regard to EU limits
By determining the type of procurement procedure, the contracting authority defines a circle of potential suppliers who will be allowed into the competition.
The contracting authority may leave the scope of potential suppliers unlimited, or it may limit the scope according to the specified criteria.
In case of large project works whose value exceeds or exceeds the limits established by the EU, a European procurement procedure must be conducted.
Demands of European law and prevention of corruption
When choosing a type of procedure, the contracting authority must meet, in particular, the requirements of European law regarding competitive environment and transparency.
If the estimate of the total cost of the contract for the required works exceeds or exceeds the current EU limit of 5,0 miles. € (125 miles. Kč), open or limited procurement procedure at European level is always required.
In exceptional cases, negotiated procedure or competition dialogue is allowed.
If the construction project reaches the EU limit, the contracting authority may, to a limited extent, deviate from the European procurement procedure by issuing national proceedings if the total value of the relevant part is below 1,0 miles. € (25 miles. Kč) and the total value of all parts does not exceed 20 % of the value of the whole contract.
Dividing a construction project or intentionally estimating its costs too low with the intention of avoiding the fundamental obligation to write a European procurement procedure is not acceptable.
Choosing a type of management is very important for the prevention of corruption, because limiting competition significantly increases the risk of manipulation.
Therefore, an important part of the procurement documentation is a detailed justification of the chosen type of procedure, especially in relation to the application of the European procurement law.
German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
Both countries implemented EU legal requirements for procurement procedures and limits to their national legislation.
Different clauses
The Czech Republic has introduced the principle of equal validity of open and narrower procedures and national procurement procedures.
Open and narrower proceedings can always be chosen, while other types of proceedings are allowed only when the conditions laid down are met.
Unlike the Czech amendment, the relevant German regime of budgetary law and the principle of corruption prevention prefers open proceedings or a public call for participation in proceedings.
Other types of proceedings including limited management are only exceptionally permitted if legislation permits.
Such exceptions must be justified and documented.
The principle of preference for open proceedings is intended to guarantee that competition restrictions are prevented to the maximum extent and that the opportunity for manipulation (pre-selected specific candidates) is limited.
In Germany, this principle of procurement is the central point of prevention of corruption.
Proper estimate of the expected price of the contract is an important basis for a decision on the corresponding type of procurement procedure.
When estimating the costs of ground construction projects, contracting entities in Germany can rely on budgetary and cost databases of public administrations and other organizations.
These were built on the basis of analysis of completed construction projects and include, among other things, standard cost values for types of buildings, construction units, parts and partial works.
Based on such standard cost values, it is possible to estimate the value of the planned project or construction works contract.
Only a few construction administrations in Germany already have a similar database for road construction.
However, the database is expected to be expanded at national level.
Contracting entities in the Czech Republic do not use any central database or average prices of comparable objects to determine the expected costs of public land construction contracts.
In many cases, cost determinations are based on estimation of the project-financing entity or based on the value of the resources available to this entity.
Standardization measures are in the early stages.
Based on the anti-corruption program for the period 2011 to 2012, the relevant Ministries are supposed to develop a database of the usual prices of standardized commodities.
The use of the price system for determining the expected price of the contract is determined by a new regulation ordering the subject line to the contract in detail.
The price system should serve as a set of information on construction and installation works, materials and products and other data to calculate the necessary costs and to determine unit prices.
The Ministry of Transport has issued regulatory prices for traffic buildings to check them, which are regularly updated.
The database is designed to determine the price of the project (investment) plan and should play comparative function in the next stages of construction work preparation.

Controlled contracting entities generally awarded contracts in an open procedure or in the form of a public call for participation, thus complying with the requirements of budgetary and procurement legislation.
In 2011, the share of tenders in the total volume of federal construction projects in the field of ground construction was 59,5 %.
This share was 94,8 % in road construction.
BRH found that in some cases the use of non-public competition was not sufficiently justified.
In the case of an area inspection, BRH found, based on information collected from more than 16 000 proceedings, that limited management has a clear disadvantage compared to public management and public challenge and limited management also increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.
This segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
According to the BRH study, tenders in limited proceedings and negotiated procedures were between 6 % and 10 % higher than in public procedures.
Parallel studies by the Ministry of Construction and the Land Control Court confirmed differences in value for money received in public and limited proceedings.
A study by the Ministry of Construction even found that prices in limited proceedings were twice the prices in public proceedings.
Compliance with EU limits
For projects whose total value of the contract was estimated to be more than 5 miles. € (125 miles. Kč), controlled contracting entities usually prepared procurement plans stating which works will be awarded in the European procurement procedure and which in the national procedure.
According to the procurement plans, the share of work awarded under European rules exceeded 80 % of the total work.
No case of circumvention of the European management requirement in the form of an overrun low cost estimate has been observed.
However, in some cases, the minimum percentage for pan-European management was not achieved due to a calculation error.
During the course of the work some contracting entities have illegally changed the contract award plan.
These changes did not justify and demonstrate that the minimum share of European management was subsequently observed.
The share of European management according to project accounts was generally lower than the share set out in the procurement plan.
If the expected value of construction projects contracts exceeded the European limits, contracting entities did not apply European proceedings to all individual parts worth more than 1 miles. € (25 miles..).
Instead, they awarded the relevant contracts on the basis of national proceedings without giving compelling reasons for the need for a derogation from the requirement.
NKÚ
Selection of the type of procurement procedure
For several large construction projects (e.g. construction of a road section, facilities for a large sporting event and housing construction) the contracting authority divided one project into several parts, although these partial contracts were of the same or similar character.
The division decreased the expected value of the contract and the contract was awarded under a less demanding regime or even outside the law regime.
Methods for calculating the expected price
Price standards applicable to road construction projects have not yet been an effective tool for determining the expected price.
They were based on the prices shown in final proceedings, but were burdened by non-economic and excessive suppliers.
NKÚ found that the actual prices for three parts of the road circuit were about 37 % lower than these price normatives.
The Ministry of Transport is supposed to update normatives in relation not only to past prices, but also compared to other comparable markets and price developments.
For ground buildings, the expected price was based on the project budget performed by architects or an investor estimation.
The actual price was then significantly different from the expected price.
The expected price of the construction of a large library was twice higher compared to the contract price, but increased by 54 miles during the implementation. Kč, i.e. by 27 %.
Similarly, for the construction of the depositary of this library, the contract price was 33 % lower than the expected price.
In other cases, the price of the successful applicant was higher than the expected price and increased even during the implementation.
The construction of a large library was 400 miles. Kč, i.e. by 22 %. For the construction of the judicial palace, the actual price increased disproportionately (by 139 %) compared to the increase in functional areas (only 12 %).
Summary
Both countries implemented European rules on the choice of procurement type and respecting European limits to their national legislation, so the relevant national adjustments of both countries are almost identical.
The principle of public proceedings in Germany is, however, stricter than the European regulation and the current national regulation in the Czech Republic.
Compared to the narrower procurement procedure, the public procedure or the public call for participation of more competitors to participate in the procurement procedure.
These types of procurement procedures generate a large number of tenders that guarantee the best value effect for money.
The prevention of corruption is significantly strengthened, as the circle of candidates is not limited by decisions taken by the contracting authority, which gives room for manipulation and price fixation among tenderers.
The study confirmed the benefits of the German provision on the preference of open proceedings or public calls for participation.
Czech legislation allows contracting entities to award contracts in open or narrower proceedings.
However, the latest regulation of the public procurement law imposes a ban for contracting authorities to restrict the number of tenderers in narrower proceedings.
The narrower procedure has now become very close to the open procedure.
In Germany, the contracting authority is largely fulfilled the requirement of a preference for open proceedings or a public invitation to participate in the competition, while in the Czech Republic some projects were divided against the law, in order to circumvent the requirement to select the type of procurement procedure.
However, in the case of some projects implemented in Germany, the European limits were not respected, which resulted in a minimum share in pan-European proceedings.
A satisfactory system has not yet been introduced in the Czech Republic to facilitate the correct calculation of expected costs of construction works and projects.
In cases where on site, contracting entities should ensure through more extensive checks that the requirements for the selection of the type of procurement procedure and the volume of the contracts awarded in European procedures are met or should create the conditions necessary to allow proper calculation of the expected costs I'm sorry.
Preliminary information and notice of initiation
In cases where contracts are awarded under the European procedure, the contracting authority must publish a procurement report.
Preliminary information and procurement notice are an important base for European competition.
Demands of European law and prevention of corruption
Through preliminary notifications, the contracting authority must state the basic specifications of the projects envisaged.
Preliminary notifications are required for projects for which the total cost estimation is equal to or greater than the European limit and when the contracting authority wishes to shorten the deadline for submitting tenders in individual procurement procedures.
The contracting authority is required to publish a procurement notice with detailed information on all public procurement required by the European procedure.
The information is binding upon the contracting authority after publication.
Among other things, the notice shall contain specifications, time limits for proceedings and for completion of the contract, specific requirements and selection criteria and their weights.
A common vocabulary for public procurement must be used to describe the subject of the contract.
Preliminary information and contract notice are published in the EU in the Official Journal of the EU and on the contracting authority profile.
Due to prevent discrimination against foreign candidates, no national notices should contain any additional information and should not be published before the text of the EU Publications Office is sent.
Incomplete or inaccurate information in preliminary notice may violate competition or even facilitate manipulation.
German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
Both countries fully implemented EU provisions on preliminary information and procurement notices in their national legislation.
Different clauses
In the Czech Republic preliminary information and notice must be published even in the case of contracts for which a European procedure is not required.
The procurement procedure shall not be opened before one month after the preliminary notice has been sent.
Preliminary disclosure may only be waived in exceptional cases.
In Germany preliminary information is not required in cases where European proceedings are not required.
In the case of national proceedings, the public call must be published on the Federal Government's website and, when appropriate, in print.
In case of limited proceedings without competition from participants, the notice must be published if the estimated contract price is equal to or greater than 000 25 (625 thousand..).
Preliminary notifications must explain all planned parts of the project.
This is an important requirement given the amount of small contracts in Germany.
The division of projects into smaller parts is not so common in the Czech Republic and this measure is considered less important.
Main inspection findings
BRH
Preliminary notice
Contracting entities published a preliminary notice of projects, which included work to be awarded in the European procedure.
In some open proceedings they shortened the deadline, although the number of days between sending a preliminary notice and sending a contract notice was less than 52 days.
In the case of other abbreviated proceedings, the annual deadline for preliminary information expired and should be renewed.
In many cases, the preliminary notice did not indicate the projected division of construction works into multiple parts.
Procurement notice
Some of the notifications included codes from the common vocabulary that deviated from the contents of the preliminary notice or precisely specify the work to be carried out.
In rare cases, national notifications included more information, e.g. regarding the dates of fulfillment, or were published before the notice in the Official Journal of the EU.
Ex-ante transparency
One contracting authority hired an external company to publish a national notice.
This published a notice on its platform whose use has been charged.
However, the contracting authority did not check whether the company had to comply with the requirement to send a notification to a free internet government portal.
The sample found that only a third of the notifications were actually published on the government portal.
NKÚ
Procurement notice
During the construction of a waste water treatment plant, the contracting authority did not determine the criteria for reducing the large number of tenders for evaluation procedures in the notice of the construction contractor.
The method of selection (reduction) of tenders for evaluation was not able to prove the contracting authority.
The reduction of the number of offers was made possible by previous legislation.
During the construction of a road circuit, the contracting authority did not define in the notice of initiation of a narrower procedure or in the qualifying documentation of the value according to which it will assess the level of compliance with the qualifying criteria and the number of applicants who will be invited.
The contracting authority evaluated the completion of the qualification by fulfilling it all six candidates in the context of the narrower procedure, but excluded one of them from fulfilling it only in the last sixth place.
The contracting authority's procedure was not transparent because it did not publish information in advance on what will be evaluated from the qualification data and how.
Publishing calls
The contracting authority did not publish a written invitation to submit tenders in the case of construction adjustments in former military újezdech.
Conclusions and recommendations / summary
The two-stage information process with preliminary information and publication of the notice of initiation is an important tool for meeting the requirements for transparency and strengthening the competitive environment applied in European proceedings.
By extending the obligation to publish preliminary information in the Czech Republic also for national procurement procedures and by strengthening this obligation in Germany in cases of limited procedures, both countries increased the transparency of procurement procedures and improved the competitive environment.
Selection of candidates in limited procurement procedures
Compared to the open procedure, limited procurement procedures do not allow participation to all potential interested applicants.
In limited procedures, the contracting authority will first select potential suppliers who will be asked to submit a tender.
Demands of European law and prevention of corruption
EU provisions allow to limit the number of applicants in European limited procedures.
However, limited proceedings require at least five tenderers to be invited to submit an offer and in case of a negotiated procedure with publication, at least three potential tenderers must be invited.
In any case, the number of challenged applicants must be wide enough to guarantee real competition.
Selection criteria must be objective and non-discriminatory and must be published in advance.
Selecting potential applicants to be challenged is very susceptible to manipulation, e.g. the preference of some of them.
Reducing competition to several applicants can make their secret agreement easier.
This has a negative impact on the outcome of the driving.
Therefore, the contracting authority needs to take measures to prevent manipulation and make sure it has effective control to ensure that the procedure is transparent and credible.
German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
The provisions for selection of applicants are similar in both countries.
In addition to the requirements of the European directive, contracting entities should change tenderers inviting to submit their tender.
It is also not acceptable to restrict competition from a regional point of view.
Contracting entities must document and justify candidate selection and selection process.
Different clauses
In Germany, it is required to invite at least three applicants in case of limited proceedings and several suitable applicants in the case of a negotiated procedure.
Except for two cases, new Czech regulations do not allow the number of applicants to be reached in case of narrower and negotiated proceedings.
In Germany it is necessary to respect the ′′ principle of four eyes ′′ when selecting applicants.
While one worker proposes their list, another has to substantially modify the proposal, e.g. by crossing out the proposed candidate or adding another candidate.
This is supposed to prevent a situation where an individual can definitively define a circle of applicants to participate in the proceedings.
If such a provision is not introduced, a far-reaching illegal agreement between participants is allowed.
The list of tenderers who will be invited to submit a tender must be confidential and must not be disclosed.
This also gives a commitment to authorized independent experts.
There is no similar measure in the Czech Republic, nor a measure for confidential treatment of the list of applicants.
Under German clauses, they must not define candidates for an external company, but they can make suggestions to the contracting authority.
There is no similar requirement in the Czech Republic.
Main inspection findings
BRH
Number of candidates
In addition to several cases, the requirement to address the minimum number of applicants was met.
An analysis of nearly 7 000 national-limit construction assignments showed that in the case of limited proceedings, contracting entities invited an average of 6,6 potential tenderers and in the case of direct negotiation proceedings, an average of 4,4 tenderers.
Change of suppliers and regional restrictions
Contracting entities especially in the area of building buildings did not change the circle of approached applicants because they had good experience with those with whom they worked so far.
This segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Contracting entities argued that in case of non-public proceedings they should guarantee that they would address the tenderers whose suitability they had already assured beforehand.
Although there was no evidence for illegal regional restrictions, the circuit of applicants in the non-public proceedings included a larger part of regional applicants than in the case of public proceedings.
Contracting authorities explained this the low level of the contract compared to public management and high cost of travel for potential tenderers.
The principle of cross-check and design of self-employed experts
Contracting entities mostly ignored the obligation to change the list of tenderers proposed by self-employed professionals.
They argued especially with lack of staff, time pressure or inappropriate knowledge of a suitable candidate.
In many cases, it was not evident from the records who suggested the candidate who was asked to participate in the proceedings.
Checking some samples showed that the list of potential applicants was created by self-employed professionals and the contracting authority was accepted unchanged.
Thus, contracting entities did not adequately protect themselves from potential manipulation.
Confidentiality of handling lists of potential applicants
One contracting authority had a list of tenderers for invitation to the procurement procedure in the database, which all employees had access at any time.
This allowed manipulation or unauthorized disclosure of the names of expected or accepted applicants, who could then agree on the price.
Documentation
The documentation gave reasons for choosing applicants in only a few cases.
NKÚ
Applicant selection criteria
During the construction of the road circuit, the candidates did not have information about what will be evaluated from the data on their qualifications and how.
The action related to the development and modernization of waterways and ports in the procurement notice for participation in a narrower procedure did not define the criteria for restrictions on the number of tenderers.
All eight tenderers met qualifying conditions, but thus exceeded the number to which the contracting authority limited participation in the procurement procedure.
The Commission then made the selection of applicants using the method of random selection - by drawing, which was legal at the time.
This procedure should have been specified as a criterion already in the procurement notice.
Summary
Due to the high risk of manipulation in selecting a winning candidate in limited procurement procedures, both countries introduced special measures to prevent illegal restrictions on competition.
German rules limit such opportunities for manipulation using the so-called. cross-checks (four-eyes principle), by maintaining the confidential character of the list of applicants and by prohibiting proposing to select applicants for external companies.
Czech rules aim to prevent potential restrictions with the aim of manipulation mainly by an unlimited number of applicants.
However, the inspection found that part of the said rules were not sufficiently applied and that inadmissible restrictions on the candidate s' circle were not prevented in some cases.
Contracting entities are obliged to eliminate all the deficiencies mentioned.
Submission of tenders
The procurement phase in which potential tenderers can draw up tenders based on the tender documentation they received starts with publication of the procurement information and / or the invitation to tenderers.
Until the date of opening the envelopes, applicants may submit their tenders to the contracting authority and thus apply for the award of the contract.
Demands of European law and prevention of corruption
EU law does not prescribe specific requirements at this stage of procurement procedure.
The contracting authority must follow national rules governing this stage of proceedings and prevent potential manipulation.
The abovementioned rules apply in particular to organizing and control.
German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
The principle applies that tendency documents on the basis of which potential suppliers make their offer must always be sent by the contracting authority.
Projection offices that are involved in proceedings should not fulfil this task.
The contracting authority must ensure that all candidates received the same information during this stage of the procurement procedure.
In case of uncertainty in the procurement documentation or further questions arise, only the contracting authority may provide information to tenderers.
The design offices responsible for drawing up the procurement documentation cannot provide any information.
Any contact between projection office and applicants must be prevented throughout this phase.
Those must remain anonymous throughout the course, because allowing contact with them can adversely affect the competition.
Tenders sent by post or submitted directly must be submitted in a closed envelope.
Electronically submitted offers must be encoded.
Different clauses
In Germany, the contracting authority may entrust insured suppliers of external services to print and send documentation, with their employees being obliged to comply with confidentiality.
In Germany, the tenders received must be marked indicating the date of receipt and transmitted directly and immediately in its original state (sealed) to the official responsible for their custody.
This worker must not be involved in the procurement procedure.
Bids received must be locked up until the envelopes are opened.
In the Czech Republic, the offers received are marked with a serial number.
The contracting authority shall issue a report with competition details including the tender number and information on the draft and receipt of the tender.
There are no special regulations on the safekeeping of offers.
Main inspection findings
BRH
BRH checked the assignment of the administration building.
Sending procurement documentation
Controlled contracting authorities of the construction administration sent out the procurement documentation either directly or entrusted it with printing and distribution to an external company.
Self-employed persons sent no documentation.
Information provided to applicants
For the part of the procurement documentation concerning inquiry and information, the contracting authority did not follow the rules for separate planning from the procurement procedure.
Contrary to the relevant regulations, he often did not mention the names of his contact staff, but rather the workers of the project management department.
Some procurement notices even included names of companies or self-employed persons involved in the preparation of the procurement documentation.
In rare cases, tenderers who asked questions during the procurement did not receive identical information.
Offer tagging
For contracting entities all accepted tenders were marked with a stamp and a receipt certificate.
However, in some cases in the negotiated procedure, offers were accepted by self-employed experts, violating the rule of one corruption prevention construction.
Custody of the tenders
Once marked, not all tenders were passed on directly and without delay to the official assigned to keep them in custody locked the tenders in a steel cabinet.
With one contracting authority, offers were temporarily placed in an open compartment of the mailroom, which was accessed by all employees.
Another contracting authority placed a box in the hallway without constant supervision and part of the offers thrown into the mailbox stayed there overnight.
The box opening was wide and unsecured, so it was accessible not only to employees.
NKÚ
NKÚ has not identified shortcomings in this area.
Summary
In both countries rules are laid down to prevent contacts especially between stakeholders and design offices cooperating in procurement procedures throughout the entire process.
Equal treatment is ensured by sending the same information to all applicants.
Rules to prevent manipulation and corruption are suitable for receipt, storage and confidentiality of offers.
In Germany, the relevant requirements are somewhat more developed than in the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the accumulated control records have demonstrated violation of the rules in some areas.
These irregularities can easily be corrected.
Opening envelopes
Opening envelopes
During the opening of envelopes, offers that have been closed, opened, are read and published.
The period for which the tenderer is bound by his tender begins at the time of the deadline for submitting or opening the envelopes and ends with a deadline specified by the contracting authority.
Demands of European law and prevention of corruption
European legislation does not contain any specific provisions on opening envelopes.
However, national law and regulations contain extensive requirements for the protection of tenders and competition during this sensitive phase of the whole procurement procedure.
The principles of ′′ more eyes ", transparency and credibility of the process of opening envelopes are intended to prevent manipulations and adjustments of offers already submitted.
German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
The opening of envelopes must be performed by several persons appointed by the contracting authority.
Conformity with the principle of ′′ more eyes ′′ is supposed to prevent individuals from manipulating offers.
Applicants may be present when envelopes are opened.
When opening all envelopes must be placed before the chairman of the commission and opened one by one.
Late offers received must not be taken into account.
In order to ensure transparency in opening envelopes, this phase including the conclusions (results) must be recorded in writing. The record must include, among other things, the names of applicants and prices offered.
The registration must be read and signed by the group leader.
The registration may be signed by the applicants present.
Different clauses
A commission is set up in the Czech Republic for opening envelopes.
Participation of independent experts is admitted.
Members of the commission may be responsible for discussing even in subsequent stages of the proceedings, i.e. by evaluating offers.
In Germany, the opening of envelopes takes place in the presence of the leader and the recorder.
The manager must be an employee of the contracting authority.
The manager and in the case of ground construction and the recorder must not be participants in the preparatory phase (production of the procurement documentation), must not decide on the award of the contract and may not be members during subsequent processing (proceedings) of the contract.
German regulations require registration of opening envelopes to contain not only offer prices, but also all information about discounts and special (unusual) signs, e.g. damaged envelopes upon receipt or late delivery.
In the Czech Republic, the registration purchased in addition to the offer prices must include an indication of the tender language and the signature authorization of the candidate.
German regulations require that all parts of open envelopes be marked to avoid subsequent changes.
Tenders, usually marked in the form of perforation, must be held at the end of opening the envelopes as confidential (secret) and can only be made available to persons who continue to process them.
Similar measures do not exist in the Czech Republic.
If a single offer is received in the Czech Republic, the envelope must not be opened and the candidate must be informed immediately.
They do not have this modification in Germany, and if a single offer is accepted, it is open and evaluated.
Main inspection findings
BRH
The principle of cross check
During the opening of envelopes, contracting entities followed the principle of four eyes.
There were always a leader and a recorder who was not intended for another role.
However, in rare cases, in small negotiated procedures, the natural person opened the tenders sent to them without the participation of the contracting authority.
The course of opening envelopes
Envelopes from opening envelopes did not always document the course.
In some cases no late bids were marked and in some cases were missing signatures.
Marketing of offers received
Contracting entities marked offers of perforations with a date, which was in accordance with the requirements.
Some of them have incorrectly flagged offers in the past, but after BRH alerted, they changed practice.
This segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
NKÚ
Time limit for receipt of tenders
During road repairs, the candidate's offer was handed over to the contracting authority with a monthly delay and he still accepted it.
Summary
In both countries, the essential parts of the envelopes are identical with the principle of ′′ more eyes ′′ and the principle of transparency and therefore allow for significantly reducing the risk of corruption and manipulation.
German rules are more complex compared to the Czech Republic, especially requirements for accurate documentation of the procedure.
Marketing, safe keeping and respecting the confidential nature of offers significantly limit the possibility of subsequent changes in the submitted tenders.
In addition, workers responsible for opening envelopes must not carry out any other contract related activities.
Discovery, despite some discrepancies, confirms that the rules for opening envelopes are mainly applied.
Assessment and evaluation of tenders
The contracting authority must examine and evaluate the tenders received within the specified deadline.
At the same time, they must award the contract to the tenderer who best meets the award criteria in the tender.
Demands of European law and prevention of corruption
EU law sets out the process of assessing and evaluating offers in several steps:
The first step examines the suitability of the applicants.
They must have a good economic and financial position and required professional and technical knowledge and abilities.
Candidates who have ever been legally convicted of bribery or defraudation must always be excluded from procurement procedures.
Offers of non-excluded tenderers must be evaluated in terms of number of correctness, technical suitability and value for money based on previously published award criteria.
The contracting authority must identify the most economically favourable offer and especially check all the significantly low price offers.
Review and assessment is especially sensitive and susceptible to manipulation.
For example, applicants may be excluded without a legitimate reason, or offers that do not meet the requirements may be left in the competition.
The result of the evaluation may be wrongly influenced by the preference of a candidate or his disadvantage, thus preventing the most economically advantageous offer.
Therefore, the contracting authority must take special measures when selecting persons involved in the process and must ensure that they meet the requirements for integrity and technical knowledge.
They also need to make sure that the whole process and decisions taken are transparent and credible.
German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
In accordance with EU requirements, the relevant provisions in both countries require review and evaluation of tenders in progressive steps.
During the evaluation, the requirements to demonstrate the suitability of the applicants, the evaluation criteria and their weights specified in the notice or in the procurement documentation shall not be changed.
The criteria laid down for the assessment of the suitability of the applicants cannot be applied further.
A further evaluation can only be carried out on the basis of the evaluation criteria.
Offers submitted must first be examined from a formal point of view whether they are complete or not included suspicious elements that might encourage manipulation.
If tenderers are excluded from further examination and evaluation of the tenders submitted by them, they must be informed immediately.
If the assessment of the tenders of the finding is disproportionately low bid price, the candidate concerned must be given the opportunity to comment on the situation before possible withdrawal of his offer.
The reasons for the decision must be transparently documented.
Different clauses
In Germany, tenderers must remain confidential and only eligible persons can participate in the evaluation of offers.
Only the contracting authority can review the mathematical accuracy of tenders.
Only employees who are not integrated into the decision-making phase of the contractor's selection or the project implementation phase may be entrusted with the evaluation.
There are no precise provisions on who can carry out further reviews and evaluations.
If external companies are entrusted with examining and evaluating offers, they must realize that offers are confidential and respect that fact honestly.
They can only give the contracting authority suggestions for decisions.
In the Czech Republic, tenders must be reviewed and evaluated by the commissioning authority, which will draw up a report with the proposal for a contract conclusion.
However, in both countries the final decision depends on the contracting authority.
If in Germany the documents and declarations required in connection with the submission of tenders are incomplete, the tenderers concerned must subsequently submit the required documents within six days.
This segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
If applicants fail to comply with this obligation, their offers must be excluded.
In the Czech Republic, the contracting authority can decide whether it will give the candidate an opportunity to supplement the missing documents.
If the candidate does not support them, they must be excluded.
In Germany it is necessary to review not only the total price, but also the unit prices.
If the price structure of the offer shows that prices for parts of the overall project were estimated disproportionately high or low, applicants must be asked for clarifications.
If they do not provide an explanation and if the contracting authority can prove that the tender contains compensatory prices, such offers must be excluded.
This should prevent applicants from submitting price calculations based on the assumption that significant quantitative changes will be made for each part of the project, which can lead to a significant increase in project costs.
In the Czech Republic, the total price of the work is evaluated and the prices of individual parts are not examined in detail.
Appreciation compensation is not a reason to exclude an offer.
In Germany, a contract cannot be awarded to a candidate who offers disproportionately high or low price.
If one or more offers differ price by 10 % or more compared to the price estimated by the contracting authority or by other tenders, tenderers must prove that their offer was plausible and convincingly calculated.
If they are not able to do so, the contracting authority should exclude them.
In the Czech Republic, procurement procedure may be cancelled after a price review if only offers with disproportionately low prices were received and tenderers did not justify these prices.
If the price of the tender is significantly higher than the contracting authority's estimate, this is not a reason for refusing to award the contractor concerned (unlike the German procurement law).
If there is a suspicion of action in Germany to reduce competition, the contracting authority shall immediately report this fact to the competent supervisory authority.
The candidate must decide on the next procedure and whether it is appropriate to inform the antitrust authority or criminal law enforcement authorities.
They also have to approve (e.g. when the contract exceeds 000 50 and the contract has not been awarded to the tenderer with the lowest bid) whether the contract will be awarded when the contract is negotiated or whether the procurement procedure will be cancelled.
Czech rules do not modify this area.
Main inspection findings
BRH
Appropriate examination and procurement criteria
Most proven procurement procedures were in accordance with relevant requirements.
In case of some recommendations of potential suppliers made by self-employed persons, contracting entities themselves did not check the suitability of the tenderers.
This segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In some cases, procurement procedures were not sufficient documentation as to whether the contracting authority took into account all published evaluation criteria or whether the selection decision was based solely on the price criterion.
Selection of interested persons and confidentiality of offers
Some contracting entities used the services of unauthorized persons, such as self-employed persons or employees of the construction authorities.
These were incorporated into the planning or implementation process of construction projects, performing functions that should have been held solely by the contracting authority.
Contracting entities sought to justify this fact with their lack of human resources in a given sector.
In some cases, they used self-employed professionals to examine offers of services of persons who were not formally bound to maintain the confidentiality of offers and perform with proper care the execution of their contract commitments.
As regards contracting entities, there was usually no evidence of whether offers in the custody of self-employed professionals were only available to designated persons.
Review and mathematical check of offers
Some contracting entities handed over open envelopes for further examination to self-employed professionals without first conducting a prescribed check of tenders and mathematical examination and without documenting the results of these tests.
In case of any intention of manipulation, third parties could make changes in tenders that could not be identified by the contracting authority.
The examination of documents revealed a number of cases where unusual elements in the offers were not adequately identified or where price and product data were missing.
Performance audits
A model inspection of one contracting authority revealed that in 75 % of the procurement cases, the most advantageous tenders deviated by more than 10 % from predetermined costs.
One of twenty procurement procedures were cancelled due to non-adequate tenders.
In many cases there was lack of evidence or sufficient documentation on the examination of offers or deals with applicants for further clarification.
In many cases, detailed information was also missing e.g. on unit prices of the most important invoiced items.
Changes in market prices or increases in material costs were often stated as a reason for the derogation.
Contracting entities defended that identifying and demonstrating compensatory prices was difficult.
In case of one call for tenders, made by an entity outside the ordinary contracting authority, a 66 % lower price was offered compared to the original cost estimation.
No data on closer cost examination or finding reasons for variations were recorded.
In clarifying this question, the contracting authority found no indication of price dumping of the tenderer to whom the contract was potentially awarded.
Therefore, it was not clarified whether the original cost estimate was inflated or whether the price offered was too low.
Later, the contracting authority evaluated this candidate as a ′′ low cost company ′′ that was unable to meet either qualitative requirements or deadlines.
In another procurement procedure, the contracting authority awarded the contract to the tenderer whose price was 35 % higher than the original cost estimate.
The contracting authority did not cancel the procurement procedure and stated the unfounded argument that the candidate concerned could be assumed that he did not base his price on excessive costs.
Suspicion of irregularities
One contracting authority found two cases of irregularities and reported to the company responsible for technical supervision.
In one procurement procedure, two tenderers submitted tenders containing an identical price calculation, which prompted the contracting authority to exclude both tenders.
The checks showed no significant deficiencies in the application of other provisions.
NKÚ
Appropriate verification
For many construction events such as university buildings, roads and railways, contracting entities did not exclude tenderers from participation in the procurement procedure, even though they did not meet the requirements of the contracting authority, or did not prove the qualification to the required extent, or on the contrary, one contracting authority failed to demonstrate or explain the reason for eliminating the candidate who met the requirements I'm sorry.
Reviews
Although the individual evaluation criteria of the contracting procedure for the construction of the sewage plant were established for the construction worker, the contracting authority did not respect them during the procedure.
For railway infrastructure development action, the evaluation criteria were not established at the start of the procedure, but only at the beginning of the evaluation.
For the road repair project, the evaluation of the 'reduction of construction time' criterion was not done correctly.
For applicants in second and third place, the evaluation incorrectly reported a larger reduction in the construction period than stated in their offers.
Documentation of the reasons for choosing the candidate
The contracting authority failed to demonstrate for three housing support actions, based on which criteria it assessed the accepted tenders and how it chose the most suitable of them.
Properity of selection of contractors of small-scale contracts associated with road circuit construction with the expected price up to 500 thousand.
Kč could not be verified, because suppliers were selected only based on telephone consultations on price and date of fulfilment, but documents of these negotiations were not made out.
Summary
In both countries, rules for verifying and evaluating offers correspond to EU requirements.
However, they differ with regard to specific management and choice of individuals in the proceedings included.
Unlike the Czech Republic, in Germany these steps of the procurement process follow stricter and more detailed requirements, especially in terms of the application of the cross principle and the protection of tenders.
The same applies to rules for verifying the appropriateness of the prices offered.
In both countries, checks found in some cases that substantial steps of the process in verifying and evaluating tenders were not documented at all and if so, only partially.
Absence of control tools and transparency in taking decisions during reviewing and evaluating tenders allows manipulation.
The checks showed serious defects, such as the submission of tenders to third parties without prior proper examination and documentation of tenders by the contracting authority.
If contracting entities entrust a third party to carry out the functions of examination and evaluation of tenders, adequate measures and increased control of measures against increased manipulation are necessary.
In all cases, controlled German contracting entities did not use the complete set of available tools and did not deal with their own price structure.
In the Czech Republic, shortcomings were found in the assessment of the suitability of offers and the application of the evaluation criteria.
Completion of the procurement procedure
After examination and evaluation of tenders, the procurement process is completed by awarding a contract or cancelling the procedure.
Demands of European law and prevention of corruption
In the case of European proceedings, all tenderers must be informed in advance of the decision on awarding the contract.
Contractors have the opportunity to review the decision taken within a limited time limit of 10 or 15 days and request a review if applicable.
This segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The 10 days period applies to electronic submissions and 15 days for other submissions.
The contract must not be concluded before this period or before the decision of the review procedure is taken.
If the review body rejects the complaint and confirms the decision, candidates and tenderers must be given the opportunity to have the correctness of the application of the procurement law examined by an independent court.
This measure ensures that no contracting authority will be able to circumvent the legal protection of suppliers by rapid implementation of the procurement decision.
The contracting authority must properly document the procedure.
German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
Both countries implemented on informational management duties.
In both countries, the final decision on the outcome of the procurement procedure lies with the contracting authority.
However, this one cannot arbitrarily deviate from the results of the proper examination and evaluation.
The contracting authority is supposed to contract within the specified time.
The reason is because the tenderer is not bound by his offer after this period.
Content of the contract must not deviate from the winning bid.
Unsuccessful applicants should be informed of the outcome in time, stating the reason why their offer was not accepted.
The cancellation of the procurement procedure is only allowed when certain conditions are met, e.g. if the prices in the offers do not meet the specifications.
Different clauses
In the Czech Republic, the mandatory waiting period before the conclusion of the contract of 10 or 15 days applies to European and national proceedings.
In Germany, the equivalent provision applies only to European proceedings.
In all other proceedings in Germany, tenderers cannot be informed of the award of the contract before a decision on its EU provision and review award.
In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure must be cancelled if a single tender has been received or only one offer complied with the requirements for its consideration and evaluation.
The contract must be awarded in Germany, even though a single tender has been received, provided that this tender meets the conditions laid down in the procurement documentation and is cost effective.
Main inspection findings
BRH
The checks found few discrepancies in completing the controlled procurement processes.
In some cases of European proceedings, the companies empowered letters before the expiry of the notification deadline, which may invalidate the contract.
In several cases of open proceedings, authorizing letters of modification included incompatible with the content of the tenders, e.g. new deadlines.
In some cases contracting entities did not comply with the deadline for awarding the contract.
In one open procedure, the contracting authority chose the second most favorable offer, because the candidate offering a price more than 50 % lower did not wish to meet the contract at the originally offered price.
NKÚ
During the reconstruction and construction of the college, the contracting authority did not enter into a contract with the contractor in accordance with the draft contract contained in the offer of the selected candidate.
Some road repair and maintenance events, highway construction and road circuit construction contracts were concluded later than the law provides.
The contracting authority sent a notice of selection of the most suitable offer to all tenderers after the legal deadline expires, for construction adjustments in former military újezdech.
Summary
Both countries implemented EU regulations on termination of procurement procedures.
Legal protection of failed candidates contributes to the reduction of corruption.
The Czech Public Procurement Act includes the Institute of Legal Protection also in cases of contracts below the EU limits.
In both countries, it was found that a limited time limit for contract closure was exceeded.
This can cause adverse economic consequences and increase the risk of manipulation.
In the future, contracting entities should eliminate such shortcomings when closing the procurement procedure.
Documentation, notifications, information duties
The procurement process with all its individual phases, relevant findings and decisions, including relevant justifications, must be documented in a transparent way.
The completion of the procurement procedure at European level must be published.
The data on procurement procedures are summarized in EU statistics.
Demands of European law and prevention of corruption
The obligation to document the procurement procedure is in accordance with the essential requirement of the principle of transparency applied at EU level.
Only proper and time-relevant documentation on decision making and justification guarantees transparency in the procurement process, and above all guarantees effective legal protection of the interests of each candidate in cases where the value of the contract exceeds European limits.
Proper documentation is also an essential part of anti-corruption measures, since the obligation to substantiate individual decisions and their justification significantly reduces the space for manipulation.
In cases of European procurement procedures, the contracting authority must announce their completion of the EU's Office of Official Publications within 48 days of the date of award of the contract.
The Office publishes the notification in the Official Journal of the EU and thus fulfils the requirement of transparency.
The contracting authority must summarize the essential information on its procurement procedures and communicate them to the European Commission through the relevant national ministries.
On this basis, the European Commission publishes annual statistics, which allow for an overview of the development of the single market in the field of construction.
German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
Both countries have completely transposed into their national legislation the provisions of the European documentation and notification laws.
The provisions on documentation and notifications for European statistics are almost identical in both countries.
Different clauses
In the Czech Republic, the obligation to announce the award of a contract does not only apply to European procedures, but also to national procurement procedures.
The deadline for notification is only 15 days after the contract is concluded.
In Germany, the obligation to notify procurement procedures, in addition to those compulsory under European law, applies only to limited procedures exceeding the limit of 25 thousand. € (625 thousand. Kč) and direct procedures exceeding the limit of 15 thousand. € (375 thousand. Kč) VAT incl.
Only parties are informed below this limit.
Main inspection findings
BRH
Documentation
Large amount of assignments have not been fully documented.
The notification did not contain all the necessary information, e.g. reasons for supply specifications and national rules.
In the case of one procedure, the contracting authority did not explain why it contracted a candidate whose offer did not contain compulsory elements.
In several cases, some required records were also missing.
Disclosure of award of the contract
In the case of some European procedures, the contracting authority made mistakes in the publication of the notice.
In case of several assignments, evidence of publication of the notice was missing.
Notification obligation
Statistically proven files included the required minimum of information and were created and sent on time.
Preliminary transparency
In most cases, the contracting authority published information on the outcome of the contract.
In the case of one contracting authority, contract information was not published due to a communication error.
The contracting authority took six months to notice the error.
Consequently, the outcome of the proceedings was not published during this period.
NKÚ
Documentation
The events related to the organizing of a major sporting event have been identified considerable shortcomings in the procurement documentation such as: incorrect information on offer prices in protocols from the evaluation committee meeting.
Moreover, some documents about opening envelopes were not signed.
Disclosure of award of the contract
In preparation of repairs and maintenance of communications, highway construction and road circuit, public procurement notice was sent after the deadline or not published.
Summary
Documentation and notification and notification and notification obligations include European requirements and are almost identical in both countries.
This generally ensures the transparency of procurement procedures and final selection.
Czech reporting duties are somewhat stricter compared to German.
The checks revealed shortcomings significantly lowering the value of documentation as a means of corruption prevention.
This segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Contracting entities should continue to strengthen the transparency of their procurement procedures and fully comply with the notification and notification requirements.
Summary evaluation and recommendations
Parallel checks of NKÚ and BRH were focused on two areas that are essential for the process of procurement both in the Czech Republic and Germany, namely the application of EU procurement law and corruption prevention.
EU Legislative gives opportunity to international competition within the EU to create a single European market.
The aim of measures to prevent corruption is not only to avoid it or at least reduce it, but also to prevent financial damage and possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the government.
The sought inspection findings of both control institutions - NKÚ and BRH - with regard to the application of the procurement right of both countries and the comparison of its relevant provisions give an internal view of common and different elements that can help both countries in the further development and application of this right.
Application of EU procurement law
Both countries transposed EU law regarding public procurement into their national legislation.
Thus, there is an important common basis in both countries for public procurement and fulfilling essential requirements in the area of: competition; equal treatment of candidates; transparency of procurement procedures.
Contracting entities reinforce these requirements with partially very extensive measures.
The Czech Republic has raised public procurement clauses requiring European management and procedures that are below EU limits and therefore governs national legislation.
However, checks showed that contracting entities do not always fully comply with all relevant EU requirements.
German contracting authorities should continue to improve the quality of their procurement procedures to eliminate the mentioned irregularities taking into account the implementation of EU requirements.
In the Czech Republic, checks identified risks affecting economy and achieving value for money.
In particular, this is an incomplete definition of the subject-matter of a public contract resulting in additional works, which were often awarded against the law, insufficient definition of the expected price and also the required qualifying assumptions narrowing the possible circuit of tenderers and thus reducing competition especially in the field of transport buildings.
Prevention of corruption
Joint checks were not intended to detect corruption cases.
The reason was that both BRH and NKÚ do not have the tools to do so.
However, they can verify whether the competent authorities of both countries are taking measures to reduce corruption and manipulate during public procurement and how these measures are applied.
In terms of corruption prevention, both countries focused on different aspects.
The German provisions mainly give space to wide and unlimited competition, transparency and controls as a central element of corruption prevention.
Czech regulations mainly monitor the strengthening of the transparency of procurement procedures.
BRH
In Germany there are general principles of corruption prevention that apply to the whole Federal administration.
These principles were also incorporated among the public procurement requirements and were adopted to meet the specific needs of these procurement.
The relevant provisions specify, sometimes very precisely, ways to comply with the requirements for the prevention of corruption during the procurement procedure and the choice of persons included therein.
In the opinion of the BRH, the principle of preference for open procurement procedures and calls for participation is a particularly appropriate instrument for substantial reduction of the risk of corruption in public procurement, while limiting competition increases the risk of manipulation.
Risk analysis and adequate control (especially the principle of cross control), requirements regarding transparency, procurement documentation and various organisational measures are also an effective mechanism to prevent corruption and manipulation.
Therefore, BRH does not feel the need for substantial changes to the current provisions that public institutions must comply with during the award of public procurement.
Anti-corruption measures are widely applied in practice.
Irregularities found in some areas highlighted weaknesses in compliance with certain requirements.
Therefore, contracting entities should provide their employees with further education and thus inform them with anti-corruption requirements and further increase their awareness in this area.
A significant part of the exposed weaknesses applies to activities delegated by the construction administration to private entrepreneurs.
However, the absence of adequate controls in delegation of powers increases the risk of their abuse.
Consequently, manipulation and corruption activities should only be transmitted to third parties if the administration can guarantee a sufficient degree of protection against unauthorized intervention.
NKÚ
In the Czech Republic anti-corruption strategies were adopted at the government level, which also significantly affect the public procurement area.
NKÚ control events took place during the implementation of one of the most important parts of this strategy, a significant change in the public procurement law and the adoption of follow-up implementing regulations.
Strategy adopted and new laws can be effective steps to improve the situation.
According to new regulations, for example, the contracting authority must justify the effectiveness of the contract, the determination of the expected value of the contract, the adequacy of requirements for qualifying assumptions, the determination of basic evaluation criteria and the method of evaluation of tenders and the proper improvement and publication of everything.
Recommendation
Overall, both NKÚ and BRH have a positive opinion on the ways of implementing EU requirements.
Their wide application in practice confirmed that EU requirements for competition, equal treatment and transparency are an appropriate basis for the award of public procurement within the EU.
A multinational model established in the EU can also serve as a base for similar projects aimed at facilitating and supporting international competition.
Taking into account the great potential of material and intangible damage caused as a result of manipulation and corruption in connection with the award of public procurement, both BRH and NKÚ insist that it is the responsibility of contracting entities to continue measures against corruption and manipulation and improve them wherever possible.
Especially organisational structures and procurement processes should be monitored continuously in terms of weaknesses and risks to identify and respond appropriately to the need for repair actions.
Compared to the practice in Germany, it appeared that the share of open procurement procedures should increase in the Czech Republic, which give space to competition and significantly reduce the possibility of corruption.
Procurement in parts can also have a positive impact on the price achieved in cases where it is admissible and suitable for contracting entities. The higher number of applicants puts pressure on the price achieved.
The influence on the procurement procedure is also provided by his organization.
In Germany, it is provided by special state organizations, while in the Czech Republic, except for transport buildings, central authorities organize it themselves or through contractors.
Both NKÚ and BRH wish to further develop knowledge in their work where it is in place and address them with their parliament and government beyond their common project.
Moreover, they believe that the principles of procurement law and their implementation, as described in this report, will also be of interest at the level of the International Organisation of Highest Supervisory Institutions (INTOSAI), because these principles and findings are of general importance for effective countering corruption and guarantee, that public procurement is awarded in a regime of well functioning and honest competition and that value is achieved for money.

COMMON FINAL REPORT on the results of parallel checks on the management of excise taxes in SR and Czech Republic
Joint final report
May 2017
The highest supervisory office of the Slovak Republic
Supreme Supervisory Authority of the Czech Republic
Introductory word
The Joint Report submitted informs about the progress and outcome of international cooperation in parallel checks carried out by the Slovak Republic's Supreme Supervisory Authority and the Czech Republic's Supervisory Authority, with a focus on the management of excise taxes in 2012-2015.
Cooperation between the top control institutions of both countries was carried out on the basis of a cooperation agreement between the NKÚ SR and the NKÚ Czech Republic in the performance of parallel inspections focused on the management of excise taxes, which was concluded in August 2015.
The topic of parallel checks was selected based on the fact that both EU Member States are based on common European legislation to find out how it is applied at national level, how the excise tax management system is set up and how the systems in SR and the Czech Republic are different.
The greatest benefit of the control actions carried out was exchanging experience, identifying differences and finding good practice.
Last but not least, it was beneficial to find that international comparability of data on the performance and efficiency of excise duty management is very limited without parallel checks being carried out.

on the results of parallel checks of SPD management in SR and Czech Republic
Summary and evaluation
The legislation of excise duties in the Czech Republic and the SR and their administration is in accordance with EU legislation and significantly exceeds EU requirements.
Differences were found between the adjustment of excise duties in SR and Czech Republic, in the Czech Republic contributes to the effective management of excise duties verification of the economic stability of applicants for the issuance of permits and compulsory marking and coloring of selected mineral oils and some other oils; in SR the distribution of control signs is simpler than in the Czech Republic and less burdened by the tax manager.
In the fight against excise tax evasion, the supervision of raw tobacco movement and or as a good practice in both countries. tobacco raw materials, implementation of the Institute of Fuel Distributor and registration of retailers of alcohol packaging.
Excise tax revenue in SR and Czech Republic grows slower than other tax revenue.
EU goals consisting of reducing labour taxation, introducing ecologically economical measures and reducing tobacco and alcohol addiction have not yet been met in the Czech Republic and SR, among others. also because there is no indexation of excise duty rates in both countries.
This results in reducing the importance of excise taxes on total tax revenue and due to increasing purchasing power, a real reduction in tax burden with excise duties.
The state has long-term support for the implementation of environmental measures, but these measures have a negative impact on excise tax revenue, which will need to be replaced by other revenue or reducing state spending.
Administrative costs incurred on the management of excise taxes in the Czech Republic and the SR have been growing long-term, mainly due to wage growth, and their efficiency is decreasing.
In SR, this effectiveness is negatively affected by the costs of electronization of excise duty management (IT expenditure) and the costs incurred on the wages of employees carrying out permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses on alcohol.
Electronization of the management of excise taxes in SR did not significantly improve the number of tax administrators.
NKÚ Czech Republic and NKÚ SR recommend doporučují SR to rethink the justification of the performance of permanent tax oversight in tax warehouses for alcohol.
In the Czech Republic, the effectiveness of administrative expenses was influenced by the fact that the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic did not apply procedures during the controlled period, which would lead to a reduction in the staffing of the excise duty management.
The number of comparable administrative actions of tax administrators was similar in SR and the Czech Republic in the various years of the controlled period, but the number of comparable tax entities is about a third lower in SR than in the Czech Republic.
Tax administrators in SR perform administrative actions mainly in the form of physical exercise of tax oversight, while tax administrators in the Czech Republic emphasize remote oversight and risk analysis.
The management of excise taxes in SR is more administratively demanding than in the Czech Republic and due to the ratio of the number of tax operations to the number of entities and more costly.
Electronization of excise duty management in SR and Czech Republic took place in different areas.
In SR, the administration of tax returns for excise duties is fully electronized, documents demonstrating taxation of selected products in free tax circulation are transmitted in the Czech Republic.
Both methods of electronization support effective management of excise taxes and therefore NKÚ Czech Republic and NKÚ SR recommend applying them not only in both countries.
The total expenditure on the implementation of the EMCS system could not be compared as the FG SR provided spending data only for the system upgrade in the period 2011-2015, but the costs were incurred even before this period.
Expenditure incurred during this period only for the EMCS upgrade was about 20 % higher in the SR than the costs incurred in the Czech Republic both on the introduction of EMCS and on the upgrade of this system in over ten years.
Excise tax administrators in the Czech Republic and SR did not achieve comparable values of qualitative indicators when comparable spending was incurred.
The level of supervisory is comparable in both countries, but in the SR, the management of excise taxes is significantly more resource demanding.
The introduction of an electronic system for monitoring the movement of excise products (EMCS) has been streamlined by the management of excise duties, but in SR to a lower extent, because significantly higher costs were incurred than in the Czech Republic on the introduction of the system and its modernization.
Basic information
The cooperation of both supervisory institutions was carried out under the Cooperation Treaty on the implementation of parallel checks aimed at the management of excise duties on 18. 8. 2015.
NKÚ Czech Republic and NKÚ SR agreed to perform parallel checks, which will primarily focus on the issue of excise duty management and whose results will allow analysis, comparisons and evaluation of the facts found.
Common audit issues were agreed on which parallel checks were based.
Characteristics of the object and the aim of parallel control:
The aim of parallel checks was to compare the performance of excise tax administrators, taking into account qualitative and quantitative indicators and identifying weaknesses of the excise tax management process.
The following main audit questions should have been answered in particular:
Did excise tax administrators in the Czech Republic and SR achieve comparable values of qualitative indicators when incurring comparable expenditures?
Has the introduction of an electronic system for monitoring the movement of excise duty products (Excise Movement and Control System (EMCS) been streamlined and the costs incurred effectively for its introduction?
Parallel checks carried out should have identified causes of significant differences affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of tax management in the Czech Republic and SR, especially in the field of regulation and organisational structure.

Legislative for excise duties in Czech Republic and SR
Excise tax management legislation is divided into EU legislation (see Annex No. 1) and national law level (see Annex No. 2).
Council Directive 2008/118 / EC on the general adjustment of excise duties and repealing Directive 92/12 / EEC defines excise duty and lays down the basic rules for the management of taxes and the management of energy products and electricity, tobacco products, alcohol and alcoholic beverages.
This directive provides for the imposition of taxes on consumption on other products.
EU legislation regulates in particular the minimum conditions for: the amount of tax rates for the different types of selected products, production, storage, processing and possession of taxable products, taxation, exemption and tax refund, oversight of transport of selected products between EU Member States, international cooperation and keeping registers on economic operators and tax warehouses.
EU legislation enables control procedures and institutes to be introduced at national level, provided that they do not distort competition.
Legislative of excise duties in the Czech Republic
Definition of legislation in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, the legislation of excise duties is concentrated in the excise duty law (law no. 353/2003 Coll.), which regulates the management of mineral oil tax, alcohol tax, tobacco tax, beer taxes, wine and intermediate taxes and raw tobacco tax.
This law defines forms of handling products subject to excise duties, tax payer, permitting proceedings, conditions for transport of products, tax return and penalties for infringements.
The law and follow-up decrees further modify some other conditions for handling mineral oils (marking of mineral oils), restrictions on the sale of spirit drinks and tobacco products, monitoring the handling of special mineral oils and storage of crude tobacco for a purpose other than the production of tobacco products.
Taxes on other energy products (i.e. natural gas and some other gases, solid fuels and electricity) are regulated in sections 45 to 47 of Law No. 261/2007 Coll., on stabilization of public budgets.
In the Czech Republic there are also a number of provisions related to the management of excise duties contained in special legislation. Fuel Act No. 311/2006 Coll. and the implementing regulation regulates the conditions for the sale, distribution of fuel and keeping fuel records for free tax circulation.
In law no. 61/1997 Coll., o alcohol and its implementing rules define the conditions for manufacture, storage, registration and control of the production and circulation of alcohol.
Act No. 307/2013 Coll., on compulsory alcohol marking and relevant implementing regulations provide for compulsory marking of alcohol in the packaging, conditions for handling control bands and conditions for alcohol handling (i.e. for the manufacture, processing, sale or other transfer, transport, transport, storage, takeover, use, possession, import or export of alcohol).
Tax procedures not specified in special regulations are governed by law No. 280/2009 Coll., tax order.
The penalties are imposed in accordance with law no. 500/2004 Coll., administrative order.
Conditions for the issue of a trade licence (concession) for the operation of a business ′′ production and processing of fuels and greases and distribution of fuel ′′ and ′′ production, modification and sale of fermented alcohol, alcohol of consumerism and spirit drinks ′′ are governed by law No. 455/1991 Coll., on business (business law).
The Czech Republic has exercised the right to introduce control procedures and institutes to control the transport of selected products in free tax circulation and to supervise compliance with the legislation in the handling of selected products without excise duty, as well as the handling of selected products already taxed taken away.
This is a monitoring of the handling of special mineral oils and crude tobacco, marking some other mineral oils, marking tobacco products and alcohol in consumer packaging.
The Czech Republic used the authorization to apply excise duty to other products and introduced an excise duty on raw tobacco as one of the measures against tax fraud.
Structure of changes in legislation for individual types of excise duties in relation to the subject matter of inspection in the Czech Republic
Based on the resolution of the Government of the Czech Republic of 3. October 2012 No. 735, the implementation of the ′′ zero tolerance plan for the black market for spirit drinks ", between 2012-2015 and 2012-2015 in the Czech Republic, fundamental legislative arrangements were introduced in the Czech Republic, which introduced a number of measures against tax fraud on alcohol excise duty.
During the same period there were also major changes in the legislation on mineral oil tax, tobacco product taxes and the criminality of preparation of tax reduction.
Criminal protection of tax revenue
Effective from 1. 7. 2016, the crime preparation of the crime is introduced ′′ tax reduction, fee and similar compulsory payment ". The adjustment made should allow police authorities to take more efficient and timely measures to reduce tax fraud, e.g. deployment of operational resources.
General provisions for the management of excise duties
The issuance of an authorization to handle excise products under the Excise Tax Act is conditional on: reliability; debtlessness; economic stability; right to operate a business allowing the pursuit of an activity related to the authorization; a situation where the appellant not in liquidation or bankruptcy.
The aim of the regulation was mainly to address the issue of tax arrears, by reducing operators with the right to handle excise taxable products.
The condition of economic stability newly enables the tax manager to take into account the financial situation of tax entities both in the framework of the authorization procedure and after the issuance of the authorization.
The purpose of this measure is to prevent entities not having sufficient financial income to properly fulfil tax liabilities from handling selected products.
Indicators (profitability, liquidity, financial stability, activity, productivity, labor productivity) were established to assess the economic stability of the appellant.
In addition to these indicators, the administrative discretion of the tax manager is also important in view of the individual conditions of the procedure.
The law sets out the periodicity of verification of the fulfilment of the condition of economic stability because of the current data - verification takes place once a year following the deadline for filing income tax returns.
The tax administrator has the opportunity to lay down other conditions needed for tax management.
If the holder of the permit does not fulfil the conditions, the tax manager is entitled to revoke the permit or cancel with delay.
Out of the total of 2 609 entities with the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic examined the condition of economic stability, 18,6 % were found economically unstable with high risk of arrears when the tax liability exceeds the amount of tax security (e.g. repeated recipient).
The permit was revoked by ten entities, other applicants increased tax collateral, capitalized their contribution to the company or documented current accounting data according to which they already met all conditions for issuing the authorization.
In addition to the appellant, a natural person who is a statutory body or is a member of the statutory body, or a natural person who is not the statutory body of the appellant or its member, must comply with the conditions of reliability and without debt, but exercises such activity (chain of legal persons in the position of a statutory body or of its member), so called. established entities).
By the end of 2016, more than 30 entities were checked.
Registration kept under the Excise Tax Act (§ 37 to § 40 and § 60 of Act No. 353/2003 Coll.) contain information on:
type, name, code and quantity of goods manufactured, received, issued or dispatched, broken down by type of tax management scheme (tax exemption regime, importation, re-entry into the suspension scheme, taxable export, free circulation, own consumption, loss);
the identifier (SEED ID) of the recipient or supplier of selected products, the declarant, the date of the event and registration;
transport of selected products (eg means of transport, carriers, transport numbers);
the registration numbers of related documents;
notification of the introduction of alcohol in a consumer package marked by control tape for free tax circulation and distribution data.
Record of post-transport takeover must be made immediately upon completion.
In case of electronic-kept records, registration must be kept or allowed to output in xls, xlsx, ods.
Alcohol
After 2012, the Czech Republic introduced a complex of measures to ensure a detailed overview of the activities of the subjects (see Annex No. 2012). 3, Scheme A) from the production of raw alcohol through marking with control tape to its distribution to the final seller or the legitimate user of the exempt alcohol.
In the Czech Republic, customs authorities and production equipment for the production of alcohol that is not in operation is subject to the supervision of customs authorities.
The aim of the new regulation was to increase the overview of the processing of alcohol and the production of spirit drinks and to identify persons handling alcohol in the packaging, reduce alcohol management to financially stable and reliable persons and ensure constant supervision of the production and marking of spirits.
The most important measures are: Records of production, income, stocks and issuance of alcohol contain information on the quantity of alcohol according to each stages of production and alcohol processing, indicating the documents numbers.
Limitation of the volume of consumer packaging, packaging material and restrictions on the number of packages with a broken control tape at the point of final sale or issue to the consumer.
Consumer packaging means a container or another packaging with a volume of max. one liter, resp. three liters when it comes to a glass container.
Spirit drinks in larger packaging are viewed as unmarked, which are prohibited from handling.
Max can be found at the point of final sale to a natural person for his / her personal consumption. one consumer package with a broken control tape or three if fitted with a one-way valve.
The compulsory registration of a person who presents alcohol in products in a consumer packaging of at least 15 % volume of alcohol for free tax circulation and is: importer of alcohol, producer of alcohol in the Czech Republic or operator of a tax warehouse under a tax exemption regime, provided personal and technical conditions.
Personal conditions - reliability, integrity and non-expression of a ban on activity - must be met by the applicant and the person in the position of a statutory authority or a responsible representative.
Depending on the expected amount of inspection bands, the applicant must provide bail 100 000 CZK to 5 000 CZK (i.e. approx. 3 700 € to 185 000).
The technical conditions for registration are suitable place for marking alcohol and the equipment of the place of marking or tax warehouse with a camera tracker with continuous operation and remote access of the tax manager.
The registration designation of the control tape is introduced for the marking of spirits with a volume greater than 0,06 liters.
When carrying control bands, the registration marking of the control bands shall be indicated in the transport documents or customs declaration at the time of export.
The inspection tape until 2013 30. 11. contained a 30.-digit registration code, which included a four-digit registration number, the application code for inspection belts and the classification code according to ethanol volume concentration level.
The control tape from 12. 1. 2013 newly contains two types of identifiers and the amount of alcohol in the consumer packaging expressed in millilitres of ethanol at 20°C, with rounding to the whole millilitres downward.
Registration of control bands for spirit drinks shall contain daily records of individual methods of handling control bands according to registration codes and also documents on the basis of which registration was made.
In the event of the destruction, loss or theft of specific control bands, their holder shall inform the tax manager by electronic means of the registration code of the inspection bands concerned and their number on the following working day following the operative event.
Introducing a new factual nature of offences and adjusting the amount of sanctions imposed for infringement of the legislation in the handling of control bands.
Penalties may be imposed up to the amount of excise duty or exceed times (e.g. when the control belt is destroyed or lost in a number exceeding 0,1 % of the total quantity of the individual inspection belt orders, when the control tape is not returned within the time limit specified).
Restriction on control tapes only to registered holders who are not allowed to transfer them to another person except for their provision to a foreign supplier for the purpose of marking spirit drinks in a packaging manufactured outside the Czech Republic.
The inspection tapes exported must be placed on the consumer packaging and re-imported no later than nine months after taking over from the tax manager.
Compulsory registration of alcohol distributor in a consumer packaging provided similar personal conditions as for a person compulsory to sign alcohol and with a obligation to deposit bail up to CZK 5 000 (i.e. Approx. 185 000).
Definition of persons for selling or buying alcohol in a consumer package.
Authorised persons are obliged to sell alcohol in a consumer package to other registered persons or final sellers, or they may sell it as a final seller.

The notification contains the number of control bands used, volume and type of consumer packaging, volume alcohol, European goods code (EAN), identification of distributor or final seller, as well as product name and batch of production.
Tax entities sent about 10,5 miles between 2014 and 2015 an announcement.
Compulsory concession (a specific form of business permissions) not only for the production and treatment of alcohol, but also for the sale of alcohol in a consumer packaging by an entrepreneur to a natural person for his personal use or another legal or business person for his or her own internal use.
Concessed business can only be executed after a decision is made by the business authority, when competence and other conditions are fulfilled.
No prescribed professional competence is required for the sale of alcohol.

In the Czech Republic, about 94 thousand was registered in 2014 for a field involving production, modification of fermented alcohol, alcoholic alcohol, spirits and other alcoholic beverages. and in 2015 about 104 thousand. concessions.
Checks on compliance with the legislation in the field of handling products subject to excise duties in the Czech Republic also provide their activities outside the tax manager: business authorities, state agricultural and food inspection, financial authorities of the Czech Republic, Czech commercial inspections.
If they find that there has been a breach of obligation or a breach of the prohibition, the excise tax administrators shall immediately inform the excise duty manager.
Mineral oils
The Czech Republic has introduced a comprehensive supervisory system (see Annex No. 3, Scheme B), subject to mineral oils charged with excise duty, but also collected mineral oils by excise duty unloaded, which were abused for tax evasion.
The system includes supervision from production of mineral oil through storage, transport, marking and coloring of selected mineral oils, marking some other mineral oils to delivery to the final consumer or user and in some cases the consumption of mineral oils.
Customs supervision includes the manufacture of marking substances for marking mineral oils and handling these substances.
The marking and coloring of selected mineral oils are subject to mineral oils specified under the Combined Nomenclature codes 2710 25 19 (kerosene others), 2710 29 19 (other not elsewhere specified medium oils) and heavy gas oils 2710 19 41, 2710 49 19 and 45 2710 19 unless they are banned.
The marking of some other mineral oils is subject to e.g. Benzol, toluene, xylol and lubrication oils and other oils intended for purposes other than engine drive.
Branding and colouring selected mineral oils and some other mineral oils with a branding substance is possible only by the tax manager's permission.

The most important new measures since 2012:
Monitoring of the handling of special mineral oils, which is the group of mineral oils under the Combined Nomenclature codes 2710 19 71 to 2710 19 99 (i.e. lubrication oils and oils other than engine drive) whose kinematic viscosity at 40°C is less than 12 mm2. s-1 inclusive and have at least one of the following characteristics: flash point is lower than 150°C, at least 20 % of volume distillation including losses up to 350°C during distillation test.
These mineral oils were abused as a substitute for finished fuels, especially for diesel, or were directly used or sold for engine drive, because the physical properties are very similar.
Register with the tax administrator must be subjects dealing with monitored mineral oils in bulk or in a package exceeding 220 liters.
The personal conditions of the applicant, statutory authority and responsible representative must be fulfilled for the issue of registration, which is valid throughout 2 Except for beer, fruit wines, other wines and mead and fruit distillates obtained by burning.
3 Council Regulation (EEC) No 3 Article 2658/87 (2658/87) of 23. July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff.
4 For example when using mineral oil as fuel (excluding water voyage, unless it is private recreational craft) or as a component for fuel production, when marking is a failure to use them.
registration.
The register of persons handling special mineral oils contained 54 valid registrations, on the proposal of the registrant, four registrations were cancelled.
Electronic registration shall contain details of income, own consumption and sale or transfer of mineral oil including documents numbers, notification numbers acquired by tax administrators, storage and consumption, purpose of consumption, place of storage and consumption, or when selling place of delivery and customer registration number.
Notice of any acquisition of special mineral oil must be made between 24 and 72 hours before adoption.
Identification of business partners, name and nomenclature of special mineral oil, quantity, purpose of consumption or sales or transfer information is announced.
Notice of the expected quantity for the year of acquired, sold or consumed mineral oil shall be submitted by the body together with the registration application or by the end of January of the relevant calendar year.
Notice of purpose of use and marking, place of storage or consumption, identification details of the person who has a special mineral oil further sold or transferred shall be transmitted before any change.
Notifications are made electronically via intelligent forms or data box in PDFa format.
In 2015 persons handling special mineral oils submitted 630 notifications.
Providing and failing of special mineral oils or means of transport, the tax administrator must express the tax manager when he finds the handling of special mineral oils without registration or when the registered person fails to comply with his notification requirement.
As in the case of failure to comply with the transport of excise goods, these deficiencies cannot be remedied additionally.
Registration of a fuel distributor is mandatory for persons who sell or are entitled to sell fuel.
Registered fuel distributors can only be persons meeting the following criteria:
Compulsory concession of the business office (specific form of business permissions).
The application for a concession or, where appropriate, to the provision of a responsible representative, shall be given an opinion by the customs office examining whether the applicant for a concession, the statutory body or members of the statutory body of the applicant - the legal person and the designated responsible representative meet the condition of reliability.
If these persons fulfil the condition of reliability, the customs office shall give an approved opinion.
A reliable person is a person of integrity, in terms of criminal property, customs and tax law.
The condition of issuing the concession is professional competence.
The absence of the same circle of persons as in the case of reliability.
A debt-free person is a person who provides sufficient guarantees that he will perform his payment duties to the state in a proper and timely manner, i.e. has no arrears to the state budget and general health insurance.
The fuel distributor must not be prohibited by a court or administrative authority by a court or an administrative authority to prohibit the activity of his or her activity.
The fuel distributor must not be liquidated or bankrupt.
Bail composition (bank guarantees, if applicable) of CZK 20 (i.e. Approx. 740 €) which can be reduced to CZK 10 after three years of registration of a fuel distributor and other conditions after three years of registration and fulfilment of other conditions to CZK 000 (i.e. Approx. 370 000).
Notice of fuel distribution is required by the distributor to the customs office within 20 days after the end of the calendar month.
The electronic notification must contain data on individual purchase and sale of fuel.
The notified data are data on business partners, documents numbers, selected product, quantity, price, carriers and transport, place of loading and unloading.
The right to refund the tax on mineral oils consumed in primary agricultural production was reintroduced at the end of 2014.
Return of excise duty on mineral oils can only be claimed in the case of activity that is apparently related to the land activity.
In 2015 it was about 64 thousand. tax refund claims totaling 1 172 844 CZK (i.e. 43 720 401 €).
Since 2017, the government of the Czech Republic introduced a refund of excise duty on fuel to farmers with animal production.
Farmers or breeders who are dealing with bovine, pigs, poultry, sheep and goats will newly be able to claim this claim.
Tobacco products
Reduction of sales of tobacco products with old tax rate
The Czech Republic has introduced restrictions on the sale of tobacco products with effect from 1. 1. 12. 2014 tobacco products with an old tax rate in case of change in the tax rate.
The excise duty on tobacco products is paid by using tobacco stickers.
The use of a tobacco sticker means placing it on a unit package (Section 116 of the Excise Tax Act).
For the use of the excise duty rate, the production of a tobacco product in a state intended for the final consumer is determined, without removing, supplying, dispatching or selling to the final consumer.
The letter of the alphabet characterizing the excise duty rate is stated on the tobacco sticker together with the price for the final cigarette consumer, the label also indicates the number of pieces in the package or. amount of tobacco smoking in kilograms.
Tobacco sticker has no identifier.
The length of the transitional period for the sale of unit packs of cigarettes intended for direct consumption and bearing a tobacco label with the previous (old) tax rate was fixed until the end of the last day of the second calendar month after the effectiveness of the new excise duty rate.
The development of tobacco stickers in 2014 and the comparison with the previous years shows that manufacturers of tobacco products significantly frontloaded tobacco products with an ′′ old ′′ tax rate, thus reducing the effectiveness of the ′′ new ′′ tax rate by about one year.
Raw tobacco tax
Due to the abuse of raw tobacco to produce tobacco products without the permission of the tax administrator and non-taxation, a tax on raw tobacco and monitoring the handling of raw tobacco was introduced as a measure against tax fraud.
Effective from 1. 7. 2015 excise duty is subject to raw tobacco not used or delivered for the manufacture of tobacco products to another Member State or third country or for which origin, purpose of use or person to whom it was not proven or raw tobacco should be supplied.
Restrictions on handling raw tobacco
Measures such as the supervision of transport and production of tobacco products, marking of unit packaging with control tape and sales restrictions at defined locations were added to the restrictions on the handling of raw tobacco.
Production equipment for processing tobacco raw materials and production of tobacco supervisory products by the customs authorities is not subject.
Only a registered person can store raw tobacco for a purpose other than the manufacture of tobacco products, but such tobacco must not be further processed or modified.
The registered person can only be a person fulfilling the personal conditions of the applicant, the statutory authority and the responsible representative, which is valid throughout the period of registration.
The conditions of registration are: (a) authorization to operate a business allowing the activity of a person storing raw tobacco, (b) reliability, (c) debtlessness, (d) the fact that a person stored raw tobacco has not been prohibited from carrying out an activity preventing the activity of his / her activity; (e) the fact that the person stored raw tobacco is not in liquidation or bankruptcy, (f) granting bail of CZK 20 000 (i.e. Approx. 740 000).
Electronic registration must contain the date of receipt or dispensing of raw tobacco, document number, business partner identification, quantity and type of raw tobacco.
Notice of any acquisition of raw tobacco by a registered person storing raw tobacco must be made between 24 and 72 hours before receiving or dispatch.
Business partner data, raw tobacco quantity, storage address, purpose of use and carrier data are reported.
Notice of the expected quantity in the relevant year of raw tobacco received or dispatched raw tobacco shall be submitted by the body together with the registration application or by the end of January of the relevant calendar year.
Notifications are submitted via an electronic data box in PDFa format.
The transport of raw tobacco must be accompanied by a document with the prescribed elements.
Excise tax legislation in SR
The legal framework regulating excise duty area in SR is based on EU legislation, thus co-creating its uniform tax system.
Individual types of excise duties are taxatively determined by the legislation of the SR, which is similar to the legislation of surrounding countries.
Definition of legislation in SR
Legislative adjustment of excise duties is ensured by four laws according to individual subjects of taxation.
Harmonization was achieved by passing the following excise duty laws: Act No. 98/2004 Z. z., on excise duty on mineral oils, law no. 106/2004 Z. z., on excise duty on tobacco products, law no. 530/2011 Z. z., on excise duty on alcoholic beverages, law no. 609/2007 Z. z., about excise duty on electricity, coal and natural gas.
All excise duty laws constitute statutes of material law and deal with taxation of the subject matter in tax territory.
Act No. 563/2009 Z. z., about tax administration (tax order), is a regulation of procedural law, regulates tax management, rights and obligations of tax entities and other persons.
This legal framework transposed the various provisions of Council Directive 2008/118 / EC of 16. December 2008 on general excise duties and repealing Directive 92/12 / EEC and transposed by it as well as the provisions of other directives and legislation European Community.
Structure of amendments to legislation for individual types of excise duties in relation to the subject matter of control in SR
Since 2011, legislation on the management of excise duties has undergone several major changes according to the structure of individual excise duties.
In the EMCS system, monitoring of the transport of selected excise products under excise duty suspension regime was changed from a documentary accompanying administrative document to an exclusively electronic system where these transports are monitored in real time.
Under the EMCS electronic system, the institute of suspending access to tax entities was introduced in 2015
This segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The customs office has the opportunity to suspend access just because of a reasoned fear of the outstanding or undetermined tax on previous taxation periods and its unenforceability.
This applies to the maturity of the tax because the transport of excise goods requires the composition of collateral, which is released by termination of transport.
Excise duty on mineral oils
A fundamental change in the management of the excise duty on mineral oils occurred in 2011, when the option of using the so-called was cancelled. red diesel.
The marked gas oil, commonly called red diesel, was one of the mineral oils.
In the past red diesel has been used for specific law-defined purposes, e.g. in agriculture and its use was favoured by lower excise duty rate.
This change had a positive impact on the income part of the state budget.
The aim of repealing red diesel was to reduce the government deficit, simplify the system of taxation of mineral oils and reduce the administrative burden of the business entities concerned.
In 2012 a new type of tax entity was created, namely the fuel seller.
The purpose of this statutory amendment was to introduce a registration obligation for all gas stations.
Clarity of movement of taxed petrol and diesel is bound to the obligation to buy petrol and diesel from the fuel distributor.
New institutes of fiscal entities were introduced in 2014, namely the distributor of fuels and fuel consumer.
This change contributed to the elimination of tax evasion in petrol and diesel and cleared the movement of these propulsion agents (see Annex No. 4, scheme A).
As part of the fight against tax evasion, lawful provisions on the registration of tax operators dealing with lubrication and essential oils have been extended.
However, in SR these mineral oils are not subject to an indication obligation.
Excise duty on tobacco products
In the fight against tax evasion and monitoring tobacco raw material, the scope of the tobacco law has been expanded and a new tax entity - a tobacco trader was introduced.
Tobacco raw material is not a harmonized tobacco product and its movement is not monitored within the EU.
The obligation to register technological equipment for the production of tobacco products was also introduced.
Legislative brought a new system of ordering, assessment, printing, distribution and use of control signs intended for the labelling of tobacco products.
The check mark is for cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos and tobacco.
Under the new system, the customer of the control stamps must request the customs office to issue inspection marks electronically, via the information system for inspection signs.
This step introduced electronic communication between the tax operator and the tax manager.
One state printer of control signs was established - in Kremnice Mint.
The exercise of tax supervision of the print of inspection signs was also introduced.
Changes have contributed significantly to eliminating tax evasion.
The new system of printing control signs strengthens the system of goods control, because the control mark generates a unique identification number, which can simply be verified whether the goods originate from legal sources.
Unique 8. digit identification number (1.- 2. place is the check sum; 3. place determines whether the code belongs to a check mark or a pack of packages; 4. place is the identifier of the series; 5.- 8. the place is an alphanumeric part of the sequence; 9.- 12. place is a decimal part of the sequence) can also be applied in the form of two dimensional barcode.
The control mark intended for the labelling of cigarettes must further indicate the price of cigarettes, the sign for the validity of the excise duty rate, the number of cigarettes in the packaging and the length of cigarettes.
Excise tax on alcoholic beverages
The biggest legislative change touched alcohol, wine and beer, because the original three materials were abolished and one common law on excise duty on alcoholic beverages.
The law was developed mainly due to the need for a comprehensive solution to the issue of taxation of alcoholic drinks, solutions to their production, movement monitoring, tax provision, as well as the need to improve the business environment in the area, streamline tax administration, reduce administrative burden on small and medium-sized entrepreneurs.
A new way of addressing the issue of taxation of individual types of alcoholic beverages introduced the application of a uniform excise duty rate on an alcoholic drink and took into account the volume percentage of the actual alcohol content.
For non-sparkling wine, sparkling wine and fermented drinks, the volume percentage of the actual alcohol content of the final product is taken into account.
The concentration of beer is also expressed in volume percentages of the actual alcoholic strength of the finished product.
A category of small producer of fermented drinks has been introduced, the essence of exemption from excise duty for a natural person who produces a sparkling fermented drink for their own consumption and for the consumption of their household not exceeding 1 liters per marketing year.
Legislative brought a new system of ordering, assessment, printing, distribution and use of control signs intended for the labelling of the alcohol consumer packaging.
Under the new system, the customer of the control stamps must request the customs office to issue inspection marks electronically, via the information system for inspection signs.
This step introduced electronic communication between the tax operator and the tax manager.
One state printer of control signs was established - in Kremnice Mint.
The exercise of tax supervision of the print of inspection signs was also introduced.
Changes have contributed significantly to the elimination of tax evasion (see Annex No. 4, Scheme B) and elimination of falsification of control signs.
The new system of printing control signs strengthens the system of goods control, because the control mark generates a unique identification number, which can simply be verified whether the goods originate from legal sources.
Unique 8. digit identification number (1.- 2. place is the check sum; 3. place determines whether the code belongs to a check mark or a pack of packages; 4. place is the identifier of the series; 5.- 8. the place is an alphanumeric part of the sequence; 9.- 12. place is a decimal part of the sequence) can also be applied in the form of two dimensional barcode.
Comparison and evaluation
Comparison
Excise taxes on alcohol, mineral oils, tobacco products, beers, wines and intermediates are regulated by one common law in the Czech Republic. 353/2003 Coll.
Solid fuel tax, natural gas tax and some other gases and electricity tax are part of Act No. 261/2007 Coll.
In contrast, in SR, every excise duty is regulated by a special law, except for the excise duty on alcoholic beverages, beer, wine and intermediate products.
Special law regulates excise duty on electricity, coal and natural gas.
In the Czech Republic, since 1. June 1., the issuance of an authorization for the handling of excise products under the excise duty law is conditional, among other things, on the basis of the evidence of the economic stability of the applicants, which the customs authorities verify annually by carrying out a financial analysis.
In SR, a similar form of analysis is carried out only when deciding to abandon or reduce tax security.
FG SR exercises tax supervision in the form of a staff member of the Financial Directorate over the handling of inspection signs for alcohol and tobacco products, their disposal in the printer and their sales to individual customers.
The law provides that the state company Mint Kremnica secures the production of control signs.
The production of tobacco stickers and control bands in the Czech Republic is not introduced in the printer.
Tobacco stickers and control tapes will be taken over from the printer by the designated territorial workplace of the customs office in Kutná Hora.
Tobacco stickers are taken over by their customers at this territorial workplace, control bands for alcohol marking are distributed to individual local tax administrators according to the point of marking.
The legislation of the Czech Republic does not define the manufacturer of tobacco stickers and control bands.
In SR there is an obligation to register technological equipment for the manufacture of tobacco products or parts thereof, such an obligation is not introduced in the Czech Republic.
In the Czech Republic, the tobacco sticker carries excise duty on tobacco products, paid when collecting tobacco stickers at the designated customs office.
On the other hand, the SRR does not contain excise duty on tobacco products.
In the Czech Republic, the refund of excise duty on mineral oils was introduced during the controlled period, in case of their use for primary agricultural plant production, so-called. green diesel.
Since 2017, this tax refund has been extended to animal production.
Such support for farmers is not introduced in SR (existed until 12. 31. 2010 as the so-called. red diesel).
In order to strengthen the fight against tax fraud, a bail of 20 miles was introduced for fuel distributors in the Czech Republic. CZK (i.e. 740 thousand. €).
As a result of the introduction of this measure, the number of fuel distributors decreased from 1 891 entities in 2013 to 174 in 2014 (i.e. decrease by 1 717 tax entities).
In SR, a similar institute of a fuel distributor is introduced, but without making the bail needed to secure the excise duty on mineral oils.
303 distributors registered in SR in 2014 and 407 distributors registered in 2015
The Institute of Fuel Vendor and Fuel Consumer is introduced in SR, which is issued by the local competent customs office.
There is no such institute in the Czech Republic.
In the Czech Republic, selected mineral oils and some other mineral oils are subject to markings, in SR after the cancellation of the so-called. red diesel labelling of mineral oils is not applied.
In the Czech Republic, the alcohol marking control tape contains an eight-digit individual code used to verify the origin of alcohol and a-digit registration code, indicating the spirit drink, according to which the control belt registration is kept.
The destruction, loss and return of the control tape shall be registered on the following working day.
The belt holder is obliged to notify their use within the same period.
In the SR, the control mark intended for the marking of alcohol in the consumer packaging contains a unique-digit identification number, which is communicated once a month to the tax administrator and serves to verify the authenticity of the check mark.
The registration contains the number of checks collected, used and relics.
The Czech Republic and the SR instituted compulsory registrations, or. alcohol distributor's registration.
In SR, registration is subject to compliance with conditions bound, inter alia, to a storage area exceeding 200 m2; annual turnover from the sale of a consumer packaging alcohol at least 100 000 or paid basic property of at least 100 €; minimum number 10 employees.
In the Czech Republic, the acquisition of registration is conditional, among other things, on the basis of a deposit of CZK 5 000 (i.e. 185 000) for the benefit of the tax administrator for the entire period of validity of registration.
This segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In SR, the permanent presence of the tax administrator is required in the production of alcohol not only in the consumer packaging.
In the Czech Republic, a special form of registration of a person compulsory to sign alcohol with the condition of the deposit for the benefit of the tax administrator from 100 000 CZK (i.e. 3 700) up to 000 5 (i.e. 185 000) according to the quantity of control bands collected and installation of a tracking device with continuous access by the tax manager.
Evaluation
The legislation of the Czech Republic and the SR exceeds the EU minimum requirements for the subject matter and management of excise duties and responds to identified risks from other Member States and to the risks identified in tax areas.
Legislative changes adopted during the controlled period allow tax administrators to prevent possible tax evasion from developing.
In the Czech Republic and SR to combat tax evasion in the form of abuse of tobacco raw material (e.g. leaves) an excise duty on raw tobacco or raw tobacco has been introduced beyond EU legislation. tobacco materials.
Although raw tobacco and tobacco are not a harmonized tobacco product, the Czech Republic and SR monitor their movement.
NKÚ Czech Republic and NKÚ SR can recommend that this measure be applied in other EU Member States.
Good practice in the Czech Republic demonstrated that the examination of economic stability in applicants for authorization under the Excise Tax Act has been successful because it reduces the risks of tax arrears.
For this reason both control institutions recommend applying such verification also in the conditions of the SR.
Distribution of control stamps is more effective in SR than in the Czech Republic, because it does not burden customs authorities with costs related to transport between printer and customer of control bands and tobacco stickers.
The financial management of the SR has a better overview of the existence and location of technological equipment for the production of tobacco products.
However, the collection of tobacco products tax is more effective in the Czech Republic, because the order of tobacco stickers itself is a tax return with subsequent tax payment.
The financial management in the SR has improved overview of the places of fuel sales due to the introduction of the institutes of ' fuel seller ' and ' fuel consumer '.
The introduction of compulsory marking of mineral oils in the Czech Republic makes it easier to control the abuse of mineral oils with a reduced tax rate or. tax exempt.
A new control tape was introduced in the Czech Republic (2013) and in SR (2014). a sign containing an identification code.
The control tape in the Czech Republic also contains a registration code, while in the SR the new legislation has dropped its introduction.
Impacts cannot yet be evaluated due to the short effectiveness of legislative changes.
The introduction of effective labelling of the consumer packaging of alcohol by a control mark or the tape is an effective measure to combat tax evasion.
NKÚ SR and NKÚ Czech Republic can recommend the introduction of this control measure in other Member States.
SR's attitude towards the conditions for distribution of alcohol characterizes a proclient approach that does not block tax entities funds.
On the other hand, the Czech Republic's approach is rather restrictive because it introduces bail burden on tax entities cash flow, but reduces the risk of tax arrears more.
Development of excise tax revenue
Excise tax is an indirect tax imposed by the state to increase state budget revenue and also regulate the quantity of goods sold, which is considered harmful to individuals and / or to the company (tax regulatory function).
According to the Commission Communication: EUROPE 2020-Strategy for smart and sustainable growth promoting inclusion of 3. 3. under the flagship initiative Europe less resource demanding is the European Commission's intention to improve the framework for using market-based instruments, MJ. in the form of a revision of energy taxation focusing on reducing energy and resources consumption.
In order to fulfil the EK's intention, Member States should try to shift tax burden from the workforce, among other things, to energy and ecological taxation.
The collection of tax revenue from excise taxes in the Czech Republic and SR includes excise duties on mineral oils, tobacco products, alcohol, beer, wines and intermediate products, natural gas, solid fuels and electricity.
The share of excise taxes in total tax revenue and the share of GDP is monitored, inter alia. Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
The two top control institutions used the following selection criteria to enter the query on the OECD website.
Excise tax collection in connection with macroeconomic indicators in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, the share of excise taxes in total tax revenue and the share of GDP according to OECD data decreased slightly.
The European Central Bank's course of the ECB was used to convert the amounts in CZK to € 12. 31. of the relevant year.
The nominal course of CZK vis-).-vis).-vis).-vis).-vis).-vis).-vis).-vis).-vis).-vis 2013
The reason was mainly the monetary policy decision of the CNB banking council of 7. November 20136.
Results of excise tax debit, excise duty rates and per capita income in € decreased significantly due to the exchange rate difference.
A significant reduction in the 2014 excise duty share was caused by a one-time outage of excise duty income on tobacco products due to the impact of the new legislation limiting the sale of old tax tobacco products.
The share of excise taxes is also influenced by the increase in income tax recovery, which has increased significantly due to the improved overall economic situation of the Czech Republic.
The total excise duty collection has the largest share of excise duty on mineral oils (about 55,7 % in 2015) but despite significant growth of the economy against 2012, it fell.
The debit of excise duty on mineral oils in 2013 and 2014 was significantly lower than in 2012 and 2015, although registration of fuel distributors was introduced as a measure against tax fraud.
The trend of ecologically economical vehicles and biofuels is negatively reflected in the tax revenue.
A negligible share of natural gas tax, solid fuel tax and electricity tax, which is caused by a low tax rate compared to the surrounding countries, which is close to the minimum rates established by the EU.
If there is no increase in tariffs, their share will in the future with regard to the ever-decreasing energy performance of buildings and production processes.
The collection of excise duty on alcohol in 2013 and 2014 was negatively affected by the reverberation of a large case of tax fraud consisting of putting taxless alcohol, alcohol containing methanol or insufficiently denatured alcohol into circulation in the form of spirit drinks.
In 2015, after taking a series of measures against such action and after reviving the liquor market, excise duty excise duty on alcohol exceeded 4 miles. €.
The share of tobacco product tax increased due to increasing rates.
The basic excise duty rates changed between 2012-2015 for the tobacco product tax, where the rate increased mainly due to the compliance of Council Directive 2011/64 / EU, on the structure and rates of excise duty on tobacco products.
Due to the currency intervention of CNB, the real rate of excise duty in €, apart from tobacco product tax, has dropped significantly. For tobacco products, it has risen slightly.
In relation to price growth, GDP or standard of living, the indexation of the excise duty rate is not set, so the function of excise duties consisting of regulation of socially problematic activities does not have to be fulfilled.
With the economic growth of the Czech Republic and the growth of living standards, real excise tax rates are decreasing.
7 Indexation - automatic adjustment of a certain economic quantity about inflation, this adjustment is based on a law or contract (for pensions paid by the state is called ad valorization).
Excise tax collection in connection with macroeconomic indicators in SR
In the current legislation of excise duties in SR, the indexation of the amount of excise duty rates is not solved on the evolution of consumer prices, because they are fixed.

Of all excise duties introduced in Slovakia, the largest share of the year-round tax revenue of the state budget has excise duty on mineral oils, with its share not falling below 52 % throughout the controlled period.
The second largest share is the excise duty on tobacco products.
On average, this tax accounts for around 32 % of the total excise tax collection.
Between 2012 and 2015 there was a growth in excise duty per capita of SR.
This development is due to an increase in the rates of excise taxes on tobacco products, higher acquisitions and higher population consumption in a given year.
The growth of excise tax debit per SR is constant and corresponds to the development of excise duty rates on tobacco products, higher purchasing capacity and higher consumption of the population in a given year.
In the Czech Republic, the reduction in income in € per capita is affected by CNB intervention in the currency rate of the crown against the euro.
The difference between the Czech Republic and SR in the total collection from the SPD is due mainly to the collection of excise duty on mineral oils and tobacco products, which is about 2,7 times in the Czech Republic or. 2,8 times higher, however, per one inhabitant of the Czech Republic is only about 1/3. higher for these selected products.
The cause is the lower price of these selected products in the Czech Republic due to lower excise rates in the Czech Republic and the CZK course against vůči for foreign consumers.
For mineral oil tax, the cause is also greater transit through the Czech Republic and cross-border purchases.
In the case of tax on tobacco products, growing foreign tourism to the Czech Republic and cross-border purchases have a negligible influence.
The evaluation of the real rate of excise duty in the Czech Republic due to CNB interventions decreased.
The share of energy taxes in the Czech Republic and SR in total tax revenue does not rise and there is no diverting from taxation of work to taxation of consumption of selected products subject to excise duties, which is not in line with EU strategies.
However, the amount of excise duty achieved is permanently above average compared to the OECD average.
The total excise tax debit is mainly influenced by changes in excise duty rates, economic condition and the behavior of the population.
Future excise tax recovery outages due to environmental measures subsidized by the state in various forms will need to be replaced by other revenue or reducing state spending.
The fact that the indexation of excise duty rates is not introduced in the Czech Republic and SR, their regulatory functions decrease and the EU's aims of less dependent on ecologically unfriendly resources and reducing alcohol and tobacco addiction.
The higher excise duty per capita in the Czech Republic shows higher consumption of selected products by foreign consumers, which is affected by the lower total price of selected products in €.
Administrative expenses of excise duties
The effectiveness of administrative costs reflects the relationship between spending and income related to the management of excise duties, i.e. Expresses the amount of expenditure for 100 units of revenue (CZK, €).
The higher the resulting value, the worse the effectiveness of administrative costs is.
The effectiveness of the tax manager in tax management affects the competence and organisational arrangement of the tax manager, management of the organization, the legal environment and the level of electronization of individual activities.
Determination of the effectiveness of administrative costs of tax management by the method of conversion rate is based on the number of employees involved in the management of excise duties in the liner-controlled structure.
In the Czech Republic, the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, which is an independent organizational component of the state and an entity.
In the Slovak Republic, the Finance Administration of the Slovak Republic ensures tax management, with customs authorities being an internal organisational unit, costs and revenue being included in the whole organisational unit.
Therefore, due to the possibility of comparing the efficiency of the management of excise duties in the calculation of the effectiveness of administrative costs, the costs and revenue of the Financial Administration of the Czech Republic were also included.
Administrative costs of the management of excise duties in the Czech Republic
The management of excise duties is a complex of administrative tasks performed mainly by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.

Administrative costs of excise duty management in SR
The Slovak Republic's Financial Directorate has undergone a demanding transformation process in accordance with the approved UNITAS programme since 1.
The creation of the FR SR also reflected on the composition of employees of the newly formed customs and tax administration.
In connection with the performance of excise duty management, the activities related to the management of excise duties within the organisational structure of the FD SR were integrated into a larger number of different sections and related unions.
Finance Directorate of the Slovak Republic Customs and Fiscal: SR Excise Duty Department (all-Slovak competence):
excise duty separation - directs and coordinates activities in the field of excise duty management; draws up professional opinions; presents proposals and comments on legislative changes; gives decisions on delegation of local jurisdiction to tax entities; allocates and abolishes registration numbers;
the tax oversight separation - directs and coordinates activities in the field of tax oversight and tax control; exercises tax oversight;
separation of ELO and SPD systems - directs and coordinates mutual administrative cooperation activities in the field of excise duties, including the exchange of information through SEED and MVS systems; ensures management and updates in SysNeD and EMCS application equipment;
separation of control signs - directs printing and handling control signs activities; exercises tax supervision of loading and liquidation of print sheets and check signs in the printer.
Vice president's department of financial administration
Excise and Customs Response Department (all-Slovak):
separation of excise duty remedies - reviewing decisions by customs offices on the basis of proper and extraordinary remedies applied; appeals procedure at second stage of the decision making process.
The section of the customs offices was established during 2012; underneath it was directly incorporated by individual customs offices (9 customs offices), which have territorial competence destined by higher territorial units, except for one customs office, which was established, among others. for the purpose of carrying out tasks in connection with the external border of the Community.
Customs offices:
excise duty separation - exercise of methodological activity in relation to branches of customs offices and to customs offices; selected entities carry out direct duties by the tax administrator, which decides on registration (tax warehouse, entitled recipient repeatedly, registered consignor), the amount of tax security, determines and reimburses tax, exercises tax oversight and tax control; decides to waive the composition of tax security; decides to waive the obligation to secure the presence of an employee of the customs office in the tax warehouse on alcohol;
separation of legal - decision-making activity in the case of non-tax law; activities related to proper and exceptional remedies; tax execution proceedings;
the branch of the customs office - decides on registration (except for the tax warehouse, entitled recipient for repeated acceptance, registered consignor), on the amount of security of the tax; prescribes and returns tax; exercises tax oversight and tax control; decides on security and forfeiture of goods;
customs office station - the exercise of tax oversight of the holding and movement of excise goods; ensures the performance of permanent tax oversight in the alcohol tax warehouse; decides on security and forfeiture of goods.
SR's financial management costs on excise duty management are constantly increasing, as with the exception of wage growth, investments for effective tax management and financial management electronization increase.
Although excise tax revenue grew, spending increased faster due to IT adjustments related to UNITAS project.
Salary expenses in SR are significantly influenced by the performance of permanent tax oversight in tax warehouses on alcohol, which the Czech Republic does not apply.
Expenditure of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic on the management of excise duties increased significantly between 2012 and 2015 in 2015, this growth was mainly due to increased wage spending and technical support costs.
In the Czech Republic, excise tax revenue grew at approximately the same rate.
Wages in the Czech Republic are positively influenced by wider customs duties, e.g. weighing trucks, check on the fulfillment of myth duties.
The effectiveness of administrative costs in SR shows a slightly worsening trend year-round.
The number of employees did not change significantly, but the spending was growing per employee.
Also in the Czech Republic, the number of employees has not changed significantly, but the costs per employee compared to the SR grew slower.
Evaluation
In the Czech Republic and in SR, an important factor is the deteriorated effectiveness of administrative spending, which can be evaluated as natural developments.
In both countries, maintaining significant administrative demanding in the management of excise duties is a negative factor, confirming the non-decreasing number of employees in the field of excise duty management.
However, in SR, the management of excise duties with lower incomes is significantly more demanding for staff capacities.
Performance indicators for the management of excise duties
Excise tax management is a set of activities aimed at correct identifying, determining and securing the payment of tax.
The main processes in the management of excise duties are taxation, permissions and registration for activity, transport oversight, inspection and search of tax entities.
The number of administrative tasks and managed entities are indicators of the tax manager's performance.
The relationship between the observed indicator and the number of tax administrators expresses the effectiveness of the tax manager's activity and defines the cost of a particular activity.
Authorisations and registration for activity are a fundamental prerequisite for the handling of selected products for commercial purposes and transport them under a tax exemption scheme.
The tax administrator is obliged to exercise a systematic administration with a focus on supervision of the legislation and conditions laid down by the tax administrator, for which adequate personnel resources must be allocated.
The observed indicator was the number of valid permits or registration for activity on 31. December of each year.
The number of permits or registrations issued is not identical to the number of tax entities.
Administrative actions are specific administrative acts in the matter.
The monitored administrative actions are the frequency of the most important tasks of the tax administrator (tax claim, transport administration in EMCS), or activities that are the sequence of actions completed by a report or decision.

Performance indicators in SR
Authorization and registration for activity in SR
Excise tax management in SR is mainly provided by customs offices and excise duty department of the Customs and tax FD SR, whose excise duty management procedure is governed by individual excise duty laws and tax rules.
These laws define not only the scope of the authorization for CÚ and FR SR for the management of excise duties, but also the rights and obligations of tax entities in connection with registration or payment of excise duty.
The largest annual increase in tax entities (by 234 %) was recorded in 2012 and 2013, due to an increase in tax warehouses licenses issued, an increase in the authorized recipient's registration for recruitment and registration of a large number of user companies.
Legislative has clarified the transport of some bulk mineral oils, as well as the notification requirement if transported freely or. in packaging with a content of more than 150 liters or. 230 liters and also extended the list of mineral oils under control and transport procedure with other goods, e.g. o anti-engine knocking products, oxidation inhibitors, bituminous inhibitors, viscosity improvement products, anti-corrosion products.
For lubricating oils, a compulsory indication of their kinematic viscosity was introduced.
Approaching the registration process for selected tax entities within the meaning of national legislation in SR is specified in the following parts of the document.
Tax warehouse operator
Under the national legislation of the SR when registering the operator of the tax warehouse within all excise duty items, the person who wants to operate the tax warehouse must also apply for registration and issuance of a permit for the operation of the tax warehouse.
The resulting decision in the registration process is the registration certificate for the relevant excise duty, which the tax warehouse operator acquires legal personality for all tax warehouses.
At the same time, CÚ will issue a permit to operate a tax warehouse, which authorizes the operator of the tax warehouse to manufacture, process, store, receive or dispatch selected products under the tax exemption scheme.
In case the tax warehouse operator has tax warehouses in several places, the tax manager will issue a separate permit for each tax warehouse to operate a tax warehouse.
Transportation of the subject matter under the suspension regime is monitored electronically via EMCS.
A unique reference code is generated for each transport, called.
ARC code under which you can monitor the transport on-line and therefore in real time.
If the operator of the tax warehouse is also a person entitled to distribute alcohol, he is required to notify by electronic means CÚ the commercial name of the packaging of alcohol, volume and volume concentration of alcohol in the consumer packaging and the barcode EAN for each new type of consumer packaging that is placed in free tax circulation, no later than the date of its introduction.
Registered sender
Registered consignor is a special type of tax entity that cannot be registered as a tax warehouse operator at the same time, even if he sends an excise duty subject to the excise duty regime after his release for free circulation.
Under the national legislation of the SR, when registered consignor for all excise duties, a person wishing to dispatch an object of excise duty under the suspension procedure after his release for the customs procedure ′′ free circulation ′′ must also apply for registration and issue of CÚ authorization to dispatch the subject matter of excise duty under this scheme.
CÚ issuing a certificate of registration for the relevant excise duty and at the same time issuing an authorization to dispatch an object of excise duty under the suspension exemption regime after its entry into the customs procedure ′′ free circulation ".
Grower's brandy
The basic act for the operation of growing brandy is to obtain permission to produce alcohol in a distillery plant from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.
However, the Ministry's authorization itself does not entitle the holder of the permit to operate a growing burner.
In order for a person to operate a growing branding machine, he must submit an application for registration and issuance of a certificate of registration of the operator of the growing plant.
CÚ shall issue a certificate of registration for the relevant excise duty, which also authorizes the producer of the growing brandy to produce alcohol in the growing brandy.
The purpose of growing brandy is to provide services to growers.
Growing brandy can't be a tax stock.
The legislator allows alcohol produced in the growing brandy to apply a reduced tax rate of 50 % on the basic tax rate, i.e. 540 € / hl a.
The reduced tax rate shall apply to alcohol produced in a growing breeder of not more than 43 l and. per grower and household for one production season in tax territory.
The production period lasts from 1. 7. of the current year to 30. of the following year.
The production period is not the same as the calendar year and therefore, within one calendar year, a reduced tax rate can be applied to the produced alcohol multiple times, because the alcohol is produced in two manufacturing periods.
This is the production of alcohol outside the tax exemption regime, which means in practice that the alcohol produced is in free tax circulation.
The grower will pay the growers not only excise tax and value added tax, but also the price for the services provided.
Growing moonshine will issue a removal certificate to the grower, which serves not only as proof of origin and method of acquisition of alcohol, but also of payment of excise duty.
Transport of alcohol thus produced is not subject to monitoring by the tax manager.
Importer of the consumer packaging
National legislation enables persons who intend to import a consumer packaging of alcohol or cigarettes from a third state and put it into free tax circulation in tax territory, to ask CÚ to be included in the registration of importers of consumer packaging.
The importer of the consumer packaging does not register for the relevant excise duty, but CÚ gives him a certificate of inclusion in the registration of importers of the consumer packaging.
This certificate authorizes the importer to import a consumer packaging of alcohol or a consumer packaging of cigarettes from the territory of a third state.
At the same time, before issuing the checks marks, they must provide a tax guarantee for the amount of alcohol or cigarettes it wants to put into free tax circulation.
The importer of the consumer packaging must introduce into free tax circulation only the packaging marked by the inspection mark.
Therefore, they must present to the customs office of export the number and identification number of the inspection marks exported to the territory of the third State.
On importation, the importer is required to confirm the number of inspection marks imported back from the territory of the third State by the customs office of importation.
The importer shall proceed with the import of the consumer packaging in the sense of customs legislation, where the amount of excise duty is also included in the customs debt.
In case of the release of the consumer packaging into free tax circulation, the compound tax guarantee will be refunded to the importer or it can be used to pay the customs debt.
The importer of the consumer packaging is not in stock.
If the importer of the consumer packaging of alcohol is also entitled to distribute alcohol, he is obliged to notify electronically oběhu the commercial name of the consumer packaging of alcohol, volume and volume concentration of alcohol in the alcohol consumer packaging and the barcode EAN for each new type of consumer packaging which he puts into free tax circulation, no later than the day of its introduction.
Salesman of consumer packaging alcohol in free tax circulation
Due to the monitoring of alcohol movement in free tax circulation and the elimination of tax evasion by the legislator, the new tax institute has introduced the consumer packaging of alcohol.
A person who wants to hold a licence for sale must ask CÚ for a licence and fulfil legal conditions (business licence for business; integrity in relation to intentional economic offences; has not been withdrawn for years of sale; not in liquidation not even in auditions).
Since it is a consumer packaging of alcohol in free tax circulation, no accompanying document is required when transporting these goods.
To demonstrate the way the consumer packaging is acquired, e.g. an invoice that also contains the number of the holder of the distribution authorization.
The holder of the authorization shall, for each establishment, register for the calendar month, the number of accepted pieces of consumer packaging of alcohol, the number of products issued, the quantity of alcohol in consumer packaging, the state of alcohol stocks in consumer packaging on the last day of the month, and the registration of manka or surplus in the number of alcohol received and issued I'm sorry.
The holder of the authorization is obliged to buy alcohol in the consumer packaging or otherwise collect only from the person entitled to distribute during the business.
Distributor of the consumer packaging alcohol
Due to monitoring alcohol movement in free tax circulation and eliminating tax evasion of the legislature, the new tax institute introduced a distributor of the consumer packaging of alcohol.
A person who intends to hold a distribution permit must ask CÚ to issue a distribution licence.
Applicant must meet legal conditions (business licence for business; storage area exceeds 200 m2); annual turnover from the sale of consumer packaging alcohol at least 100 000 € or paid basic property of at least 100 €; minimum number of 000 počet 10 employees; no arrears against the customs office; no arrears on compulsory levies; integrity in relation to intentional economic offences; not withdrawn for ten years; not in liquidation or bankruptcy).

For example, it is sufficient to demonstrate how to acquire a consumer packaging of alcohol. an invoice that also contains the number of the holder of the distribution authorization.
The holder of the distribution authorization shall, for each establishment, register for the number of alcohol packages received, number of pieces of consumer packaging, quantity of alcohol issued, alcohol stocks in the consumer packaging on the last day of the month, and registration of manka or surplus in the number of accepted and issued consumers packaging of alcohol.
The holder of the distribution authorization is obliged to buy alcohol in the consumer packaging only from another person entitled to distribute.
The distributor shall inform the data for each calendar month electronically within the 25. th day of the following calendar month.
Fuel reseller
Due to monitoring of fuel in free tax circulation, as well as tax evasion elimination, a new type of tax entity has been introduced, namely the seller of fuel.
There is no special regulation on the gas station in SR territory.
That's why gas stations in the national SR legislation are employed as fuel sellers.
A person who wants to sell petrol, diesel or LPG for final consumption in the free taxation of petrol, diesel or LPG for final consumption in the course of a business activity in the tax territory, must ask CÚ for a sale permit before starting the sale and present a document showing that the storage facility is verified and equipped with an appropriate verified measuring device allowing the amount of mineral oil to be measured when receiving and dispensing and the tank must comply with technical standards.
If the tax warehouse operator is a tax warehouse operator, a licensed recipient or a registered consignor, CÚ shall also issue licences to registered persons for the sale of fuel.
The seller of propulsion is obliged, among other legal obligations, to keep the registration of purchased and sold petrol, diesel or LPG for the calendar month and is also required to inform oznámit of a new supplier (distributor) of fuel.
The seller of fuel is legally obliged to buy or otherwise collect fuel only from a distributor of fuel or from a registered person.
Since these are fuels in free tax circulation, the accompanying document is not required when transporting these goods.
However, when supplying fuel through auto-sanitary, the distributor prints the so-called seller when overdrafts are overdrafted. bottler from a measuring device built in the auto-store.
This document shall include, in addition to quantity, the date and time of delivery and the registration number of the car assigned by the traffic inspectorate.
For example, it is enough to demonstrate the method of acquisition of fuel an invoice that also contains the number of the fuel distributor assigned by the tax manager.
The tax manager in the territory of the SR during the tax oversight of mineral oils records tax evasion related to the transport of this type of goods.
First of all, it is an effort to avoid road checks during transport, so carriers use side roads, circumvent the toll selection system due to more difficult monitoring of actual transports.
Transportation of mineral oils in rebuilt tankers with double day are also being carried out.
Many times illegal transportation is accompanied by a vehicle that carriers report possible mobile patrols to change the route and avoid road control.
Fuel mixing with light fuel oils or. waste oils.
Fuel Distributor
Due to monitoring of fuel in free tax circulation as well as to eliminate tax evasion, a new type of tax entity has been introduced, namely a distributor of fuel.
A person who intends to distribute petrol, diesel or LPG in the free circulation in the tax territory of a business activity shall apply to the customs office for distribution prior to distribution and present a document demonstrating that the storage facility is verified and equipped with appropriate verified measurements equipment as well as list of suppliers and customers.
Distributor of fuels is obliged, among other legal obligations, to keep records of purchased and sold petrol, diesel or LPG for a calendar month for each establishment.
The fuel distributor is legally obliged to buy or otherwise collect fuel only from a fuel distributor or from a registered person.
The fuel distributor can sell only to the fuel distributor, registered person or fuel consumer in tax territory.
However, when supplying fuel through the auto-ester, the distributor prints the propulsion agents or sellers during overdrafts. fuel consumer, so called. bottler from a measuring device built in the auto-store.
This document shall include, in addition to quantity, the date and time of delivery and the registration number of the car assigned by the traffic inspectorate.
Since these are free tax circulation propulsions, no accompanying document is required for the transport of these goods.
For example, it is enough to demonstrate the method of acquisition of fuel invoice, which also contains the number of the fuel distributor, or. registered persons, assigned by tax administrator.
Fuel Consumer
Special status in national legislation is the consumer of fuel.
A person who purchases gasoline, diesel or LPG in free tax circulation and stores this mineral oil in a storage facility with a volume of 15 liters or more, shall notify the customs office of this fact no later than before first place in the storage facility.
The customs office shall include the fuel consumer in the registration.
In addition to legal facts, the address of the location of the storage facility is obliged to indicate.
In practice these are large transport companies, cooperatives, bus companies, road construction companies and other entities.
The storage device shall be verified and equipped with measuring devices enabling the amount of propulsion (stavor, specific bar) to be measured at the time of arrival and dispensing.
The tank must comply with technical standards.
The fuel consumer must buy fuels only from the fuel distributor or from a registered person.
Since these are free tax circulation propulsions, no accompanying document is required during transportation.
However, when supplying fuel via auto-stern, the distributor prints the so-called consumer when overdrafts are overdrafted. bottler from a measuring device built in the auto-store.
This document shall include, in addition to quantity information, the date and time of delivery and the registration number of the car assigned by the traffic inspectorate.
For example, it is enough to demonstrate the method of acquisition of fuel an invoice that also contains the number of the fuel distributor assigned by the tax manager.
The tax manager in the territory of the SR during the tax oversight of mineral oils records tax evasion related to the transport of this type of goods.
Small independent brewery
The operator of a small independent brewery is a person who produces beer in the business and meets legal conditions.
Subject to compliance with the conditions laid down by law, a small independent brewery can apply a reduced tax rate, i.e. 2,652 € per hl / percentage of actual alcohol content.
Annual beer production is limited to quantity up to 200 000 hl beer.
Since beer production is outside the tax exemption regime, transportation is not required because it is in free tax circulation.
A small independent brewery cannot be a tax stock.
In practice, they are small family businesses, which also operate restaurants or bars in which they offer beer of their own production for sale.
Administrative operations in SR
This subcap brings the tax supervision of excise tax management to selected tax entities within the meaning of national legislation in SR.
The largest annual increase in administrative operations (by 5,3 %) was recorded between 2012 and 2013, caused by more traffic in the EMCS system.
On the other hand, the biggest decrease was recorded annually in 2014, up to 4,3 % due to a smaller number of tax checks ended and a smaller number of tax returns filed.
The decrease was about legislative changes.
Tax checks
Through the execution of the daňové tax control, it detects or examines facts that are decisive for the correct determination of the tax.
Zaměstnanci staff shall be demonstrated during the exercise of tax inspection by a delegation to carry out a tax check, including, among other things, the purpose and subject matter of the control and extent of the taxation period controlled.
In practice, this means that the controlled taxation period can be one month, but also more taxation periods.
The scope of the taxation period controlled is determined by CÚ
Tax check starts with writing a tax check registration.
Převzetí receipt confirms the receipt.
The borrowed documents are required to return vrátit within 30 days of the end of the tax check.
The Zaměstnanec employee will draw up a protocol from the tax check.
If the tax check determines the difference in the sum paid by the inspected tax body, declared or claimed by the tax refund, CÚ together with the protocol to the controlled tax body, the shall also send a call for comments on the findings set out in the protocol.
The tax check is terminated on the date of delivery of the protocol.
The deadline for carrying out the tax check shall be no more than one year from the date of its start.
Tax checks on registered persons and selected registered persons shall be performed as necessary, but at least once before the date of the right to fix tax, which is 5 years.
FG SR issued an internal management act adjusting the above mentioned deadlines due to the uniform procedure of the tax manager in the territory of the SR.
Local inquiries
Local investigation is the activity of the tax administrator, where he sought evidence, examines and examines the facts needed for tax management purposes.
The místním employee will write a registration and give his copy to the tax agency about the local investigation.
During the operation of a local investigation, the zaměstnanec employee has the right to unlimited access to land, to operational buildings, to rooms and places including means of transport, transport packaging and to accounting documents.
Recognition of the quantity of alcohol produced shall be made in the form of a local investigation.
The facts found are the basis for the exercise of the tax check.
Also, in the case of local investigation, CÚ is entitled to take samples as well as to secure the matter.
FR SR issued an internal management act regulating the performance of tax oversight and local investigation for individual excise duty subjects to unification of the procedures of the tax administrator.
Permanent tax oversight in tax warehouses for alcohol
The Slovak Republic's accession to the European Union on 1. June 5. also made a change in the field of excise duty management.
The need for more efficient spending of state budget funds in the management of alcohol excise duty, improving the business environment in the area and introducing legislative tools for more effective repression of the grey economy in the area resulted in the adoption of new laws in connection with the management of excise taxes in 2004
One of the measures brought by the new legislative amendment was not only the transition of the tax administrator in the field of excise duty management from tax authorities to customs offices, but also the introduction of the need for the tax administrator's presence in the tax warehouse to alcohol.
In the territory of SR, national legislation taxatively defines that it is possible to accept, issue, manufacture or process alcohol in tax warehouse only in the presence of a zaměstnance employee.
This does not apply to a tax warehouse that receives, stores or sends alcohol only in the packaging of alcohol.
At the same time, CÚ is obliged to secure employees in tax storage so that income, dispensing, production or processing of alcohol is not limited.
The operator of the tax warehouse has an obligation to secure the conditions of the working environment for pro employees.
Based on a contract concluded with FŘ SR for the premises provided monthly, CÚ pays the tax warehouse operator the rental costs.
In the tax warehouse for the manufacture, processing or storage of alcohol, the manufacturing plant for storage of alcohol must be adapted so that at any time the quantity of alcohol produced, processed alcohol, stored alcohol, including stocks of alcohol and alcohol contained therein can be detected.
This segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
If alcohol is not accepted, issued, produced or processed in the tax warehouse, the customs office may waive the obligation to secure the presence of an employee of the customs office, which is required to secure the space by closure of the customs office.
However, in practice, this option is not often used because tax warehouse operators use the continuous presence of a customs office employee to their advantage.
Some tax warehouse operators use the legal option within the meaning of Law No. 467/2002 Z. z., about the production and marketing of alcohol, and they use production equipment for the production of alcohol in distillery for growing burning and also for the purposes of distillery for distillates, which must be in tax storage.
Performance of permanent tax oversight in alcohol tax warehouses ensures approximately 250 customs officers.
Issue of vouchers for the collection of check signs for alcohol
The basic action for the collection of control signs is to send an application to the customs office for the allocation of registration number and issuing a voucher for the collection of control signs for alcohol.
Alcoholic drink, which is alcohol, means goods of the Combined Nomenclature 2207 and 2208 with an actual alcoholic strength exceeding 1,2 % volume.
The control mark is intended for the designation of the consumer packaging of alcohol.
A closed consumer packaging of alcohol, filled with alcohol intended for direct human consumption, is considered to be a consumer packaging of alcohol.
Consumer packaging of the Combined Nomenclature code 2207 and 2208 can only be put into free tax circulation on tax territory if it is marked with a control mark.
Only the operator of the tax warehouse, the beneficiary and the importer of the consumer packaging can mark the consumer's packaging with a control mark with a control mark.
The check mark contains, inter alia. an identification number consisting of a 14 digit character. The identification number contains the registration number (1.- 6. instead of the numeric character), alcohol volume (7.- 11. instead of the numeric character) and the volume concentration of alcohol in the consumer package (12.- 14. place of the numeric sign).
Original model of control sign for alcohol:
The registration number shall allocate. to each customer a check mark separately.
Only a check mark whose identification number corresponds to the volume of the consumer packaging, volume concentration of alcohol in the consumer packaging and customer's control mark may be used to indicate the consumer packaging.
National legislation at the end of 2014 brought the introduction of a new information system of control signs.
The aim of the new information system of control signs was to simplify and informatize the ordering, assessment, printing, distribution and use of control signs intended for the labelling of consumer packaging alcohol.
Only the tax warehouse operator, the beneficiary, the beneficiary, the importer of the consumer packaging and the recipient (s) of alcohol can mark the consumer packaging.
A customer of the control marks who wants to collect checks under the 'new system' must request the customs office to issue inspection signs electronically.
Through the electronic system, the customer of control signs is obliged to request their release, report data resulting from national legislation of SR and keep the registration of control signs.
The number of ordered pieces of inspection stamps must not be less than 500 pieces or multiple of them.
The tax administrator also communicates with customer of control signs via the electronic system of control signs, especially when notifying the number of control signs that the customer of the control signs can remove or. when determining the deadline for taking control signs by the customer of the inspection stamps in the printer.
The customer of the inspection stamps shall, before taking over the checks marks, put funds corresponding to the price of the control stamps he can withdraw and the quantity of which the customs office will inform him of.
The price of the check mark takes into account the amount of printer substitutes. However, it does not take into account the amount of excise duty.
The control mark is entitled to print the state company Mint Kremnice.
FŘ SR exercises tax oversight of handling and disposal of the control marks in the printer.
FG SR is required to ensure the presence of a staff member of the financial directorate in the printer when handling the checks marks.
FŘ SR guarantees the sale of control signs to the customer of the printer's check stamps.
Control signs can be removed only in the printer from the employee of the Financial Directorate.
Issue of vouchers for the collection of control signs for tobacco products
The customer of the check mark must ask CÚ to allocate registration number and issue a voucher for the inspection stamp.
Consumer packaging of cigarettes can only be put into free tax circulation when marked with a check mark.
It is only possible to mark the consumer packaging of cigarettes with a check mark in the cigarette producing business.
Only the operator of the tax warehouse, a licensed recipient or tobacco importer who wants to put tobacco products into free tax circulation in the tax territory may be the customer of the checks marks.
Only a check mark whose data correspond to the price of cigarettes, the number of cigarettes in the package, the length of cigarettes, the validity of the tax rate and the registration number can be used to indicate the consumer packaging of cigarettes.
Consumer packaging of cigarettes can be sold for final consumption only at the price shown on the check mark.
National legislation at the end of 2014 brought the introduction of a new information system of control signs.
The aim of the new inspection sign information system was to simplify and informatize the system ordering, assessment, printing, distribution and use of control signs intended for the designation of consumer packaging of tobacco, cigars, cigarillos and cigarettes.
A customer of the control marks who wants to collect checks under the 'new system' must request the customs office to issue inspection signs electronically.
Through the electronic system, the customer of control signs is obliged to request their release, report data resulting from national legislation of SR and keep the registration of control signs.
The control mark is entitled to print the state company Mint Kremnice.
FŘ SR exercises tax oversight of handling and disposal of the control marks in the printer.
FG SR is required to ensure the presence of a staff member of the financial directorate in the printer when handling the checks marks.
FŘ SR guarantees the sale of control signs to the customer of the printer's check stamps.
Control signs can be removed only in the printer from the employee of the Financial Directorate.
A tax warehouse operator or tobacco importer may mark the packaging of tobacco packaging.
Consumer packaging of cigars or cigarillos with a control mark may be marked by the tax warehouse operator, tobacco importer or the beneficiary.
Only a check mark whose data correspond to the character of the validity of the excise duty rate shall be used to indicate the consumer packaging of tobacco, cigars or cigarillos.
It is only possible to mark the consumer pack of cigarettes with a check mark in the business that made them.
The number of ordered pieces of inspection stamps must not be less than 500 pieces or multiple of them.
CÚ shall electronically notify the customer of the control signs of the number of inspection marks he can remove, the price of the check mark and the FR SR account number.
CÚ may reduce the number of orders of inspection signs if circumstances are arising that it is reasonable to assume that tax rules may be infringed.
FŘ SR will determine the date of taking over of the inspection marks by the customer of the inspection marks, but within 10 days at the latest.
The date of taking over of the control marks of the FG SR shall be notified to the customer of the inspection marks via the electronic system of the inspection marks.
The control marks are issued by the financial directorate exclusively in the printing works, but only after the receipt of the funds corresponding to their price to the relevant account specified in the customs office's electronic notification.
The customer of the control marks is obliged separately for cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos and tobacco to keep the registration of the check signs in the electronic control system.
Administrative cooperation between EU Member States (ELO)
Within the meaning of Council Regulation (EU) No 389/2012 The ELO department and SPD systems of the excise duty department of the FD SR is responsible for securing the exchange of information on request for administrative cooperation between EU Member States and the competent financial management authorities.
These are especially applications for inspection of operators in the context of the management of excise duties, requests for information regarding the management of excise duties and also requests for confirmation of information from the SEED database.
The exchange of applications is made in electronic form within the EMCS system.
The following actions are included in the administrative cooperation between EU Member States: applications for administrative cooperation (request for verification, request for information on the management of excise duties, application for confirmation of registration in SEED); response to the request for administrative cooperation; spontaneous information; event report; inspection report.

Permission and registration
In SR, permanent tax oversight is applied to alcohol warehouses, in the Czech Republic, this supervision is replaced by the tax manager's continuous supervision via a monitoring device.
In the Czech Republic small independent breweries are in tax storage, in SR they are only registered by the tax manager.
The Institute of Registered Consignor is introduced in SR, which is included among tax warehouses in the Czech Republic.
In SR, it is possible to burn 43 l at a reduced rate of excise duty on alcohol in case of growing burning.
In contrast, in the Czech Republic, the reduced rate of alcohol tax can be applied only to 30 l and.
Growing moonshine in SR must have permission not only from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, but also from the tax manager.
Only the Ministry of Agriculture permits in the Czech Republic.
In SR, imports of the consumer packaging of alcohol are made in addition to the tax warehouse operator, by the importer of the packaging of alcohol.
The authorization of the importer shall be subject to registration of the applicant with the excise duty manager.
No special permission of the tax administrator is required in the Czech Republic to import alcohol packaging.
In SR, the sale of the consumer packaging of alcohol is conditional on issuing the authorization of the tax administrator for the seller.
The seller of the consumer packaging of alcohol has a lawful obligation to keep the registration, including. about buying and selling.
In the Czech Republic, the tax administrator does not issue any authorization for final sellers of the alcohol packaging, issuing a concession for the sale of alcohol by the business office is sufficient; the final seller does not keep any special registration.
In the SR of the fuel seller must have permission from the tax administrator to sell them.
National legislation in the SR does not modify any special regulation of the gas station, all activities regarding gas stations are regulated only in the excise duty law on mineral oils.
In the Czech Republic, the gas station regulates a special fuel law, but the tax manager does not issue any permission to sell fuel.
Gas stations are registered and their list is published by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
In SR it is not technically possible to obtain a list of filling stations from the financial management system.
Since 2012 there has been a significant increase in the number of selected authorisations or tax registrations.
This increase was due to legislative change in the specified period.
In the Czech Republic, on the contrary, the number of permits selected in 2013 decreased significantly due to the introduction of bail for fuel distributors.
Administrative actions
In the SR, substantive legislation provides for tax control duty on selected tax entities.
This issue is specified by the internal control act issued by the FR SR due to the application of the uniform procedure of tax administrators in the territory of SR.
In the Czech Republic, material legislation does not modify tax control requirements, procedural law provides only the possibility of carrying out a check no later than the deadline for taxation.
The reason for the large differences in the number of tax checks carried out and local investigations in SR and Czech Republic is that the internal management act of the FŘ SR determines in which cases and time limits the tax administrator must carry out a tax check, while in the Czech Republic the amount of excise duty is correct or its return is verified especially by local inquiries.
Since 2012, the number of comparable administrative operations in the Czech Republic has increased due to an increase in the number of transports in EMCS and at the same time due to an increase in the number of tax returns filed.
In SR, the number of administrative operations between 2012 and 2015 had a slightly increasing trend, which was influenced by the increasing number of EMCS transports and at the same time a decrease in the number of tax returns.
Evaluation
Different legislative arrangements have been shown on the large differences between the number of comparable permits and the registration of tax entities.
The number of comparable administrative actions of tax administrators was similar in the SR and Czech Republic in the various years of the controlled period.
In SR, the total number of comparable tax entities, which is about two-thirds compared to the number of tax entities in the Czech Republic, accounts for about the same amount of administrative operations.
From the above, it can be stated that the SR is more focused on the execution of administrative tasks by tax administrators, e.g. the exercise of physical tax oversight.
In the Czech Republic, the emphasis is placed on distant supervision, e.g. tracking device, immediate data transmission via web interface and risk analysis.
Electronization of administrative operations
Electronization of administrative tasks in the Czech Republic
Tax return can be filed via a data box.
Customs administration of the Czech Republic introduced the so-called. interactive tax returns forms, which cannot be processed any longer.
The data must be further rewritten to the tax entity's personal tax account.
The benefit is to reduce the error rate of tax returns (DAP), which will save the tax administrator's actions related to the corrections of the wrong DAP filed.
DGC is working on a new application for DAP electronic processing.
Smart forms can further: tax applications or registration for activity and notification of changes in data, claim tax refund claims, fulfil notification requirements when handling special mineral oils, handling raw tobacco and fulfilling biofuels duties.
The handling of control bands is recorded by tax entities in the ORO WebClient information system, which is available for registered entities to register by the tax administrator of specified data.
Transport of selected products in the Czech Republic under a tax exemption regime must be carried out in the Czech Republic based on an electronic accompanying document implemented in the Czech Republic as a national functionality into the electronic system for monitoring the transport of selected products (EMCS).
Transport of selected products in free tax circulation around the Czech Republic can always be carried out with a document proving their taxation, proof of excise duty, decision of the customs office to release the selected products under the customs procedure, a simplified accompanying document or another decision to measure excise duty.
The required content of the data is laid down by legislation.
The Czech Republic has introduced a voluntary electronic system for the issuing of alternative documents to facilitate the performance of these duties (§ 5 and § 6 of Act No. 353/2003 Coll.).
This allows the documentary form of documents to replace or supplement electronically issued documents, which are sent to a data warehouse via the web interface of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, where each such document is assigned a unique twelve-digit identification code (JIK).
JIK serves for the purpose of inspection by customs authorities on the road and prevents repeated transportation on the same document.
For the largest operator of the tax warehouse of fuel in the Czech Republic, which places about half of the volume of PHM into free tax circulation, the CS Czech Republic has online access to the electronic registration system, where the body automatically deposits tax documents.
CS Czech Republic is considering the introduction of e-VDO, i.e. electronic system for registration and monitoring of transport of selected products in free tax circulation.
This system should use 70 % of the current functional EMCS specification.
The advantage will be a user-friendly environment for declarant and customs officers.
It will also be connected to the system of global guarantees, tax registry or risk analysis system.
The system should provide an overview of transport in free circulation between Member States, which is still working on the basis of written documents without registration and the sharing of negotiating numbers through simplified accompanying documents.
The risks of the current procedure for registration of selected products in free tax circulation can be seen mainly in the abuse of a simplified accompanying document, repeated use of one document or illegal transport without any document.
Electronization of administrative operations in SR
In the management of excise duties, the SR financial administration uses electronic communication to monitor the movement of goods in EMCS under the conditions of tax exemption, control signs, filing tax returns and also when tax entities register and registering.
One-way electronic communication of tax entities with tax administrator was also introduced in 2014, which was extended to two-way communication in 2016
Within electronic communications, the tax agency has accessible a personal internet zone, called after entering access data. an electronic personal box designed for communication with financial management.
Within this zone, the tax agency has access to the e-mailroom through which it submits applications, notifications, tax returns and other documents related to the management of excise duties.
However, electronic communication through a personal internet zone does not concern all tax entities.
National legislation defines tax entities who are obliged to communicate with the tax administrator electronically.
This is mainly a payer of value added tax, a tax advisor representing the tax body and attorneys representing the tax body.
NKÚ SR also addressed the issue of the extent of the electronization of excise duty management during the inspection.
These were only fully electronic operations, tax returns and electronic communication within ELO.
If the EMCS traffic is taken away, there has been an increase in electronization of selected comparable administrative operations, which is also a requirement for modern tax management.
Comparison and evaluation
Comparison
Fully electronized processing of tax returns is already in place in SR, from its filing to registration of tax liability.
In the Czech Republic, electronic processing of tax returns is not set.
In the Czech Republic, the possibility for tax entities to insert compulsory documents for individual transport in free tax circulation on the website.
In the future, the announcement of free tax circulation transport in the form and based on EMCS system is prepared.
Evaluation
The system of reporting transport in free tax circulation in the Czech Republic contributes to tax oversight, thus eliminating the transport of selected products, where excise duty has not been paid in violation of legislation.
These can be recommended as a good practice.

Due to good practice in SR in the field of tax return electronization, NKÚ SR and NKÚ Czech Republic recommend completing the electronization of tax returns in Czech Republic.
Analysis of changes in organisational structure and personnel security in excise duty
The organisational arrangement of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic and the Financial Administration of the SR has undergone major changes.
Organizational arrangement of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic
Customs administration of the Czech Republic from 1. 1. 2013 is composed of the Directorate-General of Customs and Customs offices, which are administrative offices and organizational agencies of the state.
DGC is an entity for the entire customs administration.
Customs administration of the Czech Republic has been carrying out comprehensive management of excise duties since 2004 as one of the many competences it ensures.
CS Czech Republic continues to perform:
(a) check:
śaśa road transport (weighing of trucks, paying fees for the use of road roads, fulfilling conditions for the transport of dangerous goods, professional supervision of the work of vehicle crews in international road freight transport and international passenger transport matters),
śaśa waste management and packaging material,
śaśa the safety of imported food,
śaśa in the field of consumer protection and protection of intellectual property rights,
śaśa employment of foreigners,
b) customs management - this is a comprehensive application of customs regulations, commercial policy measures and formalities for import and export of goods,
(c) the selection and enforcement of cash transactions imposed by other public authorities within the divisional administration;
(d) the activities of the police authority (designated customs authorities) in criminal proceedings committed by violations of customs and related regulations and tax regulations, if the Czech Customs Administration is the tax administrator.
Although the scope of competences (set of control activities) increases the overall cost of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, there is a cost savings of the extent, because the public administration does not have to incur costs on the position of the control group for each subject of the inspection independently.
At the same time, the administrative burden of controlled persons is reduced by repeated inspection.
10 The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic continues to exercise its competence from 1. 12. 2016 to verify the performance of the duties in the registration of sales (§ 2 paragraph 2). Article 2 of Law No. 112/2016 Coll., on sales registration) and from 1. 1. 2017 supervision of compliance with the law and conditions of the operation of gambling, including penalties (Section 116 of Law No. 186/2016 Coll., about gambling).
The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic has changed the three-step structure to two-stage structure with effect from 1. 1. 2013, with the cancellation of the middle article of the procedure (customs directorates).
DGC spent about 51 miles on the project. Kč (i.e. approx. 2 031 000 €).
The CS Czech Republic from 1. 1. 2013 is DGC and regional customs offices, which are administrative and organizational components of the state.
Customs offices and their competence are laid down by law, the management of excise duties is carried out by all customs offices through separation and territorial workplaces.
Territorial workplaces are internal organizing units of customs offices.
The Ministry of Finance is entitled to set up and disturb the territorial workplace and determine their factual competence.
Legislation does not provide for any competence for the territorial workplace; the territorial workplace exercises the duties of the customs office on its behalf.
Organizational structure until 12. 31. 2012
Organization structure from 1. 1. 2013
DGC, eight CŘ and 2012 58 separation (including branches) were executed until 31. August 12. total of 67 unions and departments.
As of 1. June 1., DGC and 51 departments in CÚ and their territorial workplaces, eight workplaces of the DGC legal department and a units providing mobile oversight, i.e. Approx. 60 places.
The costs of CS Czech Republic significantly affect wage costs.
Due to the reorganization of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, there was no saving of personnel resources.
The execution of main processes is ensured by customs officers in service under the Law on the service of security corps members.
The possibility of reducing the number of these members is very limited in the Czech Republic, because according to the provisions of Section 42 (42). Article 1 of Law No. 361/2003 Coll., on the service of security corps members, can be released from the service only in cases of taxatively defined.
Reduction of service posts due to organisational changes in the security corps is not a reason for dismissal and the employer is obliged to ensure the allocation of adequate services within the corps and, where appropriate, to secure jobs with another security corps (e.g. Police of the Czech Republic, Prison Service of the Czech Republic), otherwise they will put them in a deposit for the temporary non-inclusion, where members of security corps belong to 80 % of the average service income according to the law.

Organizational arrangement of excise duty management in SR
The Government of the Slovak Republic has established itself as one of the priorities of completion of tax administration reform through the UNITAS programme, which will secure additional budgetary resources by combining tax collection, customs and levies and suppression of tax evasion.
In this context, tax reform was implemented at central level, which brought the merger of the SR Tax Directorate and the SR Customs Directorate into the SR Financial Directorate and the creation of financial management.
FŘ SR was set up on 2012 1. 1. by law no. 333/2011 Z. z., about government agencies in the field of taxes, fees and customs, as last amended, as a budgetary organization based in Banská Bystrica and is connected to the state budget through the budget chapter of the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic.
FŘ SR, CÚ and the Criminal Office of Financial Administration within the meaning of Act No. 199/2004 Z. z., Customs law and amendment of certain laws, as last amended, are customs authorities if they carry out tasks under customs regulations.
In the sense of law no. 333/2011 Z. z., about the state administration bodies in the field of taxes, fees and customs, as last amended, together with the tax authorities form financial management.
The new organisational structure of the financial administration on 1. January 2012 is the Finance Directorate of the SR, the Criminal Financial Administration, the Competence Center of Financial Operations, the tax authorities, the tax office for selected tax entities, branches of tax offices, the tax offices, the customs offices, branches of customs offices (branch CÚ tax, branch CÚ combined, branch CÚ customs) and customs office station.
The main mission of the FD SR is the effective collection and management of taxes and customs, i.e. also excise duties, fulfil the income part of the state budget and protect the economic interests of the state.
The statutory body of the FG SR is the president of the financial administration, nominated and dismissed by the Minister of Finance of the Slovak Republic.
The President of the Financial Administration is responsible for the operation of the whole financial administration and therefore also for the activities of the FG SR, which he directs and represents in its entirety.
Organizing structure FŘ SR from 1. 1. 2012 in short form
Within all customs offices in the territory of the SR, excise duty management activities and processes provide, apart from branches of customs offices (38 branches) and customs offices (18 stations), excise duty separation (9 departments) and legal separation (9st department).

Comparison and evaluation
Comparison
Within the organizational structure of the financial management of the SR in 2015, apart from the FG SR, 74 organisational departments with a total of 1 employees; these services manage almost 48 tax entities.
In 2015, about 60 organizational departments with a total of 1 employees managed about 011 000 tax entities, which manage about 114 tax entities.
In the Czech Republic, the performance of individual excise duty management activities is divided among several personnel independent departments.
Their coordination and cooperation is addressed through middle and top management.
In SR, the pursuit of individual activities (registration, tax return, tax control) in the field of excise duty management is divided between excise duty separation and the branch of the customs office, where the same tax administrators often deal with the said agenda.
Evaluation
In SR, the number of tax entities is about a third of the number of employees in the field of excise duty management compared to the state in the Czech Republic; the impact of higher employees on the efficiency of excise duty management is not apparent.
EMCS system
According to the preamble of Decision No of the European Parliament and of the Council Article 1152/2003 (1152/2003) EC of 16. June 2003 on the introduction of an electronic system for the transport and monitoring of products subject to excise duty, aimed at establishing an electronic system for monitoring the transport of selected products was to enable real-time information to be acquired on transport and to carry out the prescribed checks, simplify intra-Community movement of goods under suspension arrangements.
During the implementation of the system, Member States should allow operators, especially SMEs active in the sector, to use these national elements with the lowest possible costs.
Article 3 of the said EP and Council Decision admits to include national specifications, national database forming part of the system and technical or software that the Member State deems necessary to ensure the full use of the system within its administration.
EMCS in Czech Republic
Development and functionality of EMCS system
In the Czech Republic, the EMCS system was preceded by the system of registration of selected products (EVVV), which was operated from May 2004 to the end of March 2010.
The EMCS is fully functional in the Czech Republic from 1. 4. 2010 and is continuously supplemented by European and national functionality (see Annex No. 5).
The so-called was introduced in the Czech Republic. Customs module and declarant module.
Customs module contains a number of national functions.
Transports under the EMCS system are monitored beyond the Community system in the EMCS system, started and ended in the Czech Republic.
The system ensures, after approval of a notice of receipt of a consignment intended for a beneficiary for one-time acceptance of the automatic transmission of information to the tax agency registry with subsequent invalidation of the permit.
The administration of accepted and sent applications for international cooperation and spontaneous information from ELO is fully ensured through the system, including sending replies with an attachment in any format and providing translations.
A report on manual termination of ECS exports is also allowed (only the transfer of an auto-created message is implemented in the EU).
Risk profiles for outgoing or incoming shipments are set to the currently required criteria.
The EMCS system does not allow e-AD approval or acceptance notice without the competent customs authority's reaction to a risk profile (risk profile cannot be ignored).
The Declarant module is available for tax entities for free, it has the form of a web application, where the user logs into using the username and password (coordinates), which are assigned to him after registration with the CS Czech Republic.
Each act against the EMCS customs module shall be accompanied by a valid electronic signature in the EMCS declarant module.
The Declarant Module enables tax entities to direct registration of data on initiated and terminated transport under the tax exemption regime, so tax entities do not have to spend funds on the acquisition of the system.
The national functionality of the declarant module allows you to load and store data off-line (saves time for frequently used data), fill in recipient data based on SEED ID check and require compulsory completion of data that are optional at EU level (maximum data for risk analysis).
The system also allows for every consignment consigned from the Czech Republic to block the security of excise duty in the corresponding amount of taxable transactions until the end of transport.
The amount of security is calculated automatically by EMCS.
Without sufficient amount of collateral it is not possible to send e-AD design for approval to CÚ shipment from the EMCS declarant module.
Each warranty has a unique number and contains ARC transport (including the amount of blocked collateral) for which it was used.
The tax operator can manage its guarantees directly in the EMCS declarant module, where it sees the current amount of blocked and unblocked excise duty guarantees.
Expenditure on the introduction and use of EMCS system
The EMCS development was implemented on the basis of eight execution contracts from 2006 to 2017 totalling CZK 46 791 (i.e. 1 412,56 761.) without VAT.
In accordance with the contracts concluded, the contractor issued invoices from 2006 to the end of 2015 for a total amount of CZK 43 577 (i.e. 1 401,10 640.) without VAT.
During the controlled period, the EMCS upgrade was incurred with výdaje 14 incl. VAT (i.e. 547 438,99).
The amount spent on the EMCS upgrade during the controlled period and converted into one EMCS transport is on average 16,49 CZK (i.e. 0,62 €), without national transport, these costs in conversion into one transport between the Czech Republic and the EU Member States are CZK 24,40 (i.e. 0,92 €).
The EMCS technical support was implemented under four contracts with execution from 2011 to 2017.
By the end of 2015 the total amount of technical support of CZK 7 499 (i.e. 281 389,77) including value added tax.
The average amount of technical support spent since 2011 on one transport inserted into the EMCS since 2010 is CZK 6,18 (i.e. 0,23 €).
Development and technical support invoices covered national solutions and developed the EVV application, which DGC had already operated before EMCS itself.
The invoices were paid under programming funding from national sources.
Technical support is invoiced as part of service supply and other applications provided by the supplier for the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.
EMCS in SR
The EMCS system is an electronic system operated by EU Member States to monitor the movement of excise goods between Member States under suspension regime.
Replaced the accompanying administrative document - the SAD used before the effectiveness of this system, thus ensuring better control and traffic control.
The SR has been introduced since 1. 4. 2010 and is continuously supplemented by requirements resulting from EU legislation.
A unique reference code is generated for each transport, called.
ARC code under which you can monitor this transport online, i.e. in real time.
Development and functionality of EMCS system
The EMCS system ensures the receiving and dispatch of excise goods by tax entities entitled to use the EMCS system, thus reducing the risk of tax evasion.
The biggest development of functionalities occurred in 2011, when EMCS was fully introduced into operation (see Annex No. 6).
Expenditure on the introduction and use of EMCS system
The introduction of EMCS was implemented as another module of application equipment SysNeD and therefore it is not possible to accurately determine the amount of costs of its initial application on the Slovak side.
Comparison and evaluation
Comparison
The aim of EMCS was to replace a system based on administration of transport in a documentary form.
The benefit of EMCS system is a comprehensive overview of transport between Member States within the EU from the notification of transport to its termination - reducing administrative costs for tax administrators and tax operators for processing, transfer and document archiving is important.
In the Czech Republic and SR, national functionality has been introduced into EMCS system, allowing traffic monitoring in a conditional system between two places in the Czech Republic or. in SR.
In addition, automatic functionality of online monitoring and ensuring a guarantee for excise duty is applied in the Czech Republic.
A national functionality is also introduced to monitor the risk of the tax entity or. Transportation, with subsequent compulsory response by the tax manager.
The SR and the Czech Republic register a comparable number of transport within the EU in the EMCS system.
However, the costs incurred in SR to upgrade this system were byly 744 higher between 2012 and 2015 than in the Czech Republic.
NKÚ SR received data from the FR SR on upgrade of EMCS system only for the period from 2011, although this system has been established and operated before.
Yet the costs incurred on upgrading EMCS system in SR were byly 188 higher than the costs of introducing and upgrading the EMCS system in about ten years of its operation in the Czech Republic.
Evaluation
For a controlled period, the volume of expenditure related to the EMCS upgrade in SR in conversion to one transport exceeds costs of the same type in the Czech Republic.
Conclusion
The cooperation of the Czech Republic and the NKU SR met the goals.
Both control institutions gained a deeper knowledge of the excise tax management system in the Czech Republic and SR.
Despite the common basic legal framework, it has been found that there are significant differences in both tax systems that affect the efficiency of the management of excise taxes.
During parallel checks, examples of good practice were found, which could contribute to reducing tax fraud, their importance with rising tax rates will increase.
Procedures have also been identified to reduce the cost of excise duty management.
Cross-cooperation has revealed differences that significantly affect tax management efficiency and limit international comparison unless mutually coordinated deep checks are carried out with tax administrator.
In this the role of the highest control institutions is irreplaceable.
Report on the results of parallel control of value added tax management carried out in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany
Introductory word
The Lim Declaration of 1977 emphasizes that the Supreme Supervisory Institutions (SAI) have the power to audit all public financial operations.
The Declaration calls for tax revenue to be controlled to the extent possible.
The European Organization of the Highest Supervisory Institutions (EUROSAI) considers it one of the most important components of public tax revenue.
VI. EUROSAI Congress held in Bonn in 2005 dealt with the audit of SAI public revenue.
An important step towards optimizing SAI control activity is the development of a special strategy for public revenue auditing.
This applies especially to taxes as the most complex source of public income, which is most prone to great losses.
Since the economies of individual states are increasingly interconnected and dependent, SAIs may, to some extent, be unable to carry out a control activity without cooperating with the SAI of another state.
An example is an audit of internationally organized fraud, which causes significant losses in the revenue of many countries.
In order to combat this crime, the responsible authorities need to cooperate with each other.
SAIs that carry out the inspection in this area must be willing to establish closer cooperation between themselves.
Just on VI. the EUROSAI Congress in Bonn was created by the idea of checking the administration of value added tax (hereinafter referred to as ′′ VAT ′′) and VIES system in the cooperation of the Supreme Supervisory Authority and the Federal Court of Auditors, Bundesrechnungshof.
Careful preparation followed, when both parties first had to acquaint themselves with the legal environment and procedures for VAT management in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.
Based on the analysis of this information, a selection of control topics included in the control programme was made.
Achieving effective and efficient VAT management is a long-term problem and individual states (especially Member States of the European Union) are looking for solutions to improve, simplify and make the collection of this tax available.
We believe that the results of our control can serve not only to improve the work of tax administrators, but also as a basis for a proposal to improve the international information exchange system.
Report on the results of parallel checks on value added tax management performed in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany
Introduction
Control number: (CZ) 06/27 (D) VIII 2-2005-1215
Subject of inspection:
(CZ) Value added tax administration after the Czech accession to the European Union
(D) Verification of administrative cooperation in value added tax under Council Regulation (EC) No Commission Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 1925/2004
Objective of control:
(CZ) The aim of the control action in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedure of the financial authorities in the management of value added tax following the integration of the Czech Republic into the single internal market of the European Union (hereinafter the EU) associated with the free movement of goods and services and to check the use of the VIES system, especially when checking the application of the value added tax exemption for intracommunitary delivery.
(D) The aim of the inspection was to examine the system of control of intracommunitary value added tax with a special focus on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax under the abovementioned regulations.
The result should be a report on weaknesses and recommendations for their elimination.
The system of exchange of value added tax information The Surveillance Authority, the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as ′′ NKÚ ′′) and the German Bundesrechnungshof (hereinafter ′′ BRH ′′) in mutual cooperation under a contract concluded between the two inspection institutions on 8. June 2006.
The cooperation focused mainly on the verification of selected commercial transactions between payers from the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the Czech Republic) and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter referred to as ′′ Germany ′′), the use of information obtained by means of international cooperation between tax administrations and the comparison of VAT management systems of both countries.
Joint final report on the results of the inspection actions has been processed within the meaning of the European Directive No. 31 to implement INTOSAI audit standards.
The period controlled was from 1. August 2004 to 31. August 2005.
Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions
Parallel VAT management inspection in Czech Republic and Germany was performed under agreement between the two SAIs.
Outside the main point - exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No Commission Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 1925/2004-the inspection covered other topics, such as payer registration, VAT tax returns and summary reports closely linked to the main point.
In addition, part of the inspection included the legal situation in the international bus transport of passengers and comparing some statistics.
The comparison of the VAT management systems of both countries identified differences in the following areas:
1) VAT registration.
While in Germany business owners are registered regardless of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, the first criterion (among others) is for registration exceeding the limit laid down in the VAT Act.
In the Czech Republic, only one tax identification number is assigned to payers, which they also use in intracommunitary transactions.
In Germany, VAT payers are assigned a tax number, used only for business transactions in the territory of Germany.
If a German payer intends to carry out intracommunitary transactions, he must request an assignment of a special identification number called. VAT ID.
Since different methods of registration cause problems, conditions should be offset throughout the EU (see. 4.1).
2) International bus transport of persons.
In the Czech Republic, international bus transport of persons is exempted from VAT with the right to deduct VAT.
In Germany, part of the shipment taking place on German territory is subject to VAT.
At EU level efforts should be made to harmonise the situation within the meaning of Article 393 of Council Directive 2006/112 / EC on the common system of VAT (see. 4.2)
3) VAT tax return.
While in the Czech Republic, payers filed tax returns only for individual tax periods (month or quarter), in Germany, payers are entitled to submit so-called. preliminary tax returns for VAT (monthly or quarterly) and after the end of the calendar year they must submit an annual VAT return.
Unlike the Czech Republic of payers, payers in Germany are obliged to submit preliminary tax returns electronically.
The introduction of the obligation to submit VAT tax returns in the Czech Republic electronically would increase the efficiency of the Czech tax administration (see. 4.3).
4) Summary reports.
While the payers report summary reports to the financial authorities in the Czech Republic, the payers report summary reports to the CLO in Germany.
Therefore, data from summary reports are available immediately after submission of the financial authorities in Czech Republic.
German financial authorities have information from summary reports only after processing it into CLO.
Fighting VAT fraud requires updated intra-communitarian transaction information to be available as soon as possible.
Monthly summary reporting would shorten the time shift between the date of transaction and VIES data update.
This would subsequently allow early examination of taxation in the Member State of the customer (see. 4.4).
Which would, however, require all Member States to accept the same deadline for submitting a summary report.
5) International exchange of VAT information.
Czech CLO monitors the three-month deadline for information received.
German CLO does not follow the past time.
Consequently, the German tax administration dealt with significantly lower percentage of the applications received within the specified deadline.
Due to these problems, BRH recommended the German CLO to carry out permanent warnings (see. 4.6).
6) Risk management system.
Each of the two Member States develop their own risk management system (hereinafter referred to as ′′ RMS ′′) that has its strengths and weaknesses.
NKÚ and BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by just one Member State.
Successful criteria, components and approaches of RMS must be exchanged and introduced in each EU Member State, otherwise the scammers will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5.).
As part of the cooperation, both SAIs tested selected cases of intracommunitary transactions between tax entities from the Czech Republic and Germany.
Thirty-one cases of commercial transactions were examined together with the application of the CLO legislation, where there were doubts about their effectiveness or suspicion of tax evasion on VAT.
It was found that:
In some cases, the tax authorities used information obtained through international cooperation and measured VAT tax liability for the payers.
In these cases, payers either unduly claimed the right to exemption from VAT or did not admit the acquisition of goods in VAT tax return.
In some cases the financial authorities could not use the information obtained because the information was either incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases the information could not be used due to various legal provisions in both Member States.
In some cases, the tax administration of another Member State refused to respond to the request for information.
Cases were found where payers misplaced commercial transactions in summary reports.
As a result, VIES data were incorrect and tax administration had to check these cases (see. 6.).
The course of the inspection action
The course of the inspection event in the Czech Republic
The inspection was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by the Department II - the department of revenue of the state budget and the territorial unions of Central Bohemia, northwest Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.
The inspected persons were: Ministry of Finance (hereinafter referred to as ′′ MF ′′) and 10 financial authorities - Financial authority in Humpolec, Finance office in Jihlava, Finance office in Liberec, Finance office in Nymburk, Finance office in Otrokovice, Financial office for Prague 1, Finance office for Prague 4 The Financial Office in Sokolov and the Financial Office in Třinci.
The inspection conclusion from this inspection action was approved by the NKÚ College on 23. April 2007.
The course of the inspection action in Germany
The inspection was carried out between June 2006 and February 2007 by the control group for indirect taxes and personnel of designated regional inspection authorities in Berlin, Frankfurt am Main and Munich.
The control was part of the 2006 control plan and was therefore notified to the Federal MF in 2006.
After the testing phase, the inspection started in the fourth quarter of 2006.
According to the cases selected by BRH and later elected NKÚ BRH had to announce a check of a number of Federal states.
In addition to interviews at the Federal MF and CLO, the check was carried out in the following Federal states:
Baden-Württembersko, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.
The tax files of the following financial authorities included:
Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, Munich - FÚ for corporations / legal persons (München-Körperschaften), Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-center (Hamburg-Mitte), Hamburg-North (Hamburg-Nord) and Hamburg für Großunternehmen), Hannover-Nord (Hannover-north), Winsen-Luhe, Bonn center (Bonn-Bonn-Innenstadt), Cologne center (Köln-Mitte), Cologne-Porz (Köln-Porz), Cologne south (Köln-Süd), Sankt Augustin, Pirmasens, Budysín (Bautzen), Chemnitz south (Chemnitz-Süd), Dresden II (Dresden) II), Freiberg, Leipzig I (Leipzig I) and Zchopau.
In addition, there was a discussion with Augsburg-city (Augsburg-Stadt), Aurich, Düsseldorf-old town (Düsseldorf-Altstadt), Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.
Report on control findings was submitted to the MF in May 2007.
Cooperation of both control institutions
Several meetings of representatives of both supervisory institutions took place during the preparation of parallel control events before they started.
Participants of these meetings met the tax administration organization, legislation on VAT issues and VAT management system in both countries.
The topics of the testing phase were agreed at the meeting held in May 2006
The test phase results were evaluated at another joint meeting in August 2006.
A timetable for further work was agreed within this meeting and the following topics of parallel checks were set out:
1. VAT payer registration.
2.
International bus transport of persons - legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.
3. International exchange of information, especially the procedure of tax administrators in handling requests for information and examination of selected problem cases mentioned in requests for information and spontaneous information transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany.
4. VAT tax returns.
5.
Summary reports.
6.
Statistical data on the delivery and acquisition of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany.
7. VAT risk management.
On the common inspection day of NKÚ and BRH, which took place in December 2006, both sides acquainted each other with the course of control in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the results of parallel control events.
The report on the results of parallel VAT management checks between the Czech Republic and Germany was drawn up at a work meeting in July 2007.
4. Value Added Tax Administration in Czech Republic and Germany
Registration of payers in Czech Republic
A) Payers who have their registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic
The tax subject is according to law No. 337/1992 Coll., on the management of taxes and fees (hereinafter referred to as ' Law No. 337/1992 Coll.") means taxpayer, tax payer and legal successor to a natural or legal person who is defined as a tax entity by law.
On June 31., 2004, 421 tax entities were registered in the Czech Republic.
There was an increase in the number of tax entities registered for VAT to 457 590.
A taxable person who has a registered office, place of business or an establishment in the Czech Republic, whose turnover will exceed 000 1 CZK (EUR 33 575) for the next 12 consecutive calendar months, becomes a payer from the 1. th day of the third month following the month in which it exceeded the registration limit (§ 94 paragraph 94). Article 1 of Law No. 235/2004 Coll., on value added tax; hereinafter referred to as ′′ Act No. 235/2004 Coll.").
The application for registration is required within 15 days after the end of the month in which he exceeded the registration limit.
The current legislation does not allow the taxable person to register the so-called taxable person. retrospectively where the reason for registration is to exceed the legal limit for registration.
A taxable person with a registered office, place of business or an establishment in the Czech Republic, who makes taxable transactions or transactions exempted from VAT with a right to deduct, can become a tax payer, even if he does not exceed the turnover of 1 000 CZK (33 EUR 575) if they meet any of the other conditions laid down in Law No. 235/2004 Coll.
A taxable person with a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic who does not fulfil any of the conditions laid down by law can apply for VAT registration voluntarily.
The delivery of the application to register to the local tax administrator is initiated by law No. 337/1992 Coll.
Voluntary VAT payer on the VAT registration application will also indicate the date on which he asks for registration as VAT payer.
Tax administrator data communicated by the tax agency i.e. filed application for registration with all attachments, will be checked.
If he has doubts about the data, he will invite the tax agency to explain, supplement or substantiate the data.
After verifying that the tax agency fulfils the conditions for registration, the tax agency issues a decision in the form of a certificate that the tax body is registered and has been given a tax identification number (hereinafter referred to as 'the tax ID').
The certificate shall indicate the tax administrator's date of effectiveness of the VAT registration and the periodicity of the tax period.
The delivery period is a calendar quarter, unless the payer's turnover for the previous calendar year has reached CZK 10 000 (EUR 335 750).
If the turnover of the payer for the previous calendar year reached CZK 10 000 (EUR 335 750), the tax period is the calendar month.
The payer whose turnover for the previous calendar year reached CZK 2 000 (EUR 67 150) is entitled to choose a calendar month for the tax period and will notify the tax manager of the taxation.

The allocation of the VAT in the registration certificate is always of a constitutional character and the tax body is obliged to state in all cases communications (including payments) with the tax administrator and in cases where a special law (e.g. law no. 235/2004 Coll. when issuing tax documents).
The ID number contains the code ′′ CZ ′′ and the tribal part consisting of the general identifier.
The general identifier is the birth number for a natural person or. another general identifier, if such a special law, and for a legal person an identification number (clause § 33 (33). Article 12 of Law No. 337/1992 Coll.).
If the tax body has failed to fulfil its registration obligation or at the call of the tax manager, the local tax manager shall register it without delay.
The result of the registration procedure is the issue of the Ex officio Registration Certificate, which is served on the tax body.
In the Czech Republic, the tax agency that has been entitled to business activities is allocated a tax ID at the moment of its first registration for any tax.
The tax entity uses the same tax ID even if registered as VAT payer.
According to the wording of Law No. 235/2004 Coll., which has been effective from 1. 1. 2005, the tax administrator may, in case of failure to comply with the VAT registration obligation, pay a taxable person up to 10 % of the total income or income for taxable transactions carried out illegally without tax, for the period from the date on which he was supposed to be a registered payer by law until the date on which the tax manager decided to become a registered payer (Article 98 (98) of the basic Regulation). Article 1 of Law No. 235/2004 Coll.).
The payment of the amount thus determined is considered to be a tax deduction (§ 98 paragraph 98). Article 3 of Law No. 235/2004 Coll.), i.e. it's not about sanctions.
Revocation of VAT payer registration when legally established conditions are met is possible for two reasons:
1)
Revocation of registration at the request of the payer, mainly due to the amount of turnover that does not exceed the registration limit (§ 106 paragraph 106). Article 1 of Law No. 235/2004 Coll.).
The payer is entitled to apply for cancellation of registration at the earliest after 1 year after the expiry date of effectiveness given on the registration certificate.
2) Revocation of the ′′ official power ′′ registration (§ 106 (106) Article 7 of Law No. 235/2004 Coll.), if: (a) the payer has not made the tax administrator without notification for 12 consecutive months of fulfilment, (b) the payer does not fulfil his obligations under Law No. 235/2004 Coll., c) the payer ceases to be a taxable person.
B) Payers who have no registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic Tax registered in another Member State who has no registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic, or a foreign taxable person who takes place with the place of delivery in the country and is a person liable to admit and pay tax on such transactions under Section 108 of Law No. 235/2004 Coll. (so-called. ′′ non-established payer ′′), becomes payer on the day of this delivery.
This person is obliged to apply for registration to the IRS for Prague 1 no later than the date of implementation.
In the registration application, it is required to state all the VAT paid to it in other Member States or in a third country.
If the ′′ unused ′′ payer submits an application for registration later than on the date of the first taxable operation in the Czech Republic, the Financial Office for Prague 1 will register it retroactively because according to law No. 235/2004 Coll. the tax body became a VAT payer on the date of the first taxable operation in the Czech Republic.
During retroactive registration, the Finance Office for Prague 1 requires tax entities proof that the performance has been performed (invoices or. explanatory letters).
If a ′′ non-established ′′ tax entity applies for registration in the Czech Republic before the first taxable operation takes place, the Finance Office for Prague 1 asks for the presentation of contracts that the execution takes place.
473 ′′ non-established ′′ payers were registered at the Czech Republic for Prague 1, of which 124 payers from Germany and registered as of 31. 12. 2005 951 ′′ non-established ′′ payers, of which 233 payers from Germany.
According to the provisions of Section 106 (106) Article 9 of Law No. 235/2004 Coll. the tax administrator is entitled to revoke the registration of the ′′ non-established ′′ payer on 31. January of the following calendar year, unless the payer has been incurred during the current calendar year.
The NKÚ check found that if the ′′ non-established ′′ payer filed a tax return abroad for postal transport on January 25., i.e. in accordance with the law in the deadline for filing tax returns, the tax office does not often have it available on January 31.
In cases where the facts are relevant for the possibility of cancelling registration to the tax office later than on 31. January, it is no longer possible to cancel the ′′ non-established ′′ payer's VAT registration in the Czech Republic.
Registration of payers in Germany
Due to the legal provisions of the German Tax Code (§§ 137, 138 Abgabenordnung, hereinafter referred to as ′′ AO ′′), anyone who is engaged in business is obliged to inform the municipal / municipal office or the relevant financial authority.
The deadline for submission of information is one month after the business starts.
This information is processed by the municipal / municipal office for the tax office.
If the IRS detects an undertaking that started the operation but did not register, the competent tax authority may register this payer with official power - even retroactively.
Taxpayers who are both tax residents and non-residents in Germany are legally obliged to register for VAT if they meet the criteria set out in Section 2 of the German VAT Act (UStG).
This obligation does not depend on the volume of turnover they execute.
There is no voluntary VAT registration in Germany.
For business owners permanently residing abroad there are special financial authorities.
For example, for those who are located in the Czech Republic, Chemnitz-Süd is the competent tax office.
On April 30., 2004, 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered at the Chemnitz-Süd Financial Office; on March 1., 2006, a total of 1050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered.
BRH found that these special financial authorities often refused registration called. semi-dependent independent workers based in the new Eastern EU Member States.
Since employee s' work permits from ten new EU Member States are limited after their accession to the EU, these independent workers tried to avoid these restrictions by starting their business.
These companies do not meet the criteria for entrepreneurs set out in § 2 UStG because they are usually dependent on a single employer to determine their working hours and the way they perform their work.
In order to register, the entrepreneur must complete a questionnaire of the competent financial authority, where he must provide information about the company and the activities he / she performs.
The questionnaire is a standard form that is binding on all financial authorities in Germany.
It is processed either by special departments of the financial authorities or by universal services responsible for the assessment of taxpayers.
Through this form, a risk assessment of individual taxpayers is performed before the tax office gives out the tax number.
The structure of the tax number for domestic transactions follows certain rules:
The first three digits provide information about the competent financial authority, the following three (or four) provide information about the relevant department at the financial office, another five (or four) are to distinguish payers, with the last one always the check numbers.
If an entrepreneur intends to participate in an intracommunitary trade, he needs a VAT identification number to receive tax exempt intracommunitary delivery.
CLO allocates VAT ID at the request of the entrepreneur if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany and has a VAT tax number.
CLO allocates VAT ID to entrepreneurs automatically when the payer automatically gives intra-communitarian delivery in their VAT return.
VAT ID structure is a country code (DE) followed by a series of nine digits.
Entrepreneur registration can be cancelled: 1. at his request (for example, if he has ceased his business), after all administrative work (assessment for all marketing years) and 2. if the tax administration realizes that he is no longer developing business activity.
The validity of the VAT identification number is usually linked to the validity of the VAT number.
In these cases, the tax authorities are required to inform the CLO of the cancellation of the tax number so that the CLO can expire the VAT identification number.
According to German VAT Act (§ 19 (1) UStG) tax residents in Germany are not liable to pay VAT in case of 1. that turnover plus the relevant VAT of the previous calendar year does not exceed EUR 17 500 and 2. the following year is likely to not exceed EUR 50 000
So-called small business owners (′′ Kleinunternehmer ′′) are not entitled to invoice other entrepreneurs VAT and are not entitled to deduct entry tax.
Although they are not obliged to pay VAT, small business owners must be registered at the IRS and must submit an annual VAT return.
A small businessman can claim that there will be no provision § 19 (19) of the basic Regulation. 1 UStG apply.
This confession is binding on him for the next five years.
The entrepreneur can then invoice VAT and deduct tax on entry.
For tax non-residents there is an option to appoint tax representatives (§ 22 and UStG).
It is an essential prerequisite that they carry out exclusively tax exempt commercial operations and not be entitled to deduct the entry tax.
The function of a tax representative is to fulfil the tax liability of a foreign businessman, who does not have to register for VAT.
The invoices must include information about representation for tax purposes.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation is different in both countries.
While in Germany business owners are registered regardless of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, the first criterion (among others) is for registration exceeding the limit laid down in the VAT Act.
If the tax body in the Czech Republic does not exceed the limit, it has the option to apply voluntarily for VAT registration.
Registration procedure is standardized in Germany, but different organizational models in the federal states may cause different.
In the Czech Republic, the payer is assigned a tax ID at the moment of his first registration.
In case the payer registers for VAT, he uses the same ID for intracommunitary transactions.
In Germany, the payer is given a tax number for registration for VAT, only for business transactions in the territory of Germany.
If a German payer intends to carry out intracommunitary transactions, he must request an assignment of a special identification number called. VAT ID.
As NKÚ and BRH have identified, the German two-stage registration system can cause many misunderstandings in other Member States, such as in the Czech Republic, which allocates a single identification number for national VAT registration and registration for intracommunitary transactions.
On the other hand, the two-stage system allows retroactive (national) registration in cases where payers refuse to inform municipalities or the competent financial authority about their business.
This retroactive registration allows correct VAT measurement for previous taxation period, especially accurate estimation of VAT tax liability.
Since different ways of registration cause problems, conditions should be offset throughout the EU.
The German parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number (hereinafter referred to as the ID).
The Federal Tax Office will allocate the VAT at birth of a natural person.
This VAT will be valid throughout the life of a natural person who is a German resident.
If a natural person starts a business, the competent tax authority will ask for an economic ID, which will be used as a VAT ID.
There should be no delay in the future between national payer registration and VAT ID allocation.
The work on the introduction of an IT device to manage the VAT has not yet been completed.
International bus transport of persons
Legislation in the Czech Republic
According to the provisions of Section 70 of Law No. 235/2004 Coll. the transport of persons between Member States and between Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic is exempted from VAT with the right to deduct the tax.
This transport is exempted from VAT, even if it is performed by tax-registered entrepreneurs in other Member States or by a taxable foreign person.
Return transport is considered to be separate transportation.
If ′′ non-established ′′ tax entities in the Czech Republic do not carry out other economic activity besides international bus transport of persons, they are not obliged to register as VAT payers in the Czech Republic.
International transport of persons in the Czech Republic was exempted from VAT based on the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, Annex V kap. Article 5 (5) of the Treaty 1 (1) (b) where it is stated:
' For the purposes of Article Article 28 (28) of the Treaty 3 (3) (b) Directive 77/388 / EEC may the Czech Republic continue to exempt the value added tax on international passenger transport under point 17 of Annex F to the Directive until the condition laid down in Article 17 (17) is met. Article 28 (28) of the Treaty Article 4 (4) of the directive or while the same exemption is applied by an existing Member State, whichever is the earlier."
Description of the legislation in Germany
According to Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112 / EC of 28. November 2006, implemented by § 3 b (3). 1 German VAT Act is the place of delivery of passengers (i.e. transport services) route (i.e. place) where the transport takes place.
The German tax system therefore does not distinguish between national and international cross-border passenger transport.
Only the part of the route that takes place in Germany represents a taxable provision of transport in Germany.
The German tax system also does not distinguish between tax residents and non-residents.
If a tax non-resident transports passengers through Germany, the part of the route that takes place in Germany is also a taxable provision of transport.
A tax non-resident must notify his intention to provide passenger transport to the competent financial authority before he performs his services in Germany.
The IRS will register this non-resident tax (cf. 4.1.2) and issue a special certificate for any bus or coach specified in the taxpayer's notice.
The taxpayer is obliged to admit his taxable transportation provided in German tax return to VAT.
On March 1., 2006, the Chemnitz-Süd Finance Authority registered 741 Czech payers, who engaged in passenger transport.
If passenger transport is provided to a tax resident who is a VAT taxable person, the tax non-resident does not have to pay VAT to the tax office itself.
Instead, the tax resident who is the body who is liable to pay VAT to the tax authority and the net bill to the tax nonresident is the tax resident who is the recipient of the services; this process is known as the ′′ reverse charge ′′ and is in accordance with Article 196 Council Directive 2006/112 / EC.
In addition to the tax non-resident notification and his tax return on VAT, the German tax administration has several means to assess the correctness of the taxable provision of passenger transportation.
Customs office mobile inspection groups audit buses licensed (licensed) licenses for foreign transport used to transport passengers via Germany.
After each audit, mobile control groups shall send a control message to the competent financial authority.
If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group is entitled to demand VAT payment from the bus driver before continuing further transport.
A non-resident tax deduction of the VAT paid thus calculated in his VAT tax return.
If the IRS has doubts about the accuracy of the VAT return, it may announce the intention to carry out an audit that must be held in the office of the IRS or may use the means of administrative cooperation referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 (see 4.6).
Even if the tax non-resident refuses to pay the amount of VAT measured in accordance with its legal rate, the tax authority may apply for administrative cooperation under Council Directive 76/308 / EEC.
If a review of VAT tax return or the discharge of tax non-resident tax duties is to be carried out, BRH considers all these means of administrative cooperation to be too demanding in terms of workforce compared to the small amounts of VAT to be paid for taxable provision of passenger transport.
In particular, the audit of the tax non-resident accounts raises disproportionate costs for both the taxpayer and the tax administration.
Tax administration must audit foreign accounting, which does not only mean the need for foreign language knowledge, but also familiarity with foreign accounting standards.
An audit of this type is also likely to require more time than an audit of a tax resident, but this audit is limited to the provision of passenger transports taking place in Germany.
On the other hand, the tax non-resident may not only accept the right to carry out the checks due to his national tax administration, but also the right to audit by other Member States in which he transports passengers.
In addition, in every Member State in which only one provision of passenger transport takes place, the taxpayer is obliged to fulfil all the tax liabilities applicable to him in these Member States, in all languages and on all tax forms of these Member States.
The actual taxation of cross-border passenger transportation therefore incurs disproportionate bureaucratic costs.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation in both countries is different.
In the Czech Republic there is transport of persons between individual EU Member States or. between Member States and third countries, under the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic exempted from VAT with the right to deduct tax.
In Germany, the part of the transport taking place on German territory is taxable.
If this transport is provided by a non-established payer in Germany for the first time, it is required to inform the competent financial authority of the delivery of the transport.
The tax office of this payer registers and the payer is obliged to admit taxable supply of part of the transport in the tax return in the Germany.
Implementing the law is very time consuming in Germany.
At least three of the four Czech payers registered at the Chemnitz-Süd Finance Office are in passenger transport.
Compared to a given effort, the tax return, when implemented, is rather low.
Member States collecting VAT in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112 / EC of 28. November 2006 on the common system of VAT are burdened with time consuming duties without a financially sensitive outcome.
In order to avoid excessive costs to measure VAT, the provision of cross-border passenger transport should be taxed in one Member State only.
This could be the state where the transport starts or where the provider is located.
Such taxation would require modification of Council Directive 2006/112 / EC.
VAT tax returns
Submission and processing of tax returns for VAT in the Czech Republic
The payer is obliged to submit a VAT tax return on the form prescribed by MF within 25 days after the end of the tax period, even if the law does not provide otherwise.
Own tax liability is due within the deadline for filing VAT tax return, except for the tax charged with the importation of goods under Section 20 of Law No. 235/2004 Coll., for which the maturity of the tax is laid down by customs regulations.
If a refundable overpayment is caused due to the measurement of excessive deduction, the payer will return without request within 30 days of the measurement of excessive deduction.
The deadline is not applied when the tax manager initiates tax proceedings regarding the payer's tax liability.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 73 (73). Article 11 of Law No. 235/2004 Coll. the right to deduct the tax deduction may be applied in the proper VAT tax return no later than the last tax period of the calendar year in which the tax deduction could be applied.
Upon expiry of this period, the right to deduct the tax deduction may be further applied within 3 years of the end of the tax period in which the right to deduct the tax may have been applied first.
However, this is only possible by submitting additional tax return to VAT.
Amendment to law no. 235/2004 Coll. effective from 1. 1. 2005 allows additional tax return to VAT only for the period when the right to deduct the tax deduction could be applied for the first time.
The payer is obliged to submit additional VAT tax return if (a) the aggregate of the corrections increases the tax liability, (b) makes a repair where the last known tax liability does not change, but only data by the tax entity previously tempered, (c) makes the rate corrected and the amount of the tax according to Section 49 of Law No. 235/2004 Coll.
The payer may submit additional tax return to VAT if it reduces the tax liability by a summary of corrections.
Additional VAT tax return to the payer is required to submit by the end of the month following the finding of these facts.
Submission of tax return to VAT in electronic form can be carried out via the Internet network or on a technical data medium.
Submission after the Internet can be performed as a data report with a guaranteed electronic signature or as a submission with a data message without a guaranteed electronic signature.
In case of filing with a data report not guaranteed electronic signature, submission in writing is still required, i.e. delivery of the computer assembly to the tax administrator (e-form).
VAT tax return contains separate rows regarding intracommunitary supply / acquisition values.
Values of the acquisition of services are reported on special rows of VAT tax return.
Some lines are used for the purpose of initial automated inspection within ADIS.
Values of supply of goods to other Member States to taxable persons in other Member States shall be compared with the information given in the summary reports submitted by Czech payers.
The values of acquisition of goods from other Member States from tax persons in other Member States shall be compared with the values obtained through VIES system from the summary report of payers from other EU Member States.
The IRS is undergoing a test of credibility of VAT tax returns under the ADIS system.
This test is performed automatically, because without the test, tax returns to VAT cannot be measured.
The credibility test involves calculating the credibility criteria and evaluating risk types of VAT returns.
According to the provisions of Section 37 (37) Article 1 of Law No. 337/1992 Coll. the tax authority may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 000 (67 150) on a non-cash basis on a given period of time, or by a decision under this law. EUR).
Automated tax information system used by FÚ to support tax management.
The NKÚ check found that the tax authorities mostly did not use the opportunity to impose a fine on payers for not filing their VAT tax return.
Submission and processing of tax returns for VAT in Germany
In Germany we distinguish between preliminary monthly or quarterly VAT returns and annual VAT returns.
Those taxpayers who are obliged to submit preliminary VAT returns must still submit an annual VAT return.
Even small business owners who are not liable to pay VAT annual tax returns.
In general, taxpayers are required to submit a quarterly VAT return by the 10. th day of the month following the quarter in which VAT is incurred (§ 18 paragraph 18). 2 UStG).
However, if VAT tax liability exceeds EUR 136 in the previous calendar year 6 or in the case of a newly established business, the relevant businessman is required to submit a monthly VAT return by the 10. th day of the following month.
The taxpayer may also decide to submit a monthly VAT return if last year a tax refund exceeded EUR 6 136 (§ 18 paragraph 18). 2 and UStG).
VAT admission may not be made unless the amount of the annual VAT exceeds EUR 512
The relevant amount of VAT tax liability must be paid by the 10. th day of the month following the tax year in which VAT was incurred.
Tax refund may lead to an even more detailed investigation by FÚ
There are no time limits (according to the law) for processing tax returns and refund of excess VAT.
For the purpose of early tax refund it is possible to offer collateral of the amount to be refunded.
The basic principle is to process tax returns to VAT and return tax quickly.
German VAT law provides for an extension of this period (Section 18 (18) of the basic Regulation. 6 UStG).
Such extension must be applied separately.
It allows you to submit a VAT return and pay the relevant VAT tax liability a month later, provided that a special advance is paid for monthly returns.
This advance payment will be offset compared to December's VAT tax liability.
Whenever an error is found, the entrepreneur must submit a VAT tax return.
There is no additional VAT admission.
Once the annual VAT tax return, which must be filed by May 31. of the following calendar year, is registered with the IRS, the business owner cannot fix the wrong preliminary tax return, but only the annual VAT return.
Repair of the annual VAT tax return for the benefit or failure of the payer is possible within the next 4 years after the year in which the first annual VAT tax return was filed.
After these four years, the annual VAT tax return can normally be corrected only in cases of tax fraud or evasion.
Payers are obliged to submit preliminary tax returns to VAT electronically.
The financial authorities may apply exceptions to this rule to avoid disproportionate hardness.
Submission of annual VAT refund is possible in paper or via the Internet, either with or without certification.
If done without certification, the payer must submit a confession once again on a paper with personal signatures.
In case the payer does not file VAT returns, the tax administration is entitled to make a gross estimate of the taxpayer's turnover.
In case of late submission, the payer may be penalised (maximum of 10 % of the tax to be paid or EUR 25 000).
BH found during previous inspection that the financial authorities often do not measure this standard fine.
In other cases where the financial authorities imposed a fine, the amount was inconsistent and arbitrary.
Therefore, the standard fine does not fulfil its aim to shorten the average delay, especially when filing annual VAT tax return.
VAT tax return contains separate lines related to intracommunitary supply / acquisition values.
Values of the acquisition of services are reported on special rows of VAT tax return.
Non-taxable transactions must be reported on separate tax return / VAT line.
In the case of VAT return submitted in paper form, copy must be made either via a scanner or employees specifically designated for it.
Electronically VAT return data shall be immediately available to the tax authority.
Once all data are entered into the system, RMS staff will pass it and select cases that meet certain criteria.
The selected VAT returns must be rechecked by the financial authority on the basis of a control report drawn up by the system.
(see section 5.2).
Although the tax administration must grossly estimate the amount of VAT paid by the taxpayer, the estimated tax must be as accurate as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, payers submit their tax return to VAT within 25 days after the end of the tax period.
The taxation period depends on the amount of the payer's turnover, either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
In Germany, payers submit preliminary tax returns to VAT, depending on the previous year's tax liability, either within 10 days after the end of the calendar quarter or month.
By 31. May of the following year, payers are required to submit an annual tax return.
The obligation to submit annual VAT tax returns has its pros and cons:
+ at the end of the calendar year, the payer is able to correct errors in (monthly preliminary) tax returns by filing a single annual VAT return;
- if the payer corrects the admitted intracommunitary transactions, the repair cannot be related to the period for which the summary report is submitted;
- Federal states do not usually compare VIES data on intracommunitary acquisitions of German payers before processing annual VAT returns.
In accordance with registration (see. 4.1.3) German payers are obliged to submit annual VAT tax return regardless of their turnover.
This obligation enables the German financial authority to check the maximum turnover limit for small business owners.
Moreover, the responsible financial authority is able to compare annual VAT returns with direct tax returns and with closing accounts.
In the Czech Republic, tax administrators are able to determine the amount of the payer's turnover only on income tax returns.
Unlike the Czech Republic, payers in Germany have an obligation to submit VAT tax returns in electronic form.
The introduction of the obligation to file tax returns in the Czech Republic electronically would contribute to increasing the efficiency of the Czech tax administration.
Summary reports
Submission and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic
The summary report (hereinafter referred to as ′′ SH ′′) is submitted according to Section 102 of Law No. 235/2004 Coll. a payer who has delivered goods to another Member State to a taxable person in another Member State.
Data on the value of the goods supplied are always reported in Czech currency broken down by tax entities, indicating their VAT ID under which they are registered in their country.
Data on services provided are not included in SH.
SH shall serve payers with monthly and quarterly tax periods for each calendar quarter within 25 days after its end to the local competent financial authority.
Fixing the wrong data is done in the subsequent SH within 15 days of the date of error finding.
The erroneous data given in SH are always replaced by the data given in the subsequent SH.
Just like tax returns, payers and SH can submit in electronic form.
In case the payer does not submit SH or subsequent SH and had them under law no. 235/2004 Coll. submit, the tax administrator will invite him to submit him and at the same time instruct him about the consequences in case of failure to submit SH or subsequent SH, i.e. that the tax manager is under Section 37 of Law No. 337/1992 Coll. entitled to repeatedly impose a fine up to CZK 2 000 (EUR 67 150) for failure to fulfil obligations of a non-cash nature.
The NKÚ check found that the tax authorities mostly did not use the opportunity to impose a fine on the payers for failing to comply with their legal obligations.
Especially in the case of SH filing, tax entities are not sufficiently motivated to perform their duties, because SH failure to submit does not affect VAT tax liability.
The tax administrator is obliged according to § 102 (102) 5 law no. 235/2004 Coll. data in SH, or subsequent SH, check, delete any inconclusiveness and use data for taxation.
In case of non-compliance with SH data and data in the relevant (payer with monthly taxation period) or the relevant (payer with quarterly taxation period) VAT tax return, the tax manager should verify the correctness of the tax liability given in the VAT tax return.
The wrong data in SH will be removed by filing a subsequent SH himself or may be called upon to do so.
The tax administrator shall correct the data on the supply of goods to other Member States in the ADIS system if:
- the payer will not demonstrate the data given in SH (or subsequent SH), correcting them by submitting subsequent SH,
- the tax administrator has demonstrated that the data given by the payer in SH or subsequent SH are not true.
The tax administrator does not replace the filing of the tax body by the payer by entering a repair without submission of the subsequent SH payer, only adjusts the data in the VIES database so that they are up to date, complete and accurate.
Data from SH shall be sent to the Member States concerned.
Only a national financial authority can send and receive them, designed to cooperate with other Member States in the VAT area; this is CLO (in the Czech Republic, the International Cooperation Department of VAT Management (CLO).
O _ MCTL is an automatic message received by CLO from other Member States.
Includes all erroneous VAT IDs listed in SH rows sent.
If the wrong VAT ID is used in one of the common SH or subsequent SH rows, the record is made into the wrong VAT ID table.
The table contains so-called. ′′ Notice of doubt to VAT ID ".
The tax administrator will check and record the result of the verification in the system.
When goods are acquired from another Member State, the payer is obliged to award VAT and indicate the values of acquisition on separate lines of VAT return.
Selected cases of irregularities in the value of goods purchased declared by the Czech payer in his VAT tax return and in the value of the goods supplied, as reported by payers from other Member States in their SH, are sent from the CLO to the IRS for examination.
Tax administrators have a duty to investigate the irregularities.
There may be three situations:
(a) The value declared by the Czech payer in the respective lines of VAT tax returns is lower than the value of delivery declared by EU payers.
In this case the tax administrator will check the accuracy of the data.
b) The difference is 0.
This situation can either happen by changing EU data (foreign supplier corrects its SH) or by changing the data in the tax return to VAT (the Czech tax entity himself lodges additional tax return to VAT).
In this case, it is up to the tax manager's discretion whether despite this fact he will verify the accuracy of the data in the VAT tax return.
c) The value of the acquisition of goods from other Member States, which the Czech tax payer has shown in the relevant VAT lines, is higher than the value of the goods supplied declared by the EU payer.
Even here it is at the discretion of the administrator whether it will verify the accuracy of the data.
After checking the difference and clarifying the causes of its creation, the tax administrator will introduce the result of the verification into ADIS.
The results of the verification are transmitted back to CLO.
The number of cases sent from CLO to the financial authorities for examination for each quarter of 2005 shows graph no. 1 (Note: source: MF).
The above graph no. 1 demonstrates that the number of cases transmitted from CLO to the financial authorities in each quarter of 2005 decreased.
A significant decrease in number occurred in the 4. th quarter of 2005. CLO increased the minimum financial limit, including. with regard to the possibility of sending information requests to other EU Member States.
The discrepancy between VAT tax returns and EU data may not always be caused by a fault on the side of the domestic payer.
It can also be a mistake on the EU payer side or a mistake arising from the fact that in individual EU Member States some types of transactions can be introduced into SH in a different way.
The most common reasons for irregularities in the values of the reported transactions found at the inspected financial authorities are given table 1.
Submission and processing of summary reports in Germany
Entrepreneurs who carry out intracommunitary delivery from Germany to other EU Member States or participate in trilateral transactions shall be required to serve SH once every quarter of a year, which indicate intracommunitary delivery according to beneficiaries (§ 18 a (odst 18 a). 1 UStG).
SH must be submitted by the 10. th day of the month following the relevant calendar quarter.
If extension of this deadline is allowed in case of preliminary VAT returns, this applies to SH as well.
SH must be delivered to CLO.
From 1. January 2007 they must be administered electronically.
Exceptions may be allowed by the competent financial authorities to certain taxpayers to avoid excessive hardness.
In cases where taxpayers realize that SH has false data, they are required to submit a corrective report within one month.
In case taxpayers do not submit SH, CLO will initiate proceedings in order to make this report possible.
Part of this procedure is: - the first reminder - the second reminder associated with the threat of a fine / penalty payment and - penalty payment.
Although the German tax code allows a fine of up to EUR 25 000 (§ 329 AO), the CLO measures fines in three steps, amounts 125, 250 and 500 EUR.
Besides, § 26 a (26) 1 no. UStG 5 stipulates payers act illegally unless they deliberately or negligently administrate SH, serve them incomplete, do not submit them on time or if they do not repair or repair the late SH.
This offense can be punished with a fine of up to EUR 5 000
Intracommunitary supply data cannot be entered by the VIES by the IRS because SH processing is the sole task of the CLO.
SH data are stored only in the CLO system.
Data from SH are therefore visually available only after processing to CLO.
Deadlines for SH processing are set in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
SH data must be stored within three months after the relevant calendar quarter.
In case of incorrect VAT ID in SH German payers, CLO receives O _ MCTL codes from another Member State.
The CLO contacts a particular businessman and asks for correct information.
If the CLO fails to obtain the correct information, the case shall be transmitted to the competent financial authorities.
It is then up to these financial authorities to request the correct data.
During the inspection, BRH found that most VAT ID entrepreneurs have repaired at CLO request.
However, the challenge, threat and measuring three additional fines works in cases where the payer may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud, too much time.
These cases, which were eventually reported to the competent financial authorities, were usually completed within one or two months.
The IRS rejected the exemption of reported intracommunitary delivery in 73 % of these cases.
When the payer provided the correct VAT ID, the IRS asked him to submit a repaired SH to CLO, since the tax authorities cannot repair data in VIES themselves.
BRH found that neither the financial authorities nor the CLO checked the filing of the repaired SH, so the payers often failed to comply with the request.
Due to the fact that the CLO has no access to VAT return data, a comparison of the delivery data of goods admitted in the VAT return and SH will not take place before submitting this data to the CLO of other Member States.
Only the financial authorities can carry out this inspection and is usually applied in the preparation of the VAT check.
Data obtained from other Member States are processed into CLO.
Wrong VAT ID are selected and then submitted to the Member States concerned.
This data is used for the purpose of inspection of acquisition by the financial authorities.
Once they are entered into the system, CLO will recheck them based on comparison with previous calendar quarter data.
If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), inspection information is created and sent to the competent financial authorities.
This procedure is applied permanently, while the compilation of data on the acquisition of goods or services for all VAT payers is created later and submitted to the financial authorities.
The RMS installed for the assessment procedure will subsequently check these data with intracommunitary acquisitions data.
This system completely covers those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to VAT deduction.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, payers who delivered goods to another Member State serve a taxable person in another Member State within 25 days after the end of the calendar quarter to the local tax authority.
The tax authorities process SH and transmit the data to CLO.
Values of supply of goods to another Member State, listed by the payer in SH, are compared at the financial authorities with the value of the supply of goods to another Member State, given by these payers in VAT tax returns.
The results of the comparison are used in the measurement procedure.
In Germany, payers who made intracommunitary delivery are obliged to serve SH quarterly until day 10. of the following calendar quarter.
SH payers serve on CLO, from 1. 1. 2007 in electronic form.
Tax authorities have SH information available only after it is processed into CLO.
Payers from Czech Republic and Germany mention only the delivery of goods in SH, the provision of services is not listed in SH.
Unlike Czech financial authorities, German financial authorities are unable to correct the wrong lines submitted by SH.
Due to this limited access to German VIES data, the wrong VAT ID was not corrected, although the payer provided the correct VAT ID.
German tax administration does not compare data on intracommunitary supplies, which are given in the tax return to the German payer and its SH.
The differences between the data of these two statements are not usually identified before the German CLO provides VIES data to other Member States.
Given the findings of BRH, it is clear that comparison would increase the reliability of the data transmitted in VIES.
The data on the supply of goods to Czech payers, delivered from other Member States, are compared in the Czech Republic with data on the acquisition of goods from other Member States declared by Czech payers in their tax returns for VAT.
The comparison is performed by the CLO separately for each calendar quarter.
The most important cases of irregularities are handed over to the financial authorities as a reminder of possible errors in payer s' tax returns.
Unlike the Czech tax administration, the German tax administration does not usually control the taxation of intracommunitary acquisitions.
Such a general inspection is only processed for payers who are not fully entitled to VAT deduction.
Moreover, the German tax administration checks the taxation of intracommunitary acquisitions of other payers only if RMS produces a control alert or if the payer is intended for inspection anyway.
This procedure relieves the financial authorities from the need to clarify the reasons for each difference.
On the other hand, VAT fraud detection depends on the quality of RMS.
Carousel scams fighting requires continuously updated information on intracommunitary acquisitions as soon as possible.
The current SH system, specially VIES, provides financial authorities with information that could be up to six months old.
This delay can be shortened by up to four months if the payers serve SH monthly.
Monthly filing would not be a significant increase in bureaucratic costs, because most payers in the Czech Republic and Germany are required to submit VAT returns monthly - and SH does not require any further information compared to tax returns.
In order to prevent bureaucratic costs, the submission of SH may be associated with filing a VAT return.
However, the obligation to serve SH monthly would cause more time disagreements between intracommunitary delivery and intracommunitary acquisition and could increase data flow between individual CLOs.
The German Federal Government in 2006 considered general provision of monthly SH.
Its implementation failed due to federal state s' doubts.
These were worried that monthly submission of VIES data to the CLO of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In fact, if the duty of monthly SH and monthly data transmission were to be effective, monthly update of VIES would require a European standard of monthly SH.
Statistical data on the delivery and acquisition of goods between Czech Republic and Germany
As part of foreign trade, Germany represents the most important business partner for the Czech Republic.
The total volume of intracommunitary transactions in goods between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in Table No. 2.
Both SAIs requested data on the number of erroneous VAT ID or VAT IDs, contained in the O _ MCTL reports transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany for each quarter of the controlled period.
These data are contained in the following tables.
The data shows substantial differences.
Different bases for determining the number of O _ MCTL reports may cause these differences.
While Czech CLO covers their numbers for the calendar quarter for which SH was submitted, the German CLO covers their numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O _ MCTL report was received.
International level 3 information exchange
Implementation of international information exchange in Czech Republic
International exchange of information allows tax administrators to acquire information from other Member States regarding intracommunitary business transactions and payers who made these transactions.
Council Regulation (EC) No On administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 1798/2003 218/92, distinguishes between two basic categories of information exchange, namely the exchange of information on request and exchange of information without prior request.
International exchange of information on request is made in the form of the so-called. requests for information (hereinafter referred to as ′′ ŽOI ′′), using standardized SCAC forms.
Tax administrators from the Czech Republic send their ŽOI or. replies to the ŽOI delivered via the CLO Financial Directorates, ensuring the translation of information contained in standardised SCAC forms into foreign language and sending it to other Member States.
The CLO also ensures the income of ŽOI from other Member States and replies to the ŽOI sent, translation into Czech and distribution to local tax administrators.
In Article 8 Council Regulation (EC) No 8 1798/2003 the maximum deadline for the operation of the ŽOI is set for 3 months after the application is accepted.
NKÚ checks were subjected to all ŽOI transmitted during the controlled period between the Czech Republic and Germany.
Out of the total of 94 ŽOI, accepted in the Czech Republic from Germany, there were 70 cases (i.e. 74,5 %) finished within a specified three-month deadline, 23 more cases (i.e. 24,5 %) was finished after this deadline and the remaining 1 case was not sent to Germany until the NKÚ check.
More detailed information about the deadlines in which replies to the ŽOI received from the Czech Republic were sent from the Czech Republic, contains graph no. 2.
Out of the total of 335 ŽOI sent from the Czech Republic to Germany, there were 136 cases (i.e. 40,6 %) response received within the specified three months deadline, another 179 (i.e. 53,4 %) the request was answered after this period and 19 cases (i.e. 5,7 %) no response from Germany was delivered until the NKÚ check (in the remaining 1 cases it was not possible to determine when the reply from the FRN was received).
More detailed information about the deadlines in which answers to the Czech Republic were delivered to the Czech Republic to the Czech Republic, graph no contains 3.
The percentage of the values of intracommunitary transactions, given in ŽOI transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany, contains graph No. 4.
As seen from the above graph, the value of business transactions, tested via ŽOI, was most frequently in the zone above EUR 60 000
The international exchange of information without prior request takes place either in the form of automatic or in the form. structured automatic exchange of information or in the form of spontaneous information exchange.
Tax administrators from other Member States are often transmitted without prior request information which may be relevant to them in the management of VAT.
In the Czech Republic all information is collected at CLO.
Information is transmitted electronically between Member States.
'Automatic exchange' shall apply according to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 means the systematic communication of predetermined information to other Member States without prior request and at pre-specified regular intervals.
'Structured automatic exchange' means the systematic communication of predetermined information to other Member States without prior request and as soon as the information is available.
The Czech Republic provides other Member States with information about the delivery of new means of transport in the form of automatic exchange.
This information is available to tax administrators from the form Report on delivery of a new means of transport under Section 19 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. and from a copy of the tax document issued.
The tax administrator shall complete the necessary data to a specially created template when processing the aforementioned form and transmit it to the contact worker at the financial director where the data are collected and within the specified deadline, i.e. notified to the CLO for subsequent processing and transmission to other Member States within two months of the end of the quarter in which this information was available.
Furthermore, the Czech Republic provides other Member States with information about the dispatch sale, which is exempt from VAT in the Member State of origin, information about intra-EU operations that appear unauthorized and information about potential ′′ missing traders ".
This information is sent to other Member States by means of spontaneous exchange using the SCAC form.
Implementation of international information exchange in Germany
In Germany, both requests for information and spontaneous information are initiated by the competent tax authority.
The financial authorities send the completed SCAC 2004 form via e-mail directly to the German CLO transmitting SCAC forms to foreign CLO.
The financial authorities were instructed to write their requests for information or their own spontaneous information only in German; even the SCAC form used is not multilingual.
Half of Germany's requests for information controlled by BRH were sent to ensure taxation of intracommunitary acquisition in another Member State or to demonstrate exemption of intracommunitary delivery from Germany to another Member State from tax.
If a German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it will check the value of the supply of goods or services specified in the application for a minimum limit of EUR 15 000
If there is no reasonable reason for this application, the German CLO will reject any application containing an amount lower than this specified limit.
In addition, German CLO translates free texts of the SCAC form [(B1- 17) or (E)], unless these texts are in German or English.
To respond to the request for information, CLO sends the application to the competent financial authority with a reference to the three-month deadline.
There are no other deadlines for processing applications at specific organisational levels of tax administration.
Although German CLO has technical conditions for monitoring the past time limits, it lacks sufficient personnel capacity to draw the attention of the financial authorities to the response of unsuccessful requests for information.
The financial authorities will obtain the necessary information by sending a letter to the taxpayer or by auditing.
Auditors usually choose between two different types of audits: a special VAT audit, which concerns any taxable process over a few months or so-called VAT inspection, which can relate to only one business operation that has recently been carried out.
This short and flexible type of audit requires no notification to the taxpayer and proved its beneficial effect in the investigation of individual taxable commercial operations.
Under automatic exchange without prior request, Germany provides information to other Member States - VAT ID allocated to payers resident in other Member States - on the refund of entry tax to payers resident in other Member States.
Moreover, Germany has committed itself to providing other Member States with the following information through a structured automatic exchange:
and. Delivery of new means of transport to entrepreneurs without using their VAT ID, b. sending or catalog sales in other Member States not taxable in Germany, c. significant differences between intracommunitary acquisitions declared by the payer and VIES data provided by other Member States, d. intracommunitary delivery of goods not shown by the German payer in SH because he treated the delivery as domestic transactions, e. potential ′′ missing trader ′′ that carried out intracommunitary transactions independently of their VAT ID, f. business owners who delivered goods to potential ′′ missing traders ′′ or to those beneficiaries who abused their VAT ID.
Comparison and evaluation
The sending of ŽOI or spontaneous information is initiated by the competent financial authorities in both Czech Republic and Germany, which send the completed SCAC form to the CLO.
While Czech CLO uses the bilingual SCAC form (Czech - English) and translates the sent information into English or English. German language, German financial authorities follow the instructions according to which they should write ŽOI or spontaneous information only in German on a single language form.
German CLO does not secure the translation of German texts.
By checking the ŽOI transmitted between 1. August 5. and 31. August 12. between the Czech Republic and Germany found out that the Czech tax administration has handled 74,5 % of the applications received within a specified three-month period, while ŽOI dispatched to Germany were executed by the German tax administration within the specified time limit only 40,6 % of cases.
Although German CLO alerts the financial authorities to the three-month deadline, it does not follow the past time limits.
The result of missing notifications is a large number of late replies to ŽOI.
Due to these issues, BRH recommended regular alerts to CLO.
The situation has already improved.
According to the latest information, German CLO now alerts the financial authorities to answer the unfinished answers to ŽOI.
VAT risk management
Risk management in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, several departments at various tax administration organisational levels deal with risk management.
The following departments address the issue of risk management and the fight against VAT fraud:
Department of Methodology and Performance of VAT Risk Management Report, which, inter alia, governs the selection of risks of possible tax evasion and evaluates trends of these risks at both domestic and community levels.
Nationwide coordinates the functioning of the role of Trustworthiness of VAT tax returns and the use of VIES data in terms of tax evasion risks in intra-communitarian transactions.
Based on data from the Czech trade balance, the Czech Republic evaluates risk commodities, processes conceptual risk management in the field of VAT and cooperates in this area with relevant EU institutions and other Member States.
Department of International Cooperation in the Management of VAT, which, among other things, is the same. ensures exchange of VAT information, participates in the creation and maintenance of information databases, analyses data from other Member States contained in the VIES system, ensures public awareness and ensures other forms of international cooperation within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
Both SAIs requested data on the number of erroneous VAT ID or VAT IDs, contained in the O _ MCTL reports transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany for each quarter of the controlled period.
These data are contained in the following tables.
The data shows substantial differences.
Different bases for determining the number of O _ MCTL reports may cause these differences.
While Czech CLO covers their numbers for the calendar quarter for which SH was submitted, the German CLO covers their numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O _ MCTL report was received.
Department of Methodology Tax Control and Search, which inter alia conducts a risk analysis in the methodological management of tax checks and in accordance with risk analysis, sets priorities for the focus of tax checks in the plans of the financial directorate, processes risk analysis in the framework of tax evasion restrictions, including the collection of knowledge gained during tax management and other sources, and proposes measures to reduce tax evasion.
Financial directors have set up search departments, which are performing, among others. searches of tax entities and areas that are at risk in terms of tax fraud (e.g. online shops, gold, pharmaceutical industry), searching for unregistered tax entities in terms of tax evasion risks (e.g. from internet services, work brokerage, radio and printing services etc.), analysis of chain fraud bonds and transmission of information to territorial financial authorities.
Specialized inspection department is set up at selected 12 financial authorities.
They have regional competence, tax checks outside the territorial scope of the financial authorities under mandate.
The need to set up a separation of specialised tax checks came from the growing findings of new and more perfect forms of tax evasion, which mainly occur with entities connected to chains.
These departments focus on controlling fiscal entities according to the requirements of the search department, tax entities with specific activity and multinational companies and tax entities of a large scale of activity in terms of turnover size.
The following mechanisms were integrated into the ADIS system to reduce risks in the field of VAT: - the task of credibility of VAT tax returns, used to evaluate the risk of tax returns filed, - the role of the selection of tax entities for inspection, allowing the selections based on selected criteria of the payer for inspection, - the role of the task VIES through which tax administrators have access to data provided from other EU Member States.
The role of VIES enables, inter alia, to verify the validity of VAT ID of payers from other Member States, - to obtain from other Member States the values of goods supplied to a Czech payer declared in SH by all its suppliers from other Member States, - to generate a set of payers who did not submit SH, - carry out a formal check of data reported by the Czech payers in SH before sending such data to other Member States, - generate a set of payers where the data on the supply of goods to other Member States listed in VAT tax returns do not match the data in SH, - generate a set of payers where the value of acquisition of goods from other Member States listed in VAT tax returns does not match the data declared in SH by all its suppliers from other Member States.
As part of the tax evasion risk reduction activity, tax administrators have access to registries of state authorities such as: business register, real estate cadastre, motor vehicle registry, business registry etc.
More detailed information is given in Chapter 4.4.1 Submission and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic.
Risk management in Germany
Due to the Federal (Federal) structure of Germany, the Federal Tax Administration (especially CLO) and the tax administration of 16 Federal States are involved in the development and operation of RMS.
Although there are common working groups for developments, neither CLO nor tax administrations of federal states share a completely consistent database.
At CLO level, the ST I 2 (hereinafter referred to as ′′ KUSS ′′ - the coordination unit for special VAT audits and tax investigations) collects the findings of the tax fraud control in a special database called the OPUS.
KUSS introduced a new database called ZAUBER designed for the transfer of tax fraud company names ′′ missing traders ′′ in cooperation with the financial authorities.
KUSS coordinates related cases of national and cross-border tax fraud.
KUSS experience is projected into RMS development in working groups.
In addition, specialists of several other CLO and MF services are entrusted with RMS duties and powers.
At CLO level, a formal inspection of the composition of VAT ID of other Member States in SH submitted by German payers is introduced.
This formal inspection is carried out before shipping data from SH to other Member States to improve clarity and use of VIES data provided (see 4.4.2).
Verification of validity of VAT ID specified in SH is performed on the basis of O _ MCTL codes provided by other Member States (for the repair of invalid VAT ID, see. also 4.4.2).
In addition, the CLO RMS is based on VIES data transmitted by other Member States and produces several types of control messages based on several characteristics, which are usually called. carousel business operations to identify potential ′′ missing traders ".
The Federal State s' financial authorities are instructed to process these inspection reports and report in some cases on the results of their CLO findings.
The BRH audit findings confirmed that it is necessary to take into account all the available characteristics if the existence of a tax fraud case is likely to be expected (instead of sole focus on company turnover).
Therefore, BRH suggested the MF to take into account various characteristics when processing reports.
RMS should also affect other facts, such as taxpayer's (morale) payment behaviour, field (economic activity) or shareholder structure.
The second level of RMS is processed in the tax administrations of the Federal States and focused on the processing of VAT tax returns.
For example, RMS generates a list of those payers who showed intracommunitary delivery in tax returns.
This list is sent to CLO to monitor full SH administration.
In addition, this type of RMS compares the intracommunitary acquisition reported in the payer's annual VAT tax return with VIES data.
Tax Administration of the Federal States seeks to avoid comparing quarterly data, because this comparison would reveal too much disagreement data attributed to reasons other than tax evasion or tax fraud; for example:
- a different period of implementation of the intracommunitary transaction in the opinion of the supplier on the one hand and the beneficiary on the other;
- different accounts on sales discounts and sales promotions (incentives) and their different reporting in tax returns.
In addition to comparing VAT tax returns data and VIES data, many Federal States have introduced RMS elements based on VAT tax returns data and some other facts (such as company name structure, shareholder age, employee number and payment behavior / morale of taxpayer).
Bavaria has introduced RMS based on rules that allow a team of tax fraud specialists (hereinafter referred to as risk managers) to program their own rules for earning potential tax fraud offenders.
This RMS is applied when the tax authorities process the monthly tax return for VAT.
Therefore, the competent tax authority receives recommendations made by RMS before the VAT determination.
Since this RMS is not able to project current findings into its activity, risk managers must adjust the relevant rules based on the feedback of the financial authorities.
The Mecklenburg-West Pomerania administration programmed an adaptive artificial neural network with data of tax files in which the inspection revealed tax evasion.
Based on this data, RMS is able to identify the characteristics of tax evasion.
RMS produces once a month a list of tax files suspected of tax evasion.
The competent financial authorities use this list as a basis for the audit decision of proposed taxpayers.
Following the audit, auditors must report their findings in order to be projected into RMS.
North Rhine-Westphalia Administrative Region uses adaptive artificial neural network that is combined with a system of fuzzy based on rules.
Based on the large number of data assessed VAT tax returns and some other facts, this neural fuzzy system or potentially useful information collection system (called. data-mining system) calculates the probability that a taxpayer committed a tax fraud.
He then compiles a monthly list of potential scam offenders.
Local financial authorities use this list as a basis for selecting the taxpayers concerned for inspection and announce the findings of the data processing center.
The introduction of one of these three RMS in the other spolkových is further underway.
Since none of these three RMS are based on the same approach, a combination of all systems seems useful to solve tax fraud.
The question remains whether this system will lead to expected results.
Comparison and evaluation
Although this report cannot discuss specific RMS criteria in the Czech Republic and Germany, NKÚ and BRH found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.
As well as different approaches in three Federal states of Germany, the RMS of each EU state has its strengths and weaknesses.
The tax authorities of EU Member States are currently discussing new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.
VAT fraud - especially carousel fraud - turns out not to be a national but rather a European problem.
Payers in fraudulent activities act simultaneously not only in one Member State but in multiple states.
Effective RMS cannot be developed by just one Member State.
Successful RMS criteria, components and approaches must be exchanged and introduced in every EU Member State, otherwise the scammers will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS.
VAT loss caused by fraud in the EU does not have to intervene by the Member State of the fraud initiator.
Any Member State involved in fraudulent activities may be affected.
Therefore, there should be a European exchange and discussion about RMS.
Selected inspection findings when verifying commercial transactions
In the framework of cooperation on the implementation of parallel control events, NKÚ and BRH tested the quality and use of information about selected commercial transactions, which were the subject of international exchange of information between the tax administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.
The two supervisory institutions also jointly examined the implementation of several commercial transactions, where there were doubts about their implementation, or. irregularities in the way payers from both countries reported these commercial transactions in their tax returns to VAT or SH.
NKÚ checked a total of 8 cases involving commercial transactions between 8 Czech and 8 German tax entities at the request of BRH.
In 43 cases, NKÚ checked the value of intracommunitary transactions with Germany, which Czech payers reported in their tax returns and SH due to the BRH alert.
AT the request of the NKÚ, BRH checked a total of 23 cases involving commercial transactions between 23 German and 21 Czech tax entities.
Important information has been exchanged under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 via official communication with CLO.
The examination of selected cases was among others. a different method of registration in EU Member States found to lead to problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:
1.
According to data in VIES, the Czech payer should have been bought in III. quarter 2004 from the German payer of goods worth EUR 60 500
Since the Czech payer showed the acquisition of goods only worth EUR 29 869, the Czech tax manager sent a request to the Czech tax manager to the Czech Republic for a verification of the value of the goods supplied.
In reply to the ŽOI delivered from Germany, the German party stated that in II. quarter of 2004, German payer supplied the Czech payer with goods worth EUR 27 381, in III. quarter worth EUR 31 997 and IV. quarter 2004 worth EUR 10 276
The reply further revealed that the German payer's VAT ID was valid only from 28. August 9., but German CLO in 2006 following additional application by the German payer for validity certificate VAT ID retroactively issued a valid VAT ID certificate from 1. 5. 2004.
The German payer did a repair of SH.
The Czech payer was based on this information about the acquisition of goods.
NKÚ found by a local tax administrator in the Czech Republic that the Czech payer submitted additional VAT tax returns for each tax period 2004, in which he increased the value of goods acquired from other Member States while exercising the right to deduction VAT on the acquisition of goods from other Member States.
However, from these additional tax returns to VAT, the Czech tax manager could not clearly determine whether they included the value of the supply from the above German supplier.
Based on NKÚ request, BRH found that a German supplier was registered for VAT in September 2003.
However, since he did not apply for VAT ID on registration, he was only assigned an ID for transactions within the FRN.
Although it is not usually possible to allocate VAT ID retroactively in Germany, in this case the German tax official assigned VAT ID retroactively to the above German payer in 1.5.2004.
German CLO allocates VAT ID retroactively unless the German entrepreneur caused the delay in the allocation; for example, if the delay caused the CLO after the payer's VAT ID application.
In this case, CLO allocates VAT ID retroactively because the entrepreneur does not need his own valid VAT ID for intracommunitary delivery under Section 6 of the German VAT Act.
On the contrary, the German recipient does not need a valid VAT ID of its supplier to report intracommunitary acquisition.
Due to these various procedures between Member States, German CLO allocated VAT ID retroactively in this special case.
2.
The Czech tax administrator asked for VAT registration of the German tax payer as part of the international exchange of information.
VIES stated the date of registration on 5. June 3., with the date 1. 2004. on the certificate of registration of the German payer issued locally by the competent German financial authority.
In a response received from Germany, the German party stated that the German tax entity was registered from 1. 10. 2004, but VAT ID was provided to him in Germany for organizational reasons up to 16. 2. 2005.
NKÚ by question at the local tax manager, found that the Czech tax manager carried out a VAT check with the Czech tax payer for the tax period III. quarter 2004 to II. quarter 2005.
Through this inspection, the IRS found that the Czech payer included a VAT service of CZK 9 (EUR 314) in the tax return, provided to the German payer at the time prior to his VAT registration (i.e. before 1. th June 10.).
For tax period III. quarter of 2004, the tax authority measured VAT of 1 880 CZK (EUR 60) to the tax agency.
The BRH found out, based on NKÚ's request, the German payer was allocated up to 16. 2. 2005 when he informed the IRS about his business he launched in 2004.
In addition, the IRS registered it for VAT retrospectively on October 1., 200415 to monitor the submission of the annual VAT return for 2004.
In this tax return, the payer showed an intracommunitary acquisition from the Czech Republic worth EUR 160 (approx. 5000 CZK).
3. The Czech payer reported VAT tax return for September 2004 and SH for III. quarter 2004 delivery of goods worth CZK 114 (EUR 3 642) to the German payer.
The Czech tax administrator found out when verifying the registration of the German payer in VIES system that his registration was valid from 11. 11. 2004, i.e. only after delivery of goods by Czech payer to Germany.
The Czech payer submitted additional DAP to VAT, showing the tax base for transactions in the country worth 114 615 CZK (EUR 3 642) and VAT of CZK 21 (692 EUR) paid for.
NKÚ found by a question at the local competent tax office in the Czech Republic that the Czech payer subsequently submitted an application for a revision of the proceedings regarding the additional tax return to VAT and presented a confirmation of the German tax administration that the German payer was taxed from 1. 1. 2000.
Therefore, the Czech tax administrator verified the validity of registration of the German payer in international information exchange.
The response received from Germany showed that VAT ID was allocated to the German payer up to 11. 11. 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods.
For this reason, the tax administrator in the Czech Republic rejected the application for renewal.
BRH found out that in the present case it was not an intracommunitary acquisition of goods because the German payer obtained VAT ID up to 11.11.2004.
However, the German recipient reported the acquisition as an intracommunitary acquisition and declared VAT on this acquisition when demanding the input tax refund of the same amount.
However, because there would not be changes in the value of VAT that the German payer had to pay, the tax manager in Germany did not correct the data in his VAT return.
BRH further found that the name of the German payer, listed in ŽOI, was changed during the processing of the response in Germany, resulting in two German tax entities confusing.
This change in the name of the German payer confused the Czech tax manager.
4.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax manager verified the acquisition of goods by a Czech payer in I. quarter 2005 worth EUR 22 686 from the German payer.
NKU found out by a local tax administrator in the Czech Republic that this administrator carried out a local investigation with the Czech payer verifying that the delivery of goods was carried out and the Czech payer charged and paid the invoice for the goods in question.
The Czech payer did not confess the acquisition of goods in VAT tax return, because the German supplier did not state his VAT ID on the tax document, but only the tax number intended for national transactions in Germany.
In VIES application, the Czech tax manager found out that the German payer was registered to VAT for intracommunitary transactions only from 21. 4. 2005, i.e. only after delivery to the Czech payer.
At the same time, the Czech tax manager asked the German tax administration to send a copy of the certificate of registration of the German payer so that he could take steps to pay tax if necessary.
The Czech Financial Authority assessed the commercial transaction as acquisition of goods from the non-payer from Germany and therefore the Czech payer on the said commercial transaction was not taxed.
BRH found that according to German legislation, a VAT ID does not have to have a VAT ID allocated to intracommunitary supply of goods exempted from VAT.
The supplier must only have VAT ID available to the customer from another Member State and be able to demonstrate the transport of the goods to another Member State.
According to the German VAT Act, it was an intracommunitary transaction and VAT should be measured in the Czech Republic.
In any case, it is important that the Czech tax manager noticed this transaction, because the delivery of the machine at the value was not the basic subject of the German supplier's business.
As described in Chapter 4.6.2, the German CLO refuses to respond to ŽOI regarding intracommunitary transactions with a value of less than EUR 15 000: 5.
According to data from VIES in III, the Czech payer had a Czech payer. quarter of 2004 to buy goods from a German payer worth EUR 12 561
The Czech tax administrator carried out a tax check on the tax agency for this tax period.
In international administrative cooperation, he asked the German tax administration via the SCAC form to verify the delivery of the goods.
The Czech payer denied the acquisition of goods, claimed that he had never traded with the German company and in his accounts the acquisition of these goods was not accounted for.
The German tax administration rejected the request for evidence - contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents, justifying that the turnover was not more than EUR 15 000 and no further explanatory reasons were given.
Since the Czech tax manager did not obtain evidence for the measurement of the tax on the goods purchased, he ended the tax check without finding and the tax obligation remained in the original amount.
The BRH found that the German payer performed as the so-called based on the NKÚ request. ′′ fiscal representative ′′ (§ 22 a - e UStG).
The German payer showed the said supply in its annual VAT tax return and SH.
The claim to exemption of delivery has been recognized.
Based on the BRH alert, the German financial authority will send documents needed to the Czech Republic for measuring the tax on acquired goods in the Czech Republic.
As stated in chapter 4.6.1, the answers to the ŽOI sent from Germany to the Czech Republic exceeded the three-month deadline more often than replies from Czech Republic to Germany: 6.
NKU found out by inspection that the Czech tax administration sent a request for information to Germany on 5. th quarter of 2004. to check the value of the goods supplied.
The German payer reported the delivery of goods to a Czech payer worth EUR 86 307 in the same period, but the Czech payer reported the acquisition of goods only of EUR 35 314 in the VAT tax return.
In response to ŽOI, delivered to the Czech Republic on 9. 5. 2006, i.e. after the expiry of the deadline for processing, provided for in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 8 1798/2003, the German party stated that the application could not be completed because the operation of the German company was closed at the end of 2005
The Czech tax administration did not comply with the deadline for ŽOI, the Czech tax administration did not have the documents needed for tax proceedings in the Czech Republic.
7. The Czech tax administrator requested in 2005 via the SCAC form to verify the delivery of cars worth EUR 1 265 554 to the German payer, performed in III. and IV. quarter 2004 showing signs of carousel fraud.
NKÚ found out that ZOI had not been delivered from Germany until the time of inspection.
The NKÚ further found out by a question from the local tax manager that the Czech payer did not include the delivery of new means of transport for the German payer in VAT tax return for the said German payer worth 11 816 CZK (EUR 375 472).
The Czech tax administrator corrected the data in the tax return and the Czech tax agency filed the subsequent SH.
According to NKÚ request, the BRH found that for technical reasons the German CLO did not transmit the aforementioned ZOI to the local competent financial authority for examination.
Following the BRH alert, a German customer was inspected in Germany, which found that all cars were properly taxed and that the relevant cars were sold to another payer in Germany.
8. According to VIES data, the Czech payer should have been bought in IV. quarter 2004 from the German payer passenger car worth EUR 48 500
The Czech payer did not admit the acquisition of these goods.
A question from the local tax manager in the Czech Republic found out that the Czech payer has not filed VAT returns since August 2004
The tax return was not filed by the Czech payer even after the calls of the tax administrator, so on 23. 5. 2005 the tax authority measured VAT of CZK 0 for the period October to December 2004
On 2005 2. 6. the CLO highlighted the above delivery from the German payer.
Since the Czech payer did not cooperate with the tax administrator, the tax administrator sent ZOI to Germany regarding the abovementioned delivery.
Since the response to ŽOI was delivered to the Czech Republic on 7. August 2., it was not known until the end of the NKÚ inspection, how the Czech tax manager used information obtained by international exchange.
The tax office of the Czech payer due to failure to comply with the obligations under the VAT law cancelled VAT registration on 23. August 2005
In some cases, only a partial response was sent to the ŽOI because the check carried out by the tax authorities with the payers was not completed at the time of the NKÚ and BRH inspection:
9.
In 2005, the Czech tax administrator asked for inspection of the delivery of a car worth EUR 16 991 to the German payer, performed in III, via the SCAC form. quarter 2004 showing signs of carousel fraud.
The German tax manager stated in a response to the ŽOI that he only had an invoice issued by the Czech payer for delivery of EUR 16 335
The BRH found, based on the NKÚ request, that the inspection carried out by the German IRS on the customer from Germany has not yet been terminated.
The German buyer reported the acquisition of goods worth EUR 16 335 twice in August and September 2004. tax returns.
10. The Czech tax administrator asked in 2005 via the SCAC form to verify the delivery of cars to a German payer worth EUR 198 167, effected in IV. quarter 2004 and I. quarter 2005 showing signs of carousel fraud.
The German tax administration sent a partial response to the Czech Republic to the Czech Republic confirming the acquisition of certain cars by a German payer and stated that the investigation in Germany was not closed.
This segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
NKÚ found out that a Czech supplier had a local tax authority to verify excessive VAT deductions were carried out by several local investigations where it did not detect their unauthorized drawings.
BRH found out that the German payer reported VAT acquisition of goods from other Member States totaling EUR 579 114 in the said period and that the inspection carried out by the German financial authority with the customer from Germany has not yet been completed.
Chapter 4.4.1 describe the reasons for differences between the intracommunitary acquisition values, which the recipient stated in the tax return and values stated by the supplier in his SH.
Checked cases showed that the most common reasons for differences were not the time shift or the incorrect value of intracommunitary supply of goods in SH:
11.
Czech payer had in I. čtvrtletí 2005, according to data from VIES system, buy goods from a German payer worth EUR 35 716, but the Czech payer did not admit such acquisition.
Since the Czech payer did not cooperate with the tax administrator and did not develop any activity at the company's headquarters, the Czech tax manager asked to verify how the German payer communicated with the Czech payer.
The response to the ŽOI delivered from Germany showed that according to the findings of the German tax administration, the Czech tax agency is unknown at the communicated address and that the goods were taken over by the negotiated carrier.
The order was for a total amount of EUR 155 000, but the German payer supplied goods only with EUR 21 659
The Czech payer sent a false confirmation to the German payer of EUR 155 153 for the benefit of the German payer.
After finding out the fraudulent behavior by the Czech customer, the German payer managed to recover the material supplied, except for one item worth EUR 7 916
NKU by question at the local competent financial authority in the Czech Republic found out that the tax manager among others. based on the information received, he measured the Czech VAT payer on the acquisition of goods from other Member States of CZK 388 (EUR 13 044).
Based on the NKÚ request, BRH confirmed that the German supplier showed the Czech payer only EUR 7 916 after repairs.
According to the German legal situation, the German payer showed corrected goods values and a reduction in the taxable amount in the quarter in which the repair was made.
This included the following delivery values in relation to the Czech payer:
12.
During the international exchange of information, the German tax manager requested via the SCAC form to verify the supply of goods and services made in III. quarter 2005.
According to this ŽOI, the Czech payer was supposed to supply the German payer with a total value of EUR 396 126 and provide services worth EUR 11 885
NKÚ found out that the Czech tax manager carried out a local investigation to verify this delivery with the Czech payer.
In response to ŽOI, the Czech tax manager stated that the Czech payer supplied a production line including assembly to the German payer.
The Czech payer delivered individual parts of the production line before the Czech Republic joined the EU and after 2004 1. 5. the line was assembled based on order.
German payer did not take over the assembled line because he claimed it had defects.
In III. The Czech payer issued invoices to the German payer for EUR 107 100 for assembly and EUR 11 885 for services.
The German payer took over the issued invoices, but he did not acknowledge them and pay them.
The NKÚ further inquiries from the local tax manager in the Czech Republic found that all invoices are properly registered in the Czech payer's accounts.
In tax returns for III. 2004. quarter 2005 only amounts supported by the Czech payer related to invoicing after 1. 5. 2004.
BRH found that based on a response from the Czech tax administration, the local tax authority in Germany concluded that in the case of the transaction it was the delivery of goods from a Czech payer to a German payer including services for assembly.
In this special case, the place is called. work is done where the production line was installed.
According to German VAT law, the German recipient is liable to pay VAT.
At the same time, the beneficiary can claim VAT deduction from the same amount.
As there would be no changes in the value of VAT that the German payer was obliged to pay, the repairs in VAT tax return were neglected by the German tax authority.
13. Czech payer A according to data from VIES in February 2005, he should have bought a machine worth EUR 58 000 from the German payer.
The Czech tax administrator sent a request to Germany to verify this delivery.
In response to ŽOI, the German party stated that the German payer C added the German payer C to the Czech payer B, which was supposed to return the machine to the German payer C in October 2004
According to German tax administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but transported to the organizational component of the German payer C in Czech Republic.
Furthermore, the answer to the request for information revealed that German payer C sold the machine to Czech payer A in February 2005
This payer took over the machine at the headquarters of the German payer C in Czech Republic.
Since the delivery took place only within the Czech Republic, it was not an intracommunitary delivery of goods.
NKÚ by a question from the tax manager of the local payer B found that according to VIES data, German payer C added in III. quarter 2004 to the Czech payer B goods (another machine) worth EUR 88 027
The payer B denied this acquisition of goods, so the local tax manager from the Czech Republic sent ŽOI to Germany.
According to the response to this request, the machine was delivered.
Another investigation with payer B, the Czech tax manager found out that the machine worth EUR 88 027 was not in the bookkeeping of payer B and that it could be a machine of the same type as the organisational component of the German payer C to the Czech payer A in February 2005.
NKÚ further found out that the Czech tax administrator local payer A conducted a local investigation with this payer.
The tax administrator had an invoice of German payer C dated 7. 2. 2005, on which the payer A was listed as a machine customer.
The Czech tax administrator found out that the payer A does not have this invoice included in the accounting.
The payer A had a leasing contract with another Czech company, where the subject of the leasing was a machine of the same type.
Handover of the machine from the leasing company took place on 9. 2. 2005, the transport of the machine was provided by the leasing company.
The information contained in the reply to the request for information was not used by the Czech tax authority to determine the tax liability of payer A.
BRH found out that German payer C machine worth EUR 88 027 was not delivered to the Czech Republic, but to another German payer D.
So it was not an intracommunitary delivery of goods, but a taxable operation in Germany.
For these reasons, the German tax manager did not acknowledge the German tax payer C tax exemption and corrected the data in his tax return.
German payer D added the machine to Czech payer B.
According to German legislation, this delivery was not taxable in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.
Next, BRH found out that German payer C stated in his SH for I. quarter 2005 delivery of the machine worth EUR 58 000 to the Czech payer A.
This delivery was not verified during the tax inspection carried out by the German tax authority.
The following scheme shows relations between participants in the abovementioned commercial transactions.
14.
NKU found that the Czech tax administration accepted a request from Germany for information in which the German tax manager asked for verification of intracommunitary delivery from a German payer worth 879 680 625 EUR to the Czech payer.
According to the German tax manager, there was a suspicion that this case was a fake intracommunitary delivery of goods.
In ŽOI it was further stated that German payer since 1999 did not carry out any active business activity.
NKÚ found out that the Czech tax manager conducted a local investigation with the Czech payer.
According to the opinion of the director of the Czech company, it was probably a claim by the German payer against the German tax administration, which was applied by the Czech payer as a partner of the German company with the German financial authority.
According to information provided by NKÚ the Czech tax manager has no information about the German tax administration dealing with the issue of the Czech payer.
According to the available information, it was not the delivery of goods, yet the value is still included in the VIES system as an intracommunitary delivery of goods to the Czech payer from Germany.
The main reason for the following irregularities was that the beneficiaries did not show intracommunitary acquisition of goods in their tax returns (see also Chapter 4.4.1):
15. According to VIES data, German payer added in III. quarter 2004 to I. quarter 2005 to the Czech payer of goods totalling EUR 33 205 The Czech payer did not admit this acquisition.
This segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The Czech tax administrator asked for verification of the delivery of goods from Germany as part of the international exchange of information.
The German tax administration stated in reply to this request that the German payer sent part of the goods to the Czech payer, the Czech payer picked up the remaining goods personally.
By a question with a local tax manager in the Czech Republic, NKU found out that before receiving a response to ŽOI, the Czech payer submitted additional tax returns to VAT for those periods.
Despite this submission, the differences in the values of the acquisition were not resolved, so the Czech tax manager recommended to carry out a tax check with the Czech payer.
No inspection has been carried out yet.
16. German payer delivered according to data in VIES in III. quarter 2004 to the Czech payer of goods worth EUR 46 854
The Czech payer admitted intracommunitary acquisition only equal to EUR 14 856 for the same period.
The Czech tax administrator asked for verification in the international exchange of information the value of deliveries made.
The response to ŽOI, delivered from Germany, was accompanied by 3 invoices with a total value of delivery of goods EUR 31 999, i.e. a value corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech payer and VIES data.
NKÚ with a question from the local tax manager in the Czech Republic found that after receiving an answer from Germany, the Czech tax manager contacted the Czech tax manager and agreed with him that after checking these invoices with the company owner, he will discuss the submission of additional tax return to VAT for III. quarter 2004.
Additional VAT tax return has not yet been filed.
The Czech NKÚ tax administrator said that he will proceed to comply with the specified deadlines for possible additional VAT measurement for the relevant tax period.
17.
German payer had in IV. quarter 2004 to supply the Czech payer with goods worth EUR 11 600
The German tax manager asked for confirmation of whether the Czech payer actually existed because the alleged German payer founded more fictional companies in Germany.
When checking the commercial transaction, the Czech payer confirmed the acquisition of goods to the IRS.
According to the Czech payer, the goods were not transported from Germany to the Czech Republic and were sold during 2005 in Germany.
Czech payer presented documents of sale of goods for January 2005.
The Czech payer was not registered as a VAT payer in Germany, the tax on the sale of the goods in question in the Czech Republic or in Germany.
All of these facts suggested tax evasion in the territory of Germany and the Czech tax administrator communicated them to the German tax administration in response to ŽOI.
NKÚ found by question at the local tax manager in the Czech Republic that the Czech payer submitted additional tax return to VAT for IV based on investigations carried out. quarter 2004, including the value of acquisition of goods, inter alia. from a German payer while claiming the tax deduction on the acquisition of goods from other Member States.
VAT on the sale of goods in Germany did not include VAT in the Czech tax return.
The Czech tax administrator measured additional tax return to VAT after a local investigation without change.
According to the Czech legislation, it was not the acquisition of goods from other Member States because the goods were not shipped or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.
The Czech tax administrator thus incorrectly concluded the local investigation.
BRH found that the German tax manager immediately after receiving a response to the ŽOI, which stated that the goods had not left Germany, corrected the German payer's tax return and requested VAT of EUR 1 600
In addition, the competent tax authority sent a notification to the financial authority of the actual recipient of the goods to ensure that the resale of these goods is properly taxed.
In the following cases, the payers showed intracommunitary transactions, which probably did not actually happen:
18.
The Czech tax administrator received a request from the German tax administration for information whether the Czech payer bought a car worth EUR 47 400 from a German payer in February 2005
The attachment of the application was a copy of the Czech VAT registration certificate.
A copy of the passport of the person who was supposed to carry out the transport of the said car was also attached.
By investigating the Czech tax manager found out that it was a stolen passport, the person in it did not bring any vehicle to the Czech Republic and denied all contacts with the German tax agency.
The Czech tax administrator has never issued a VAT certificate, a copy of which was sent by the German party.
This information was given by the Czech tax administrator in the response to ŽOI together with the statement that he cannot confirm the acquisition of the goods - the car in question.
NKU found out by a question at the local tax manager in the Czech Republic that the Czech payer did not live at the address listed in the commercial register and the company manager was non-contact.
The Czech tax administrator, after the alleged proceedings for the tax period February 2005, measured a tax obligation of CZK 0 to the Czech payer.
Another investigation by the Czech tax manager found that the vehicle in question was sold to another Czech operator who bought it via an advertisement on the Internet.
BRH found that the local German tax manager based on the Czech response to ŽOI will not accept the German payer's claim to exempt this delivery from VAT.
19. During the inspection, the German tax authority was unable to clarify the difference of EUR 3000 between the value of the goods acquired in the payer's tax return and the value provided from another Member State.
It was said that the Czech payer should have delivered during IV. quarter 2004 to I. quarter 2005 to the German payer of goods worth EUR 89 424
Since the acquisition declared by the German payer did not correspond to the VIES data, the German tax manager asked for verification of supply and their remuneration for international exchange of information.
The Czech tax manager stated in a response to ŽOI that the only director of the Czech company was deleted from the Trade Register on 8. 7. 2005 and the new manager was not registered.
The German recipient of the goods was apparently related to the company of the Czech company.
The Czech payer filed tax returns for VAT and SH, which, after deleting the director from the Trade Register, was signed by an unauthorized person - the company's partner.
The Czech tax payer's accounting officer confirmed that the company's partner deposited cash paid for the invoiced goods in EUR into the company's account.
The cashier's documents were not issued.
NKÚ in the Czech Republic by question at the local financial authority found out that the tax manager recognized the Czech tax payer as IV. quarter 2004 entitled to VAT exemption on delivery of goods to another Member State worth 1 326 CZK (EUR 42 145) and I. quarter 2005 of 1 CZK 416 (EUR 47 548).
BRH found out that the tax manager in Germany did not correct the German customer's VAT tax return, because the German judge confirmed the insolvency of the German payer.
Since earlier inspection revealed no sign of tax fraud, tax liability will not be possible.
20. According to data in VIES, German payer bought goods from the Czech Republic in 4 2005 251 after acquiring EUR 43 274 worth of goods in the previous year.
In his tax return for 2004 and in his tax return for 2005, the German payer did not show intracommunitary acquisition.
Moreover, he did not show adequate deliveries either.
Due to these differences, the German IRS sent ŽOI for the 4. rd quarter of 2005 and 1. th quarter of 2006.
The Czech supplier showed intracommunitary delivery of goods to the German payer totaling 167 246 CZK (EUR 5 615 299) in SH.
On June 6., 2006, ŽOI was delivered, in which the German party asked to check whether the Czech payer of reported intracommunitary delivery was held.
In reply to this ŽOI, the Czech tax administration stated that the German party's request was not possible because the Czech payer had no manager.
As it follows from materials provided by NKÚ by the competent tax manager, on 30. June 3., a protocol was written with the director of the Czech payer on the start of the VAT check for IV. quarter 2004 and January to December 2005.
The payer was also invited by the tax administrator to submit all accounting and tax documents for the above periods, but he did not submit any documents.
The Czech payer's only director disappeared according to the Trade Register of functions on 16. 5. 2006, the new director was not named.
Since April 2006, the Czech payer stopped filing tax returns for VAT.
During the NKU inspection in cooperation with BRH, among other things, he checked several cases of intracommunitary delivery between the Czech Republic and Germany, which were not subject to previous exchange of information between tax administrations of both countries.
The two top control institutions were transmitting information on the proven cases via the CLO of both countries.
21. Czech company (eCR) which is not resident in Germany informed the competent financial authority (Chemnitz-Süd) that it intends to carry out taxable transactions in Germany.
Due to this information the company was registered since June 2005 but did not receive German VAT ID.
(ECR) accepted an order from a Danish entrepreneur (eDK) for the production of several wind power plants and for the delivery of these wind power plants on behalf of, at risk and at the expense of a Danish customer to Austria.
Due to lack of capacity, the Czech company handed over part of the order to the German payer (eD), based in Germany.
The following scheme shows the contractual relations and the method of transporting wind power plants:
According to the German legal situation, the place of carrying out these transactions must be determined according to the following:
- Danish entrepreneur (eDK) sent wind power plants to assemble under his name, at his risk and his account to Austria.
Since the installation of this delivery took place in Austria, the delivery of wind power plants is taxable in Austria.
- Because the carrier was instructed by the Danish businessman (eDK) and the transport took place under his name, at his risk and at his own expense, the delivery of the German subcontractor (eD) took place where the transport started - in Germany.
Although wind power plants were sent to another Member State and the recipient is a registered payer from another Member State, the delivery of the German subcontractor (eD) could not obtain an exemption because another Member State of destination differs from another Member State of the registered office of the Czech company.
Therefore, this delivery is rightly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (eCZ) deducted tax on entry in its tax returns.
The place of delivery of the Czech company (eCR) is also determined by the beginning of the transport.
Transport of some wind power plants started in Czech Republic and others in Germany.
- Delivery of those wind power plants that are made in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.
- Delivery of other wind power plants manufactured in Germany.
So the Czech company (eCR) made both intracommunitary delivery from the Czech Republic to Austria and intracommunitary delivery from Germany to Austria.
BRH found out that the Czech company (eCR) did not report any intracommunitary acquisition or submit SH to the German CLO in its tax return.
So it is possible that the Czech company reported all intracommunitary delivery uniformly as an intracommunitary delivery from the Czech Republic.
NKÚ found that (eCR) showed no intracommunitary delivery to Austria, but intracommunitary delivery to Denmark.
Verification of taxation of intracommunitary acquisition in Austria would require cooperation of at least four tax administrations (Austrian, Czech, Danish and German), even though this case shows no sign of tax fraud or evasion.
Furthermore, the NKÚ and BRH examined transactions to highlight the differences between VIES reporting and VIES data caused by different VAT legislation in 2004.
Checked cases also demonstrate that changes in legislation need time to apply new legislation into practice by payers and financial authorities:
22. V SH for II. up to IV. quarter of 2004, the Czech payer showed intracommunitary delivery to the German payer totaling 792 977 CZK (EUR 25 197 885).
For the same period another Czech payer in SH showed intracommunitary delivery to another German payer totaling CZK 18 157 (EUR 576 970).
According to information provided by NKÚ from BRH, both cases were the supply of electricity.
Both Czech payers stated the abovementioned delivery in SH in accordance with the text of Law No. 235/2004 Coll., valid in 2004.
By further examination of the abovementioned transactions, the group checking NKÚ found that in 2004 there were differences between the Czech Republic and the Germany in the regulation of delivery and delivery. acquisition of electricity.
While in the Czech Republic the payers showed electricity supply in accordance with the valid version of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. as an intracommunitary supply of goods, in terms of German law in force in 2004, it was not an intra-communitarian acquisition, but a taxable operation with the place of operation in the territory of Germany.
The difference in legal adjustments was removed in the Czech Republic by the adoption of law no. 635/2004 Coll., amending certain laws in connection with the adoption of the Administrative Charges Act, effective from 1. 1. 2005.
23. During the examination of selected intracommunitary transactions in cooperation with BRH, it was also found that the Czech payer showed intracommunitary delivery to the German payer in the 1. th to 4. th quarter of 2005 163 Kč (EUR 8 071 823) and another Czech payer showed intracommunitary delivery to the German payer totaling 263 470 776 CZK (8 8 846 050 EUR).
According to the information provided by NKÚ by BRH, both cases were the supply of electricity.
According to the wording of Law No. 235/2004 Coll., effective from 1. 1. 2005, in case of electricity supply, the place where the customer has its registered office, place of business or where the establishment for which the goods are delivered.
Therefore, Czech payers should not have introduced electricity supply to SH in 2005
The two above-mentioned payers showed intracommunitary supply of electricity in SH, the VIES data was distorted by a total of 503 881 CZK (EUR 16 917 873).
Conclusion
Cooperation met the goals of BRH and NKÚ.
Both SAIs gained a deeper knowledge of VAT management systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.
Cooperation revealed differences in both systems and showed that VAT rules differ.
Suspicious cases of intracommunitary transactions were detected during parallel checks.
Some of them make sense to check afterwards.
Based on the inspection findings, both SAI made recommendations regarding VAT management.
Monitoring these recommendations should also be part of a follow-up check.
New experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of both control institutions is the basis for successful VAT management checks.

Report on the outcome of international cooperation in checks on excise duty management between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in 2006
Introductory word
The joint report submitted informs about the progress and outcome of international cooperation during parallel checks carried out by the Supreme Supervisory Authority, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic's High Supervisory Authority, focused on the management of excise duties during the period after the entry of both countries into the European Union.
Cooperation was implemented under a control activity cooperation agreement concluded in February 2006.
The topic of parallel checks has been selected with a view to the fundamental change in the system of excise duty collection, which has occurred in connection with the integration of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic into the internal market of the European Union since 1. May 2004.
The functioning of the internal market of the European Union requires the free movement of goods, including excise goods.
The basic principle is to allow the circulation of non-taxable goods until the date of delivery for final consumption.
In accordance with that principle, new legislation, adopted in both countries, allows the movement of goods under tax supervision under tax exemption regime.
The system places great claims on tax administrators and envisages a mutual close synergies of the competent administrative authorities of the Member States in combating tax fraud in this area.

The customs office shall retain copy No. 4 and copy no. 3, where they verify the correctness and validity, returns to the recipient.
The consignee sends a confirmed copy no. 3 no later than the following working day after receiving it by the consignor to SR.
Transportation in SR is considered to have ended on the date of product takeover by the recipient.
The termination of transport is demonstrated by the consignor by submitting copy No. 3 accompanying document confirmed by the recipient and tax manager in the Czech Republic.
Chart No. 3-Circulation of the accompanying document during transport (alcohol and tobacco products) started in SR and ended in Czech Republic
In 2006, amendment to all excise duty laws were gradually passed in the SR, according to which the consignor of goods under the suspension regime is required to send a copy of copy of copy No before transport started. 1 accompanying document by electronic or fax to the customs office to the local consignor.
The document demonstrating the termination of the transport of alcohol and tobacco products is copy No. 3 accompanying document certified by the recipient and his competent tax administrator.
The document demonstrating the termination of transport of mineral oils, wine and beer is copy No. 3 confirmed by the recipient.
The confirmation of the tax administrator of another Member State of the receipt of the said goods by the consignee is required if the administrator is required to confirm copy No under the legislation of the Member State concerned. 3 accompanying document.
2.3 Registration of commenced and terminated transport held by customs authorities in the Czech Republic and in the SR
A single electronic system is not introduced to monitor the transport of goods under the tax exemption regime between Member States of the European Union.
Decision 1152/2003 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16. June 2003 establishing an electronic system for the transport and monitoring of excise products requires Member States and the European Commission to introduce an electronic system from 1. July 2009 (Excise Movement and Control System), which would allow excise tax administrators in individual Member States to acquire real-time information about the transport of goods.
The system will allow the electronic transmission of accompanying documents, which are currently used only in paper form, and will contribute to simplifying the movement of goods under the tax exemption regime and ensuring more efficient control of the movement of non-taxed products within all Member States.
National transport databases of individual Member States will be part of this system.
The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic records all transport started and ended in the Czech Republic in the Module of Registration of selected products (hereinafter referred to as ′′ EVVV ′′).
All customs authorities in the Czech Republic have access to the system online.
In the case of transport carried out only in the Czech Republic, tax administrators can obtain information about the start or termination of transport immediately after registration of the accompanying document by the customs office to EVVV.
The customs office shall release the tax security for transported products provided by the consignor at the time of registration of the termination of transport by the customs office of the local beneficiary.
Customs offices in SR use a database based on SysNed application software that ensures the automation of their activities in the management of excise duties and communication with European Union systems.
By registering a tax warehouse operator, tax warehouse operator or authorized recipient to SysNed application software, this data will automatically be transferred to the ′′ System for Exchange of Data ′′ database (SEED).
3. Preparation and course of cooperation
The first coordination meeting of representatives of the NKÚ-Czech Republic and representatives of the NKÚ SR, which discussed a specific cooperation procedure in the implementation of parallel checks in the field of excise taxes, took place in January 2006.
Both parties have acquainted with each other's excise duty rules and the organization of excise duty management in both countries.
Special attention was paid to the procedure of the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and the SR during the authorization or. when commencing and terminating transport of excise products under conditional exemption regime and exchange of information between excise tax administrators of both countries.
The meeting was agreed that the Czech and Slovak parties: - they will process total data on the quantity of excise duty products transported from the Czech Republic to the SR and on the contrary, whose transport started during the controlled period - they will compare data on transport of mineral oils - Combined Nomenclature code 2710 and 2711 and alcohol - code of the Combined Nomenclature 2207 and 2208 in the tax exemption regime started in the Czech Republic and ended in SR and vice versa in November 2004 and September 2005.
During the checks, the verified periods were extended by October and November 2005 and the transport of tobacco products under the tax exemption regime were subjected to checks.
In tables no. 1 and no. 2 The total quantity of excise products transported under the tax exemption regime between Czech and Slovak tax entities during the controlled period is stated.
4. Comparison of the transportation of goods under the tax exemption regime
NKÚ-Czech Republic handed over the Slovak side a database of transport ended in the Czech Republic, which contained a total of 5 items listed on accompanying documents, of which 5 738 items covered mineral oils, 134 items of alcohol and 4 items of tobacco products.
NKÚ SR handed over to the Czech side a database of transport completed in SR, which contained a total of 3 items listed on the accompanying documents, 696 items covered mineral oil, 2 066 items of alcohol and 557 items tobacco products.
NKÚ-Czech Republic compared data on transport provided in the registration of launched transport in the Czech Republic with data on closed transport registered in SR.
The results of the comparison are given in table no. 3.
Transport data in November 2004 and September 2005 compared the NKÚ-Czech Republic with the Slovak Customs Administration database, which the NKÚ SR handed over to him at the beginning of the inspection.
The database did not contain data allowing reliably to agree individual transports and therefore only 63 % of the started transport was allocated.
Individual transportation has been assigned according to multiple data, e.g. consignor, consignee, date of transport, quantity of products transported.
Transport data started in the Czech Republic and ended in SR in October and November 2005 compared the NKÚ-Czech Republic with the Slovak Customs Administration database, which contained all data according to accompanying documents, based on which 93 % of the started transport was clearly assigned.
In the Czech Customs Administration database, data on the amount of mineral oils were given in liters or tonnes depending on the type of mineral oil.
In most cases the amount of alcohol was reported in liters, which, however, could be converted into litres of absolute alcohol based on the database of the percentage of alcohol.
Quantity of tobacco products has been reported in pieces, thousands of pieces and kilograms according to the type of tobacco products.
Transports started in the Czech Republic, whose termination of the Slovak database failed to verify reliably or where the information on the transported quantity of products was not in accordance with the information on the transported quantity of products, were checked.
The checks were subjected to accompanying documents for 487 transportation of alcohol, mineral oils and tobacco products.
The inspection of these documents was carried out at the customs offices where the NKÚ-Czech Republic carried out a check.
For transport permitted by other customs offices, accompanying documents were requested via DGC.
The Czech Republic asked the Slovak party to verify the implementation of 141 transport, which the customs authorities in the Czech Republic did not provide confirmed copy no. 3 accompanying document or the quantity of products listed on the accompanying document did not agree with the quantity of products specified in the database.
The Slovak party was also transmitted data on transport registered in the Slovak database, which did not contain the Czech customs administration's transport database.
NKÚ SR traced 95 transport in the Slovak customs administration database.
Verification of the remaining 46 transport was requested by local customs authorities, which showed their completion by copy of the accompanying documents.
The Slovak party forwarded the Czech side a copy of accompanying documents, based on which transport was identified in the Czech database, except for transports carried out by two Czech tax entities, which were not found in the Czech database of initiated transport.
A check of these cases was found:
- 11 alcohol transport transports were registered in the Slovak Transport database totaling 276,7 liters of alcohol implemented by the Czech tax agency in 2004 and 20 transport of alcohol in total of 404,66 liters of alcohol implemented in 2005.
NKÚ-Czech Republic found out that it was transportation of taxed products, which the consignor does not need the approval of the tax administrator.
The consignor informed the tax administrator in writing about the start of transport. Transport was carried out on the basis of accompanying documents used for the transport of products under the tax exemption scheme;
- a total of 94 mineral oils transportation were registered in the Slovak transport database, combined nomenclature code 2710 2710 11 21, totaling 173 thousand. liters implemented by the Czech tax agency between September 2004 and December 2005.
NKÚ-Czech Republic found that between May 2004 and June 2005 the tax agency carried out a transport of 102 thousand. liters of tax-free mineral oils without proper approval.
The tax body held a special authorization for the acceptance and use of tax exempt products, on the basis of which he could supply only to the holder of the same authorization.
The opening of transport to the customs office in the Czech Republic did not announce the opening of transportation and did not provide a tax security of CZK 1 680
Between July 2005 and December 2005, the tax body transported 71 thousand to the territory of SR. liters of taxed mineral oils. In these cases he did not fulfil his legal obligation by notifying the opening of transport to the customs office.
The consignor in the Czech Republic can start transport of products entered into free tax circulation in the Czech Republic without the approval of the customs office, but he is obliged to inform the customs office in writing before the start of transport.
A tax body collecting products placed in free tax circulation in another Member State is required to report the quantity before collecting them and securing the tax.
Products can only be transported with a simplified accompanying document, the elements of which are governed by Regulation No 3649/92.
This Regulation also admits the use of the accompanying document for transport under the suspension scheme, but clearly indicates that it is a ′′ simplified accompanying document for tax inspection (excise products) ".
The same legislation on transport and acceptance of products entered for free tax circulation in another Member State applies in SR.
In these cases, tax entities transported products entered into free tax circulation with an accompanying document for transport under the tax exemption regime, whose 3. and 4. made by the recipient was submitted to the tax administrator in the SR for verification.
The customs authorities in SR registered these transports into the transport database under the tax exemption regime because the accompanying documents did not indicate that it was a simplified accompanying document.
NKÚ SR compared the Czech Customs Transport Database with the Slovak Customs Administration Database and found out:
- in the databases the quantity of products transported were reported in unity, e.g. mineral oil has been shown in liters, hectolitres or kilograms; alcohol was shown in liters or liters of alcohol, thus making it difficult to compare the quantity of goods transported,
- the quantity of alcohol transported in the invoices did not match the quantity registered in the databases,
- all related invoices were not listed in the databases,
- two transports of alcohol from the Czech Republic to SR were registered in the Slovak Customs Administration database, which was not located in the database of Czech customs administration, which was not located in the Czech customs administration database.
The Slovak party handed over copies of accompanying documents to the Czech side.
5. International exchange of information between the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and the SR
Conditions of cooperation between the administrative authorities of the Member States responsible for the management of excise duties were adapted until 30. June 2005 by Council Directive 77/799 / EEC on mutual assistance between the competent authorities of the Member States in the field of direct taxes, certain excise duties and insurance taxes.
On 1. July 2005, Regulation No 2005 entered into force. 2073/2004 laying down rules and procedures to enable the competent authorities of the Member States of the European Union to cooperate and exchange information necessary for the correct excise duties.
Each Member State shall designate a central liaison office that secures contacts with other Member States in the field of excise duty management and is responsible for exchange of information on the movement of excise goods.
In the Czech Republic, the report ′′ Excise Liaison Office ′′ (hereinafter referred to as ′′ ELO Czech Republic ′′ was set up on DGC to secure exchanges of information in the field of excise duties between Member States of the European Union.
Security of tasks related to the management of systems for control of movement of excise goods (SEED, MVS, EWSE) and the exchange of mutual administrative assistance information between Member States of the European Union and the SR was carried out with effect from 1. May 2004 by ELO customs of the office of Poprad.
With effect from 1. July 2005, the ELO department (based in Poprad) shall carry out the tasks of the ELO department (hereinafter referred to as ′′ ELO SR ′′).
According to Article 3 (3) Article 3 of Regulation No 3 2073/2004 The central contact authority is responsible, in particular, for - exchange of data kept in the SEED electronic register, - early warning system ′′ Early Warning System Excise ′′ (EWSE) - requests for verification of movement of excise goods sent to other Member States or from ′′ Movement Verification System ′′ (hereinafter referred to as ′′ MVS ′′).
The content, scope and function of SEED, EWSE and MVS systems are adapted in Articles 22, 23 and 24 of Regulation No 24 2073/2004.
SEED - a system for exchange of information on tax entities trading excise goods.
The system consists of national excise tax payer registers and allows tax administrators in the territory of the European Union to determine whether the person is entitled to do so with excise products.
Each national register shall be made available to the competent authorities of the other Member States for excise duty purposes only.
The central liaison office of each Member State ensures that persons involved in movement of excise goods within the territory of the European Union can obtain confirmation of the information stored in this database.
In accordance with Section 41 of Law No. 98/2004 Z. z., s s 39 of Act No. 104/2004 Z. z., s s 46 of Act No. 105/2004 Z. z., s s 40 of Act No. 106/2004 Z. z. and s § 39 of law no. 107/2004 Z. Z. ELO SR runs an electronic database containing a register of tax warehouse operators, eligible beneficiaries and tax warehouses - SEED database.
Customs offices in SR contribute to the SEED database by registering a tax warehouse, tax warehouse operator or a beneficiary to SysNed application software, which is automatically linked to ELO SR.
For example, if a new tax warehouse operator, a licensed recipient or a tax warehouse is registered into the SysNed database, the related data will automatically be transmitted to SEED database.
NKÚ SR found that the SEED database exchange between the customs administration of the SR and the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic took place in the controlled period usually once a month, exceptionally several times a month.
Customs administration of SR accepted 22 SEED files and sent 25 SEED files.
Data to the SEED database in the Czech Republic are transmitted from the national registry, where all persons entitled to dispose of excise duty products and licenses issued for the handling of these products.
Individual customs offices in the Czech Republic do not have access to the SEED international database.
Applications from customs offices for information from the SEED database of other Member States are obtained only through the ELO Czech Republic.
EWSE - Early Warning System aimed at controlling the transport of excise goods through which the transport of risk consignments is carried out.
The transport of certain excise products in quantity exceeding the limits laid down by the European Commission Regulation and, on the one hand, is considered to be a risk consignment.
The exchange of information is made in two forms:
- information - sent when the limits are exceeded,
- warning message - sent if the transport of goods is evaluated as risk.
ELO SR uses SEED database to send a warning message using the SEED database to check the data contained in the accompanying document when evaluating the risk level.
In case the SEED database does not agree with the data in the accompanying document (for example, the registration number of the recipient of the goods or the registered office of the consignee), ELO SR shall produce a warning report sent to the ELO Member State of the recipient of the goods.
ELO is governed by CED 317 and CED 457 commissions for tax and customs areas, which define, among other things, the type and quantity of goods in the relevant units of measure for the preparation of informative and warning reports.
In the controlled period of ELO SR, ELO sent one warning message to the Czech Republic.
In the Czech Republic, information on started transportation of products in excess of the specified limits is generated automatically when entering data from the accompanying document into the database when transport approval is approved.
If the tax manager in the Czech Republic evaluates the consignment as a risk based on his own analysis, he will process the so-called. a warning message sent to the relevant Member State via ELO Czech Republic.
In 2005 ELO Czech Republic sent two warning messages to ELO SR.
The MVS - the system of control of the movement of goods - enables the individual transportation of excise products and the control of the specified route of transport between the entities listed in the accompanying document via MVS applications.
The exchange of information takes place on request in which ELO specifies its requirements.
The system is used especially when the consignor takes over the confirmed copy No. 3 accompanying document and required for example refund of excise duty and where the data provided in the accompanying document cannot be verified in the international SEED database.
In the controlled period of ELO SR, ELO Czech Republic sent 33 applications to MVS.
ELO Czech Republic sent ELO SR 25 applications from MVS.
Customs offices in the Czech Republic most often examined the data contained in the accompanying documents, especially the amount received or received. the products dispatched or whether the consignor of the products specified in the accompanying document is entitled to deal with excise products, unless this fact could be verified in the SEED international database.
The applications received by MVS were sent to customs offices located in both countries, competent for the recipients or consignors of excise products.
Customs authorities checked the required data and notified the result of the investigation through ELO to the second Member State.
6. Summary
The cooperation of the NKÚ-Czech Republic and the NKÚ SR enabled the basic legislation on excise duties in both states, the procedure of the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and the SR in the opening and termination of transport of products under the tax exemption regime between the two states, registration of these transports and further comparing information exchange between customs authorities in international cooperation.
6.1 Differences were found by comparing the legislation governing excise duties in the Czech Republic and SR:
(a) in the procedure of tax entities and tax managers when initiating the transport of products under the tax exemption scheme.
Transport of products under the tax exemption regime can be launched by a tax body in the Czech Republic only with the approval of the tax administrator, who will authorise the start of transportation, provided that transported products were provided with a tax security in the amount of tax on them.
Start of transport of products under tax exemption regime in SR shall not be subject to tax manager's permission.
During the controlled period, the tax agency was obliged to notify the tax administrator of the initiation of the transport of alcohol and tobacco products.
The transport of mineral oils, beer and wine could have started without informing the tax manager.
In 2006, amendment to all excise duty laws were gradually passed in the SR, according to which the consignor of goods under the suspension regime is required to send a copy of copy of copy No before transport started. 1 the accompanying document by electronic or fax to the customs office, which is locally competent to the consignor;
(b) within the time limits for the dispatch of copy No. 3 accompanying document.
The recipient in the Czech Republic is obliged to send copy no later than the following working day after the end of the transport. 3th and 4th accompanying document tax administrators for verification.
Certified copy No. 3 is required to send the consignor no later than the following working day after receiving it from the tax manager.
The consignee in SR is obliged to send copy No to the consignor of the products. 3 confirmed by the tax administrator and the product receiver no later than the 15. th day of the month following the month in which he accepted the goods.
6.2. Customs authorities in both SR and Czech Republic keep electronic records of transport of products under the tax exemption regime.
The content and method of keeping this evidence is not regulated by legislation in the Czech Republic or in the SR.
Customs authorities in both countries shall register all data from the accompanying documents on the basis of which transport is carried out.
There is currently no uniform electronic system for monitoring the transport of goods under the tax exemption regime between Member States of the European Union that allows managers of excise duties in individual Member States to obtain information on the transport of goods in real time.
According to Decision 1152/2003 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16. June 2003, the introduction of an electronic system for monitoring the transport of excise products is envisaged from 1. July 2009
Based on the cooperation agreement in the control activity, the Czech party handed over to the Slovak party a database of transport of products under a conditional tax exemption regime started in SR and ended in the Czech Republic.
The database contained 5 items for transported mineral oils, alcohol and tobacco products.
The Slovak party handed over to the Czech party a database of transport of products under a tax exemption regime started in the Czech Republic and ended in SR.
The database contained 3 items for transported mineral oils, alcohol and tobacco products.
The Czech party compared the traffic data contained in the registration of initiated transport in the Czech Republic with the transport registration closed in SR.
The Slovak party compared data on transport of goods under the tax exemption regime started in SR and ended in the Czech Republic.
Comparison of data was made difficult by the fact that the quantity of goods transported was not uniformly reported in the databases.
In cases where it was not possible to unequivocally attribute data on individual transport in both records, the accompanying documents were checked and the violation of the tax exemption regime and the cases of tax evasion were not found.
Based on the knowledge from parallel checks, it can be stated that Member States can obtain valuable information from transport records to improve the management of excise duties.
Establishment of an electronic system for the transport and control of excise goods within the meaning of Decision No of the European Parliament and of the Council 1152/2003 / EC will allow the electronic transmission of the accompanying document and more effective control of movement under the tax exemption regime in the European Union territory.
Communicating
This report was made in Czech, English and Slovak languages.
The report was signed by the chairman of the Najšie's Supervisory Authority of the Slovak Republic and the President of the Supreme Supervisory Authority, the Czech Republic.
Value added tax management in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany
Report on the results of the follow-up
Introductory word
Taxes are generally a key source of public income.
It is therefore obvious that the Supreme Audit Institutions (SAI) should focus their attention on this area.
An example is value added tax fraud (hereinafter also ′′ VAT ′′).
In their case, EUR 100 billion is estimated in the European Union (hereinafter the ′′ EU ′′) each year.
Already in 2005 participants VI. the EUROSAI Congress in Bonn agreed on the need for very close cooperation.
Within this cooperation, SAI can exchange control procedures, find the best solutions, etc.
VAT is a very appropriate area for control cooperation, since it is the only tax harmonised within the EU.
The Czech Republic's Supreme Supervisory Authority (hereinafter referred to as ′′ NKÚ ′′) and the Federal Court of Auditors (Bundesrechnungshof, also ′′ BRH ′′) performed the first parallel VAT control action in 2006.
The relevant report was published in 2008.
Since VAT fraud is not limited to a single country, but is expanded across the EU, close cooperation between SAI is required to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the steps taken to address this problem.
Therefore both SAIs decided to further develop cooperation in this area and carried out a parallel check.
1. Introduction
Control number: (CZ) 09/11 (D) VIII 2-2009-0892
Control subject: (CZ) Value added tax management (D) Bilateral audit with NKÚ (follow-up check)
Objective of control:
(CZ) The aim of the control action was to examine the procedure of the financial authorities in the management of VAT, in particular to verify the procedure for solving selected cases of commercial transactions between the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter referred to as ′′ Germany ′′), and to examine the procedures of the tax administrations of both countries in the context of international cooperation.
(D) The inspection action was designed to evaluate the measures taken by the tax administration to implement recommendations issued by NKÚ and BRH.
The intention was also to cover other VAT related areas.
The resulting inspection findings were intended to compare with the established best practice (if any).
The period controlled was the years 2006 to 2008, in case of factual context and the period preceding and following, until the end of the inspection.
2. Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions
The subsequent VAT management check in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two SAIs.
Suspicious cases of intracommunitary transactions were detected during previous parallel checks.
Some of them requested further clearance.
Based on inspection findings, both SAIs formulated recommendations regarding VAT management.
The subsequent inspection action performed was used to evaluate measures taken in response to these recommendations and to examine selected suspicious cases.
The inspection further focused e.g. on selected cases of high-risk intracommunitary transactions, mutual assistance in recovery of claims and VAT checks on large tax entities.
During the inspection of VAT management in selected areas in both countries, inspectors have reached the following inspection findings:
1. Recommendations from previous inspection
• Recommendation 1: Conditions for registration of payers should be harmonised within the EU
In previous parallel checks, comparing VAT registration systems in both countries identified differences.
Since various forms of registration cause problems, both SAIs recommended harmonizing conditions for registration of payers within the EU.
This recommendation was presented at EU level.
Proposal for amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 1798/2003 218/92 (hereinafter referred to as ′′ Council Regulation (EC) No 218/92 1798/2003 ′′) requested the extension of existing databases within the EU, including VAT tax identification numbers database.
He also adjusted common standards for registration and deregistration of tax payers.
SAI expected EU Member States to agree on adequate standards to support their decision to exclude unreliable traders from the VAT system as quickly as possible.
However, the latest version of the document agreed by EU Member States within ECOFIN does not contain the issue anymore.
Both SAIs regret to say that the idea of common minimum standards has been abandoned.
However, they continue to consider this project a relevant tool for prevention in the fight against VAT fraud.
• Recommendation 2: Monthly submission of summary reports
In the context of international cooperation, it was recommended in the previous control action that all EU countries should introduce a monthly deadline for submitting summary reports and thus allow for more timely examination of the values of intracommunitary transactions.
Council Directive Article 2008/117 (2008/117) EC amending Directive 2006/112 / EC on the common system of value added tax to combat tax evasion related to intra-Community transactions reduces the period for summary reports of intra-EU transactions to one a month.
In the Czech Republic, this measure was implemented through the Value Added Tax Act with effect from 1. January 2010, implemented in Germany since July 1., 2010.
In Germany, the obligation to report summary reports monthly was not introduced within the specified deadline in accordance with the applicable EU regulations, while in the Czech Republic did.
• Recommendation 3: Comparison of data in VAT returns and summary reports in Germany in order to achieve greater reliability of VIES data and consideration of interconnection of both VAT returns systems and summary reports
The German tax administration accepted BRH recommendations and set up a working group to explore possible solutions.
Work is ongoing and BRH will monitor further developments in detail.
• Recommendation 4: Sharing successful criteria, components and approaches of the EU risk management system Based on the results of previous inspection action, both SAI agreed that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by just one Member State.
Successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system must be exchanged and introduced in individual EU Member States.
If this is not the case, the offenders of fraudulent activity will choose the Member State with the weakest risk management system.
The inspection found that our two Member States use different risk management systems that have their advantages and weaknesses.
In this area, the NKA checked the EUROCANET system, which allows information exchange within the EU, while BRH focused on German participation in the so-called. risk management platform.
2. Subsequent inspection of selected cases of intracommunitary transactions
During the previous inspection action, commercial transactions were jointly examined, where there were doubts about their implementation or irregularity in the reporting of commercial transactions in tax returns or summary reports to the tax payer from both countries.
Both SAIs selected nine cases for subsequent inspection, which included intracommunitary movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany.
Checks carried out by the tax authorities of the countries concerned were not closed on the date of completion of our previous joint control action.
The subsequent inspection action verified that most tax proceedings in connection with the selected cases of commercial transactions between payers from the Czech Republic and Germany were closed and that adequate measures were taken by the tax administration of the Czech Republic or Germany (e.g. additional VAT measurements or avoidance of tax refund at the entrance).
3. Checking selected cases of risk intracommunitary transactions
High-risk cases of intracommunitary transactions performed by EU payers, which were included in the EUROCANET system were selected for inspection.
The EUROCANET system is a tool for detecting risk tax payers within the EU.
Member States participation in this system is voluntary.
The Czech Republic is an active participant in the EUROCANET system, while Germany has passive status.
It is unsatisfactory for an active participant of the system if some Member States refuse to participate actively.
Given the fact that the German tax administration did not participate in the exchange of data in the EUROCANET system, it was not possible to obtain any information about which suppliers with German VAT ID were evaluated as hazardous.
The NKÚ identified both cases of normal commercial transactions and cases with suspicion of carousel shops or VAT fraudulent conduct.
Tax administrators have limited options for controlling risk transactions, especially when it comes to so-called. missing traders, with mere physical vetting of documents can hardly prove any fraudulent behavior to the tax body.
A similar situation for tax administrators occurs when imports and exports to third countries are linked to intracommunitary carousel shops.
In such cases it would be appropriate to ensure greater cooperation between customs and financial authorities to identify goods and irregularities in transport documentation and also monitor their physical movement within the EU towards the end consumer.
Germany, like some other countries, hesitates to actively engage in the EUROCANET system because of the absence of sufficient legal base.
In Germany, other tools are being used to detect risk tax payers, which have been proven to the German tax administration until now.
In this field it is necessary to communicate and exchange experience among EU Member States.
The EU Council has reached political agreement on the proposal for a regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
Its main innovation is the creation of the EUROFISC network.
Experience gained so far using the EUROCANET system should be the basis for creating this new VAT fraud network.
4. Mutual assistance in recovery of claims
In the field of international aid in the recovery of claims, all EU Member States are governed by the same European legislation.
Therefore, the method of handling applications for international aid in the Czech Republic and Germany is the same.
NKÚ and BRH compared the statistics submitted by both Member States to the European Commission for the years 2006-2008
The data contained in these statistics did not match.
Both SAIs find it useful to renegotiate at EU level to find a way to avoid persistent inconsistencies.
Without this statistics will not be reliable and comparable.
In addition, SAI agrees that reliable statistics should include more information about VAT.
It would probably be helpful if the Commission, based on more detailed statistics, was to process analysis to help Member States strengthen the effectiveness of the fight against VAT fraud.
According to both SAIs, this means assistance for Member States with low enforcement success rate to increase the level of recovery to at least the EU average.
If a Member State so wishes, the Commission should actively participate in this process.
5. Control of large tax entities
SAI analysed the legal situation regarding VAT control for large tax entities (hereinafter also ′′ VDS ′′) in both countries.
In addition, they collected information from tax administrators on areas that SAI consider essential to the management of the issue.
The answers received clearly indicate that the situation in both countries develops differently.
The Czech Republic has a system based on a large volume of relevant data to direct the selection of cases with a tendency to risk (e.g. information from tax checks carried out, balance sheet data and profit and loss statements etc.).
This ensures effective management and analysis of VAT checks in general.
The establishment of a specialised VDS finance office is planned in 2012
There is no similar system in Germany yet, which makes it difficult to manage and analyse VAT checks in general.
Germany has so far more focused on the selection of individual cases in question, especially based on VAT tax return data and summary report.
Analysis of this data relies on various components of risk management that will be strengthened.
3. The course of the inspection action
3.1 The course of a control action in the Czech Republic
The inspection was carried out between May 2009 and February 2010 by Unit II.-by the department of state budget revenue and territorial unions IX. Pilsen, X. České Budějovice, XIII Brno and XV. Ostrava.

The College of the Supreme Supervisory Authority approved the inspection conclusion of this inspection action on April 27., 2010.
3.2 The course of inspection action in Germany
The inspection was carried out between February 2009 and February 2010 by the inspection unit for indirect taxes and personnel of designated regional inspection authorities in Berlin, Frankfurt am Main and Munich.
Following the selection of case samples, many spolkových were notified of the mission of the control action.
In addition to interviews at the Federal Ministry of Finance, there were control events in the following spolkových: • Bavaria, • Hamburg, • Hessen, • North Rhine-Westphalia, • Saxony.
Tax files of the following financial authorities were included: • Erlangen, Zentralfinanzamt München (Central Financial Office in Munich), Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Grafenau; • Hamburg-Nord (Hamburg-North), Hamburg für Großunternehmen (Hamburg-VDS);
In addition, there was a discussion with the financial authorities of Mühlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-Süd (Halle-south) and the financial directorates in Frankfurt am Main, Chemnitz and Münsteru.
The report on inspection findings was submitted to the Federal Ministry of Finance in April 2010.
3.3 Cooperation of both control institutions
The preparation of parallel control actions took place in September 2008 to discuss and identify control topics.
After December 2008, the top leaders of both SAI signed a cooperation agreement in the implementation of parallel checks.
At the Bonn meeting in June 2009, the control teams informed each other about the initial results achieved during the preparation of the inspection, discussed possible audit approaches and agreed next procedure together.
The second meeting took place in Prague from 2. to 4. December 2009.
The control teams have swapped findings together until then and agreed a timetable for compiling a joint report.
Both SAIs decided to focus on: • follow-up of the implementation of recommendations made in previous report zprávě verification of selected cases of intracommunitary transactions between tax payers from the Czech Republic and Germany, which were not resolved during previous parallel inspection, • verification of selected cases of intracommunitary transactions between tax payers from the Czech Republic and Germany, which have been classified as high risk cases, • control of the tax administration's procedure in international assistance for the recovery of VAT claims, • tax checks on large companies.
The report on the results of parallel control events was drawn up during the June 2010. work meeting.
4. VAT management check in selected areas
4.1 Evaluation of recommendations from previous inspection
4.1.1 Evaluation of recommendations in the Czech Republic
Recommendation 1
Conditions for registration of payers should be harmonised within the EU
Based on the results of the previous inspection action, NKÚ recommended adjusting the conditions of VAT registration and introducing a new rule for cancellation of registration in the Czech Republic.
Modified conditions should allow more effectively to reduce the risk of possible tax evasion with VAT collection.
In this context, it was found that in some cases the financial authorities did not use the authorization to revoke VAT registration for payers who did not fulfil their obligations under Law No. 235/2004 Coll., on value added tax (hereinafter referred to as the 'VAT Act').
The amendment of the provision consisting of the introduction of the duty of tax administrators to abolish VAT registration for payers during the repeated non-filing of VAT tax return has not yet been proposed by the Czech Ministry of Finance.
According to the VAT Act, the tax manager can revoke the registration of the tax payer 'ex offo' in cases where: (a) the payer has failed to carry out the tax administrator without notification of the reason for the tax administrator for consecutive months of transactions, (b) the payer does not fulfil his obligations under this law, c) the payer ceases to be a taxable person.
In the previous inspection action, it was found that the applicable legislation allowed the FÚ for Prague 1 to cancel VAT registration on 31. January of the following calendar year called. non-established payers who were not incurred during the current calendar year no obligation to admit and pay tax.
FÚ for Prague 1 often did not cancel VAT registration for these payers, because the relevant provision provided for the cancellation of registration insufficient time limit.
This issue has been remedied by the amendment to the VAT Act with effect from 1. January 2009.
The tax administrator is entitled to revoke the registration of a non-established tax payer in case the tax payer has not supplied any taxable goods or services in the previous calendar year or goods or services exempted from taxation with the right to deduct VAT.
Recommendation 2
Monthly submission of summary reports
As part of international cooperation, it was recommended that all EU countries introduce a monthly deadline for summary reporting.
The Council Directive reduces the period for which summary reports on intra-EU transactions are submitted to one month. This measure was implemented in the Czech Republic through the VAT Act with effect from 1. January 2010.
Newly, the obligation to report summary reports in electronic form is also established.
The summary report must be submitted to the payer even if there are services for which the place of delivery is determined in accordance with Section 9 (9). Article 1 (1) of the VAT Act, provided to another Member State to a taxable person in another Member State and if he is liable to admit and pay tax to their recipient on such services.
This obligation is based on Council Directive 2008/8 / EC amending Directive No 2008/8 2006/112 / EC as regards the place of service.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of VAT returns and summary reports to achieve greater reliability of VIES data This recommendation was related to the German tax administration.
The Czech administration conducts a comparison of data on intracommunitary transactions reported in VAT tax returns and summary reports of Czech payers automatically in ADIS system.
Recommendation 4
Sharing successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system at EU level
Proper VAT collection is one of the necessary preconditions for the proper functioning of the EU internal market.
The fight against VAT fraud is therefore one of the areas of priority interest and has been given considerable attention in recent years.
The importance of this fight is testified, among others. the conclusions of a study published by the European Commission in October 2009, where the external evaluator tried to determine the difference between the legitimate and actually collected VAT amount in 25 EU Member States (hereinafter referred to as ′′ EU-25 ′′) during the period 2000-2006.
Based on the analysis of the available data, the author of the analysis concluded that the estimated amount of loss from unpaid VAT for this period is EUR 90 billion, with on average 12 % of the eligible VAT not collected annually in the EU-25 I'm sorry.
For the Czech Republic, the VAT loss for 2006 was even estimated at 18 %.
In the context of international cooperation, it was stated in the previous control action that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by just one Member State.
Successful criteria, components and approaches of this system must be shared and introduced in every EU Member State.
Regarding the risk management system, NKÚ has carried out a check on the EUROCANET system for information exchange in the EU.
Cases of risk intracommunitary transactions carried out by EU tax payers, included in the EUROCANET system have been selected for inspection (see Chapter 4.3).
The aims of improving administrative cooperation and increasing the effectiveness of the fight against VAT fraud should also be achieved by the establishment of the EUROFISC network, which should improve the cooperation of responsible authorities into a form enabling fraud to be detected already in their bud.
This network should later become an important source of information when assessing intra-Community transactions.
The ECOFIN Council approved the creation of the EUROFISC network on 7. October 200812, while setting out the basic principles to follow this network.
The preview of EUROFISC is an already functioning system of rapid and selective exchange of information EUROCANET developed by the Belgian tax administration in cooperation with other Member States and with the support of the European Commission and OLAF.
The aim of this system is to detect risk trading transactions and entities involved in organised VAT fraud.
4.1.2 Evaluation of recommendations in Germany
The evaluation of the recommendation from the first report brought the following findings:
Recommendation 1
Conditions for registration of payers should be harmonised within the EU
The German tax administration has established a well functioning tax payer registration system based on a detailed questionnaire.
The Federal Ministry of Finance alerted the Commission in October 2007.
Improvement of the system is done continuously.
Currently data from the questionnaire are being processed electronically and will then serve as part of risk management already during registration.
The Commission has submitted a proposal for an amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, which included common standards for tax payers registration and deregistration.
Member States requested further clarification and detailed development of the issue.
BRH asked the Federal Ministry of Finance to secure the level of standards already achieved in this area in Germany.
Recommendation 2
Monthly submission of summary reports
On April 8., 2010, a law on transposition of EU directives into national law was passed.
This law contains clauses on monthly submission of summary reports on intracommunitary delivery.
Those provisions took effect on 1. July 2010.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of data in VAT returns and summary reports to achieve greater reliability of VIES data and consideration of the interconnection of both VAT returns and summary reports
A joint working group consisting of workers from the spolkových and the Federal Ministry of Finance was established.
The group developed a strategy for automatic comparison of VAT tax returns data and summary reports.
This strategy is still being discussed in the spolkových.
The working group also dealt with a tool designed to optimise the control procedure for internal market transactions.
Recommendation 4
Sharing successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system at EU level Exchange of relevant information at EU level.
Germany participates in this exchange within the so-called. risk management platforms.
The European Commission supported the idea of this platform and based on a written consultation of 18. October 2006, the establishment of a risk management platform was added to the Fiscalis 2006-2007. action plan.
Members of the platform are further divided into subgroups that deal with individual topics such as: • risk management tools, • acting influence, • evaluation, • risk management update.
At the beginning of 2010 reports were published on the results of the activities of these subgroups.
4.1.3 Evaluation
Registration
The issue of conditions for VAT registration and cancellation of this registration in different countries has been addressed at EU level.
Proposal for amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 included an extension of existing EU databases, including VAT identification numbers database.
He also adjusted common minimum standards for tax payers registration and deregistration.
The issue of registration and cancellation of registration has been left to the national legislation of EU Member States for now.
Member States requested further clarification and detailed development of the issue.
BRH asked the Federal Ministry of Finance to ensure that the level of standards already reached in Germany does not fall.
On 8. June 2010 the ECOFIN Council reached political agreement on the proposed regulation.
The intention of common minimum standards has been abandoned.
Member States need to implement national procedures and are only required to inform the Administrative Cooperation Committee of these procedures.
Both SAIs regret that the Commission failed to convince Member States of the necessity of common standards for registering and deregistration of payers, because both SAI consider this measure an important element of prevention in the fight against VAT fraud.
They would therefore welcome the Commission to make further efforts in this direction.
Monthly submission of summary reports
In the context of international cooperation, it was recommended that all EU states introduce a monthly deadline for summary reports, allowing more timely examination of the values of intracommunitary transactions.
Council Directive Article 2008/117 (2008/117) EC amending Directive 2006/112 / EC on the common system of value added tax to combat tax evasion related to intra-Community transactions reduces the period for summary reports of intra-EU transactions to one a month.
In the Czech Republic, this measure was implemented through the VAT Act with effect from 1. January 2010, Germany took effect on July 1., 2010.
Germany has not introduced an obligation to report summary monthly reports according to the specified calendar, while the Czech Republic has (in accordance with EU directives).
Comparison of data in VAT returns and summary reports in Germany to achieve greater reliability of VIES data and to consider interconnection of both VAT returns systems and summary reports
The German tax administration accepted BRH recommendations and set up a working group to find possible solutions.
Work is ongoing so far and BRH will monitor further developments in detail.
Sharing successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system at EU level
Germany and the Czech Republic apply different approaches to the risk management system for the purpose of detecting risk-inclined traders.
NKÚ has carried out a check on the EUROCANET system for information exchange in the EU (see drip. 4.3).
BRH focused on German participation in the so-called in this area. risk management platform.
4.2 Subsequent inspection of selected cases of intracommunitary transactions
In the previous inspection action, the implementation of commercial transactions was jointly examined, where there were doubts about their implementation, or. irregularities in the way payers from both countries reported these commercial transactions in their tax returns to VAT or summary reports.
Both inspection institutions selected nine cases involving the intracommunitary movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany for subsequent inspection by tax administrations of both countries were not completed during the previous joint control action.
1)
The Czech payer bought goods worth EUR 22 686 from a German payer in the 1. th quarter of 2005
This acquisition of goods by the Czech payer in his tax return to VAT, because the German payer did not have VAT ID assigned, but only a tax number intended for domestic transactions in Germany.
Based on international administrative cooperation under Council Regulation (EC) No On 798/2003 July 798/2003, the Czech tax administrator received information that under the German VAT law, a payer who supplies goods to other Member States does not have to have VAT ID assigned to intracommunitary supply of goods exempted from VAT.
Follow-up inspection of the NKÚ found that, based on a check carried out by the Czech tax manager, the Czech tax payer filed an additional VAT return, admitting the acquisition of goods at the said value and at the same time in this tax return, he claimed the right to deduct VAT of the same amount.
2)
The Czech payer was supposed to buy EUR 12 561 from the German payer.
The Czech payer denied the acquisition of these goods and did not mention VAT in his tax return.
The German tax administration refused upon request under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 cooperation as the turnover of transactions did not exceed EUR 15 000
Since the Czech tax manager did not obtain evidence, he ended the check without finding and the tax liability remained at the original amount.
Following a follow-up inspection of the NKÚ found that the Czech tax manager received two spontaneous information from Germany under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, which showed that the German payer invoiced the goods to Slovakia.
The Czech payer bought goods from a Slovak payer and stated this acquisition in a proper VAT return for October 2004.
3)
The Czech payer was supposed to buy a car from a German payer in the 4. th quarter of 2004 CZK.
The Czech tax payer did not admit the acquisition of the goods in question.
This payer has not submitted tax returns to VAT since August 2004, so the tax manager measured VAT of CZK 0 for that quarter.
Based on information received in the international exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No In March 2007, 1798/2003 from Germany, the tax administrator called on the payer to submit an additional tax return to VAT, which the payer did not submit.
Follow-up inspection found that the tax administrator carried out further tax procedures in 2007, which showed that the car in question sold to the Czech payer to the Czech payer.
The Czech tax administrator issued a payment for the tax period December 2004, which he additional paid VAT for the acquisition of goods from another Member State and subsequent sale of CZK 295
By order of the regional court, the Czech payer was cancelled with liquidation and a liquidator was established.
In the absence of foreclosures of the tax borrower's property, this outstanding balance appears impregnable.
4)
The Czech payer was supposed to deliver new means of transport (cars) to Germany during the 4. th quarter of 2004 and the 1. th quarter of 2005 totalling EUR 198 167
From reply to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 it appeared that there is an unfinished tax-criminal proceedings against the German entity in Germany.
Following a follow-up check, BRH received information that after the end of the tax proceeding in Germany, it was demonstrable to find that the German tax payer was incorporated into fraudulent activities.
Intracommunitary acquisition of goods was taxed EUR 182 424 (year 2004) and EUR 369 690 (year 2005).
NKÚ found out by subsequent inspection that the Czech payer was involved in carousel shops with new means of transport.
Based on information from the German tax administration regarding the verification of delivery of goods, VAT was started with the Czech tax agency for the tax period April, May and June 2005.
Based on the inspection findings and information collected in the international exchange of information, the tax administrator additional VAT for the period May 2005, 031 CZK and 703 CZK for the period June 2005
5)
Czech payer A was supposed to buy a machine totaling EUR 58 000 from a German payer in February 2005
This German payer was supposed to supply the Czech payer B with a machine worth EUR 88 027 in the 3. st quarter of 2004, but the payer B denied this acquisition.
Subsequent inspection of the NKÚ found that payer B bought a machine from a German company that had an organisational component established in the Czech Republic.
Czech payer A did not show the acquisition of goods from a German payer in his VAT tax return.
From a German tax manager's response to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 it appeared that the German payer did not carry out an intracommunitary delivery of the machine worth EUR 58 000, but the supply of goods within the Czech Republic.
BRH found after the tax inspection that after the tax check was carried out, the intracommunitary supply of the machine was reclassified to supply the machine in the country and the VAT exemption was abolished.
6)
The German tax payer was supposed to supply the Czech payer with EUR 11 600 in the 3. th quarter of 2004
The goods were bought and sold in Germany in 2005
The NKÚ subsequent inspection found that the Czech tax administrator measured the additional tax return for VAT filed, where the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State was wrongly stated, including the acquisition of goods at the said value.
BRH found that after receiving a reply to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) No On 1798/2003 July 1798/2003, the German tax administrator corrected the tax return for the German payer's VAT and additional EUR 1 600
The further movement of goods in Germany and the application of VAT in Germany is subject to tax control.
The summary report of the German payer has not yet been corrected, because repairs of summary reports in Germany can only be made by the payer who submitted the summary report.
7)
The Czech tax administrator received a request for information from the German tax administration under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 whether the Czech tax payer bought a car from a German payer in February 2005, worth EUR 47 400
The Czech tax administrator, after the tax procedure carried out for the tax period February 2005, measured the Czech tax payer's tax liability of CZK 0 and told the German tax manager that he cannot confirm the acquisition of the car by a Czech payer.
Subsequent inspection of the NKÚ found that registration of the Czech VAT payer was cancelled in 2007 for failure to comply with duties and the Czech tax manager sent documents to the police of the Czech Republic.
Following the check of BRH, he found that the German payer changed his seat and the new local tax manager cancelled the VAT exemption on the delivery of the vehicle to the Czech payer on the basis of the inspection carried out.
The German tax payer has not yet corrected the data in the summary report and filed an appeal against the tax manager's decision.
8)
According to VIES data, the German taxpayer supplied goods totalling EUR 33 205 to the 1. th quarter of 2005 according to data from the VIES system.
Subsequent inspection of the NKÚ found that the Czech tax manager was trying to identify the causes of differences caused by the Czech tax payer when acquiring goods between the 3. th quarter of 2004 and the 1. th quarter of 2005.
The Czech tax payer repeatedly submitted additional tax return to VAT for the 1. st quarter of 2005.
The Czech tax administrator did not explain the difference in the value of the goods purchased between CZK 134 and 273 for the period of the 3. th quarter of 2004, because according to the Czech tax administrator it was not possible to accurately capture the commercial transactions for individual quarter and therefore the tax manager accepted additional tax returns.
9)
The German tax payer supplied the Czech payer with EUR 46 854 in the 3. st quarter of 2004
The Czech payer admitted only EUR 14 856 intracommunitary acquisition of goods in the same period.
Czech tax administrator verified the amount of deliveries made in the international exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
The reply to the request for information received from Germany was accompanied by 3 invoices with a total value of the supply of goods EUR 31 998, which is the value corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech payer in the VAT tax return and the data given in VIES I'm sorry.
Follow-up inspection of the NKÚ found that the Czech payer filed additional tax return to VAT for the July 2004 to January 2007. after many urgences.
In this tax return, the tax payer also claimed the right to deduct VAT, thus the tax liability for the said tax period remained unchanged.
The subsequent inspection verified that most tax proceedings were completed in selected cases of commercial transactions between payers from the Czech Republic and Germany and that tax administrators in the Czech Republic and Germany took adequate measures (i.e. additional VAT or prevented tax refund on entry).
4.3 Checking selected cases of risk intracommunitary transactions
4.3.1 Results of inspection in the Czech Republic
EUROCANET may be an important source of information for the detection of risk entities within the Member State where goods were acquired.
In the Czech Republic, the signal information obtained from the EUROCANET system was compared by the local financial authorities with customer data.
Starting in the 1. th quarter of 2008, the Czech Republic sends data on risk transactions and tax entities acting as suppliers into the EUROCANET system.
Nine Czech tax entities included EUROCANET were selected for inspection as part of international cooperation.
These entities acted either as suppliers or as buyers of goods.
Relevant data from tax administrators from other Member States were captured in EUROCANET.
Since the German tax administration did not participate in the exchange of data in the EUROCANET system, no information could be obtained to help determine whether suppliers with German VAT ID were evaluated by the German tax administration as risk entities.
The control action revealed cases of normal commercial transactions and cases with suspicion of involvement in carousel shops or VAT fraudulent conduct.
Where relevant, tax administrators benefited from exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
For example:
• Tax administrators did not reveal any suspicions of involvement in risk transactions when verifying signal information.
The financial authorities monitor such tax entities on a continuous basis for their inclusion in the EUROCANET system.
• During the verification of risk transactions, the financial authorities did not demonstrate in the submitted accounting records derogations from the rules applicable to the calculation of the tax base and VAT, despite finding irregularities in the transport and storage of goods or reveal trade relations with suspicious or non-contact companies from other Member States.
• Verification of business transactions was complicated because some tax payers did not cooperate with tax administrators and could not be contacted.
Locally competent financial authorities mostly checked the risk tax entities and risk transactions specified in the EUROCANET signal information.
Tax administrators when checking risk transactions, especially in connection with the so-called verification. missing traders, they have limited options and only from physical document control it is difficult to prove fraudulent behavior to the tax body.
Stronger requirements for registration of VAT payers and more flexible cancellation of registration would help reduce missing trader scams.
For tax entities involved in carousel fraud and other fraudulent activities, VAT is registered for the purpose of reporting fictitious supply of goods within the EU or for the purpose of issuing formal tax documents to payers, who illegally draw VAT deductions on entry due to them.
In cases where tax entities are suspected to involve in carousel shops and other fraud and imports and exports of goods from third countries, it would be appropriate to ensure greater cooperation between customs and financial authorities.
Closer cooperation of these institutions would help in identifying goods and irregularities in transport documentation and monitoring the physical movement of goods within the EU towards the end consumer.
The participation of EU Member States in the EUROCANET system is voluntary.
The fact that three large Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not participate in the operation of the EUROCANET system, the European Parliament evaluated at the end of 2008 as a weakness of this system, which should be eliminated by the establishment of a mandatory EUROFISC network.
4.3.2 Results of the inspection in Germany
BRH analysed information available with the Federal Central Financial Authority, which contained data from the EUROCANET system.
These data were the criteria for selecting six German tax payers files for inspection.
Germany, like some other countries, refused to actively participate in the EUROCANET system.
Germany thus has a passive status, which means it does not send data to Brussels, but is only a recipient of data from the EUROCANET system.
The justification of this position is contained in the following statement :. in the opinion of the government, it is not legally admissible for state (public) institutions to provide data to the EUROCANET system.
Currently there is no legal base that would allow tax information to be violated.
In addition, the government has no reliable information on how such data are used by other Member States within EUROCANET." 17 Since October 2007, the Federal Central Tax Office has been analyzing data from the EUROCANET system and advancing it to the finančním's financial authorities in compliance with the agreed procedure.
German financial authorities receive control information on the direct trade relations of payers (registered with specific financial authorities) with traders from other Member States who have been included in the EUROCANET scheme.
However, German financial authorities do not receive any information about whether such a trader from another Member State has any risk trading relations with traders from other Member States who also maintain trade relations with the German trader in question.
4.3.3 Evaluation
The Czech Republic is an active participant in the EUROCANET system, while Germany has passive status.
It is unsatisfactory for an active participant if some Member States refuse active participation.
As a result of this fact, the control in a given area had to be carried out in different ways.
However, the results did not reveal big differences in VAT fraud detection, since the EUROCANET system is not the only systemic risk management tool.
Tax administrations of both countries have many other tools to detect fraudulent transactions, but it is necessary to create a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.
The EU Council has reached a political agreement on the proposal for a regulation, whose main contribution is to the establishment of the EUROFISC network.
Experience gained from the use of data from the EUROCANET system should become part of the expected VAT fraud network.
Member States should therefore communicate their experience at European level.
On the other hand, cases presented to courts at national and European level show that discussion between Member States and the Commission is probably necessary about the conditions of tax exemptions in intracommunitary transactions.
4.4 Mutual assistance in recovery of claims
4.4.1 International assistance in the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic
In particular, the following directives are the basic regulation of international cooperation in the recovery of certain financial claims within the EU:
• Council Directive No 76/308 / EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims arising from operations which are part of the system of financing the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund as well as agricultural levies and customs duties;
• Council Directive No 2001/44 / EC amending Directive No 2001/44 76/308 / EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims arising from operations which form part of the system for financing the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, agricultural levies and customs duties, value added tax and certain excise duties;
• Commission Directive 2002/94 / EC implementing certain provisions of Council Directive No 2002/94 / EC 76/308 / EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims resulting from certain levies, duties, taxes and other measures.
In the Czech Republic there was Council Directive No. 76/308 / EEC implemented by law no. 252/2000 Coll., on international assistance in the recovery of certain financial claims.
Following the adoption of Council Directive 2001/44 / EC it was necessary to implement this directive into the Czech law and at the same time amendment of the said law No. 252/2000 Coll.
In this context a new law no has been adopted 191/2004 Coll., on international assistance in the recovery of certain financial claims.
The new regulation in the system of adaptation of international cooperation in the recovery of certain financial claims within the EU is Commission Regulation (EC) No 1179/2008 of 28. 2008.
The Annex to the Regulation sets out new models of applications, which have been used since 1. 1. 2009, the obligation of electronic communication and the obligation of the requesting authority to confirm the conformity of the documents sent with the original document.
Guidelines for international cooperation in recovery of claims:
1. reciprocity;
2. assistance is always provided only on request containing the prescribed elements;
3. aid does not apply to financial claims that are in the requested State of criminal penalties;
4. in the provision of international assistance for the recovery of claims shall be followed by the national law of the country which was asked for assistance;
5. foreign claims do not have a priority in enforcement;
6. assistance is provided only for the recovery of undisputed claims;
7. principle of exhaustion (the requesting state without success used all the applicable option to recover the claim given by its legal order).
Act No. 191/2004 Coll. defines three forms of assistance, namely the provision of information, the delivery of documents and self-recovery of claims.
Procedure for sending claims to other EU Member States
Local competent tax authority electronic sends a request for information, a request for delivery or a request for recovery of claims together with relevant documents to the Czech Ministry of Finance via the Financial Directorate.
The Czech Ministry of Finance will arrange a translation of the application into the relevant language, scan it including attachments and sends to the competent tax administration of the designated state via the CCN / CSI network.
Two essential requirements apply to enforcement: the claim must be more than EUR 1 500 and must not be older than 5 years.
If those requirements are not met, the requested authority may refuse the enforcement.
Procedure for receiving claims from other EU Member States
When receiving an application from another Member State, the Czech Ministry of Finance must confirm the receipt of the application as soon as possible, within seven days at the latest.
If the Czech Ministry of Finance decides not to comply with the application, it shall inform the applicant authority of the reasons for rejecting the application and shall indicate the specific provisions of the directive it relies upon.
This communication must be sent no later than three months after the date of receipt of the application.
After accepting the application, the Czech Ministry of Finance will verify whether the application has all the elements under the law and should immediately transmit the application to the local financial authority for processing through the financial directorate.
If the application for recovery is accepted, tax administrator among others find out the debtor's property, e.g. acquiring real estate cadastral extracts, checking accounts in banks, verifying vehicle registration at the DMV etc.
The Czech Ministry of Finance should inform the applicant authority of the outcome of the investigation carried out to obtain the information requested.
In the case of non-contact tax entities, when the claim is not possible, the requesting authority should also be informed of this fact.
Any amount recovered by the tax manager shall be transferred to the requesting authority in CZK within one month of the date on which the claim was recovered.
It is not excluded that the Czech tax administrator enforcing foreign claims allow waiting for payment or payment in instalments if the state that asked for enforcement agrees with it.
During the period of enforcement the debtor is prescribed interest or penalty payment under law No. 337/1992 Coll., about tax management and fees.
This interest or penalty payment belongs to the state that applied for the enforcement.
In the case of applications received for enforcement, the Czech Ministry of Finance did not forward local tax administrators applications for processing in a timely manner, especially in 2006 and 2007.
Similar situation was found in international aid in recovery of claims and in case of applications received from tax administrators from the Czech Republic.
The control action revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance did not proceed in accordance with law No. 191/2004 Coll., because the local competent authority of the Member State did not inform the progress made in enforcement within six months of the date of receipt of the application was confirmed.
This situation has been improving since 2008
Statistical data
Czech Ministry of Finance in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 13 (13). Article 4 of Law No. 191/2004 Coll. process statistical data for the European Commission by 15. March each year, indicating the number of requests for information, receipt or recovery, sent or received in the previous year, indicating the amount of claims covered by the application.
The European Commission shall process the report on the state of recovery of claims submitted to the EU Council and the European Parliament based on the documents provided by all EU Member States.
The inspection found that the Czech Ministry of Finance underestimated statistics due to an error in the asset item in 2008 by 250 5 thousand. EUR, by indicating the incorrect value of the enforced VAT claim (it was a shift of the decimal point after the conversion of the claim from Czech crowns to the value in euro).
This error was subsequently reflected in European Commission statistics.
Information on mutual assistance including amounts recovered is given in the table below.
4.4.2 International aid in recovery of claims in Germany
Legal authorization for international administrative assistance in tax matters derives from European Community law, Council Directive Commission Regulation of 2008/55 November 2008 (ECR) and Commission Regulation of 28. November 2008 (EC Implementing Directive).
In the interests of more accessible wording and better clarity, the EC directive on the recovery of claims codifies Council Directive No 76/308 / EEC of 15. March 197621, whose provisions have been substantially modified several times.
The provisions apply, inter alia. for VAT recovery, income tax and capital income tax, including accessories.
The EC directive on recovery of claims was transposed into German national law by law (EC) on the collection of state taxes of 3. May 2003.
The enforcement procedure in Germany follows the German fiscal code.
Article 117.2 of the Code stresses that tax authorities can provide international judicial and administrative assistance based on international agreements and legal instruments of the European Communities valid in national jurisdiction and under the EC Administrative Assistance Act.
Part six of the German fiscal code (Articles 249-346) enshrines statutory provisions governing the enforcement procedure.
Administrative operations of the financial authorities follow in particular instructions for execution and enforcement instructions.
The Federal Ministry of Finance reached an agreement with representatives of the nejvyšších's highest tax authorities regarding the principles of administrative assistance in taxation, and transferred its own responsibility in this matter to the Federal Central Tax Office.

4.4.4 Comparison and evaluation
In the field of international aid in the recovery of claims, all EU Member States are governed by the same European legislation.
Therefore, the method of handling applications for international aid in the Czech Republic and Germany is the same.
NKÚ and BRH compared the statistics submitted by both Member States to the European Commission for the period 2006-2008
The data contained in these statistics did not match.
In the 2006 report, the European Commission recommended that Member States pay increased attention to the management of their statistics.
In the 2009 report, the Commission concluded that the incidence of inconsistencies in statistics decreased despite the increase in the number of applications.
Both SAIs consider it important that statistics are renegotiated at EU level.
This discussion should focus on how to avoid persistent inconsistencies, otherwise the data reported by individual EU states will not be reliable and comparable in statistics.
In addition, both SAIs agree that reliable statistics should report an annual number of applications and the nature of the claims in question (i.e. whether the claims relate to VAT, income tax etc.) also amounts of claims received by individual Member States.
Both SAIs consider it important for the Commission to provide more detailed analyses of statistics submitted by Member States, as this may help Member States to assess their own effectiveness in the fight against VAT fraud.
The fact that it is possible to calculate the level of recovery of claims broken down into individual Member States, both SAIs find it useful to intensify their efforts and to improve the level of recovery of claims at least to the EU average level.
If a Member State so wishes, the Commission should actively participate in this process.
Especially in 2006 and 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance did not submit to local tax administrators applications for recovery of claims on time.
Similar situation was found in applications for international assistance received from tax administrators from the Czech Republic.
The control action revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance did not proceed in accordance with law No. 191/2004 Coll., on international aid in recovery of claims because it did not inform the local competent authority of the Member State about the progress made in recovery within six months of the date of receipt of the application.
4.5 Control of large tax entities
4.5.1 Control of large tax entities in the Czech Republic
General information
The VAT audit of large tax entities is governed by the same rules as that of other tax entities.
Procedure for the inspection of VDS is based on law No. 337/1992 Coll., about tax management and fees.
The Czech Ministry of Finance defined the VDS as natural or legal persons who were established or established for business and whose net turnover for the tax period specified in the tax return of natural / legal persons amounted to 2 billion. CZK or higher.
The inclusion of the tax entity among the VDS was submitted after the filing of the income tax return for the relevant taxation period, for the first time in 2003.
The tax entity ceased to be referred to as the VDS if, in three consecutive tax periods since the end of the period when it filed the tax return based on which it was placed among the VDS, its net turnover over the tax period fell below that threshold.
The tax body was not allowed to be excluded from the VDS record without carrying out a tax check of at least one tax for one tax period.
All VDS were checked in at least five-year periodicity by the end of 2009
Since 2010, at least once every 2 years a written assessment of the tax body must be carried out and the subsequent procedure chosen must eliminate tax risks and their negative impact on the correct determination and collection of the tax.
The Kontrola control focuses on at least one type of tax; the tax manager usually chooses several tax periods at once.
VDS were controlled by specialized inspection departments, which are set up in total for 13 FÚ or by inspection staff of local competent FÚ
The department of specialised inspections shall carry out tax checks within the scope established by the Director of the Financial Directorate.
In addition to large tax entity audits, it also examines
• tax entities operating in unusual and specific business fields;
• entities for which tax inspection is professionally and time consuming;
• entities with branched territorial and organisational structure;
• entities suspected of extensive tax evasion;
• entities linked in chains and networks suspected of extensive tax evasion and unauthorized attraction of excessive deductions.
The number of tax checks carried out by departments of specialised specializovaných checks and the results of these checks are shown in Table 3.
The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed amendment to law No. 531/1990 Coll., about territorial financial institutions, which consists of establishing a specialised FÚ with national scope for selected tax entities (among others) for business-based legal entities that have reached a turnover of more than 2 billion. CZK).
4.5.2 Control of large tax entities in Germany
General information
VAT checks for large companies follow the same rules as tax checks in general, i.e. the relevant provisions are enshrined in the following rules: • German fiscal code (AO), • Fiscal Administration Act (FVG), • Tax Control Regulations (BpO).
Other methodological documents are in effect.
German fiscal code
The statutory rules on control are enshrined in Articles 193-203 of the German fiscal code in Section IV - On-the-spot Tax check. In particular, these articles enshrine rules of admissibility of on-the-spot tax checks (i.e. in the premises of the undertaking), their scope by the subject line, rules on the distribution of responsibilities, form and content of the inspection notification, the principle of control, the tax body's obligation to cooperate and the preconditions for the implementation of the final examination and the communication of the inspection report.
On-the-spot tax checks are carried out by responsible financial authorities (Article 195 of the Code).
Act on fiscal administration According to Article 5.1 (1) in custody of Article 5.1 (1) Article 19 of the law is the participation in on-the-spot tax checks carried out by the financial authorities for the Federal Central Financial Office.
The participating authorities will agree together on the spot the nature and extent of the participation of the Federal Central Tax Office in tax checks.
In addition, the Federal Central Tax Office has the right to demand that the specific businesses it select be controlled at the time it determines.
In such a case he may declare rules on the execution and content of the inspection at the premises of these companies.
The rules on tax checks According to Article 108.7 of the German Constitution, the rules on tax checks (German shortcut BpO 2000) were approved by the Federal Council (Bundesrat, the upper chamber of the German parliament, where the governments of the spolkových are represented).
These administrative regulations apply to on-the-spot inspections carried out by the financial authorities of the spolkových and the Federal Central Tax Office.
Enterprises are classified according to size at regular intervals in accordance with Article 3 BpO 2000.
Large enterprises are subject to follow-up (Article 4.2 BpO).
According to Article 33.1 BpO 2000, every informed tax office must keep a register of groups of companies as defined in BpO 2000.
Methodical instructions
In addition to the above, it provides additional methodology for tax administration as follows:
• Uniform manual for special VAT checks in Germany;
• a USLO manual that sets out methodology for the use of data on intracommunitary business relationships led by VIES;
• ZAUBER manual, which sets out the methodology for using the ZAUBER database;
• work aids for various and special items.
The classification of tax entities is based on criteria such as turnover and net profit, with different limits according to business type.
The Federal Ministry of Finance publishes the data.
They are always evaluated in three years and fixed for the next three years.
The number of companies to check - not only big companies - must be set at regular inspection intervals.
In general, checks on large enterprises are carried out on a continuous basis.
Checks are usually announced including VAT checks.
This means that during the inspection the checks will be finalised mainly in income taxes, excise duties and VAT - i.e. checks on all types of relevant taxes.
VAT checks can be carried out either by tax inspectors or by VAT inspectors.
Implementation varies and depends on the organisational arrangement of the spolkových.
The number of tax seasons covered by checks usually ranges between three and five years.
BpO 2000 forecast a three-year inspection period.
The subject of the examination is all taxes given to the company.
4.5.3 Management of control of large tax agencies
Both SAIs decided not to check individual cases of VDS checks carried out, but focused on management issues to gain insight into how tax administrations manage VAT checks at VDS.
Through a questionnaire, they collected information from tax administrators on areas they consider essential for managing the issue.
• What statistical records and analyses regarding VAT control with VDS does tax administration have available?
In particular:
• Are there any statistics or record rates whereby differentiates between fighting against VAT fraud and generally VAT control?
Czech Republic: No, the ADIS system does not allow such distinction with the current data version.
Germany: The tax administration does not distinguish between the control proposed to combat VAT fraud and general VAT control.
• Are there any statistics or timeliness of VAT checks (in custody for the time period of controlled transactions)?
Czech Republic: Registration of timeliness of inquiry with relevance for intracommunitary acquisition of goods for selected VAT payers is shown in ADIS system.
In addition, information registered in ADIS is also part of the type of information, how long the questioning took.
Germany: No, uniform statistics at the Federal level for tax inspectors contain only information about the average time of the last inspection (year information).
This data does not provide an overview of selected inspection periods with respect to individual entrepreneurs.
VAT inspectors focus on the latest period of tax measurement; they also have the right to carry out VDS checks.
However, statistics created at the Federal level for special VAT inspection services do not provide information regarding the classification of tax entities.
• Are there any statistics or records on the nature of additional tax revenue generated, broken down for example according to the following criteria:
i. net tax increase (e.g. in cases where the tax body unduly applied a reduced VAT rate instead of the standard tax rate);
ii. only nominal tax increase (eg transfer of a fully qualified VAT case to another tax period);
iii. additional tax revenue collection (payment due additional tax payable).
Czech Republic:
The Czech tax administration monitors the number of tax verifications performed, the volume of additional tax collected broken down by type of tax, according to the number of tax agencies controlled and according to the number of tax periods checked.
Other tax procedures (local investigation, accusation proceedings) are followed in the same way.
Time stamps and amounts of additional tax paid are registered as a separate task.
Statistics of general debt broken down by type of tax, but not by declared tax or tax found by the tax manager.
Germany: No, uniform statistics at the Federal level for tax inspectors and special VAT inspection services do not distinguish between the above criteria.
In addition, these differences are not distinguished by most tax administrations visited.
• Are there areas of control that generate high additional revenue?
Czech Republic: Yes, the tax administrator has the right to collect tax payer for verification based on criteria that can be linked to selected indicators in special sections ADIS.
Germany: There are no regulations at the Federal level.
This follows that uniform statistics at the Federal level for tax inspectors and special VAT inspection services do not provide such data.
However, there is one coordinated approach of the Ministers of Finance of the spolkových and the Federal Government.
In the ZAUBER database, tax inspectors or tax investigators from the spolkových must register an increased tax (VAT) requirement if they exceed a certain amount.
In this case they must specify for example the nature of the measured tax increase.
• What findings are the most common?
Czech Republic:
- VDS claim unauthorized right to deduct tax on entry for supplies and services:
• which were not used to carry out any economic activity under Paragraph 72 (72) of the basic Regulation. 1 VAT Act;
• which were used for representation under Section 75 (75). 3 VAT Act;
• based on tax documents that did not meet the requirements set out in Section 73 (73). 1 VAT Act;
- VDS did not declare VAT on output according to Section 21 (21). 1 VAT Act.
Germany: It has been stated that there are no rules at the Federal level.
This follows that uniform statistics at the Federal level for tax inspectors and special VAT inspection services do not provide such data.
VAT findings are not independently registered by the spolkovými if they result from VDS tax checks.
However, in the ZAUBER database, where tax inspectors or tax investigators from the spolkových must write the increased tax (VAT) requirement, if they exceed a certain amount, the Federal Central Authority is able to analyse this information.
• Does the tax administration analyse the areas of control from which high ′′ yields ′′ and produces consequences for management?
Czech Republic: Yes, for example, they start national audits focused on risk commodities or the subject of economic activity.
Germany: There are no regulations at the Federal level.
Uniform statistics at the Federal level for tax inspectors and special VAT inspection departments do not provide data on the audit areas from which high ′′ revenue ".
There are various opinions on the analysis process, as well as on case management in terms of importance.
Some regional financial authorities provide special information, but its use is on the own account of the financial authorities.
4.5.4 Comparison and evaluation
Differences in the replies of both Member States show that the Czech Republic provides a system that collects a lot of data from tax checks carried out and data from accounts - balance sheet and profit and loss accounts.
Based on a wide range of data, the Czech Republic is able to direct the selection of cases with risk inclined.
The same applies to VAT analysis and management in general.
In 2012, the Czech Republic is planned to set up a specialised VDS management financial authority.
In Germany, the tax administration does not collect this information.
This shows that it is more difficult to perform these tasks in a similar way.
However, Germany's philosophy places greater emphasis on choosing individual cases based on data from submitted tax returns.
Risk management components will therefore be strengthened and improved.
Based on adequate reference comments, expert auditors must be able to calculate the exact amount of VAT.
Both SAIs agree that Member States should be able to provide adequate financial management and adequate risk management system.
This will help reduce VAT income outages.
The result will increase VAT revenue and the risk detection rate for unreliable entrepreneurs will improve.
5. Conclusion
The cooperation of both SAIs on parallel VAT management checks met the goals set by NKÚ and BRH.
Both SAIs have better recognized each other's valid systems in the following areas: • intracommunitary transactions, • VAT risk management, especially regarding the selection of risk-inclined transactions, • VAT recovery assistance and a VAT control for large tax entities.
Thanks to mutual cooperation, differences in VAT fraud cases and differences in the above mentioned VAT management areas in the Czech Republic and Germany were revealed.
Check findings were compared and best practices were identified based on them.
In addition, both SAIs hope that the results achieved will become an impetus for stakeholders to start discussions on approaches and strategies within Member States, among them and at European Commission level.
Extremely valuable experience and knowledge gained from the cooperation of both SAIs can serve as an encouragement to carry out future VAT control actions.
