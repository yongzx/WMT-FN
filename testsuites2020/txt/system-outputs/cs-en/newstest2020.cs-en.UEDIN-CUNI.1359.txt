Report on the results of parallel checks on the management of value added tax between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic carried out in 2005
Introductory word
The submitted material informs about the progress and results of parallel checks carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the NajA Supervisory Office of the Slovak Republic, which were focused on the area of value added tax management and the use of the VIES information system (Value Added Tax Information Exchange System).
In May 2004, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic joined the European Union, so revenues from value added tax affect not only the state budgets of both countries, but also the budget of the European Union as a whole.
Parallel control actions were aimed in particular at checking the procedure of the tax authorities in examining the amount of value added tax paid in commercial transactions carried out between individual Member States of the European Union.
The introduction of the VIES system enabled the electronic exchange of information on the registration of VAT payers in individual Member States of the European Union and on commercial transactions carried out by these payers.
The mismatch between the VIES data and the data in the VAT return submitted by the payer should alert the tax authorities to suspicious cases and allow the detection of tax evasion or fraud.
The benefits of the parallel checks carried out consisted not only in the exchange of information on the progress of financial or tax authorities in the management of value added tax, but in particular in examining the use of the VIES system in checking the application of the right to an exemption from value added tax in intracomonality transactions.
The lessons learned in the implementation of parallel controls are beneficial for the development of mutual cooperation and will be used in carrying out further parallel controls in cooperation with the control institutions of the Member States of the European Union.
Report on the results of parallel checks on the management of value added tax for the period from 1 January 2004 to 30 June 2005
Introduction
Control number: (CZ) 05/19 (SK) 22/2005
Subject of scrutiny: (CZ) Value Added Tax Administration, (SK) Control of the procedure of tax authorities in the administration, control and enforcement of value added tax and fulfilment of roles under VIES for the exchange of information between EU Member States
The Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the SAO, the Czech Republic) and the Najvyšší Control Office of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as the SAO of the Slovak Republic) concluded the Cooperation in Control Activities on 12 December 2005.
The subject of the contract was cooperation in the implemented parallel control actions of the "Value Added Tax Administration", included in the control activity plan of the SAO, the Czech Republic for 2005 under No 05/19 and "Control of the procedure of the tax authorities in spiral, control and recovery of dane from the pridé value and pleneni roles within the VIES system on the fabric of information media by the member regions of the ECO", included in the control activity plan of the SAO SR SAO under No 22/2005.
Parallel control actions carried out were in the nature of coordinated checks.
The outcome of the joint coordinated control was drawn up within the meaning of European Implementing Regulation No 31 for INTOSAI control standards.
The cooperation consisted of exchanging information to the extent provided for in the contract and in drawing up a joint final report on the outcome of parallel checks.
The purpose of the coordinated check was to verify selected cases of delivery and acquisition of goods in suspicious commercial transactions between value added tax payers from the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the Czech Republic) and the Slovak Republic (SR).
The two parties have contracted to provide each other with information from public sources, the VIES electronic system (Value Added Tax Information Exchange System) and data on received and sent requests to investigate business transactions between the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
The checks were carried out in parallel between June and December 2005.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, the inspection was carried out by the State Budget Department and the territorial unions of Central Bohemia, northwest Bohemia, southern Bohemia, South Moravia, central Moravia and northern Moravia.
The audited bodies were the Ministry of Finance and 12 Financial Offices: Financial Office in Mladá Boleslav, Financial Office in Cologne, Financial Office in Teplice, Financial Office in Karlovy Vary, Financial Office in Tábor, Financial Office Brno III, Financial Office in Znojmo, Financial Office in Zlín, Financial Office in Šumperk, Financial Office Ostrava I, Financial Office for Prague 7 and Financial Office for Prague 9.
The audit on the territory of the SR was carried out by the Financial and Tax Section of the SAO SR in cooperation with Expoziturami SAO SR Banská Bystrica and Košice on 9 selected tax offices: Tax Úrad Bratislava I, Tax Úrad Komárno, Tax Úrad Trenčín, Tax Office Prievidza, Tax Úrad Zvolen, Tax Úrad Dolný Kubín, Tax Úrad Košice II, Tax Úrad Košice V and Tax Úrad Michalovce.
Objective of checks:
The aim of parallel control actions was to examine the procedure of financial or tax authorities in the management of value added tax (VAT) after the integration of the Czech Republic and Slovakia into the single internal market of the European Union (EU) and to examine the use of the VIES electronic information system, in particular when checking the application of the right to VAT exemption.
The audited period for coordinated control was the period from 1 May 2004 to 30 June 2005.
Summary of the results and evaluation of parallel control actions In the EU Member States, an electronic VIES system is in place, allowing tax administrations to check whether the supplier has been entitled to exempt taxable transactions from VAT and makes it possible to check in the country of destination whether the purchaser has properly admitted and taxed the acquired goods.
VIES is not centralised within the EU, each Member State is developing its own system.
The checks identified differences in the national VIES systems in the Czech Republic and Slovakia in the following areas:
The recapitulative statements shall indicate the values of deliveries of goods to other EU Member States, the values of the services provided shall not be included in the recapitulative statements.
Data from recapitulative statements submitted by Czech payers are processed in the Czech Republic at the level of the tax authorities, where they are compared with data on supplies of goods to other EU Member States listed in VAT returns.
The tax authorities shall transmit the data from the recapitulative statements to the Ministry of Finance (CLO), which sends them to other EU Member States.
In Slovakia, data from recapitulative statements filed by Slovak payers at tax offices are only converted into electronic form and processed centrally at the Slovak Tax Directorate (CLO).
In the Czech Republic, payers report the value of the supply of goods and the value of the provision of services to other EU Member States on separate lines of VAT returns, which makes it possible to compare the values given in the recapitulative reports with the values of the supply of goods according to VAT tax returns and to identify their possible differences.
In the SR, the values of goods delivered and services supplied to other EU Member States are reported cumulatively on the common row of the VAT return.
As a result, the system does not make it possible to automatically identify differences between the values of the supply of goods under VAT returns and recapitulative statements.
Separate reporting of the values of the supply of goods in VAT tax returns makes it possible to use the results of the comparison of data when checking the exemption of goods to the EU from VAT.
The supplied data from the recapitulative statements submitted by the payers in other EU Member States are processed into the CLO and compared with the value of the acquisition of goods mentioned by the payers from the Czech Republic or Slovakia in VAT tax returns.
In the SR, these figures are sent to the tax authorities and the tax authorities themselves decide which cases of differences to examine.
In the Czech Republic, the Ministry of Finance (CLO) will determine the quantified differences between the values of delivery and the acquisition of goods must be examined by the tax authorities, and hand over a list of these cases to the locally competent tax authorities.
This ensures that for the most significant derogations, it will be examined whether VAT has been awarded at the correct amount when acquiring the goods.
The audit also highlighted some of the problems in the VAT management system of the complications caused by the different reporting of intracomonality transactions (i.e. the supply and acquisition of goods made by payers from different EU Member States):
Summary reports are made in the EU for each calendar quarter and the maximum time limit for processing and sending data to other EU Member States is set at 3 months from the end of the relevant quarter.
Reducing the period for which recapitulative statements are made for one month, together with the shortening of the deadline for processing them, would allow earlier access to the VIES data.
Tax administrators would thus be able to examine more effectively whether VAT was awarded at the correct amount in intracomonarian acquisitions.
At the same time, filing VAT returns and recapitulative statements for the same tax year (month) would allow faster verification of whether the payer has reported the same values of the supply of goods to the EU in the recapitulative statement as well as the VAT return.
The differences between the values of delivery of goods reported by EU payers and the values of the acquisition of goods reported by payers from the Czech Republic or SR were due, among other things, to different reporting of data on intracomonality delivery and acquisition in individual EU Member States.
These included, for example, the inclusion of received advances in the recapitulative reports, or the reporting of intracomonant supplies in the supplier's recapitulative statement in a quarter other than intracomonality acquisitions in the tax return on the purchaser's VAT return.
A unification of the conditions for reporting these data within the EU would lead to streamlining the control activity of national tax administrations.
The cooperation of the SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO SR was also aimed at examining selected intracomonality transactions carried out between the two states.
Together, a total of 40 cases of commercial transactions carried out between 29 Czech and 32 Slovak tax entities were examined, for which there were doubts about their realisation or suspicion of tax evasion on VAT.
The SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO of the SR found, among other things, the following facts:
the tax authorities have declared in their VAT returns in order to unlawfully obtain excess VAT execution of intracomonant transactions which have not actually been carried out;
tax entities reported intracomonality supplies in carousel transactions in which there was a deliberate multiple reduction in the value of supplies in order to draw on excess VAT deductions;
the suppliers reported in their VAT tax returns and recapitulative statements the intracomonality supply of goods exempt from VAT to purchasers who were so-called "lost companies" and did not declare the tax on the goods acquired;
the suppliers made an intracomonality supply of goods exempt from VAT for tax entities that were not registered for VAT in another Member State.
In such cases, the supply should not have been exempt from VAT and should have been subject to tax in the supplier's country;
suppliers reported intracomonality supplies in their VAT tax returns at a higher value than those declared by the purchasers of the intracomonality acquisition, in some cases the VAT was declared in the wrong amount.
The findings of the inspection showed that the VIES system provides tax administrations with the information necessary to check the correct application of VAT in intracomonality transactions.
In particular, tax administrations should pay extra attention to the rigorous examination of the differences between the data reported by VAT payers and the VIES data and the use of all information in tax procedures.
The issue of value added tax after the entry of the Czech Republic and Slovakia into the EU
Value added tax
On 1 May 2004, the Czech Republic and Slovakia became members of the EU.
After joining the EU, internal borders and border controls on the movement of goods within EU territory were abolished.
The VAT administrator was the relevant financial or tax office until 30.4.2004, with the exception of the import of goods and occasional bus transport in the Czech Republic, where the tax administrator was the customs office.
In connection with the adoption of the new Act No 235/2004 Coll., on Value Added Tax (hereinafter referred to as "Law No. 235/2004 Coll.), or Act No. 222/2004 Z. z., on Pridanej Value Tax (hereinafter referred to as "Law No 222/2004 Z. z."), the VAT administration switched the acquisition of goods and services (formerly imports) from other EU Member States from customs offices to financial or tax offices.
The delivery of goods in the Czech Republic under the provisions of Section 13 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. means the transfer of the right to dispose of the goods as owner.
The delivery of goods from the Czech Republic to another EU Member State is the delivery of goods that have actually been shipped or transported to another EU Member State.
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 64 of Act No 235/2004 Coll., it is an exempt taxable transaction with a right to deduct VAT if the goods are supplied to a person registered for VAT in another EU Member State.
The supply of goods in the Slovak Republic under the provisions of Section 8 of Law No 222/2004 Z. z. is considered to be the supply of tangible property in which ownership rights are changed.
The transfer of goods belonging to a taxable person from the country to another Member State shall also be considered a supply of goods if those goods are dispatched or transported by that person or on his behalf to another Member State for the purposes of his business.
Under Paragraph 43 of Law No 222/2004 Z. z., the supply of goods from the country to another Member State is exempt from VAT if the person acquiring the person identified for VAT in another Member State is the person identified for VAT.
The acquisition of goods from another EU Member State in the Czech Republic under the provisions of Section 16 of Act No 235/2004 Coll. means the acquisition of the right to dispose as owner of the goods which are sent or transported by a person registered for VAT in another EU Member State.
The Czech payer buys goods at a price without VAT and his obligation is to declare VAT in the Czech Republic under the provisions of Section 25 of Act No 235/2004 Coll., subject to the fulfilment of the conditions set out in Section 73 of this Act, he is entitled to deduct VAT.
By acquiring goods domestically from another EU Member State, in the Slovak Republic, pursuant to the provisions of Section 11 of Law No 222/2004 Z. z., the acquisition of the right to dispose as owner of movable tangible property dispatched or transported by the purchaser by the supplier or the acquirer or on their behalf to the country from another Member State.
The tax liability in the SR arises to the payer when acquiring goods in the Czech Republic from another Member State under the provisions of Section 20 of Law No 222/2004 Z.z.
The payer may deduct VAT under the provisions of Section 49 of Law No 222/2004 Z. if the tax is applied by it when acquiring goods in the national territory from another Member State pursuant to the provisions of Sections 11 and 11a of this Act.
Trilateral trade means, according to the provisions of Section 17 of Act No 235/2004 Coll., or Section 45 of Act No 222/2004 Z. trade concluded between three persons registered for VAT in three different EU Member States, where the subject of trade is the supply of the same goods between the three persons.
Intracomonarial transactions means the supply and acquisition of goods made between VAT payers from different EU Member States.
The total volumes of intracomonality transactions carried out between the Czech Republic and Slovakia are shown in the following table.
VIES
In order to check the application of the VAT exemption entitlement to intracommunity supplies of goods, a VAT information exchange system has been established within the EU.
It includes the VIES electronic system, which allows tax administrations of EU Member States to check whether the supplier was entitled to exempt taxable transactions from VAT and vice versa whether the acquirer duly admitted and taxed the acquired goods.
The VIES information system is not centralised within the EU.
Each Member State shall develop its own VIES system.
National systems work on a common principle and are interconnected through the EU's common communication network, the so-called CCN (Common Communication Network; see diagram below).
In the Czech Republic, the VIES system was linked to an automated tax information system (ADIS), in the Slovak Republic, with the application software of the tax information system (hereinafter referred to as "APV DIS").
These systems use financial or tax authorities as technical support for executive and management activities in tax and fee management.
International administrative cooperation
Through international administrative cooperation, the tax administration of each EU member country receives information on tax entities that it would not have been able to obtain on its own without such cooperation.
The main objective of international administrative cooperation is to combat tax evasion and tax losses.
Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, each Member State, within the internal organisational structure, provides for a central unit in the field of administrative cooperation between EU Member States in the administration of VAT, the so-called CLO (CLO (Central Liaison Office).
In the Czech Republic, the Ministry of Finance – the Central Financial and Tax Directorate, where the International Cooperation in the VAT Administration (MF CLO) was established.
The CLO function in the Slovak Republic is performed by the Slovak Tax Directorate, the International Administrative Cooperation Unit (DR CLO).
These departments inter alia communicate with EU foreign administrations, in particular in the area of exchange of information under the VIES system, the exchange of spontaneous information and information at the request of EU tax administrations, the coordination of multilateral (simultaneous) tax controls, the verification of tax identification numbers (hereinafter referred to as the VAT Code) of persons registered for VAT in other EU Member States and communicate with the European Commission.
In order to examine a certain intracomonality transaction or to obtain other information relating to a particular tax entity, the financial or tax authorities shall send requests for information to the EU via the IF CLO or DR CLO to the EU.
Through these applications, they obtain from the requested Member States information which they can use to correctly determine VAT.
Requests for information are mostly sent between the CLO of EU Member States in electronic form, using the standardised SCAC form.
Selected control findings when verifying commercial transactions
The cooperation of the SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic was aimed primarily at examining selected intracomonality transactions carried out between the two states and on the level of use of information obtained in the form of international cooperation obtained in the form of international cooperation by financial or tax authorities.
The SAO, the Czech Republic requested the SAO of the SR to examine in 30 cases the commercial transactions carried out between 19 Czech and 25 Slovak tax entities.
The SAO SR requested the SAO, the Czech Republic to examine in 10 cases commercial transactions carried out between 7 Slovak and 10 Czech tax entities.
Examination of intracomonial transactions was found, among other things:
o
The SAO, the Czech Republic has asked the SAO of the SR to examine the procedure of the tax administrator, to whom a response to the request for information was sent.
The Slovak Tax Office applied via the SCAC form to examine the delivery of goods (footwear) in the 3rd quarter of 2004 from a Slovak payer worth 2 847 thousand Sk.
The Financial Office in the Czech Republic replied that the Czech payer had stated the acquisition of goods of this value only in an additional VAT return and had delivered the same goods back to Slovak tax entities worth CZK 2,550,000 by the end of 2004.
Based on the international cooperation of the SAO, the Czech Republic and the SAO SR, it was found that the locally competent tax authority recognized the Slovak contractor in full the right to excess VAT deduction incurred, among other things, on the basis of this supply.
This tax office did not provide information on suspicion of reexport to tax authorities locally competent customers of goods imported back from the Czech payer.
These will trigger further screening of trading activities in relation to possible carousel fraud.
o
The Czech tax administrator applied through the SCAC form to examine the delivery of the technological line to SR worth CZK 4,850 thousand in the 2nd quarter of 2004.
The tax procedure carried out in the SR showed that only part of the technological line was delivered, components worth CZK 3,395,000 were not delivered.
When examining this case, the SAO of the SR found that VAT on the taxable transaction carried out was granted by the Slovak tax entity on the amount of CZK 4,850,000 in the VAT return (hereinafter referred to as "DAP") for the tax period 7/2004.
The SAO, the Czech Republic further found that the Czech payer reported an excessive VAT deduction of CZK 655,000 for that quarter in his DAP, which was created by applying a VAT deduction on the purchase of this technological line from another domestic payer.
Based on the results of the investigation, the Czech Tax Office concluded that the Czech and Slovak tax entities had created a commercial relationship in order to improperly obtain an excess VAT deduction, questioned the execution of the taxable supply and did not recognise the Czech payer part of the right to deduct CZK 647,000.
o
The Slovak tax administrator applied in 2004 via the SCAC form to examine the supply of goods (copiering machines) to a Czech payer worth 24 246 thousand Sk made in December 2002.
The Slovak payer purchased these goods in November 2002 in SR from another tax entity worth 29 667 thousand. Sk and subsequently sold it to the Czech payer.
The Slovak tax entity applied an excess VAT deduction for the relevant tax year.
In a tax investigation carried out in the Czech Republic, it was found that the Czech tax entity did not cooperate with the tax administrator and did not file DAP for the 4th quarter of 2002 or for the period following.
The SAO of the SR found that the Slovak tax administrator, on the basis of the result of the tax audit, did not recognise the right to an excess deduction of 5 541 thousand. Sk applied in DAP for the month 11/2002 and set the tax liability in the amount of 1 750 thousand Sk.
At the same time, that taxpayer was not granted an exemption from VAT on the export of goods in December 2002.
o
The Czech tax administrator received an order from MF CLO to verify the value of the acquired goods for the 3rd quarter of 2004.
According to VIES data, the Czech payer was to acquire goods (director) from SR worth 3 767 thousand Sk.
This tax entity did not cooperate with the tax administrator, DAP did not serve and VAT for the months 7 to 12/2004 was assessed ex officio in the amount of CZK 0.
The Czech tax administrator asked, via the SCAC form, to check whether deliveries of goods from Slovakia to the Czech Republic were made, in what quantity and price (according to invoices).
In reply, the Slovak local tax authority sent a copy of the invoice, bills and a notice to pay the invoice.
The SAO of the SR found that the Slovak payer was granted an exemption with a VAT deduction claim for this supply.
The SAO, the Czech Republic found that the Czech tax administrator assessed the response to the request for information received from the SR as evidence proving that the company had acquired goods from another EU Member State.
On the basis of further investigation, the Financial Conduct Authority in the Czech Republic will request a review of the tax liability.
o
The Slovak company supplied goods (wooden products) including to an American company that stored these goods in the Czech Republic in a free zone.
The operator of that free zone was listed on the invoices as the recipient of the goods.
In 2004, for example, an American company purchased chipboard cladding worth USD 57,600 from a Slovak payer (at a unit price of USD 100/piece) which it placed in a free zone.
Subsequently, the company transferred the property rights to the Swiss company, worth USD 14,400 (unit price USD 25/piece) and the goods were exported back to the Slovak Republic.
The goods were not unloaded in the Czech Republic, but left the free zone area on the same means of transport.
The Slovak tax administrator initiated tax inspections of individual tax years 2004 and 2005 from the supplier of goods on suspicion of carousel transactions.
Examination of the transactions carried out was requested by the Czech locally competent tax authorities through several forms of SCAC.
Individual answers gradually created a picture of the shops and confirmed the involvement of stakeholders from Slovakia and the Czech Republic in carousel shops.
The SAO, the Czech Republic, in cooperation with the SAO SR, found that there was deliberately a gradual reduction of the value of goods in these trade relations.
On the basis of the information obtained, the SR Tax Directorate concluded that in this case the carousel trade is free pricing (i.e. the import of undervalued goods and its overvaluation by domestic companies located in the chain between the importer and the exporter), which is not a breach of the VAT Act in the SR.
In the current legislation, the payment of excess VAT to export companies cannot be prevented as they meet all the conditions of the VAT exemption law.
o
The Czech payer's VAT registration had been revoked on 12 July 2005.
On 27.10.2005, that body became a taxpayer again on the basis of a voluntary VAT registration application.
The Czech tax entity entered into DAP for the month 8/2005 (i.e. the period when it was not the VAT payer) the value of the purchase of goods (a polygraphic printing machine) from the Slovak Republic in the amount of CZK 1,174,000 and claimed the right to deduct VAT.
This value corresponded to the supply of goods from the Slovak payer in the amount of 1 530 thousand Sk, which the Slovak payer listed in DAP as a supply of goods to another EU Member State entitled to deduct VAT.
The Slovak tax administrator asked to verify the mentioned delivery using the SCAC form because the Slovak supplier did not prove how he acquired the goods delivered to the Czech Republic.
The SAO, the Czech Republic found that the Czech taxpayer does not cooperate with the tax administrator and does not reside at the address listed in the Commercial Register.
As part of the international exchange of information, a local investigation will be carried out in the Czech Republic by the locally competent tax administrator for the purpose of examining the data.
o
The Slovak payer entered the summary report for the 3rd quarter of 2004 a supply of goods worth 956 thousand. Sk to a tax entity from the Czech Republic.
The VAT number of the Czech entity was identified by the VIES system as erroneous.
By verification in the payer database, it was found that such a DIČ was never assigned in the Czech Republic.
According to invoices issued by the Slovak payer, it was a performance of electrical works on real estate in the Czech Republic, it was not a delivery of goods from Slovakia to the Czech Republic, but a service provision.
The services were invoiced without VAT, as the Czech entity told the Slovak entity that it was registered as a VAT payer in the Czech Republic.
The Slovak tax administrator asked to verify these facts by means of the SCAC form.
The SAO, the Czech Republic, by asking the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic, found that the tax entity listed on invoices as a customer was never registered as a VAT payer in the Czech Republic, did not acknowledge the tax on the services received from the Slovak entity and did not acknowledge the tax on the acquisition of the goods.
Local investigations and tax inspections have not been carried out with the Czech entity, his current stay is unknown.
On the basis of an international exchange of information, the Czech tax administrator learned that the Czech tax entity had become the adoption of the service as a VAT payer by law.
The Slovak tax entity will be subject to a tax audit for the 1st to 4th quarter of 2004.
o
The Slovak payer entered the summary report for the 3rd quarter of 2004 delivery of goods worth 1 055 thousand. Sk to the Czech payer.
According to invoices issued by the Slovak payer, it was a performance of electrical works on real estate in the Czech Republic.
It was not about delivering goods from Slovakia to the Czech Republic, but about providing services.
The Slovak tax administrator asked to verify these facts by means of the SCAC form.
The SAO, the Czech Republic, asked by the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic, found that the Czech entity was a VAT payer at the time of the supply and a local investigation was carried out with it in order to examine the acquisition of goods from other EU Member States in the 3rd quarter of 2004.
On the basis of this local investigation, it was found that it was indeed not the acquisition of goods in the present case, but the acquisition of services, which was also reported by the Czech entity in a regular DAP.
The tax office further found that the Czech entity, as a result of a poor procedure in calculating VAT, did not pay VAT at the correct amount for the 3rd quarter of 2004 tax year.
The taxpayer shall submit an additional DAP.
Asked by the locally competent tax authority, the SAO of the SR found that the Slovak payer had misstated the provision of the service in the recapitarian report and would be subject to a tax audit for the 1st to 4th quarter of 2004.
o
The Czech taxpayer voluntarily registered as a VAT payer from 10 March 2004.
For the first quarter of 2004, DAP submitted with a high turnover on both entry and exit.
The tax administrator of the locally competent tax administrator initiated the tax proceedings, the entity did not cooperate with the tax administrator, so due to the suspicion of involvement in the carousel trade, he was assessed in VAT amounting to CZK 0.
Another DAP has not filed this payer.
Due to the failure to comply with his obligations under the law, his VAT registration was revoked on 4 January 2005.
According to data from the VIES system, the entity was to acquire goods worth 7,846,000 from the Slovak payer in the 3rd and 4th quarters of 2004.
In order to examine the execution of these deals, the Czech tax administrator sent two requests for information to SR.
When asked by the locally competent tax authority, the SAO of the SR found that the manager of the Czech company in the witness statement denied carrying out the transactions examined and questioned the authenticity of his signature on invoices and other documents.
On the basis of the tax procedure carried out in the Slovak Republic, the intracomonality delivery to the Czech Republic declared by the Slovak payer was questioned.
The payer will not be entitled to an exemption from VAT and will be charged with VAT on the amount mentioned above.
o
According to data from the VIES system, the Czech payer was to acquire goods (workwear) from SR in the first quarter of 2005 with a total value of 39,970,000 Sk.
The Czech payer reported the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State in this quarter only in DAP for the month 3/2005, worth CZK 11,292,000.
The locally competent tax authority carried out a local investigation with the entity to examine the data in this DAP.
As the company did not produce any documents, nor otherwise substantiated the execution of taxable transactions, on 9 June 2005 the tax administrator assessed the VAT in the amount of CZK 0.
Due to doubts about the acquisition of the goods, the tax authority sent two requests for information to the SR in May 2005.
According to the reply to requests for information, the tax administrator in SR had doubts about the execution of business cases as well as the implementation of the payment.
The SAO of the SR was informed that the Slovak tax administrator had sent DR CLO an initiative to carry out simultaneous checks with the tax administration of the Czech Republic, which would be carried out with the participating entities.
At the time of the coordinated control, the locally competent tax administrator carried out further investigations concerning the Czech entity in the Czech Republic and at the same time an investigation by the Police of the Czech Republic was ongoing.
o
The following 2 cases concern companies suspected of being involved in carousel fraud.
Transactions in goods (working clothing) were made between the Czech Republic and Slovakia in the 4th quarter of 2004 and 1st quarter 2005.
Slovak payer No.1 supplied goods to Czech payer No. 2.
In the Czech Republic, the goods were then sold to payer No. 3, who delivered it back to SR to payer No. 4 (see diagram No. 2).
A)
Czech payer No. 2 was to purchase goods (workwear) worth CZK 4,847,000 from Slovak payer No 1 in the 4th quarter of 2004 and goods worth CZK 17,050,000 in the first quarter of 2005.
As the acquisition declared by the Czech payer in the DAP did not correspond to the data in the VIES system, the locally competent tax administrator sent a request for information to the SR on 25 May 2005.
In response, the Slovak tax administrator expressed doubts about the execution of business cases as well as the implementation of the payment.
On 8 June 2005, a request for information was received at MF CLO from SR concerning goods worth 16 575 thousand. Sk, which was to be delivered in December 2004 by Slovak payer No. 1 to Czech payer No. 2.
The Slovak side demanded to check whether Czech payer No 2 had actually accepted the goods, admitted it in DAP and paid VAT.
An official record drawn up by the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic shows that Czech payer No 2 has not been stationed at an address registered in the Commercial Register for a long time.
Although they were VAT payers with a monthly tax period, they served the DAP for a quarterly tax year.
In view of this fact, the Czech tax administrator could not assess VAT.
The realisation of the taxable supply between Slovak payer No 1 and Czech payer No 2 mentioned in the application in the amount of 16 575 thousand. Sk could not be verified due to the above facts.
The Czech tax administrator suspected the involvement of both entities in the carousel trade in order to draw an excess VAT deduction.
B)
Czech payer No 3, engaged in the purchase and sale of passenger cars, filed a DAP for the tax period of the months 1 and 2/2005 in which he reported delivery of goods (workwear) to the Slovak payer No 4 with a total value of CZK 21,935,000.
These working clothes were to be purchased by Czech payer No 3 from Czech payer No 2 between December 2004 and January 2005.
The locally competent tax authority sent a request for information to the SR, which was mainly to verify whether Slovak payer No 4 had purchased goods worth CZK 1,025,000 from Czech payer No 3 in December 2004 and CZK 21,935,000 in the first quarter of 2005.
The reply to this request for information received from the SR showed that in DAP for month 12/2004 Slovak payer No 4 stated the zero value of the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State and in DAP for months 1 and 2/2005 stated the value of the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State in the amount of only 1 193 thousand Sk.
The invitation to submit tax documents for the tax period of the months 10/2004 to 3/2005 did not respond to Slovak payer No 4.
In the local investigation carried out in SR, it was found that the company was not at the address mentioned in the Commercial Register.
The reply further stated that this payer fulfils all the characteristics of the so-called "lost society" and therefore there is a reasonable suspicion of carousel fraud.
The SAO of the SR was informed that the Slovak tax administrator had sent DR CLO an initiative to carry out simultaneous checks with the tax administration of the Czech Republic, which would be carried out by the participating tax entities.
During the coordinated check, the Czech tax administrator collected documents that would confirm or refute the existence of the goods.
VAT will be measured against the outcome of the investigation.
The case is also being handled by the Police of the Czech Republic.
The course of the inspection
As part of the preparation of parallel control actions, a coordination meeting of representatives of the SAO, the Czech Republic with representatives of the SAO, took place in the first half of July 2005.
Participants in this meeting became aware of the VAT legislation in both states and the integration of the VIES electronic system into national databases.
The result of the negotiations was a specification of the scope of cooperation and the setting of conditions for the selection of control samples.
The two parties agreed that the cooperation will focus on the following areas: (a) verification of the validity and correctness of VAT officers registered in the Czech Republic or SR for intracomonality supplies; (b) verification of data on intracomonant acquisitions listed in the DAP by payers in the Czech Republic using information from recapital reports (hereinafter referred to as "SH") of SR payers contained in the VIES system; and vice versa; c) exchange of information between tax administrations in the Czech Republic and in the Slovak Republic on commercial transactions carried out.
It was also agreed that the selection of tax entities for inspection would be carried out following the volume of intracomonality deliveries between the Czech Republic and Slovakia and according to the number of applications for international cooperation sent and received between the Czech Republic and Slovakia via the SCAC form.
5.1 Intracomonative transactions
The process of processing information by the tax administrations of the Czech Republic and Slovakia in intracomonial delivery and acquisition of goods illustrates the following diagram.
5.1.1 Intracomonant delivery
If the VAT payer makes an intracomonality delivery, he is obliged to file SH until the 25th day after the end of the calendar quarter.
The payer in the Czech Republic gives in SH summary information about the supplies of goods made by him to another EU Member State exempt from VAT for the previous calendar quarter.
The Slovak payer is obliged to indicate to SH the value of goods that have been exempt and delivered from the country to other EU Member States for the calendar quarter period.
Data on the value of the delivered goods are always shown in SH in the Czech or Slovak currency, broken down by individual tax entities, indicating their VAT number under which they were registered in their country.
Data on services are not included in SH.
If a payer in the Czech Republic finds that he has given erroneous data in SH, he is obliged to submit subsequent SH.
In the event that the payer in the SR finds that the data referred to in SH were incomplete or incorrect, he shall lodge a corrective SH before the expiry of the deadline for the submission of SH, after that period he is required to submit an additional SH.
VIES allows the exchange of information on VAT registered users' registration data in EU Member States.
Payers from the Czech Republic or Slovakia can check whether the VAT number of the relevant acquirer is registered in a given EU Member State.
Data from the submitted SH are grouped on MF CLO or DR CLO by the VIES system according to the individual VAT number of the purchasers.
The aggregate value of all deliveries for each DIČ of the acquirer and the code of the method of performance from all its Czech or Slovak suppliers, the so-called L1QD files, will be created.
Data from the L1QD files shall be sent to the relevant EU Member States no later than three months after the end of the quarter to which the data relate.
The total value of intracomonality transactions between the Czech Republic and Slovakia (from L1QD files) is given in the following table.
If the VIES system in another Member State detects the erroneous TIN of the maker in the L1QD files sent, it generates the so-called O_MCTL message, which contains all the faulty VAT number indicating the type of error.
This message is then sent to MF CLO, respectively DR CLO.
The O_MCTL report may contain 4 types of errors: formally erroneous VAT number, VAT number is not registered in that state or has never been allocated, the customer with a particular VAT number was not a VAT payer in the given quarter, the VAT registration of the customer was terminated during the quarter.
In the Czech Republic, MF CLO transmits data from received O_MCTL reports to the tax authorities.
If the wrong EU payer's VAT number is used in one of the SH or subsequent SHs sent lines, the so-called "Notice on the VAT ID" is generated at the relevant tax office by ADIS.
The tax office will examine whether the delivery to the VAT registered payer in another EU Member State has actually taken place and will record the result of the verification in the system.
In the SR, DR CLO will process all O_MCTL messages in VIES and electronically send them to the locally competent tax authorities together with the identification of tax payers who have reported the wrong VAT number in their SHs.
Tax authorities subsequently call on the payer to file an additional SH and give a valid VAT number, or the tax office, when reporting an invalid VAT number in the filed SH, will examine the delivery of the goods at the relevant payer.
Data on the number of erroneous DIČs relating to intracomonality transactions carried out between the Czech Republic and Slovakia are given in the following table.
Of the total number of 41,728 VAT number of Czech payers, listed in SH Slovak payers between the 2nd quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, 929 were erroneous DIČs, i.e. 2.23%.
Of the total number of 62 997 VAT number of Slovak payers listed in SH Czech payers in the same period, 416 were erroneous DIČ, i.e. 0.66%.
When reporting intracomonality transactions carried out between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, Czech VAT payers reported on average fewer erroneous VAT numbers in their SH than Slovak payers.
When examining the activities of financial or tax authorities, it was found that the VIES system did not provide up-to-date information on the validity of VAT registrations of tax entities in all cases.
E.g.:
- Although, when asked by the tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the VIES system confirmed the validity of the registration of the tax entity in Q4 2004, the O_MCTL report was subsequently generated due to the termination of the registration of the payer in this quarter.
The investigation revealed that the end of the marketing authorisation did not take place until 1 January 2005;
- The SAO of the SR further found that 6 tax entities were submitted by SH, which reported the wrong VAT number, but the O_MCTL reports did not contain this VAT number.
In the SR, the submitted SHs shall be transferred to the tax authorities in electronic form and the data from them shall be sent to DR CLO.
Following the subsequent processing of these data in the VIES system, DR CLO will send to the relevant tax authorities so-called breakdowns of errors in SH submitted by tax entities for the relevant quarter.
The SAO of the SR compared data on the occurrence of erroneous data in SH as of 26 July 2005 (i.e. data processed before the start of the inspection procedure) and to 2.2.2006 (i.e. data processed after the end of the inspection procedure).
The data comparison is provided in the following table.
From the above data it can be seen that the audit of the SAO of the SR had an impact not only on the reduction of the number of SHs with the wrong VAT number (average by 199 SH per quarter), but also on the reduction of the number of unrepaired errors in SH (on average by 431 errors per quarter).
In the Czech Republic, the value of intracomonant supplies listed by the payer in the respective DAP lines is compared at the tax authorities with the intracomonality delivery value given by this payer in the quarterly SH.
ADIS automatically indicates the differences between these values.
The tax administrator should examine the differences, remove any ambiguities and use the data obtained to determine the tax liability.
The SAO, the Czech Republic found that the audited tax authorities did not verify these differences in 27 cases.
The overall difference between the values shown in SH and DAP was CZK 537,231,000 in these cases.
Since the 3rd quarter of 2004, the ADIS system allowed the tax administrator in the Czech Republic to consider the difference between the values shown in SH and DAP of up to 0.5% of the total value of intracomonarian supplies according to SH as a match and set it in the ADIS system.
For payers with a large volume of intracomonality deliveries for one quarter, 0.5% of the value represents a not insignificant amount, therefore tax administrations should not set the compliance of SH and DAP in these cases without clarifying the causes of the differences.
For example, the tax administrator without verification set the match in case of a difference of values in the amount of CZK 1,561,000.
The examination of differences in the Czech Republic and Slovakia was complicated by the fact that SH was administered by payers within 25 days after the end of this quarter for each calendar quarter.
For taxpayers with a monthly tax period at the time of DAP's submission for the first two months of the calendar quarter, tax administrators could not compare the intracomonal delivery values given in these DAPs with those according to the SH.
In these cases, the tax administrators only became aware of any mismatch of the data in the DAP and SH when the tax liability or excess VAT deduction was assessed or refunded.
5.1.2 Intracomonity acquisition
The VIES system provides, inter alia, information on the values of intracomonality transactions carried out within EU Member States.
Acquisition of goods in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, data delivered from SHs delivered by payers from other EU Member States (delivered L1QD) are processed by MF CLO.
During processing, the data are recalculated by the Czech National Bank's minimum and maximum daily exchange rates for the relevant period and are then compared to the acquisition value given by Czech payers in DAP for the relevant quarter.
The value of the acquisition of goods recognised by the payer in DAP should be within the minimum and maximum recalculated value of L1QD (L1min and L1max values).
If the value shown in the DAP is less than L1min, the so-called verification order is generated for the payer with the most significant irregularities.
Orders to verify the acquisition of goods are a warning to problematic tax entities and are transmitted to the locally competent tax authorities, which must investigate the data transmitted.
The number of authentication orders relating to the audited tax authorities in the Czech Republic is given in the following table.
The SAO, the Czech Republic found that the audited tax authorities in 33 cases did not examine irregularities in the values of intracomonality acquisitions to which the audited orders were pointed out.
The overall difference between the values shown in SH payers from other EU Member States and DAP of Czech payers was at least CZK 148,319,000 in these cases.
The SAO, the Czech Republic has selected 533 files of tax entities for inspection, for which the audited tax authorities received a verification order from the I.F. CLO.
The inspection identified the following most common causes of differences between the values given in the DAP of the acquirer and in SH of the supplier: on the side of the acquirer (Czech payer) in 263 cases the acquirer did not indicate the acquisition of goods in regular DAP, in 93 cases the payer admitted the acquisition of goods in a different tax year than in which he was liable to declare the tax, in 6 cases the acquirer stated the value of the acquired goods in the incorrect line of DAP, on the part of the supplier (the EU payer) in 88 cases the payers from the EU in their SHI included the values of the services provided to the Czech payer, of which in 54 cases were the supplier from the SBCs, in 88 cases of the supplier in the Czech Republic, the supplier from the Czech Republic included the values of the services provided to the Czech payer in the Czech Republic, of which in 54 cases were the payers from the SR, included the supply of the goods in the SBCs in 88 cases of the supplier
On the side of the payers from the SR, the value of the services provided in SH was most often incorrectly included.
54 such cases were found at the audited tax offices.
For example, when investigating the verification order, it was found that the difference in the value of CZK 10,974,000 arose from the Slovak payer introducing the provision of services to SH for the first quarter of 2005 (construction work and delivery of goods, including assembly on the territory of the Czech Republic).
Another reason for the differences was the inclusion of the values of accepted advances into SH, e.g. 2 Slovak payers gave in SH the advances received from Czech payers, resulting in a command to verify the difference of CZK 3,580,000.
Orders to verify goods acquired are generated only once in one quarter.
In cases where data from SHs are subsequently changed in EU Member States, such as a change in the customer of goods in the Czech Republic or the increased value of deliveries of goods to the Czech Republic, new authentication orders are not generated.
As the VIES does not automatically draw attention to these changes, the locally competent tax authorities need not know the purchaser of the goods without any other complaint about the facts relevant for the correct determination of the tax liability on the goods acquired and there is a strong likelihood of VAT evasion.
An audit of the SAO, the Czech Republic found that this situation occurred e.g. in the following cases:
The Slovak payer gave the value of the supply of goods to the Czech payer in SH for the 2nd quarter of 2004 in the amount of 1 504 thousand Sk.
On 1 February 2005, the tax office sent a request for information to the locally competent Czech payer to the SR, as the Czech payer admitted the acquisition of the goods only in the amount of CZK 425,000.
On the basis of the tax proceedings, the Slovak payer filed an additional SH on 1 January 2005, correcting the data on the supply of goods to the Czech Republic by reducing the value of the supply for the originally listed Czech payer to 538 thousand. Sk and increasing the value of the delivered goods for another Czech payer from the sum of 194 thousand Sk.
Four Slovak payers reported intracomonarian delivery to payers from the Czech Republic totalling 10,24 thousand Sk (i.e. CZK 8,183,000) in their SH for the second quarter of 2004.
However, Czech buyers did not report intracomonarian acquisition in DAP.
Based on the international exchange of information, it was found that the goods were delivered in all cases to another Czech payer, which was not mentioned in SH submitted by Slovak payers.
During the first quarter of 2005, Slovak payers in additional SHs related to the 2nd quarter of 2004 increased the value of intracomonant delivery for this Czech payer by a total of 10,24 thousand Sk.
In view of the above, the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic could not have doubts about the accuracy of the data in the submitted DAP for the second quarter of 2004, even though the actual acquirer did not comply with the obligation to grant an intracomonality acquisition for this quarter.
The SAO, the Czech Republic found that, on the basis of the international exchange of information between tax administrations, the aforementioned Czech taxpayer was additionally charged VAT for the tax period 5 and 6/2004 in the amount of CZK 3,640 thousand and for the 3rd quarter of 2004 in the amount of CZK 3,305,000 from the goods acquired in these periods.
From the above, it can be seen that tax authorities had to examine in tax proceedings not only the differences caused by errors in the DAP of the purchaser, but also the differences caused by the different reporting of intracomonality and acquisition data in individual EU Member States.
A unification of the conditions for reporting these data would lead to a streamlining of the control activity of tax administrators.
Acquisition of goods in SR
In the SR, APV DIS makes it possible to compare data on the value of goods acquired through the VIES system from other EU Member States with those listed in the DAP of Slovak buyers.
The method by which data is compared is called "Method MIN-MAX".
This method will recalculate the value of deliveries of goods listed in SH payers from other EU Member States with a minimum and maximum exchange rate for the relevant quarter.
There will be an MIN-MAX interval, which is used for comparison with the purchase values of goods listed in the DAP of Slovak payers.
DR CLO will send the tax administrators information on the intracomonality acquisition values set out in the DAP and the values of the delivery from the EU in VIES.
The tax administrator will decide for which VAT registered persons the difference will be examined, taking into account other risk analysis criteria.
On the basis of data provided by DR CLO, the SAO SR selected 57 files of Slovak purchasers of goods for inspection at audited tax offices, of which 25 were also purchased by goods from the Czech Republic, for which the highest differences were found between the values of acquisition obtained from the VIES system and the values declared in DAP.
The SAO audit of the SR SAO confirmed the fact that the tax authorities did not consistently examine the differences obtained using the MIN-MAX method and did not check the accuracy of the data listed in the DAP of Slovak acquirers.
As part of the audit, the SAO SR asked the tax authorities to carry out 47 local investigations with specific tax entities.
During the SAO's audit at tax offices, 31 local investigations were terminated.
For Slovak companies, to which the VIES system showed significant differences in MIN-MAX values when acquiring goods from EU Member States, the following facts were identified, among other things:
In DAP for the fourth quarter of 2004, the Slovak payer did not disclose the value of the acquisition of goods from the EU.
The tax office found that the company from the Czech Republic accidentally listed this payer's VAT number in SH for the 4th quarter of 2004, while it actually delivered the goods worth CZK 19,184,000 to another Slovak payer.
According to the VIES system, the Slovak company was to purchase goods from the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Austria in the 4th quarter of 2004 worth MIN 682 692 thousand. Sk and MAX 715 105 thousand Sk.
This company submitted the DAP for the periods in which it stated the value of the acquisition of goods from the EU only amounting to 480,599 thousand Sk.
The tax administrator conducted a local investigation, finding that the tax entity purchased electricity from the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Austria.
Suppliers to SH and DAP intracomonarian deliveries did not state according to the date of invoice issuance, but according to the date of delivery.
In view of other irregularities in the acquisition of goods from these EU states, the tax administrator will request an examination of the value of the delivered goods through the SCAC forms.
The acquisition of goods from EU member states in the 4th quarter of 2004 did not mention the Slovak payer in DAP.
According to the VIES system, this payer was to purchase goods worth MIN 11,286 thousand Sk and MAX 11 845 thousand Sk.
The tax office carried out a local investigation, the inspection showed that the tax entity did not acquire any goods from EU member states in the 4th quarter of 2004.
The SAO SR recommended that the tax authority request to examine the delivery of goods from EU Member States via the SCAC form.
The VIES system reported delivery of goods to a Slovak customer worth MIN 557 thousand. Sk and MAX 565 thousand Sk.
In the DAP for the tax year 10 to 12/2004, the payer did not show any acquisition of the goods.
A local investigation by the tax administrator found that the tax entity received an invoice from a supplier from the Czech Republic on 10 December 2004 for the material consumed in repairing the hydraulic loader.
The SAO SR recommended carrying out a tax audit on the payer.
During the audit of the SAO SR in 16 cases, the tax authorities did not terminate the local investigation.
In 10 cases, the SAO SR asked the tax administrator to carry out a tax audit on tax entities.
Reports on the results of local investigations and tax inspections will be filed by the tax authorities after they have been carried out by the SAO SR.
These were, for example, the following cases:
The Slovak acquirer did not declare in DAP for the fourth quarter of 2004 the acquisition of goods from EU Member States and did not grant any tax for the tax period of the months 10 to 12/2004 and claimed a refund of the excess VAT deduction in the total amount of 1 236 thousand Sk.
The tax administrator carried out a local investigation, which showed that the tax entity had purchased goods worth 683 thousand euro (approx. 27,080 thousand Sk) from the Czech Republic.
These goods were transported from the Czech Republic by a Czech supplier to customs in Čiernej nad Tisou, from where the transport continued to the Russian Federation.
The Slovak customer payer in the Russian Federation issued an invoice for the amount of EUR 683 thousand, which he did not mention in the filed DAP.
For the tax entity, the tax administrator carries out a tax inspection.
The difference between the acquisition data reported in the Slovak payer's DAP for the 3rd quarter of 2004 to Q1 2005 and the delivery data reported by EU Member States in each quarter was a total of 4,800 thousand Sk.
The tax office found that the tax entity purchased goods from suppliers from the Czech Republic and Belgium and subsequently sold these goods to Ukraine.
The invoices were accompanied by the export uniform customs declarations.
The acquisition of goods in the DAP was not reported by the tax entity, according to the company's manager, the goods under the transit procedure were transported directly from the Czech Republic to Ukraine.
The taxpayer did not submit any VAT records in respect of the local investigation.
Tax control was initiated at the payer.
5.2 International exchange of L3 Level Information
The exchange of information at L3 level is initiated by the locally competent tax authorities, who send their requests for information (hereinafter referred to as the SPI) or spontaneous information (SPI) relating to a particular tax entity or transaction, by means of MF CLO or.
DR CLO to another EU member country. The aim of the ŽOI is, for example, to prove the execution of a given transaction within intracomonality transactions, verification of a particular VAT number, etc.
In the case of the SPI, it is a communication of information relevant to tax administrations in another EU Member State.
Cooperation in the field of information exchange is governed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
The maximum time limit for replying to the ROI was set in Article 8 of this Regulation for 3 months.
The conditions for admissibility of applications are governed by the Decision of the Commission of the European Communities of 15.11.2004, which provides that, unless the participating States agree otherwise, the RHI must relate to commercial transactions worth at least EUR 1 500 excluding VAT.
Where the ROI relates to a commercial transaction of less than EUR 15 000 excluding VAT, the requested authority may refuse to respond in view of its workload.
The procedure for processing received ŽOI by the tax administration of the Czech Republic, including the indication of internal time limits set for processing at individual organizational levels, illustrates the following diagram.
In the SR, the deadline for the processing of ŽOI by the tax authorities was set internally for 2 months so that the three-month period under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 could be met.
MF CLO received a total of 29 ŽOI and 3 SPI from SR from 1 May 2004 to 30 June 2005.
Of the 29 ŽOI received, 26 (i.e. 89.7%) were processed within the time limit of 3 months and 3 (i.e. 10.3%) were dealt with after that period.
In the same period, DR CLO from the Czech Republic received a total of 71 ŽOI and 7 SPI.
Of the 71 ŽOI received, 64 (i.e. 90.1%) were processed within the deadline of 3 months, 5 (i.e. 7.0%) were dealt with after that period (for the other 2 cases, it was not possible to determine the processing time from the submitted materials).
More detailed data on the time of processing of ŽOI received MF CLO or DR CLO contains the following chart.
The reasons for sending the ŽOI, given on the SCAC forms, are provided in the following table.
Conclusion
On the basis of international cooperation, compliance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT has been examined, as well as the use of the VIES system to exchange information between EU Member States, in particular when checking the application of the right to VAT exemption.
International cooperation made it possible to examine selected intracomonality transactions carried out between VAT payers from the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
By examining the selected transactions, it was found that, on the basis of an international exchange of information, the tax administrations of both countries revealed cases of companies that carried out fictitious intracomonal commercial transactions to obtain excess VAT deductions, as well as cases where the purchasers did not declare VAT on the received supplies of goods at the correct amount.
Furthermore, the checks identified differences in the processing and use of VIES data by the tax administrations of both countries.
The audit also highlighted the problems caused by different reporting of data on intracomonality deliveries and purchases of goods in individual EU Member States.
A unification of the conditions for reporting these data within the EU would lead to streamlining the control activity of national tax administrations.
By examining the procedure of the financial or tax authorities in the administration of VAT and the use of the VIES system, it was found that the financial or tax authorities did not sufficiently use all the possibilities of the VIES system and the relevant legal permissions.
Furthermore, it was found that the VIES did not provide up-to-date information on the supply of goods and the validity of the VAT registration of tax entities in all cases.
The SAO SR compared data on the occurrence of erroneous data in SH, processed before the start of the inspection performance, with data processed after the completion of the inspection performance.
It was clear from the comparison of these data that the audit of the SAO of the SR had an impact not only on the reduction of the number of SHs with the erroneous VAT number, but also on the reduction of the number of unrepaired errors in SH.
In the case of irregularities in the reported data of the SAO SR, it asked the tax authorities to carry out local investigations or to carry out tax inspections.
The SAO, the Czech Republic did not have such an option under the current legislation in the Czech Republic.
The findings of the control actions obtained showed that the VIES system provided tax administrations with the basic information necessary to check the correct application of VAT in intracomonality transactions.
As there continues to be scope for tax evasion in this area, there is a need for increased attention to intracomonality transactions in the VAT administration.
Communications
This report was prepared in the Czech, English and Slovak languages and signed by the President of the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the chairman of Najýššie's control department of the Slovak Republic.
Parallel control of the administration of value added tax and excise duty between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic
Introductory word
This information material gives an overview of the progress and results of parallel control actions carried out by the Supreme Audit Office and the Najk control úradom of the Slovak Republic, which were focused on the management of value added and excise duties.
Cooperation between the highest control authorities of both countries was implemented on the basis of a cooperation agreement in control activities concluded in February 2004.
The subject of parallel control actions has been selected in view of the fact that indirect taxes account for a significant contribution to the revenues of the two countries' state budgets.
The design of value added tax, allowing the refund of excess deduction, provides scope for tax fraud or evasion.
High excise duty rates, especially for tobacco and tobacco products, alcohol and mineral oils, mean high profits for those who escape taxation by illegally selling these goods.
Tax fraud is a problem not only in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, but also in other European Union countries.
Due to the need to address this issue comprehensively across the European Union, the highest control institutions of the European Union Member States have been set up by the VAT Working Group, in whose activities the highest control offices of both countries are actively involved.
The greatest benefit of the control actions carried out can be seen not only in the exchange of experience, but in particular in a joint effort to identify problem areas of indirect tax administration in order to limit the scope for tax evasion.
The experience gained and knowledge will be used in the framework of planned indirect tax inspections, mainly aimed at involving both Member States' tax administrations in the VIES system, to control the movement of goods between the Member States of the European Union.
Report on the results of the control of the management of value added tax and excise duties for the period 2002 and 2003
1. Introduction
Control number: (CZ) 04/07 (SK) 18/2004
Subject-matter of the inspection:
(CZ) Value added tax and excise duty
(SK) Control of the procedure of the tax administrator in the administration, control and recovery of value added tax and excise duty
On 11.2.2004 the Cooperation Agreement was concluded in control activities between the Supreme Audit Office (hereinafter referred to as the SAO) and the Najvyšší audit úradom of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as the "SAO of the Slovak Republic"). The subject of the contract was cooperation in the implemented parallel control actions "Value added tax and excise duty tax", included in the auditing plan of the SAO for 2004 under No 04/07 and "Control of the procedure of the administration dane pri správe, control and recovery of dane from the pridé value and spotreb taxes", included in the control activity plan of the SAO SR under No 18/2004.
The cooperation consisted of exchanging information to the extent provided for in the contract and in drawing up a joint final report on the outcome of the checks.
In the contract, the two parties undertook to provide each other with information from public sources, from the customs administration database and from the files of tax entities held by the tax authorities in the Czech Republic and tax authorities in the Slovak Republic, which the contracting parties were unable to obtain when checking the application of value added tax and excise duties on imports and exports from sources in the territory of the relevant state.
The checks were carried out in parallel between January and August 2004.
In the territory of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the Czech Republic), the inspection was carried out by the State Budget Department and the territorial unions of southern Bohemia, northeastern Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and northern Moravia.
The audited persons were the General Directorate of Customs and 12 selected Financial Offices: Financial Office for Prague 1, Financial Office for Prague 3, Financial Office in České Budějovice, Financial Office in Frýdek-Místek, Financial Office in Hodonín, Financial Office in Jihlava, Financial Office in Kostelec nad Orlicí, Financial Office in Kroměříž, Financial Office in Písek, Financial Office in Rožnov pod Radhoštěm, Financial Office in Ústí nad Orlicí, Financial Office in Velke Meziříčí.
The audit on the territory of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as the "SR") was carried out by the Section of Tax and Customs Administration of the SAO of the SR in cooperation with Exposituras of the SAO SR Banská Bystrica and Košice at 10 selected tax offices:
Tax Úrad Bratislava pre selected tax entities, Tax Úrad Bratislava III, Tax Úrad Trnava, Tax Úrad Pú-chov, Tax Úrad Banská Bystrica I, Tax Úrad Liptovský Mikuláš, Tax Úrad Žilina I, Tax Úrad Žilina I, Tax Úrad Žilina II, Tax Úrad Košice I and Tax Úrad Košice IV.
Objective of control
The aim of the control actions was to examine the fulfilment of the obligations of financial or tax authorities and customs offices in the administration of value added tax and excise duty, with a focus on the collection of these taxes on the import and export of goods and services.
The aim of international cooperation was to verify imports and exports of selected commodities between the Czech Republic and Slovakia in the customs database of the Czech Republic and their subsequent verification in tax returns at the relevant financial or tax offices.
The audited period was 2002 and 2003.
2. Recapitulation of control results
2.1. 2.1. General evaluation of control activities
As part of the SAO's international cooperation, the SAO of the Slovak Republic handed over 22,206 items of uniform customs declarations (hereinafter referred to as "JCD") on imports and exports of goods between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, and vice versa, the SAO of the SR, handed over 30 221 JCD items from the SR customs database.
A comparison of the drafted JCD items from the customs database of the Czech Republic and the customs database of the Slovak Republic was made.
Of the 5 883 selected JCD items from the customs database of the Czech Republic, a total of 43% of the related JCD items were assigned.
Of the 12,343 selected JCD items from the SR customs database, a total of 26% of the related JCD entries were assigned.
Based on the unassigned JCD items, financial or tax offices selected files of tax entities for which reported imports and exports were further verified in cooperation with the customs administrations of the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
Based on the exchange of information from the documents of the customs administrations of the Czech Republic and the Slovak and financial or tax authorities, the implementation of reported imports and exports between the Czech Republic and Slovakia was verified on the territory of the second state.
The SAO and the SAO of the Slovak Republic carried out a joint pilot inspection at the border customs crossing Starý Hrozenkov - Drietoma, in which the two interested parties cooperated closely in verifying the accuracy of data on the movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
The inspection did not identify deficiencies in the register of selected cases of imports and exports of goods carried out in 2002.
International cooperation has made it possible to examine trade transactions carried out between trading partners from both states and pointed to shortcomings in the import and export records.
2.2. Summary of the results of the inspection
Control of the SAO and SAO SR in the field of international cooperation focused on imports and exports of spirits and spirits, tobacco and tobacco products, computers and computer components, mobile phones and their components, and possibly other types of goods.
On the basis of an examination of the files of tax entities at selected financial or tax offices, the SAO asked for verification of the implementation of exports of goods declared at 40 JCD with a total statistical value of CZK 15,010,093 and the SAO SR to verify exports at a statistical value of 56 989 Sk.
The SAO and the SAO of the SR found, among other things, the following facts:
- trade transactions were not declared in the same way on both sides, which made it difficult to identify the corresponding imports and exports in the customs database of the Czech Republic and the SR customs database,
- the error rate in entering data in customs databases made it impossible to identify certain imports or exports,
- for some exports from the Czech Republic, corresponding imports into the Slovak Republic have not been demonstrated.
In such cases, there is a reasonable suspicion of fictitious exports of goods for the purpose of unauthorising application of value added tax deductions,
- Tax entities did not comply with certain statutory obligations when reporting imports and exports in value added tax returns,
- deficiencies were identified in the activities of financial or tax authorities in the management of value added tax and excise duties and in their interaction with the customs authorities.
In the area of value added tax and excise duties, attention will continue to need to be paid to international trade in order to effectively minimise tax evasion.
In particular, it is important to improve the activities of tax administrators in the exercise of value added tax administration.
The basis for effective control of excise duties is to check the circulation of documents, systematic physical control of goods and the mutual exchange of information on the import and export of goods.
3. Description of the state of value added tax and excise duties
Value added tax
Value added tax (hereinafter referred to as "VAT") was levied by financial or tax authorities on taxable transactions carried out domestically and by customs authorities on the importation of goods.
Tax revenues for financial or tax authorities were determined by the difference between the collected own tax liability and the excess VAT deductions returned.
The VAT revenues at the customs offices were due to the amount of tax collected by them.
The tax collected by the customs authorities, in accordance with the basic principles of the VAT mechanism, was reflected in the tax deductions applied to financial or tax authorities.
For most financial or tax authorities, excess VAT deductions exceeded the tax liability.
VAT is one of the core taxes in terms of state budget revenues, as it accounted for around 31% of the tax revenues of the state budget of the Czech Republic in 2003 and approximately 42% in the tax revenues of the state budget of the Slovak Republic.
The total VAT collection in the Czech Republic amounted to CZK 162.9 billion in 2003.
The financial and customs authorities collected a total of CZK 394.3 billion in VAT in 2003 and the excess VAT deductions refunded totalled CZK 231.4 billion.
Total VAT collection in the SR amounted to 83.8 billion Sk in 2003.
Tax and customs authorities collected CZK 187.0 billion in VAT in 2003 and the excess VAT deductions refunded amounted to a total of EUR 103.2 billion.
Excise taxes
The collection of excise duties (hereinafter referred to as the SpD) was made by the relevant financial or tax authorities and on imports of products subject to SpD by the customs authorities.
SpD's share of state budget tax revenues in the Czech Republic was approximately 16% in 2003 and around 19% in the Slovak Republic.
The total collection of SpD collected in the Czech Republic by the financial and customs authorities in 2003 was CZK 85.6 billion and in the SR amounted to CZK 38.0 billion.
4. The course of the inspection
Cooperation between the SAO and the SAO of the SR took place in two stages.
In the first stage a comparison of imports and exports of selected commodities from the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia was carried out, in the second stage the results of this comparison were used in mutual verification of the implementation of selected commercial transactions between the Czech Republic and Slovakia and in checks carried out on the territory of both states.
4.1.
Preparing a control action
The first proposal for cooperation in parallel VAT and SpD inspections was presented at a working meeting of representatives of the SAO and the SAO of the Slovak Republic in April 2003.
In November 2003, a coordination meeting was held at which, inter alia, the selection of commodities - goods which represented a significant risk in complying with customs and tax legislation: - alcohol and spirits, tariff subheadings 2207 and 2208, - tobacco and tobacco products, tariff subheadings Nos.2401, 2402 and 2403, - computers and computer components, items and subheadings of customs tariff Nos 8471 and 8473 30, - mobile phones and their accessories, tariff subheadings Nos 8525 20 91, 8525 20 99, 8529 90 40.
The two parties agreed that the selection of tax entities for inspection would be made: (a) from the unassigned items found by the comparison of exports and imports of selected commodities between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, (b) from entities carrying out imports and exports regularly or in one lump sum, (c) on the basis of the findings from the checks carried out by selected tax and tax authorities.
4.2. 4.2. Comparison of customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia
In the first stage, a sample of imports and exports of selected commodities for the month of October 2002 tested a mechanism for the mutual allocation of JCD items registered in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
Subsequently, some exports from the Czech Republic were compared with imports into the Slovak Republic for 2002 and vice versa for selected commodities according to the customs tariff:
- 2207 Undenatured ethyl alcohol with an alcoholic strength by volume of 80% vol. or more; ethyl alcohol and other spirits denatured, with any alcohol content,
- 2208 Undenatured ethyl alcohol with an alcoholic strength by volume of less than 80% vol; spirits, liqueurs and other spirituous beverages;
- 2401 Unprocessed tobacco; tobacco waste,
- 2402 Cigars (whether or not cut off), cigarillos (cigarillos) and cigarettes from tobacco or tobacco substitutes,
- 2403 Other tobacco products and tobacco substitutes; homogenised or reconstituted tobacco; tobacco extracts and punishments (essences),
- 8525 20 91 Transmitting devices containing reception devices: For a cellular network (mobile phones),
- 8525 20 99 Transmitting apparatus containing the receiving equipment: Other,
- 8529 90 40 Parts suitable for use solely or principally with apparatus of headings 8525 to 8528.
Other: Parts of apparatus falling within subheadings 8525 10 50, 8525 20 91, 8525 20 99, 8525 40 11 and 8527 90 92.
JCD entries from the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia were assigned to each other on the basis of the agreement of individual JCD paragraphs (e.g. invoiced price, quantity, weight, registration plate of the vehicle carrying cargo, date of crossing the national border, customs tariff item, etc.).
The results of the comparison are presented in the following tables and charts.
The mutual allocation of individual imports and exports was made more difficult, among other things, by the fact that commercial transactions were not declared in the same way on both sides.
For example, exports from the Czech Republic declared on one export JCD were declared on several import JCDs in the territory of the Slovak Republic, or the export JCD had a different number of items from the import JCD.
Other factors that influenced the success of the assignment were the different composition of the data in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia, as well as the time shift between the export records in the customs database of one country and the registration of corresponding imports in the customs database of the other country.
The results of the comparison were used in the selection of control samples at the financial or tax authorities audited.
Priority was chosen for some tax entities that made imports or exports between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which could not be identified in both databases.
Furthermore, some tax entities were selected for the verification of business transactions reported in VAT returns, for which data on imports or exports between the Czech Republic and Slovakia were found in both databases.
4.3. Pilot control at the border customs crossing of Starý Hrozenkov-Drietoma
The border customs crossing for the performance of pilot control was selected on the basis of a joint analysis of the unassigned JCD items in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
On the basis of a bilateral agreement between the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, the use of control sheets has been introduced at border customs crossings between the Czech Republic and Slovakia since 1.6.1998.
The aim of this measure was to eliminate customs and tax evasion as far as possible, to ensure an overview of the movement of means of transport carrying goods of a commercial nature in the customs area and to create the conditions for mutual comparison of customs records.
The joint pilot inspection was carried out on 8.3.2004 to 26.3.2004 and was aimed at examining this customs control system.
Procedure for the use of control certificates at the Starý Hrozenkov-Drietoma border crossing:
1) Consideration of the vehicle, issue of the inspection sheet and hand it over to the driver.
2) Shutdown of the vehicle in the designated sector in the parking lot.
Customs discussions in the check-in hall check-in hall of the Police of the Czech Republic, Police of the Slovak Republic, Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, Customs Administration of the Slovak Republic.
The execution of the check-in was confirmed by the individual components with a stamp on the checklist.
3) Landing a vehicle into the area of carrying out a physical check.
Presentation of the inspection sheet, JCD, or other documents to the customs officer - check the execution of all prescribed operations and documents.
Performance of physical inspection by the relevant files.
Removal of the vehicle from the customs area.
Pozru: When goods were imported into the Czech Republic, the weighing of the vehicles were carried out directly by the staff of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.
When goods were imported into the SR, weighing vehicles were carried out by staff of a designated legal entity.
The vehicles were registered in computer records after consideration.
4.3.1 Control sample
Exports from the Czech Republic to Slovakia
The control sample was selected on the basis of an analysis of records from the customs database of exports of the Czech Republic in 2002.
The composition of the control sample for exports is shown in Table 4.
4.3.2. Check sheets and their records Exports from the Czech Republic to Slovakia
When exported from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic, the inspection certificates were issued and registered by the SR Customs Administration.
The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic recorded the registration numbers of these control sheets in the electronic database of exports.
Of the number of 453 JCD items, the SAO supervised 256 cases of imports into the Slovak Republic according to data from the customs database of the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The remaining 197 JCD items were identified by the SAO of the SR in cooperation with the workers of the Drietoma border crossing.
Exports from Slovakia to the Czech Republic
When exported from Slovakia to the Czech Republic, the inspection certificates were issued and registered by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.
Out of a total of 339 JCD items of the selected SAO control sample in cooperation with the staff of the border customs crossing Starý Hrozenkov assigned to 295 JCD entries corresponding to the registration numbers of the control sheets.
The remaining 44 cases were identified in their records by the workers of the border customs crossing of Drietoma and the export of goods from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic confirmed.
The audit of the SAO and the SAO of the Slovak Republic did not detect deficiencies in the register of selected cases of imports and exports of goods in 2002 at the Starý Hrozenkov-Drietoma border crossing.
4.4. Selected control findings when verifying commercial transactions
Within the framework of international cooperation, the implementation of imports and exports between the Czech Republic and Slovakia was verified from the documents of customs administrations and financial and tax authorities on the territory of the other state.
Selected tax entities have been verified:
- whether the submitted JCD was registered in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia,
- fulfilment of the legal conditions for the application of the VAT deduction on importation, the refund of excess VAT deduction and the application of the VAT exemption on export.
The verification of commercial transactions was found to be:
1. The SAO SR asked for verification of the implementation of alcohol exports at a statistical value of 56 989 Sk.
The SAO identified corresponding imports in the customs database of the Czech Republic in a statistical value of CZK 42,624.
2. The company involved in the import and export of photographic equipment and accessories applied an excess VAT deduction of CZK 3,740,664 in the VAT return for the month of December 2002.
In order to control reported exports from the Czech Republic, the SAO selected 3 JCD (16 items) with a statistical value of CZK 1,274,822.
The SAO of the SR identified 3 corresponding import JCD (17 items) in a statistical value of 1 724 321 Sk.
VAT was paid to the competent customs office in the SR.
3. The company, whose business was mainly the trade in optical devices, applied a total excess VAT deduction in 2002 of CZK 4 1 36 000 higher than the tax liability.
To verify the reported business activity, the SAO selected an export JCD (32 items) with a statistical value of CZK 7,154,124.
The SAO of the SR found that this JCD corresponds to the import JCD (12 headings) with a statistical value of 9 653 827 Sk.
VAT was paid to the competent customs office in the SR.
4. The company engaged in, inter alia, buying goods for resale and sale, did not report any exports of goods in the submitted VAT returns in 2002 and 2003.
According to the customs database of the Czech Republic, the statistical value of exports of goods in 2002 totalled CZK 3,439,888.
Based on these facts, the SAO selected 5 export JCDs (5 items) for verification with a total statistical value of CZK 669,839.
The SAO of the SR identified 5 corresponding import JCDs (5 items) in a statistical value of 1 012 656 Sk.
The audit of the SAO of the SR at the relevant tax office proved the implementation of the declared imports and the payment of VAT.
5. The company whose business was, among other things, the purchase of goods for resale and sale, production, installation and repair of electrical machinery and appliances, reported in 2002 the export of goods worth CZK 12,966,706 in VAT returns.
According to the customs database of the Czech Republic, in 2002 the total value of exports was CZK 14,474,381.
The SAO submitted 17 export JCDs (59 items) with a total statistical value of CZK 2,975,122.
The SAO identified SR 13 JCD (50 items) in the SR customs database with a statistical value of 3,621,370 Sk.
In the SR customs database it was not possible to identify the corresponding import JCD to 4 export JCD (9 items) with a total statistical value of 399 776 CZK.
The competent tax authority in the Slovak Republic verified these imports from the taxpayer.
The tax entity, listed on the JCD as an importer in the Slovak Republic, commented in the minutes of the local investigation that it had not implemented the imports declared on Czech export JCDs.
The SAO of SR therefore asked the local competent tax authority to carry out a tax audit of VAT and corporate income tax for the 2002 and 2003 tax.
6. The company involved in importing and selling cigarettes exported tobacco stickers in a statistical value of CZK 7,338,199 according to the Czech customs database in 2002 and a statistical value of CZK 12,228,545 in 2003.
In the VAT tax returns, the company did not report any exports in 2002 and 2003.
The SAO selected 5 export JCDs (5 items) for verification with a total statistical value of CZK 2,471,598.
To 4 export JCD (4 items) with a total statistical value of 2,246,860 CZK, the SAO identified SR 7 JCD (7 items) in the customs database SR 7 JCD (7 items) in the statistical value of 2,919,514 Sk.
The export JCD (1 item) with a statistical value of CZK 224,738 could not be assigned adequate imports in the SR customs database.
7. The software company did not report exports of goods in the VAT returns for 2002 and 2003.
According to the customs database of the Czech Republic, the statistical value of exports of goods in 2002 and 2003 totalled CZK 1,630 198.
The SAO selected for verification in SR 9 JCD (9 items) with a total statistical value of CZK 755,588.
In the customs database of the SR SAO SR identified 8 JCD (8 items) in the statistical value of 915 601 Sk.
The export JCD (1 entry) with a statistical value of CZK 68,286 could not be attributed to the corresponding imports in the SR customs database.
In these cases, it was not possible to identify in the SR customs database corresponding to imports to 6 JCDs with a statistical value of CZK 692,800.
Of which:
- to 2 export JCDs from the customs database of the Czech Republic with a statistical value of CZK 293,024, the corresponding import JCD could not be identified in the SR customs database (see paragraphs 6 and 7).
Due to a certain error rate in entering data into the customs database, it was not possible to identify some registered imports, e.g. in cases where the name of the importer was missing or there was an error in the tax identification number (hereinafter referred to as the "DIČ").
It is therefore not possible to conclude with certainty that those exports did not materialise.
- for 4 export JCDs from the customs database of the Czech Republic, imports corresponding to exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic with a statistical value of 399 776 CZK have not been demonstrated (see paragraph 5).
In such cases, suspicion of a fictitious export of goods for the purpose of unauthorised application of the VAT deduction is justified.
5. Control of imports and exports of goods and services as part of the control of selected financial or tax authorities
5.1. Control sample
In order to verify the fulfilment of the obligations of tax entities in the import and export of goods and services, and to evaluate the level of cooperation between the financial and customs authorities, the files of the tax authorities were selected on the audited financial or tax authorities according to the following criteria:
1. tax entities were selected from the customs databases of the Czech Republic and Slovakia: (a) with the highest volume of imports, (b) with the highest amount of VAT charged, (c) with the highest volume of exports,
2. from the registration of financial or tax authorities were selected tax entities according to the above: (a) applied VAT deductions on importation, (b) excess VAT deductions applied, (c) entitlement to a refund of SpD, (d) the VAT exemption claimed on export,
3. tax entities for which tax control has been carried out.
Sampling was made regardless of the country of destination with a focus on risky commodities.
5.2. Control findings in the Czech Republic
An overview of imports into the Czech Republic and exports from the Czech Republic for risky commodities in 2002 and 2003 is shown in the following table:
5.2.1. Check of the selected sample at the tax authorities
The SAO focused mainly on the audited tax authorities:
- the procedure of the tax authorities in verifying the correctness of the declared VAT,
- the cooperation of the tax authorities with the customs administration,
- comparing the data from the customs database with the JCD database at the tax authorities with a focus on comparing the declared value, applying the correct VAT rate following the customs classification of goods or services, or comparing the data on the JCD and the accompanying invoices with the particulars in the customs database,
- Comparison of VAT return data on transactions made and received from abroad with data in the JCD database at the tax authorities or in the customs database,
- how to verify the right to VAT exemption when exporting goods or services abroad,
- a comparison of the volume of exports of goods or services declared in VAT tax returns with data from the customs database.
The JCD database at the tax authorities contained only records of those imports and exports for which tax entities were required to include imports or exports in the tax return.
The audited tax authorities examined the files of the tax entities, which reported in VAT returns in 2002 and 2003 imports totalling CZK 60,396,379,000 and the corresponding VAT totalling CZK 12,644,052.
Furthermore, the files of the tax entities reporting in tax returns for the years 2002 and 2003 were checked with exports totalling CZK 47,323,111,000.
According to the Czech Republic's customs database, tax entities for which imports and exports were examined between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, carried out imports into the Czech Republic from Slovakia in 2002 and 2003 with a total VAT base of CZK 3,759,352,000, VAT amounting to CZK 767,607,000 and exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic with a total statistical value of CZK 1,989,090,000.
The identified differences between the records in the JCD database at the tax authorities and in the customs database of the Czech Republic were examined as follows:
- JCD items that were missing from the customs database of the Czech Republic were requested directly at the General Directorate of Customs of the Czech Republic,
- for JCD items missing from the database of tax authorities, it has been verified that these are not cancelled documents,
- for JCD items for which different values were found between the customs database of the Czech Republic and the database of the tax authorities, the relevant JCDs were requested at the General Directorate of Customs of the Czech Republic in written form, including the attached invoices.
The screening revealed that the JCD database at the tax authorities did not include, for example, records of import JCDs with a total VAT value of CZK 3,622,000 and records of export JCDs with a total statistical value of CZK 9,359,000.
5.2.1.1. Detected differences
By comparing the JCD database at the tax authorities and the cumulated tax liability for 2002 and 2003 in the VAT returns for the selected sample of tax entities, the following differences were found:
Differences in values were mainly due to:
- The time shift between the realisation of imports and the exercise of the right to deduct VAT charged on the importation of goods.
The taxpayer was entitled to deduct the tax on the importation of goods within 3 years of the end of the tax year during which the goods were placed under the relevant scheme or, in the case of the temporary admission procedure, no later than 3 years after the end of the tax period during which the scheme was terminated.
- The time difference between the realisation of exports and the moment when the taxpayer received JCD.
The taxpayer was obliged to provide data on realized exports exempt from the obligation to apply output tax to the VAT return at the earliest for the tax period in which the goods came out of the country if they simultaneously had a tax document, which was JCD.
- Failure to comply with the obligations of tax entities when reporting imports and exports in VAT returns.
In some cases, tax entities did not include correct data on imports and exports in VAT returns.
Since tax entities did not have to attach JCD lists to the VAT return filed, it has been made more difficult to control the right to deduct VAT or VAT exemption by the tax authorities.
5.2.2.2. Synergies between the financial and customs authorities
During the audited period, following a decision by the customs authorities, import or export duties and VAT were refunded or remitted.
Tax entities were required by law to reduce the previously exercised right to deduct VAT by the amount of tax returned by the customs office, in a tax return for the period in which the tax was returned.
No legislation provided for the transmission of information on changes in the amount of customs duties and VAT from customs offices to the tax authorities.
Some audited tax authorities received this information, but irregularly or with considerable delay and only from some customs offices.
One audited tax office did not receive this information at all.
If the tax office did not receive information on changes in the amount of duty and VAT directly from the customs office, it did not have the information necessary to check compliance with the legal obligation of tax entities.
In 2002, customs authorities refunded VAT of more than EUR 319 million. CZK and in 2003 in the amount of over 398 mil. CZK.
The results of the audit pointed to persistent shortcomings in the activities of tax authorities, some systemic errors in the cooperation of the tax authorities with the customs authorities and the failure of certain obligations of VAT and SpD payers.
In the administration of VAT and SpD, weaknesses were identified in particular in the following areas:
(a) on the abolition of VAT registrations, the fulfilment of the obligation on payers to pay VAT on the registered assets, or which should have been registered on the date of cancellation of the registration in respect of which the payer applied the deduction, verified only rarely,
(b) the tax authorities have not consistently used the possibility of carrying out a tax audit or local investigation.
In this case, in some cases, there was a lack of verification of the right to deduct VAT,
(c) the official records and reports on the oral hearing did not contain all the necessary data demonstrating the legitimacy of the excess VAT deductions applied,
(d) the tax authorities did not sufficiently verify the imports and exports reported in VAT returns.
5.3. Control findings in SR
5.3.1. Check of selected sample at tax offices
For the selected sample of the SAO SR, it verified or the tax office carried out a tax audit for the tax years 2002 and 2003.
After analysing the filed tax returns and refund requests from selected tax entities of the SAO SR, the tax office asked for the provision of the relevant JCDs documenting imports and exports, invoices and proofs of payment of the tax.
Subsequently, the SAO of the Slovak Republic checked that the submitted JCD was registered in the customs database of imports and exports and the fulfilment of decisive facts and legal conditions when applying the deduction of input tax by way of importation, when the excess VAT deduction was refunded, the application of the exemption in respect of exports and the refund of SpD.
In 10 audited tax offices, the SAO of the Slovak Republic verified selected cases of imports and exports of goods between the Slovak Republic in the structure according to the respect of JCD items and the sum of the statistical values given in the following table.
In total, imports were checked at a statistical value of CZK 856.2 million. Sk, which represents 5.11% of the total value of imports of selected commodities from the Czech Republic into SROV.
Exports of selected commodities were checked at a total statistical value of 176 million. Sk, which from the total value of exports of selected commodities from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic represents 6.87%.
In addition, 618 cases of imports of additional goods and services (mainly white technology, packaging and software) from EU countries were checked into the Slovak Republic with a total statistical value of CZK 532.8 million. Sk.
5.3.2. Synergies between tax and customs authorities
The SAO OF THE SR's audit found discrepancies between the data registered in the SR customs database and the data reported in specific VAT returns, e.g.:
- 2 tax entities (natural persons) reported in tax returns imports of goods with a total value of 1 589 261 Sk, on the basis of which they claimed a refund of excess VAT deductions.
In local investigations carried out at the instigation of the SAO OF THE SR, tax entities were unable to prove to the tax authority the legitimacy of the application of input tax with the relevant documents on the implementation of imports and the payment of VAT,
- In the tax return for the January 2003 tax year, the taxpayer declared the taxable transaction received at the value of 77 167 576 Sk, the export of goods worth 18 006 041 Sk and claimed an excess VAT deduction of 17 157 101 Sk.
VAT returns filed for 2003 show that the difference between the volume of purchases and exports of 59 161 535 Sk, which arose in January 2003, was not settled throughout 2003.
In the above cases, the SAO SR asked the relevant tax authorities to carry out a tax audit of the excess VAT deductions applied.
- in another case, the tax entity (s.r.o.) for the January to June 2002 tax year declared in VAT returns the export of goods with a total value of 87 199 Sk.
By verification in the SR customs database, it was found that the taxpayer made exports at a statistical value of 296 747 Sk during that period.
The tax office carried out a local investigation multiple times at the company's headquarters, finding that the company's managing director (UK citizen) had travelled and the company had left the leased premises without terminating the lease in August 2002.
At the time of the SAO's audit of the SR SAO, the tax administrator filed a complaint with the law enforcement authorities on suspicion of committing the crime of non-taxation.
Based on the results of the audit at selected tax offices, the SAO of the SR notes that the biggest problems in the performance of the administration and control of VAT and SpD occurred mainly in the following areas:
- non-use of the possibility of carrying out VAT control on problematic tax entities, in particular in cases of high value of excess VAT deductions;
- the tax inspection protocols did not contain an inventory of the documents audited
- JCD on the import and export of goods,
- insufficient screening of reported imports and exports of goods in tax returns,
- lengthy management of tax administrators in issuing decisions, in particular in the context of the assessment procedure, even as a result of the termination of the right to impose penalties;
- non-compliance with legal conditions when granting tax deferrals;
- non-compensation of VAT arrears within the deadline for the refund of excess VAT deduction,
- insufficient use of all forms of security and recovery of tax arrears.
On the basis of the SAO's examination of the findings, the SR asked the relevant tax authorities to carry out a VAT check with a focus on the legitimacy of the excess VAT deductions applied for 14 tax entities.
Measures have been taken at all audited tax offices to remedy the identified deficiencies, the implementation of which will be monitored and monitored by the SAO of the SR.
6. Conclusion
International cooperation has made it possible to examine trade transactions carried out between trading partners from both states and pointed to shortcomings in the import and export records.
The results of the checks also identified persistent shortcomings in the fulfilment of VAT and SpD obligations, in the activities of financial or tax authorities, in the system of cooperation and exchange of information between tax authorities and customs administrations, which ultimately reduced the efficiency and effectiveness of tax controls.
The lessons learned also showed that the tax authorities in the Czech Republic have basic data on imports and exports from the Czech customs database within the tax information system. There is no similar system for transmitting information on imports and exports of goods between customs and tax administrations in the SR.
The procedure for verifying the performance of the VAT and SpD management was not the same, given the different rules and conditions in the territory of the two States.
The SAO verified the necessary data from information obtained from the customs administration of the Czech Republic and from the documents available at the audited tax offices. The SAO of SR verified the execution of commercial transactions from documents of tax entities requested through tax authorities.
If irregularities were found, he asked the tax authorities to carry out tax inspections.
The parallel VAT and SpD checks carried out assessed the state of administration of these taxes in the period prior to joining the European Union and pointed to the need for further cooperation in this area.
Mutual cooperation will further deepen in the control of the activities of financial or tax authorities in connection with the adoption of the new VAT Act.
One of the new obligations related to the delivery of goods to other Member States of the European Union is the submission of a so-called recapitulative statement.
This report must be made by all VAT payers who have made the supply of goods to another Member State to a person registered for VAT in another Member State.
Tax administrators are required to enter data from recapitulative statements into the VIES (VAT Information Exchange System) to which tax administrations from the Member States of the European Union have access.
Financial or tax authorities then have the possibility to compare these data with the data contained in the filed VAT returns.
This system is further used to verify the validity of the VAT number of persons registered for VAT, to verify the validity of the VAT exemption applied on the supply of goods to another Member State and to check the proper taxation of goods.
The implementation of parallel control actions showed the possibilities of cooperation between the SAO and the SAO SR.
The results of these control actions will be confronted with the outputs of upcoming control actions, which will, among other things, focus on examining the VIES system, which is intended to prevent tax evasion in so-called "intra-community supplies."
Given the importance of VAT and SpD for budget revenues, control action needs to be focused primarily on monitoring and identifying risky areas in order to limit the scope for tax evasion to indirect taxes.

1. Introduction
Population migration is one of the phenomena that has a global character and has become an inseparable part of the current development stage of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.
Its cause is, in particular, the flight of citizens from their country of origin or last residency from persecution, in particular for reasons of racial, religious, national, political, as well as the consequences of military conflicts and ethnic cleansing.
Their aim is to gain asylum and integrate into society, especially in some of Europe's developed democratic countries.
A large group is also made up of foreigners, whose reason for migration is unfavourable economic and living conditions.
Migration is not a new phenomenon.
The setting of concrete principles for aid to refugees has already been brought about by the adoption of the 1951 Geneva Agreement and the 1967 New York Protocol on the status of refugees, the acceptance of which the governments of the signatory countries have pledged to apply them in their foreign-policy orientation.
The Czech and Slovak Federative Republic ratified the New York Protocol in 1991 and the Geneva Agreement in 1992.
After the split in 1993, both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic declared their position on the refugee issue by continuing to implement adopted international documents and confirmed their binding nature within the framework of national legislation by a legal act.
Both republics have also enshrined the granting of asylum in their constitutional laws.
The asylum process and related issues were targeted parallel checks carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Najýš Control Office of the Slovak Republic, the results of which are contained in a joint final report.
Cooperation between the highest control authorities of both countries was implemented on the basis of the "Contract of Cooperation in Control Activities" (hereinafter referred to as the Treaty") concluded in April 2004.
The two Parties undertook to provide each other with information in the Treaty on the legislation governing the asylum procedure in the State of the other Contracting Party, selected statistical data on the number of asylum seekers and the results of the asylum process, as well as information on asylum facilities.
The aim of the parallel control action was to set out the same problem areas and to highlight the consequences of this for the area of population migration.
Cooperation consisted in the harmonisation of the control action programme, the exchange of information to the extent provided for by the Treaty and the drawing up of a joint final report on the outcome of the checks.
The first joint meeting, which took place from 5.4. to 7.4.2004, set out the same headings of the audited issue and control procedures for the preparation of control actions.
At the second meeting, which took place on 28.6. to 30.6.2004, the common points for the control action programme were specified.
During the third joint meeting, which took place during the audit operation on 8.11. to 10.11.2004, there was an exchange of experience from the ongoing inspections.
The forms of outputs from the checks were specified and the structure and content of the joint final report drawn up from 14.2. to 17.2. 2005 at the last joint meeting were set out.
The checks were carried out in parallel between September 2004 and January 2005.
In the Czech Republic, the inspection was carried out by auditors of the Department of Defence and Security and selected territorial unions.
The audited bodies were the Ministry of the Interior (hereinafter referred to as "MV") and the Administration of Refugee Facilities of the Ministry of the Interior (hereinafter referred to as "SUZ").
In the Slovak Republic, the defence section, vnútra and the staff of the úradov carried out a check.
The audited entity was the Migration Department of the Ministry of Slovakia (hereinafter referred to as "MÚ").
The audited period was 2001, 2002, 2003 (the period checked).
In some cases, statistical data over a longer period of time are also used in the joint report.
2. Recapitulation of control results
2.1. 2.1. Assessment of control activity
The subject of parallel checks was: - asylum process, - asylum facilities, - management of funds and state property, - internal control system.
The mutual exchange of experience gained between the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Najýš Control Office of the Slovak Republic took place at the stage of preparation and implementation of control actions.
This exchange made it possible to evaluate the supporting documents submitted more thoroughly, to analyse the causes of the identified differences in the safeguarding of the asylum process.
This made it possible to focus on the decisive problems affecting the activities of asylum facilities.
Ultimately, this positively affected the quality of carrying out the control activity.
2.2 Summary of the results of the inspection
The harmonisation of the asylum law of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic with European Union documents (EU) has been the subject of evaluation reports by the European Commission on the readiness of both countries to join the EU.
The adoption of legislation governing this area continues after the accession of both countries to the EU in order to further align with EU law.
The number of asylum seekers in the Czech Republic increased significantly in 2001.
In the Slovak Republic, the number of applicants has a steadily growing trend, with a significant increase in applicants in 2001.
Within the meaning of international agreements, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic provide financial and material security to asylum seekers.
The state budget of both countries earmarks the necessary funds for this purpose.
The amount of expenditure drawn from the state budget of both countries is influenced in particular by the number of applicants, the duration of the asylum procedure until granting or not granting asylum, as well as the health of applicants.
The amount of some selected benefits is comparable in both countries.
The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic set up asylum facilities in which they gradually created suitable conditions for the stay of participants in the asylum procedure.
During the stay, asylum seekers are provided with accommodation, catering, health care and basic material equipment and sanitary items.
At the same time, courses are organised as part of leisure activities and applicants are created the conditions for cultural and sporting activities.
Asylum facilities include reception centres and residential centres, in the Czech Republic as well as integration centres.
The cost of one residential day depends on the occupancy and equipment of the Centre and is comparable in both countries.
In the Czech Republic, the capacity of asylum facilities is basically stabilised.
In the Slovak Republic, it is projected to increase by almost 1,000 seats in the next two years.
The aim is to create the conditions for applicants, whose growing number is expected to continue in the coming years in the context of the application of the Dublin Convention.
In the Czech Republic, the highest part of the approved budget expenditure was spent on securing services. The decisive expenditure of this item was the expenditure on the accommodation and catering of applicants in asylum facilities operated under the contract, the healthcare expenditure provided to asylum seekers and the costs of a permanent security service ensuring the protection of asylum facilities.
A significant part of the total expenditure was also spent on salaries, payments for work carried out and premiums.
In the Slovak Republic, the budgetary management of the security of migration policy and the asylum process was marked by many budgetary measures that addressed legitimate requirements related to the increase in the number of asylum seekers.
Current expenditure was a decisive factor in the execution of current expenditure on wages, salaries and premiums, expenditure on materials and services and expenditure on security services.
The results of the audit in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic highlighted some similar shortcomings that did not have a major impact on the financial management and management of the state's property.
These were shortcomings, in particular, in the area of the use of state budget funds in breach of the purpose for which they were determined by the State Budget Act, when ordinary expenditure was covered by actions having the character of a technical appreciation of fixed tangible assets.
The Accounting Act in the field of inventory and non-compliance with the accounting curriculum was also violated.
In the Czech Republic, minor deficiencies were also found in the disposal of state property when it was left to use another person without a contract.
Failure to comply with the deadline for reporting changes to the Land Registry data violated the Land Registry Act and leaving the waste for disposal to a person who was not a person authorized for waste management was violated by the Waste Act.
In the Slovak Republic, shortcomings were also found in the provision of disproportionately high advances for electricity and natural gas abstraction, shortcomings in public procurement and the management of state property when it was not sufficiently secured by its registration and the method of liquidation of unnecessary assets was not proven.
The internal control system has been secured in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic within the meaning of the generally binding legislation in force governing the way financial control is carried out.
No deficiencies were found in the written documentation submitted.
Despite some identified shortcomings, the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and Najvyšší control úrad of the Slovak Republic, evaluate positively the procedure of SUZ and the Municipality in the provision of services for asylum seekers.
Based on the lessons learned during the inspection, the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the Najvyšší Control Office of the Slovak Republic note that despite a significant increase in the number of asylum seekers in recent years, the relevant organisational units of both countries have managed tasks related to the care of asylum seekers at an appropriate level.
The evaluation shows that the system is functional and stable.
The results of the inspection were discussed with interested statutory representatives of the respective organizational units of the state on the Czech and Slovak sides.
Based on the results of the audit, we recommend that the positive methodological experience of the audit be used in other joint control actions in the framework of international cooperation of supreme audit institutions.
3. Legislative framework
In both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, asylum law is based on the 1951 Geneva Convention (Convention on the Status of Refugees and the Secondary New York Protocol of 1967).
The first legislation was implemented by Act No. 498/1990 Coll., on Refugees.
Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum and on Amendments to Act No. 83/1991 Coll., on the Police of the Czech Republic, has been effective in the Czech Republic since 1 January 2000.
This Act has been amended a total of five times (Act No. 2/2002 Coll., Act No. 217/2002 Coll., Act No. 320/2002 Coll., Act No. 519/2002 Coll. and Act No. 222/2003 Coll.).
Two other amendments to Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum, are currently in the legislative process, and the adoption of further amendments will be tied to European legislation.
At the time of the creation of Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum, the area of asylum was part of the 3rd pillar of the EU and asylum documents were in terms of binding political documents.
Already in the context of the adoption of this law, there was an effort to make it as compatible as possible with EU law.
A major change for asylum policy within the EU was the transfer of asylum issues from the 3rd to the 1st pillar, when the right of asylum became part of Community law from 1.5. 1999 on the basis of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
This shift has created the need to create adequate legislation, i.e. to create legal instruments in appropriate legal binding nature.
The compatibility of Czech asylum law with EU documents has been the subject of regular evaluation reports by the European Commission.
Key Community regulations in the field of asylum were adopted shortly before or after the Czech Republic joined the EU and their transposition period at the time of the audit of the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic has not yet expired.
After their implementation into the Czech legal order, the Czech Republic will be obliged to notify the European Commission of how it carried out the transposition.
In the Slovak Republic, the procedure of the state authorities in the procedure for granting refugee status and the determination of the obligations of foreigners who applied for refugee status or who were granted temporary refuge in the territory of the Slovak Republic was established with effect from 1.1.1996 by the National Council of the Slovak Republic No 283/1995 Z. z., on the refugees.
Since 2003, the Refugee Act has been replaced by Law No 480/2002 Z. z" on asylum and amending and supplementing certain laws incorporating the harmonisation of the legislation of the Slovak Republic with Directive 2001/55/EC of the Council of Europe of 20.7.2001 on minimum standards for granting temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons and on measures to promote the balance of efforts between Member States in the adoption of these persons and the endure of the resulting consequences.
After two amendments to Act No 480/2002 Z., on Asylum, in 2003 and 2004, a third amendment was approved at the beginning of 2005, which means further harmonisation of the Slovak Republic's law with EU legislation on migration and asylum.
Its important elements are, for example, the establishment of an obligation for asylum seekers to attend a course of the foundations of the Slovak language for the duration of their stay at the integration centre, the designation of a guardian by the courts of non-funded foreigners, if they are staying on the territory of the Slovak Republic without a legal representative, allowing applicants to enter into an employment relationship under certain circumstances mentioned in the amendment to the Act.
The harmonisation of the Slovak Republic's law with EU law on migration and the asylum process has been assessed in regular European Commission reports on the readiness for the Slovak Republic's accession to the EU.
In 2002, the report highlighted the lack of staffing capacity of the Ministry of the Ministry, which did not correspond to the increased number of asylum seekers.
4. Asylum Process
In the Czech Republic, since 1990, matters relating to refugees fall within the competence of the MV.
With effect from 1 January 1996, the MV has established an organisational unit of the state of SUZ. This was due to the state administration's exercise department in the field of asylum procedures, which is carried out through the Department of Asylum and Migration Policy of the MoI, from the provision of services to asylum seekers.
The task of SUZ is to provide accommodation, catering, health and other services to participants in asylum and asylum procedures for the MV.
In the Slovak Republic, it performs decisive tasks in the area of the IHR's asylum process, in particular in terms of financial and material-technical security of the asylum process to the extent defined by specific regulations.
Priority tasks are issues related to the decision-making of foreigners' applications for asylum at level I of the administrative procedure and the comprehensive operation of asylum facilities in the areas of accommodation, catering, health, financial and material security for asylum seekers.
In addition, it is preparing concepts for the state's migration policy.
The results achieved in the area of the creation of the asylum system in the Slovak Republic in recent years have been significantly influenced by cooperation and support from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
A special benefit was his financial contribution to the reconstruction of the housing fund for asylum seekers.
The UNHCR has also co-financed social, cultural and sporting activities for applicants.
4.1 Development of the number of asylum seekers and the results of the asylum process
The evolution of the number of asylum seekers in the Czech Republic is shown in the graph.
A significant increase occurred in 2001 due to the Kosovo crisis and an increased number of refugees from Chechnya became apparent in 2003.
An overview of the results of the asylum procedure in the Czech Republic is shown in Table 1.
A total of 394 asylum were granted in the audited period, 83 of them in 2001, 103 in 2002 and 208 in 2003.
In the audited period, no asylum was granted in a total of 22,731 cases and in 22,636 cases the asylum procedure was terminated.
The number of parties to 1.1. includes both persons who have not yet been subject to a decision and those to whom the decision has not been referred.
There are also included persons who have been waived to miss the time limit for lodging an appeal, or who have been annulled the previous decision and have not yet been issued a new one.
In the Slovak Republic, the number of asylum seekers has a steadily growing trend.
If 96 applicants were registered in 1993, it was already 10,358 in 2003.
A significant increase in the number of applicants occurred in 2001, when 8,131 applicants were registered, an increase of 423% compared to 2000, in which 1,556 people applied for asylum.
Data on the results of the asylum procedure in the Slovak Republic in the audited period are shown in Table 2.
A total of 49 asylum-seekers were granted in the audited period and the number did not exceed 0.22% of the registered number of applicants in each year.
Asylum was not awarded in 860 cases.
The asylum procedure was discontinued in a total of 23,088 cases.
The bulk of applicants, by staying outside the asylum facility without permission, voluntarily left the asylum procedure before it was completed.
In 2002, it was more than 82% of the total number of registered applicants, and by more than 94% in 2003.
The duration of one applicant's stay at one asylum facility, converted into an average number of days, was 13 days in 2001, 18 days in 2002 and 19 days in 2003.
The findings of the Ministry also show that for most applicants entering the asylum process in the Slovak Republic, it is about finding better living conditions, i.e. so-called economic migration, which has no basis in documents adopted by the international community, to which the Slovak Republic has also signed up.
In these cases, the asylum system is purposefully used by the applicant.
An application for asylum based on economic reasons, such as seeking employment or better living conditions, is no reason to grant asylum.
Such an application should be considered as manifestly unfounded under the provisions of Section 12 of Article 12(a) of Act No 480/2002 Z.
Internationally recognised principles for the identification of economic migrants are not yet established to distinguish them from applicants persecuted in their country of origin and that would allow the asylum process to be accelerated.
In view of the above, it can be concluded that the Slovak Republic is, in terms of international migration, transit countries and destination countries have been and remain Western European states.
After joining the EU, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic acceded to the Agreement determining the State responsible for examining asylum applications lodged in one of the Member States of the European Communities (Dublin Convention).
The Convention prevents multiple purpose applications for asylum in several EU countries.
Applicants are returning to the country of first registration after positive identification in EURODAC.
The Slovak Republic is part of the outdoor border of EU countries, therefore the application of the Dublin Convention may in the following period result in an increase in the number of applicants who will need to create the conditions for residence in the Slovak Republic until the decision to grant or not grant asylum.
4.2 Drawing of funds
The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic are obliged, within the meaning of international agreements and the national legislative arrangements based on them, to provide financial and material security to asylum seekers.
The state budget of both countries earmarks the necessary funds for this purpose.
The amount of expenditure drawn from the state budget is mainly influenced by the number of applicants, the duration of the asylum procedure until the final decision on the granting of asylum, as well as their state of health.
The growing number of people entering the asylum process has a direct impact on the higher use of statutory benefits for applicants such as food, pocket money, expenditure on basic material equipment, other material equipment and other social contributions.
The amount of some selected doses is comparable in both countries.
In the Czech Republic, in the audited period, there was a meal allowance of CZK 58 per person per day, an allowance of CZK 12 per person per day and CZK 6 per child under the age of 15.
The cost per asylum seeker per residential day was on average CZK 351 in 2001, CZK 383 in 2002 and CZK 345 in 2003.
In addition to pocket money, asylum seekers staying in residential centres with separate cooking and applicants staying in private outside asylum facilities may receive a contribution up to the minimum subsistence level.
Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum, as amended, admits, among other things, in § 84 municipalities, to a contribution to the reimbursement of costs incurred in connection with the asylum facility on its territory.
The amount of the contribution was determined annually by government resolutions and in the audited period amounted to CZK 7 per person per stay day.
At the same time, municipalities are entitled to a contribution to the non-investment costs of primary schools attended by asylum seekers.
The amount of the allowance was CZK 120 per pupil in the audited period and a month, provided that in a given month the person attended the school for a minimum of 10 days.
In the Slovak Republic, in the controlled period, there was a meal allowance of 70 Sk per person per day, pocket money 12 Sk per person per day and 8 Sk per child under the age of 15.
The cost per asylum seeker per residing day was on average 442 Sk in 2001, 447 Sk in 2002 and 445 Sk in 2003.
The municipalities on whose territory the asylum facility is located is granted, in accordance with Law No 480/2002 Z. z., on asylum, a partial reimbursement of expenses incurred by the municipality in connection with the establishment and activities of an asylum facility.
So far, municipalities have only partially benefited from the possibility of applying for a contribution, which is set at 1 500 Sk per bed and calendar year.
National legislation in both countries for issuing a decision on asylum sets a 90-day period from the start of the asylum procedure and at the same time allows for an extension of this deadline in justified cases.
The most common reason for extending the asylum procedure, which affects the amount of state budget expenditure, is the submission of remedies against the decision not to grant asylum.
In the Czech Republic, the highest number of final decisions was made between 90 and 180 days (31.54%).
The second highest number was within 90 days of the date of the application for asylum (17.61%).
In total, 73% of asylum procedures initiated in 2001-2003 were finally decided within one year of their initiation.
Within two years of the start of the asylum procedure, 92% of asylum applications were finally decided.
In the Slovak Republic, according to MÚ data, up to 90% of applicants who have not been granted asylum use the statutory possibility of extending the time limit by filing an appeal to the court.
In some cases it was an extension of more than a year and at the time of the audit, the proceedings were not closed in court.
Some contribution to the shortening of the asylum procedure is expected from the establishment of joint workplaces of the Municipality and Úrad Border and cudzineckej polície Policajný zboru in the reception centres in Adamov-Gbeloch, Opatovskej Novej Vsi and in Liptovské Vlachoch, which was approached at the time of the inspection from 1.10.2004.
This envisages simplifying procedures and shortening procedural deadlines between the two components of the asylum process.
5. Asylum devices
The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic set up asylum facilities in which they gradually created suitable conditions for the provision of services to the participants in the asylum procedure.
During the stay, asylum seekers are provided with accommodation, meals, health care, pocket money and basic material equipment and sanitary items during their stay.
At the same time, courses are organised as part of leisure activities and applicants are created the conditions for cultural and sporting activities.
5.1 Asylum equipment in the Czech Republic
SUZ manages and operates asylum facilities and is responsible to manage the state's property in the premises of the Vyšní Lhoty reception centre, the reception and residential centre Červený Újezd, the residential centres Bělá-Jezová, Zastávka u Brna, Kostelec nad Orlicí, Havířov and in the premises of the integration asylum centres Jaroměř and Zastávka u Brna.
At the beginning of 2002, a reception centre was established in the transit area of Prague-Ruzyně Airport.
SUZ also operates asylum facilities in Stráž pod Ralskem, Seč, Bruntál, Zbýšov and Kashava, which are operated by a legal entity on the basis of Section 80 (3) of Act No 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum.
The total accommodation capacity of the reception centres is 747 seats and the total accommodation capacity of the residential centres is 1,977 places.
Admission centres are closed establishments which may not be allowed to leave asylum seekers until the prescribed medical examinations and basic admissions listed in Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on Asylum.
Violations of the obligation to stay at the reception centre are assessed as a misdemeanor.
The residency centres to which asylum seekers from reception centres come are used to house asylum seekers until the decision on their application for asylum or not to grant asylum becomes final.
Subject to certain conditions, asylum seekers have the opportunity to leave or stay in private.
Applicants for asylum, in reception and residential centres in which they are reported to reside, have the right to free accommodation, the provision of meals, other services and pocket money, provided that they have tolerated the acts necessary to ascertain their financial and property circumstances, and those circumstances are such that even partial reimbursement of those services cannot be fairly claimed from them.
Integration asylum centres are used for temporary accommodation for persons who have been granted asylum.
Clients are accommodated in the resort on the basis of an accommodation contract, which is usually concluded for 6 months with the possibility of an extension until adequate housing can be provided for them, or they will secure it themselves as part of the state integration program.
In the integration centre, clients pay for all accommodation costs and eat individually.
Persons with the recognised status of a refugee have the same rights and obligations as Czech citizens and have the same access to social security.
5.1.1 Costs of asylum facilities
To compare asylum facilities, he was chosen as the best-sensifying indicator of the cost of one physical residential day.
It is based on the actual number of persons to whom the services provided by the asylum facility were actually provided every day.
Table 3 and in the graph are devices operated by SUZ designated as own and facilities operated by legal persons on the basis of Section 80 of Act No.325/1999 Coll., on Asylum, as contractual.
The cost of one residential day in its own asylum facility operated by SUZ decreases with increasing fulfilment of these facilities. This is due to the fact that the fixed costs of running the premises are budgeted for more asylum seekers.
The volume of total costs incurred to provide services for asylum seekers increases proportionately with their increasing numbers.
In 2001 and 2003, applicants in crisis capacity were accommodated in their own asylum facilities.
In part of 2003, emergency accommodation capacity in residential containers, caused by the mass arrival of asylum seekers from Chechen nationality from Poland, even used extraordinary accommodation capacity in residential containers (a total of 320 beds).
This capacity was secured by renting 80 residential and 6 sanitary containers.
Spending per applicant per day of residence was then lower in those years.
However, long-term maintenance of the high filling of these devices is not possible.
Account should be taken of the risks of an unexpected influx of refugees and the associated requirement for the need for higher accommodation capacity.
At the same time, it is not possible to carry out some repairs, maintenance and investments with fully occupied accommodation capacity.
The form of asylum facilities operated contractually allows, where necessary, the adoption of operational solutions in the area of the capacity of asylum facilities.
5.2 Asylum facilities in the Slovak Republic
Asylum facilities are reception centres and residential centres.
The Municipality has in its administration the reception centres Adamov-Gbely, Rohovce, Opatovská Nová Ves and the residential centre Brezová pod Bradlom.
The total capacity of the reception centres is 470 seats and the residential centre is 100 seats.
The growing number of asylum seekers was dealt with by the Municipality by setting up a residential centre in Gabčíkov in the rented premises of the Slovak Technical University of Bratislava with a flexible disposable capacity from 250 to 940 seats.
According to the contract concluded, the leaseholder also ensures the provision of services related to the operation of the centre.
In this form, the Ministry dealt with the lack of its own staff.
The residential centre was also temporarily established in 2002 and 2003 in leased premises in Jazierciach with a capacity of 160 seats.
Admission centres had an average occupancy rate of 57% to 62% in the audited period, with an average of 33% to 50% in residential centres.
Occupancy changed according to the season and the highest was in the last months of the year, when many more applicants applied for asylum compared to other months of the year.
Further increase of accommodation capacity by about 450 seats will be possible after the reconstruction of the resorts in Opatovskej Novej Vsi and Vlachoch.
Following the completion of the Humennom Centre in 2006, the number of seats will increase by another 550 people.
5.2.1 Cost of asylum facilities
Data on the cost of running asylum facilities are shown in Table 4.
Their analysis shows that the operation of an asylum facility by another body providing premises and ensuring the operation of the facility, including the related activities, is one of the options to ensure, at reasonable costs, the tasks arising from the stay of asylum seekers in the Slovak Republic.
6. Management of funds and state property
6.1 Economic analysis
In the Czech Republic, in 2001, approved budgeted SUZ expenditure was increased by 13 budget measures by CZK 103,077,000.
Of this, 89,979 thousand CZK (87.29%) were purpose-designed funds. The bulk of it was intended to address the consequences of the Kosovo crisis (CZK 44,538,000) and the provision of health care provided to asylum seekers (CZK 38,870,000).
In 2002, SUZ spending was increased by 20 budget measures by CZK 88,362,000.
Of this, CZK 62,282,000 (70.48%) were earmarked funds, the bulk of which (CZK 23,200,000) was earmarked for health care provided to asylum seekers.
In 2003, SUZ spending was increased by fourteen budget measures by a total of CZK 88,078,000.
Of this, 82,000 thousand CZK (93.09%) were earmarked funds released from the General Treasury Administration.
The amount of CZK 51,000,000 was earmarked for health care provided to asylum seekers, CZK 24,000,000 to address the influx of Chechen refugees and CZK 7,000,000 for a program of humanitarian evacuations of disabled residents of the Iraqi Republic.
An overview of the drawdown of selected SUZ expenditure in the audited period is given in Table 5.
It is clear from the above overview that the highest part of the expenditure was spent on providing services.
The amount of expenses spent on the purchase of services ranged from 37.07% to 38.23% of total expenditure.
The outrageous expenditure under this item was the costs of accommodation and catering of applicants in asylum facilities operated on the basis of a contract, medical treatment expenses provided to asylum seekers and the costs of a permanent security service providing security in individual asylum facilities.
A significant contribution to SUZ's total expenditure was spent on salaries, payments for work and premiums (23.99% - 24.97%).
Last but not least, total SUZ expenditure was significantly accounted for by material purchases (around 14%), with food purchases accounting for the highest share of these expenditures (7.61% ? 9.83% of total expenditure).
In the Slovak Republic, the MÚ's budgetary economy to secure migration policy and the asylum process has been marked by more budgetary measures that addressed legitimate requirements related to the increase in the number of asylum seekers.
In particular, in 2001 and 2002, the draft and breakdown of the budget in the expenditure part were characterised by an imbalance between the requirements of the Ministry, which were based on an increase in the number of asylum seekers and the financing needs for their legal claims, and the resources provided mainly in the main category of current expenditure.
The administrator of the budget chapter disproportion dealt with several budgetary measures over the course of the year, increasing the current expenditure limit by 41.8% in 2001 and up to 71.7% in 2002.
An overview of the drawdown of selected MÚ expenditure in the audited period is shown in Table 6.
The implementation of current expenditure was a decisive factor in spending on wages, salaries and premiums ranging from 24.47% to 30.51% and expenditure on materials and services ranging from 21.04% to 38.82% of total expenditure.
More than 10% were spending on security services and from 3.92% to 7.20% on food purchases.
Another significant part was spending on accommodation and catering services by a share of 10.82% to 26.96%.
The relatively low share in the range from 1.03% to 6.25% was capital expenditure.
6.2 Shortcomings identified
The results of the audit in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic pointed to some similar shortcomings that did not have a major impact on the management of state funds and property.
These were shortcomings in particular in the following areas: (a) the use of state budget funds in violation of the purpose for which they were determined by the State Budget Act when ordinary expenditure was covered by actions having the character of a technical appreciation of fixed tangible assets; (b) a violation of the Accounting Act in the field of inventories and in non-compliance with the exchange chart.
In the Czech Republic, minor deficiencies were also found in the disposal of state property, when it was left for use by another person without a proper contract; failure to comply with the deadline for reporting changes to land registry data violated the Land Registry Act; leaving waste for disposal to a person who was not a person authorized to manage waste was violated by the Waste Act.
In the Slovak Republic, shortcomings were also found in the provision of disproportionately high advances for electricity and natural gas abstraction, shortcomings in public procurement and the management of state property when it was not sufficiently secured by its registration and the method of liquidation of unnecessary assets was not proven.
7. Internal control system
In the Czech Republic, an internal control system was introduced for SUZ on 1.7.2002, within the meaning of the provisions of Act No. 320/2001 Coll., on Financial Control, determining the competences of individual employees responsible for carrying out preliminary, ongoing and subsequent control.
At the same time, an internal audit system was put in place and an internal SUZ auditor was appointed.
Every year, SUZ is issued a plan of financial, socially and operationally technical inspections aimed at comprehensive verification of the management of state funds and property in individual asylum facilities managed by SUZ.
In 2002, 42 management checks were carried out and 54 were carried out in 2003.
In the Slovak Republic, the direct exercise of control activities in the departments and organizations of the Ministry of the Interior of the Slovak Republic in terms of compliance with generally binding legislation and internal regulations, the Úrad ensures the Minister's checks.
The audited period did not check the performance of tasks in the asylum policy section.
The internal control system of the MÚ is focused primarily on the implementation of preliminary and ongoing financial control under Act No 502/2001 Z. z., on financial control and vnútornom audite.
The performance of the financial control is also regulated by the internal regulations of the Director of the Ministry of Industry.
The substantive focus of the control activity as part of the management of individual departments was established within the framework of the annual plan of the Ministry of Industry.
Responsible for the exercise of control in this area were identified by trade union directors.
According to the written documentation submitted, deficiencies were not identified.
Since the Regulation of the Ministry of the Interior of the Slovak Republic No 28 of 23.4.2004, the Ministry of the Ministry of the Slovak Republic has been obliged to handle and investigate complaints under the Complaints Act.
In the near term, the organisational security of this task will need to be resolved.

Joint report on parallel expenditure controls on the construction of the motorway Prague – Dresden
Introductory word
Without the existence of trans-European transport networks, a modern, dynamic and, above all, united Europe would be difficult to imagine.
Quality transport networks are a prerequisite for maintaining and raising the standard of living of Europeans.
Creating conditions for fast, safe, reliable and cheap transport of people and costs is an important task for the state administration.
It is a very demanding task both in organizational and technical terms and financially.
European efforts at sustainable mobility often and hard to find compromises with Europe's interest in maintaining a healthy and human-friendly environment.
Construction of transport infrastructure, also thanks to the necessary measures in favour of the environment, are financially challenging.
Considerated procedures and decisions of the state administration in the preparation and acquisition of transport constructions can bring significant savings from public financial resources that can be used differently for the benefit of citizens.
One of the roles of the audit institutions is to actively seek out shortcomings that have led to less than achievable cost-effectiveness, efficiency and effectiveness of expenditure on transport infrastructure construction.
The audit institutions should not only alert the state administration to the shortcomings identified, but recommend measures that lead to an improvement in the situation, for the benefit of the citizens, for the benefit of Europe.
Short summary
The two highest audit institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as Germany and the Czech Republic) were carried out by the Bundesrechnungshof (BRH) and the Supreme Audit Office (SAO) in 2005 and 2006 parallel inspections of expenditure on the construction of the motorway Prague – Dresden (distance D 8 in the Czech Republic and motorway A 17 in Germany).
The highways are connected by a border bridge co-financed by both countries.
Thanks to cooperation with the SAO, BRH was able to carry out a thorough check on the efficiency of the funds spent on the construction of the border bridge.
On the basis of close cooperation with BRH, the SAO obtained the necessary data on the amount of German bridge and tunnel costs for comparative purposes.
The Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany concluded a contract for the construction of a border bridge in 2000.
According to the construction process, the completion date was eventually scheduled for the end of 2006.
During the award of the contract, however, the Road and Motorway Directorate of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the RMD) made mistakes that led to an extension of the duration of the competition and the reduction of the construction time.
The contract with the contractor was thus signed later than anticipated.
The contractor agreed to build the bridge in a shorter time and ensure its completion in 2006.
As a result, however, the RMD had to accept a significant increase in the price of the bridge.
As part of the joint inspection work, the prices of bridges on motorways D 8 and A 17 were compared on the basis of the conversion into m2 of the bridge structure area.
The statistical analysis of prices made it possible to identify bridges with high costs per m2 area.
Analysis revealed that the border bridge was the most expensive bridge in a group of large bridges with a length of over 100 metres.
The price increase could also be attributed to the delay that occurred during the procurement procedure.
When analysing the cost of building the tunnels, inspectors found that the prices of tunnels on the D 8 motorway were significantly higher than those of comparable tunnels in Germany.
BRH and the SAO now have a database of the prices of bridges and tunnels, on which they will be able to rely on for future checks on the effectiveness of the means used for transport infrastructure purposes.
For the construction of bridges, both control institutions recommend: standardization of bridge structures and the use of coupled steel-concrete and special structures only in cases where prestressed reinforced concrete bridges are not adequate.
One of the main hallmarks of the collaboration was her team spirit and informality.
During the parallel control, the auditors were involved in their specific knowledge and skills.
Introduction
This report reports on the progress and results of parallel checks on funds spent on the construction of the motorway connecting Dresden and Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and A 17 in Germany).
The checks focused on the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the expenditure incurred.
Parallel checks were carried out by BRH in Germany and the SAO in the Czech Republic.
Parallel checks took place in 2005 and 2006.
The SAO audited the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of spending of approximately CZK 20 billion including VAT (approximately €690 million) for the border section of the D 8 motorway, which has the figure 0807.
Of this amount, €64 million from European funds (ISPA) was planned to be used.
In addition to the parallel control carried out jointly with the SAO, BRH controlled the preparation and construction of the A 17 motorway in 2003 and 2005.
The funds spent on the construction of all three sections of the A 17 motorway amounted to around €670 million, of which €277 million will be co-financed by European funds (EFRE).
The highway from Prague to Dresden is part of the Trans-European Transport Corridor IV. Dresden – central and southern parts of Eastern Europe – Istanbul.
The D 8 motorway runs from Prague through Ústí nad Labem to the state border.
Highway A 17 runs from the state border of the Czech Republic/Germany to Dresden.
At the time of the inspection, border sections of both motorways were under construction.
These sections were put into operation on 21 December 2006.
On the German side, the motorway is completed all the way to Dresden, while it is not finished on the Czech side of the D 8 motorway, because the section no. 0805 of 16.4 km through the Bohemian Central Mountains between Řehlovice and Lovosice is still in the preparatory phase.
According to the plan, section No 0805 between Prague and Ústí nad Labem is to pass through the protected landscape area of the Czech Central Mountains.
According to forecasts made in the Czech Republic in 2001, there should be an operating intensity of 22,940 vehicles per day in 2008 on the border section No 0807 of the D 8 motorway.
According to German forecasts, the traffic intensity at the Czech border will total about 25,000 vehicles per day in 2010.
In 2000, Germany and the Czech Republic concluded the Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic on the interconnection of the German motorway A 17 and the Czech motorway D 8 on the common state border by building a border bridge.
Both states are involved in the construction of the bridge, so the inspection of the construction of this bridge was an important aspect of the parallel checks carried out by the two inspection institutions.
BRH and SAO cooperation
Since mid-2005, the two highest audit institutions have discussed close cooperation in controlling the construction of the motorway connecting Prague and Dresden.
The two sides had serious reasons for such cooperation:
1.
Germany is financially involved in the construction of the border bridge.
Its planning and construction rests with the RMD.
Therefore, BRH itself did not have the opportunity to carry out a check of this construction project.
2.
The SAO did not have the comparative database needed to assess whether the funds were used economically in terms of the overall level of costs for bridges and tunnels on D 8.
3.
The SAO needed to ensure the effectiveness of the expenditure, taking into account the main technical parameters of the motorway, in particular the arrangement of bridges and tunnels, which should allow the same quality of the journey on both sides of the border.
Following preparatory negotiations, the presidents of the two supreme audit institutions were signed on 4 January 2006 by the Coordinated Control Agreement on the D 8/A 17 motorway.
The joint working meetings of the BRH and SAO inspectors took place throughout 2006 at an interval of approximately six to eight weeks.
Current problems and tasks were addressed at the meetings, in particular the preparation of a uniform methodology for checking the prices of bridges and tunnels, the exchange of findings from the control of the border bridge construction and the preparation of joint reports.
An important sign of cooperation was the ongoing exchange of information.
While BRH carried out most of the work on comparing the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels and tender procedures, the SAO largely prepared a methodology for controlling the prices of bridges and tunnels.
The applicable legal rules for government control differ in both countries in the way control actions are closed.
For these reasons, the two highest audit institutions drew their own control conclusions on their findings, obtained during their inspections.
This report reflects the results achieved in parallel checks.
The cooperation will be completed by signing the final communiqué in the first half of 2007.
Construction of the border bridge
In the 2000 treaty, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed on a date for the completion of the construction of the border bridge, as far as possible, in 2005.
The two sides then agreed to postpone this deadline until the end of 2006.
The RMD was active as an investor.
Germany is financially involved in the construction of the bridge from 42.13%.
In the period up to 1999, the RMD proposed that the border bridge should have a prestressed reinforced concrete structure.
In 1999, in agreement with its partners in Germany, the RMD agreed to a coupled steel-concrete structure.
That decision was justified by a reduction in the number of double pillars from seven to five and the subsequent environmental benefits of such a solution to the valley.
In addition, the comparative calculations carried out by the RMD stated that the coupled steel-concrete structure should be a less expensive option.
But there was a mistake in the calculations.
They stated that the new coupled steel-conconcrete structure would be only 397 m long.
In fact, it's 5% longer.
During the award of the contract for the border bridge, the RMD made serious errors.
It has not prepared a custom dossier that adequately describes the assessment criteria and sub-criteria for comparing tenders.
This error led to the evaluation and evaluation of tenders and the Director-General evaluating the bids in a subjective and problematic manner.
The unsuccessful tenderer challenged the results of the contract procedure.
A subsequent investigation by the Office for the Protection of Competition resulted in the contract for the award of the construction contract being signed later than originally envisaged.
This meant that the 2004 summer construction season, after evaluating the bids, was wasted and the construction time was reduced.
The construction company agreed to build the bridge in a shorter period of time, but at the cost of a substantial increase in costs.
The offered procedure included a double assembly of the bridge superstructure, a change in the structure of the pillars and the establishment and equipment of the assembly space.
In addition, the construction company was unable to procure the originally designed type of steel within the necessary time.
The new type of steel – at a higher price by about €4 million, which had to be fully paid by the RMD – allowed for a reduction in the time to perform anti-corrosion protection, which in turn made it possible to reduce the overall construction time of the border bridge.
Compared to the net price of €18.3 million offered in the tender, the total cost of building the border bridge will increase considerably as a result of the accelerated procedure and other adjustments in funding.
The reduced time earmarked for construction work has led to a price increase of about €5.9 million.
Currently, the net cost amount is around €25.9 million, without taking into account automatic price increases (as of October 2006).
Comparison of prices of bridges and tunnels
The two highest control institutions carried out an analysis of the prices of bridges on motorways D 8 and A 17 in order to identify bridges whose price was too high and to compare the prices of bridges on the German and Czech sides.
The analysis was based on methods of mathematical statistics.
Furthermore, tunnels on the D 8 were compared with similar tunnels on motorways in Germany (A 71, A 38 and A 4).
There are no similar tunnels on the A 17 motorway.
In preparing this part of the check, it was important to accurately identify the relevant prices.
The two highest control institutions set the following principles for comparison of bridge prices: based on the actual price paid for the bridge without value added tax (VAT rates vary in the Czech Republic and SNR and are subject to change); disregard prices for special bridge foundations; rewrite prices in CZK at the rate of the European Central Bank valid as at 30 December 2005 (CZK 29 = € 1).
On both D 8 and A 17, there are bridges of various structures (steelo-concrete, prestressed reinforced concrete, coupled steel-concrete and steel) and various sizes.
In an effort to ensure the homogeneity of the structures studied, the bridges were divided into groups according to the type of structure.
Within these groups, the size of the bridge was also taken into account in the analyses.
By far the most common type of construction on both sides of the border were concrete bridges (20 bridges on D 8, 36 bridges on A 17).
The analysis focused primarily on this group of bridges, as the number of the set allowed the use of mathematical-statistical methods with a high degree of reliability of the results.
Checks found that prices per m 2 concrete bridges on both D 8 and A 17 depend on the size of the bridge (its length, area): the larger the bridge, the lower the price per m2 of the bridge structure.
For German bridges, the price dependence on size was stronger than for Czech bridges (see charts below).
Two concrete bridges on the A 17 and four on the D 8 have been identified, the price of which is significantly higher.
A method was used to locate these bridges to detect atypical values in a set of numbers and a regression analysis taking into account the dependence of the price of the bridge on its size (for the determination of atypically expensive bridges, the standard distance from the regression curve upwards was used).
However, information on the atypically high price of these bridges should only be seen as an indicator on which bridges need to be targeted.
In order to draw a generally applicable conclusion, the reasons for the high price should be analysed in each identified case.
One such cause may be inefficient administrative measures, or environmental protection requirements or any other acceptable reason.
In view of the fact that Czech concrete bridges are on average longer than the German ones (see table below), the proven negative dependence of the price of the bridge on its length could lead to the assumption that Czech bridges should be cheaper.
The lower prices of Czech concrete bridges are also supported by lower labour costs in the construction sector in the Czech Republic compared to Germany.
On the contrary, the results of the analysis show that the prices of concrete bridges on the D 8 are higher than on the A 17.
During the joint negotiations, two possible causes of this situation were identified:
1.
In Germany, most bridges are awarded as separate contracts.
Such an award allows small and medium-sized regional firms to participate in the competition for the contract.
In the Czech Republic, many bridges are awarded as part of a contract for part of the motorway route, which is several kilometres long.
Small and medium-sized companies do not participate in such a competition because the contract is too big for them.
2.
There is greater variability in bridge structures in the Czech Republic than in Germany.
In this context, the SAO found that the type of bridge structure was decided long before its construction.
The decision shall be taken at the time when the RMD is submitting an application for a zoning decision.
The RMD at this time selects types of bridges from multiple variants, but cost-effectiveness plays a minor role in decision-making.
A general conclusion on the prices of bridges in the Czech Republic and Germany could only be reached on the basis of a thorough analysis of the construction work market in both countries, which would, however, go beyond this control action.
The border bridge is the most expensive coupled steel-concrete bridge on D 8 and A 17.
In the case of tunnels, it was found that the prices of the tunnels on the D 8 were twice as high as the tunnels in Germany.
Comparing the main construction-technical parameters of the tunnels on the D 8 with the tunnels in Germany, however, showed no significant difference.
Significant price differences could be attributed to the fact that there is no real competition in the field of tunnel construction in the Czech Republic.
However, the small number of tunnels did not allow generally applicable conclusions to be drawn.
Effectiveness and efficiency of the construction of the Dresden motorway – Prague
The independent Czech Republic was established in 1993.
In the same year, the government approved the concept of developing the motorway network.
The D 8 motorway was to be gradually extended from Prague to the state border with Germany.
Section 0805 through the Czech Central Mountains was to be taken before the border section no. 0807.
The Czech Republic is acquiring the D 8 motorway as part of the programme financing.
In programme No 327 220 "Construction of the D 8 motorway Prague – Ústí nad Labem – state border of the Czech Republic/SRN" set two targets for the construction of the D 8 motorway:
1.
improving the connection between Prague and Ústí nad Labem – national objective;
2.
improve the connection between Prague and Berlin within the IV Trans-European Transport Corridor Berlin-Istanbul - international target.
According to the program, the construction of the section leading through the Czech Central Mountains was to be completed in June 2008 and the construction of the border section No 0807 in June 2007.
It should be added here that the completion date is not identical to the date of commissioning.
The SAO found that the preparation of the construction of the section leading through the Czech Central Mountains is now at the stage of an official zoning decision.
Environmental activists challenged that decision with legal actions.
The actions are not finally decided.
It cannot therefore be excluded that the section running through the Czech Central Mountains will be completed a few years later than stated in the programme documentation.
In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed postponing the completion date of section No 0805 to 2010.
As a result of these facts, the construction of the border section did not achieve a national goal – improving the connection between Prague and Ústí nad Labem.
The RMD made an estimate of capital expenditure for the border section D 8 No 0807 and section No 0805 via the Czech Central Mountains in 1999-2001.
The estimate for this capital expenditure of the included investment costs is about €639 million combined for both sections 0805 and 0807.
Table 2: Economic assessment results (EIRR = internal rate of return)
All the highways and expressways under consideration opened, both sections of the D 8 opened in 2007.
On the northern part of the border section, the traffic intensity of 18,000 vehicles per day in 2010
All the highways and expressways under consideration opened, both sections of the D 8 opened in 2007.
On the northern part of the border section, the traffic intensity of 22,000 vehicles per day in 2010
All the highways and expressways under consideration opened, both sections of the D 8 opened in 2007.
On the northern part of the border section, the traffic intensity of 25,000 vehicles per day in 2010
The economic analysis carried out in 2001 was based on the assumption that the border section and section through the Czech Central Mountains would be completed in time.
At the time of the inspection, however, it is clear that the section through the Czech Central Mountains will not be opened at the original date.
This will reduce the above EIRR values.
The cost of both sections excluding VAT, calculated as at 31 December 2005, was € 897 million, or 27,4 % higher than the cost level with which the 2001 economic analysis worked.
But there is a risk that section 0805 will be conducted in a different, more costly route, which would affect the aforementioned line of economic viability.
Economic analysis showed that the construction of both sections of the motorway is economically viable at least 18,000 vehicles per day in 2010.
The forecast for 2008 was 22,940 vehicles, but a study addressing the issue of itineraries for the missing section through the Czech Central Mountains envisages an intensity of 12,600 to 13,750 vehicles per day, pushing the investment below the economic viability threshold.
With a higher load of itineraries for the missing section through the Czech Central Mountains, there is a high probability of congestion and thus an increase in external costs, which were not foreseen in the original economic analysis.
The aforementioned reduction in revenues and cost increases means that the already low EIRR that the construction of the border section D 8 was not to be achieved.
Construction of the D 8 border section is therefore inefficient.
Also in the construction of the A 17 motorway, there was a similar cost overrucy as in the case of these two sections on D 8.
As part of the overall economic assessment of the federal road development plan for long-distance transport for 1992, the Federal Ministry of Transport of Germany envisaged a cost of about €320 million.
The resulting cost-to-income ratio was 4.6.
In the meantime, however, costs have soared to about €670 million, and the cost-benefit ratio has more than halved.
In addition to the parallel control carried out jointly with the SAO, the BRH audited the preparation and construction of the A 17 motorway in 2003 and 2005.
In doing so, BRH found that the competent approval state authority had requested an off-road tunnel for Section A-17, which was not needed.
During the inspection, BRH managed to convince the Federal Ministry and the German Road Construction Administration that the tunnel was not necessary.
The result was savings, which amounted to roughly €10 million and €0.15 million in annual operating costs alone.
When assessing the first Section A 17 BRH, BRH found that the construction project was not properly prepared.
This is illustrated by the following example:
At the preparatory stage, the Road Construction Administration did not investigate the conditions of the bedrock in the rocks of Dölzschen because the site was difficult to access.
This was done only after the tunnel stamping machine hit a rock.
Tests showed that the rocks inside were more weathered than anticipated during the selection process.
Therefore, costly measures such as anchoring, injection and protective net against stone falling had to be taken, which required about €3.3 million.
The Roads and Motorways Directorate had to bear the costs not only of other emergency operations, such as security measures in the rocks of Dölzschen, but also for measures that would not have been needed if the construction project had been properly prepared first.
Expenditure of this kind includes the costs associated with the interruption of construction operations (€3.2 million), further training of drilling workers (€0.5 million) and rising wages and expenditure on goods as a result of exceeding the duration of the project (€7 million).
The cost overruns thus amounted to around €10.7 million, which was not matched by any added value.
Following the lessons learned from these and other audited projects, BRH asked the Federal Ministry to apply stricter management in its oversight of road construction work.
The Federal Ministry should give the Road and Motorway Directorate the necessary incentive to implement quality assurance systems.
Benefits of cooperation for BRH and SAO Cooperation fulfilled the intention of both audit institutions.
BRH gained control knowledge of the preparation, assignment and course of the construction of the border bridge.
The two highest control institutions have built a database of the prices of bridges and tunnels, on which future controls will be able to rely.
The SAO found that the main construction-technical parameters of bridges, tunnels and the route of the D 8 motorway are no different from the A 17 parameters.
The inspectors of the two institutions involved in the cooperation have gained new experience, which they can use for further inspections.

Coordinated control of funds earmarked for financing projects carried out under the Operational Programme for Cross-Border Cooperation Czech Republic - Republic of Poland 2007-2013
INTRODUCTION
The emerging community of the people of Europe is the driving force behind cross-border cooperation as an integral part of the wider territorial cooperation that has been part of our lives for the last 20 years.
So let this community give the opening statement on this joint report by the two highest control institutions of neighbouring countries:
"185 million EU citizens (37% of the population) live in border areas.
These areas are usually underdeveloped and peripheral territories, often remnants of darker parts of Europe's history.
The main objective of cross-border cooperation is to help mitigate the existence of borders as administrative, legal and physical barriers, and to further facilitate the development of the dormant potential of border regions.
The programmes cover different border regions: some cover coastal areas, other inland borders within the EU or borders shared with candidate countries.
Most of the programs are bilateral, but some include more than two neighbouring countries."
The programmes last for seven years and a total of EUR 5.7 billion is earmarked for them from the EU budget.
"The programmes include the following activities: repair and reconstruction of cross-border roads, cycling trails and bridges, investments in cross-border waste management systems, health facilities, research centres, flood control measures, etc., joint management of natural sites or the development of tourist destinations, development of common services for the local population, advice on employment issues, the creation of thematic networks and clusters for innovation.
Support from the programme is provided on condition that organisations from both sides of the border (such as regional authorities, universities or SMEs) come together to implement projects based on the needs of the border region.
Representatives of cooperating regions, relevant ministries and other local partners meet regularly and decide which projects to be supported.
This system should lead to a sustainable form of cooperation even after the programme itself has ended.
The funds shall be provided on condition that the project partners from both sides of the border cooperate in a way that fulfils at least two of the following four characteristics: joint preparation, joint implementation, joint staff, joint funding."
Within the framework of the partnership, the tasks and responsibilities for the preparation, implementation, funding and control of the activities of the project are clearly defined and distributed to the relevant partners.
The main attributes of the partnership include: joint choice of management partner, joint project preparation and application, conclusion of a joint partnership agreement signed by all partners, assuming overall responsibility for the implementation of the project by the lead partner, the overall support payments are accepted by the lead partner and carry out their transfer to the relevant project partners.
Eligible projects carried out on the territory of the regions and voivodeships adjacent to the common border may be supported.
OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE CONTROL
On 11 December 2007, the European Commission (EC) approved the Operational Programme of Cross-Border Cooperation Czech Republic – Republic of Poland 2007-2013 (OPPS ČR-POL).
The implementation of the operational programme was allocated €258,187,467.
The total sum included a contribution from European funds (ERDF) totalling €219,459,344 (85%), which must be exhausted by the end of 2015.
Financial data on the use of EU funds from the Operational Programme for Cross-Border Cooperation The Czech Republic - Republic of Poland 2007-2013 at the end of 2013 is presented in the following table:
The agreement on cooperation between the Supreme Audit Institutions of the Czech Republic (SAO) and the Republic of Poland (NIK) was concluded by the presidents of both offices on 27 February 2013 following previous mutual negotiations at the meetings of the heads of the Supreme Audit Institutions of the Visegrad Four, Austria and Slovenia, held in Lovasberény, Hungary, in September 2012.
The aim of the cooperation was to examine whether the implementation of the operational programme is carried out in accordance with the legislation and with binding programming documents or agreements, whether the management and control system operates reliably, whether the objectives of the operational programme are being achieved and that the selected projects are implemented in accordance with the specified conditions of the support provided.
This cooperation took the form of a parallel check, in which the control authorities, on the basis of their statutory mandate, independently examined topics the content of which had been jointly discussed in advance.

The inspection carried out also contained elements of a performance audit.
Selected topics were examined on a sample of projects for project partners on both sides of the border.
The results of the checks carried out were the audit findings published in the usual manner by both authorities.
On the basis of the two control conclusions set out in the Annex, this Joint Report was drawn up.
The joint control sample selected included six projects (Annex 1) which fall within the area of aid 1.1 - Strengthening transport accessibility and support area 2.2 - Promoting the development of tourism.
Prior to the start of the audit, the absorption of funds from these two areas of support accounted for more than 60% of the funds reimbursed to beneficiaries by the end of 2012 for all projects carried out throughout the OPPS CR-POL.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In addition to controlling a joint sample of six projects, the SAO audited another 13 projects and NIK two others (all in the area of support 1.1 and 2.2).
The funds paid to the beneficiaries of the ERDF aid, which were audited by the SAO and the NIK, totalled EUR 25 362 174 (SAO) and EUR 8 450 784 (NIK).
The audited volume of appropriations represented 41 % of all funds paid to beneficiaries of aid from aid areas 1.1 and 2.2.
MAIN CONCLUSION CONCLUSIONS
Both inspections independently carried out by the SAO on the Czech side and NIK on the Polish side showed that the level of irregularities identified did not exceed the level of significance.
The implementation of the OPPS ČR-POL, including the functioning of the management and control system and the implementation of selected projects, was successful.
The audited persons who were part of the management and control system have taken steps to limit the risk of misuse of funds and the non-use of ERDF funds provided.
Evidence of the effectiveness of the implemented projects under the operational programme is a high level of achievement of the objectives set, which was also supported by the results of the survey of the societal evaluation of project implementation.
SUMMARY OF RESULTS OF CONTROLS
A. Evaluation of the control and control system
The coordinated approach made it possible to carry out a check of the management and control system of the OPPS ČR-POL implemented by the following institutions in both countries: the managing authority (Ministry for Regional Development of the Czech Republic), the National Coordinator (Ministry for Regional Development POL) and Controllers (Centre for Regional Development and Voivodeship).
At the same time, the coordinated audit made it possible to evaluate the tasks and functions carried out by the Joint Technical Secretariat and the Monitoring Committee.
During the evaluation of the management system, the audit focused on the activities carried out in connection with the setting and performance of the function of the managing authority and the national coordinator, in particular in the context of setting the objectives of the programme and monitoring of the progress achieved, evaluation activities and annual reports, assessment, evaluation, selection and approval of project applications, the absorption of the programme funds and the fulfilment of the obligation to publish correct, complete and up-to-date information on subsidies, as well as the control activities of the managing authority, setting up the performance of activities and outputs from audits of the entrusted audit entity and with the system of reporting and monitoring of irregularities and its compliance, at the same time, the coordination of tasks and cooperation between the institutions involved in the CRL.
Furthermore, the activities of the competent authorities in the area of risk analysis and the drawing up of project implementation control plans were examined and the evaluation of project applications carried out by independent evaluators was assessed.
The examination of the control system included a review of administrative and on-the-spot checks, which allowed the approval of, for example, the supply of goods and co-financed services, the eligibility of expenditure submitted for reimbursement, while the compliance of the disbursement of these funds and related activities (or parts thereof) with EU national and EU legislation.
Significant deficiencies were identified by the SAO's audit in the area of publication of correct, complete and up-to-date information on the subsidies provided.
In the area of evaluation and approval of projects, the risk of non-transparency of this process has been identified.
Other deficiencies were identified in the area of setting up monitoring indicators and setting up the irregularity reporting system.
Based on these findings, the Supreme Audit Office assessed the control and control system implemented by the managing authority as partially effective.
The irregularities identified by the NEV relating to the functioning of the management and control system in Poland in relation to violations of existing laws and rules have not been assessed as significant.
These discrepancies had an impact only on individual projects and did not have a significant impact on the implementation of the entire OPPS CR-POL.
Despite the identified discrepancies, NIK assessed the functioning of the system positively.
B. Evaluation of project results
The audit did not show a contradiction between the indicators and the objectives set for each project and those defined by the operational programme.
The expected results were achieved in all projects audited, the funded activities were carried out and the indicators (measurable parameters) set out in the project applications of the operational programme were met.
The audit conclusions are in line with the result of the survey of the societal evaluation of the implementation of the projects described below in the text.
An important aspect that the SAO and the NIK have paid attention to in their conclusions is the limited possibility of objective evaluation of the fulfilment of the projected results of individual projects with regard to the objectives of individual projects and at the same time the objectives of the whole operational programme.
At the initiative of the Supreme Audit Chamber, a poll conducted in the summer of 2013 at the site of the implementation of projects selected for the joint control sample.
The survey and its evaluation were carried out by the School of Higher Vocational Education in Nysa (Poland).
In agreement with the Supreme Audit Office, the investigation was carried out on both sides of the border between 2,820 respondents, both with the public in Poland in relation to a part of the project carried out by Polish project partners and with the Czech public in relation to a part of the project carried out in the Czech Republic.
The survey mainly concerned the appropriateness, quality, exchange of information, use of funds and the societal function of projects, including investments made.
The number of respondents for individual projects is given in Annex 2.
The assessment of the responses from the survey indicated that the overall societal evaluation of the projects was good and reached 4.8 points (on a scale with a maximum of 8 points), meaning that the results of the projects were positively perceived by the majority of respondents both with regard to the objectives and other parameters mentioned in the project applications.
According to respondents, the projects examined fulfilled the criteria expressed in the operational programme.
Respondents also noted the positive impact of investments on improving the quality of transport and tourism infrastructure, transport accessibility, tourist attractiveness, business conditions, quality of life of citizens and restoring contacts between residents of the border region.
On the other hand, the overall assessment of the responses indicated a certain difference between the actual level of achievement of the objectives/parameters (actual impact rate) and the level of the expected respondents.
This difference applies to the evaluation of the results of individual projects, where in some cases there is a significant difference.
The results of the survey were in line with the views of participants in panel discussions (target groups) carried out under the NIK control on the Polish side, who pointed to the need for project implementation and confirmed their positive public acceptance and the fulfilment of expected results.
C. Evaluation of the legality of the projects audited
For the beneficiaries of the aid, the compliance of the project with the timetable and content of the project application was examined, the fulfilment of the stated objectives and purpose of the project, the fulfilment of binding monitoring indicators, the management of changes in projects, the handling of any project revenue, the fulfilment of the obligation of separate accounting records of project transactions, compliance with the ban on the financing of projects from other EU sources, the implementation of the project partnership and compliance with its conditions, the fulfilment of mandatory publicity concerning in particular the dissemination of awareness of the sources of financing of projects from the EU, compliance with the eligibility conditions of project expenditure, the collection of suppliers and the verification of deliverables on the basis of public contracts awarded.
The total financial value of shortcomings by qualified SAO and NIK as ineligible for EU funding was estimated at €85 094.
However, this amount did not exceed the specified level of materiality relating to the total controlled volume of appropriations for the sample of projects.
Despite the discrepancies found, the SAO and NIK evaluated the implementation of selected projects positively by the beneficiaries of the aid.
In most cases, the commitments resulting from the conditions of the aid were duly fulfilled by the beneficiary.
The funds earmarked for the implementation of the audited projects were spent in accordance with EU and national law regulations.
Nevertheless, seven of the eight beneficiaries audited by NEVs were found to have irregularities in the implementation of in-kind and financial obligations.
These were individual cases of non-systemic nature and concerned, in particular, inconsistent preparation of project documentation and breach of public procurement rules, which did not have an impact on the choice of supplier or the supply of contractually agreed works.
Only in one of all NIK-controlled projects can the irregularity found, relating to non-compliance with reporting obligations, be assessed as ineligible expenditure, amounting to PLN 43 003 (of which €8,231 financed by the ERDF).
On the other side of the border, the SAO identified ineligible expenditure of CZK 2 098 053 in three of the 19 audited projects (of which €76,863 financed by the ERDF).
Irregularities included non-delivery of paid material and work or expenditure for the modernisation of a property owned by a person who had no link to the project either as a beneficiary of the aid or as a project partner.
RECOMMENDATIONS
The joint recommendation of the SAO and the NIK concerns the improvement of the monitoring system in particular with regard to the consistent setting of proper monitoring indicators for all specific objectives of the priority axis of the operational programme.
In general, efforts must also be made to identify such indicators at both programme and project level, which will allow for a more reliable verification of the implementation of the identified impacts.
Notes and recommendations resulting from the checks carried out on both sides of the border are included in the separate control conclusions of the SAO and the NIK on CDs.

Procurement of public works contracts and the prevention of corruption
Joint Parallel Control Report by the Czech Supreme Audit Office (SAO) and the German Federal Court of Auditors (BRH)
Introduction and overview
Public procurement of goods and services by contracting authorities is very important for both the state and private spheres.
The role of the state is to use public resources as efficiently and economically as possible and to ensure fair and regulated free competition.
In the European Union (EU), public procurement is a key factor in the success of the Single Economic Area.
In its rules, the EU has set limits whereby the contracting authority must comply with certain requirements to guarantee a broad and unlimited competitive environment across the EU.
EU Member States must therefore transpose European procurement law into their national legislation and put it into practice.
Both the Czech Republic and Germany have already done so.
For public procurement that are values below EU limits, regulation of their procurement remains within the remit of individual countries.
Moreover, public procurement is prone to corruption with the consequent high potential for damage.
Therefore, contracting entities are obliged to take reasonable measures in their procurement procedures to prevent corruption and incorrect favouritism (prevention of corruption).
In January 2011, the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (Czech SAI - SAO) and the Federal Court of Auditors of Germany (German SAI - BRH) agreed to carry out parallel checks on procurement procedures and the prevention of corruption in land and transport constructions.
Cooperation was also focused on the area of European procurement law as transposed into national legislation.
The checks included procurement below European limits in order to penalise the area of corruption prevention.
The audit findings of the two supreme audit institutions are summarised in a joint report, which is addressed, inter alia, to international organisations such as the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).
Control areas and audited institutions
The BRH assessment is based on blanket checks of the aforementioned areas carried out on German building administrations responsible for federal transport and land constructions between 2011 and 2012.
For example, highway construction and large-scale building projects were evaluated.
BRH included findings from past inspections in the evaluation.
The SAO evaluation is based on inspections carried out during the years 2008 to 2012, which focused on construction of roads, railway lines, water projects, large buildings (hospitals, cultural facilities, universities) and some other buildings in the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the award of federal public contracts is mostly carried out by the provincial construction administrations.
In the Czech Republic, public procurement in the area of transport infrastructure is the responsibility of state institutions for road and railway construction.
In the field of building construction, public procurement is carried out by beneficiaries of budget funds.
In both countries, the services of external experts are also used at the various stages of the procurement procedure.
The evaluation must take into account differences in public procurement legislation and the specificities of the construction market in both countries.
Structure of the Public Procurement Act in both countries
In Germany, the conduct of European procurement procedures is governed by laws and subordinate standards.
Procurement procedures limited to Germany are governed by budgetary law and the relevant administrative acts .
Internal administrative rules contain numerous additional provisions for both European and national procurement procedures.
Further details on the requirements of European procurement law and the prevention of corruption are enshrined in the so-called federal government tender manuals, in which the requirements are elaborated or formulated in greater detail with regard to legal precedents in the area of procurement law.
In the Czech Republic, public procurement is governed by the Public Procurement Act and other legislation relating to contracts with value above and below European limits.
The terms of reference were made to substantial changes in 2012.
The new rules have strengthened the transparency of procurement procedures, opened up room for more competition and reduced opportunities for corruption during the procurement procedure.
Basic aspects of procurement law in both countries
As regards European procurement procedures, open and narrower procedures in particular need to be applied in both countries.
In Germany, contracts below the European limit are awarded in accordance with national regulations (public call for competition, limited call for participation, negotiated procedure), but these are virtually identical to the above conditions for the European procurement procedure.
Public procurement in Germany is characterised by the principle of preference for open procedures (where candidates on a European scale are invited) and public calls for participation (only in the case of national procedures).
In open procedures and when calling for competition, any bidder may submit an offer.
Another important feature of German procurement law is the support of small and medium-sized firms.
This is achieved primarily by splitting the overall public contract into commercially specific parts and dividing into sub-contracts.
The award of contracts divided into these parts gives the opportunity to participate in the proceedings as many candidates as possible.
The two characteristics of German procurement law are time-tested instruments for obtaining good value for money.
In Germany, more than 330,000 construction companies are registered with 1.9 million employees.
In the Czech Republic, the conditions of European procedures must be applied even in cases of public procurement with a value below the EU limit.
The exception is a simplified sub-prime procedure where the contracting authority can use less demanding procedures.
In accordance with European law, Czech procurement law includes the conditions under which the contract must be awarded in order to ensure competition and achieve a favourable price.
The current Czech legislation allows contracting authorities to choose between open management and closer management.
85,000 construction companies are registered in the Czech Republic, of which about 1,900 have 20 or more employees.
Total number of contracting authorities for public works and share of individual types of procedure in both countries
In 2011, the total volume of construction work in Germany amounted to 7 675 billion.
Of which CZK 1,138 billion (15%) was the share of public contracts, which, in addition to contracts awarded by the federal government, included contracts awarded by individual Länder and municipalities.
The total volume of projects of the federal road and earthworks (without the construction of railways and water constructions) amounted to CZK 212.5 billion.
In 2011, the composition of federal contracts for land works and transport works was as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public calls; 12.7% closer management and narrower calls;
6.6% of the negotiated procedure and direct procurement; 33.2% is the share of European procurement procedures.
The volume of public construction contracts in the Czech Republic in 2011 reached CZK 118.6 billion , which was about 25% of the total volume of all construction works.
In 2009, it reached CZK 194.0 billion, which was 37% of the total.
Structure of procurement types in 2011: 65.1% open procedure; 14.3% narrower procedure; 9.5% negotiated procedure; 8.4% simplified procedures for sub-prime contracts; 2.7% other procedures.
The figures include all public supply, service and works contracts awarded by contracting authorities in 2011.
These figures show that: parallel controls in both countries have been targeted at a substantial part of public procurement procedures; the prevention of corruption, which must still be taken into account in procurement procedures, has a significant financial impact; open relevance. procurement procedures are of key importance.
Summary of the main results
The SAO and BRH carried out parallel controls on the award of European works contracts, with an emphasis on the prevention of corruption in their countries.
The checks focused on comparing the legislation in both countries and the EU and on the implementation of public procurement in the field of land and transport construction.
The key findings are also provided:
The EU Public Procurement Directive has been transposed into the national rights of both countries (points 1 and 3.1).
Preventing corruption is not only the aim of the EU directive, but of the national procurement rules of the two countries, which differ in part in terms of focus and in detail.
In both countries, the essential requirement to comply with the tender documents is the inclusion of all the information needed to prepare tenders.
The specification shall be neutral and shall not contain any requirements restricting competition.
The tender documents in Germany generally meet these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, the problem is the lack of definition of the subject of the contract.
In Germany, a division of contracts is required into parts where it is only possible in order to promote a competitive environment.
According to BRH's findings, this requirement is respected in Germany.
The SAO's inspections showed that significant heavy public works in the field of road construction are commissioned in the Czech Republic without being divided into parts or divided into parts, but only into a very significant volume. This method can distort competition and lead to restrictions on only a few large companies.
These limitations on market potential can result in significant cost increases and give rise to the risk of non-serious price negotiations and inadmissible conventions.
The legislation in both countries allows contracting authorities, under certain conditions, to retrospectively outsource further works if this need arises after the conclusion of the contract (point 4.1).
In both countries, the requirements for the correct determination of the type of procurement procedure are met.
In the Czech Republic, under the applicable regulations, contracting entities can freely designate one of the open procurement procedures, namely an open procedure or a narrower procedure.
German regulations in tendering and budgetary law enshrine the primacy of open procedures for both European tenders and national ones, known as public calls for competition.
Open procurement procedures in both countries allow a larger range of bidders to submit a bid and also reduce the risk of corruption because they make it difficult to negotiate prices illegally between bidders.
At the same time, the best results in value for money are achieved.
In the case of large contracts whose projected total price is or exceeds the limits set by the EU, the audited contracting entities have always tendered a European procurement procedure.
In determining the type of procurement procedure, the correct determination of the estimated value of the contract plays a very important role.
In Germany, databases are used to objectively determine the price of public works, in which the values are based on completed construction projects.
This is an objective enough tool.
In the Czech Republic, databases are used only in the area of road construction, but they are not yet an effective tool (point 4.2).
When awarding a works contract according to European procurement procedures, it is necessary to publish preliminary information and notice of the initiation of a procurement procedure, in order to strengthen competition by allowing interested parties to prepare in a timely manner for the submission of tenders.
As a rule, the construction authorities audited complied with this requirement.
In isolated cases, errors in the information released, incorrect application of provisions and/or a lack of controls may have impaired competition (item 4.3).
When selecting candidates to participate in a narrower procurement procedure, there is a greater risk of manipulation.
Under EU law, the number of candidates invited must be high enough to guarantee real competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, non-discriminatory and published well in advance.
Beyond EU requirements, contracting authorities in both countries should, as often as possible, rotate candidates who call for participation in the procedure when selecting suppliers.
In Germany, there are partly very detailed requirements to prevent the risks of manipulation.
In some cases, the audited contracting entities did not comply with these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, selection decisions were not always credible (point 4.4).
In both countries, contracting entities must ensure during the procurement procedure that all candidates wishing to submit a tender receive the same information.
Any agreements between those candidates and between them and third parties involved in the preparation of the specifications must, as far as possible, be prevented in order to avoid restricting competition in the form of unlawful agreements.
In Germany, the measures are more thorough than in the Czech Republic.
However, the audited German contracting entities did not meet the requirement in several cases (paragraph 4.5).
In both countries, the principle of cross-checking and transparency must be applied when opening envelopes.
The labelling, documentation, protection and confidentiality requirements are intended to limit the scope for manipulation and are particularly detailed in Germany.
Checks in both countries found only a few cases of irregularities (point 4.6).
The assessment and evaluation of bids is procedurally regulated in both countries.
The relevant German measures are more complex, but it has not always been respected by the audited contracting authorities.
For example, contracting entities forwarded their bids to third parties for consultation without their prior assessment, without properly documenting any suspicious circumstances.
The offers were thus insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulations (point 4.7).
Participants must be concerned about the intended award of the contract for legal protection enterprises are to be informed about the intended contract award before the latter is finalised.
This legal protection rule also is designed to prevent corruptive action.
The law of the Czech Republic provides for judicial review of contract award procedures also for national tenders.
Only in few cases, the notification of the enterprises was not appropriately ensured (item 4.8).
The procurement procedure documentation was not always complete or entirely credible for the audited contracting entities in both countries.
In the case of several procurement procedures, the transparency requirements applied at European level have not always been properly complied with in the minutes of the procedure.
In addition, some identified deficiencies reduced the preventive anti-corruption function of the dossier.
Contracting entities in both countries mostly fulfilled their reporting obligations (point 4.9).
Summary of the guiding principles of European procurement law and corruption prevention
European Award law
In order to ensure free competition in the EU, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have adopted, inter alia, a Directive on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts in order to ensure the free movement of goods and services and the Directive on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the award of public supply contracts and public works contracts (Right Procedures Directive), the two Directives being transposed into national law.
The EU's general procurement principles include in particular: a requirement for a competitive environment; a requirement for equal treatment or non-discrimination; a requirement for transparency.
EU procurement principles include the Directive on the Coordination of Public Procurement Procedures, in addition, includes provisions relating to construction projects with a total estimated value of more than €5 million.
These provisions affect: the content of the procurement documents; the type of procurement procedure used; the publication of certain information before, during and after the end of the procedure; compliance with the deadline for receipt of tenders; the qualification requirements that may be required of tenderers; the criteria for selecting the most appropriate tender.
The legal protection of candidates is governed by the Review Procedures Directive.
In the event of a potential breach of contract law, tenderers may have the contracting authority's decision reviewed in accordance with the review procedures.
Both countries transposed EU requirements into national legislation.
Prevention of corruption
Importance of corruption prevention
In none of the two countries, there is no legal definition of what corruption actually means.
In general, corruption is seen as an abuse of a personal (confidential) position for one's own benefit.
As a rule, this means that such misuse is encouraged by those who benefit.
Corruption can be a barrier to competition and can cause serious economic losses.
It is estimated that the total damage related to corruption amounts to 5% of the world's economic output.
For the EU area, these costs are estimated at 1% of the EU's economic performance.
Where a contracting authority is involved, conventions restricting competition or allowing dishonest conduct may weaken confidence in the integrity, ability and overall work of the public administration.
Therefore, the prevention of corruption is an essential task for contracting authorities.
Both practice and procedures must be controlled, in particular, in areas particularly susceptible to corruption, in order to take adequate measures to prevent it.
Adopting preventive measures and carrying out effective controls can substantially reduce the susceptibility of the decision-making process to corruption.
As a rule, the award of works contracts is considered to be particularly susceptible to corruption.
Measures on the prevention of corruption
In Germany, corruption is prosecutable under criminal and labour law, which mainly concerns active and passive bribery, acceptance and offering significant benefits.
The German federal government has issued a manual with recommendations on the prevention of corruption in federal administration and according to which the following principles are applied throughout the procurement process beyond risk analysis: priority of open procurement; principle of multiple control and transparent decision-making; separation of planning, procurement and accounting phases; accurate and complete documentation of the procurement procedure.
Moreover, other measures having preventive influence against corruption have become part of the right to tender.
In 2011, the relevant Federal Ministry of Information Technology introduced a system to monitor the procurement of federal roads.
Using this system, data such as estimated costs, the total value of the contract and the involvement of private design offices can be fully recorded and analysed in order to identify any irregularities.
In the Czech Republic, corruption is being prosecuted under criminal law, and the level of labour or civil law is also possible.
The statutory requirement for transparency, equal treatment and prohibition of any discrimination throughout the procurement process (preparation and implementation) is the most important part of corruption prevention.
Anti-corruption measures in this area were established by the government in the "Government Strategy to Fight Corruption for the period 2011 to 2012" which was updated for 2013 and 2014.
Part of these measures were incorporated into the Public Procurement Act and the follow-up implementing regulations.
The new legislation contains the following basic provisions: lowering the limits for small-scale contracts; the obligation of prior notice by the contracting authority, including the justification of the contract; the prohibition on limiting the number of tenderers in a narrower procedure and the abolition of the general possibility to limit the number of tenderers by drawing lots; the obligation to publish contracts including annexes; the obligation to publish actual and lists of subcontractors.
Results of checks relating to subsequent stages of the procurement procedure
Procurement documentation
The tender documents must contain all the information necessary to enable tenderers to prepare their bids in due form.
In particular, the documentation must allow the bidding price to be processed.
For this to be possible, candidates must not be exposed to risks they could not count on.
The tender documents contain, in particular, specifications, as well as the requirements for proving the qualifications of the tenderers and the criteria for selecting the most advantageous tender.
Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption
In particular, European law contains requirements relating to technical specifications.
The specifications must limit competition to the least extent possible and all candidates must have equal access to them.
The specification shall be neutral.
Requirements for specific products are permissible on a very limited scale in the tender documents.
The basic principle of preventing corruption is that the tender documents do not contain requirements that could restrict competition.
Furthermore, the documentation should avoid confusion or inaccurate data that create room for speculation and manipulation in the evaluation of tenders.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
Both countries have transposed EU legal provisions into their national legislation.
The basic principle is that the specifications are generally stated without reference to a specific product or brand.
The specifications shall specify the required supplies and services and detail the number of units of work and supply.
In normal cases, prices should be quoted according to works or supply units (e.g. in CZK/m or in CZK/item).
Defining the required work in terms of their functionality is only permissible in exceptional cases.
In principle, the rule is that the specifications need to be developed in full and unambiguous way.
They must contain exact quantities and must not include works and supplies, the necessity of which is not entirely clear.
Reimbursement in the form of lump sums or according to time worked must be avoided where possible.
These parts of the tender documents must exclude speculation and manipulation, based on ambiguous specifications.
The specifications must allow each tenderer to prepare their offer with certainty and without excessive preparatory work.
The invitation to tender must only be made public when the tender documents are complete.
Different provisions
In the Czech Republic, there is no obligation for subpoena to award construction contracts in parts.
A contracting authority may divide the contract into several separate parts if the nature of the subject-matter of such a contract so permits.
In Germany, the application of the rule is required to divide construction work into parts, either quantitatively (partial deliveries) or according to specific aspects (specialised part of the contract).
This allows participation in competition to small and medium-sized entities, increases the number of potential bidders and makes price fixing more difficult.
This type of input is usually considered to be the most appropriate in terms of providing value for money.
In the Czech Republic, the tender documents must include evaluation criteria in national and European procurement procedures.
This should inform the tenderer comprehensively and exhaustively of the criteria by which its tender will be assessed.
In Germany, the requirement to indicate the evaluation criteria in the notice applies only to European calls for tenders.
In national procurement procedures, it is necessary to include evaluation criteria only in the contract record, which is an internal administrative document.
If the tender documents are prepared by authorised independent experts, German regulations require the exclusion from it of any information that would help identify specific interested firms, architects or designers.
The reason is to prevent individual construction firms from obtaining any additional information or other inadmissible competitive advantages without the satisfaction of the contracting authority through contacts with these independent experts.
This is also why independent experts are not allowed to publish tender documents and allow them to be accessed for vetting.
The contracting authority is the only contact point for construction companies.
The Czech Republic does not currently have a similar provision.
In the case of large construction projects, there is almost always a need for additional work or modification of existing works after the conclusion of the original contract.
The legislation of both countries allows a multi-works contract to be awarded to the same contractor within a certain limit, without the need to publish and carry out a new procurement procedure.
The volume of additional works under both European and German legislation may not exceed 50% of the original value of the contract.
In addition, additional work must be necessary and must be in the nature of a specific component of the main contract.
In the Czech Republic, a stricter limit of 20% is applied to award additional works.
This may risk a greater time delay in the execution of the contract and the possible integration of the new entity into the project already running.
Where a multi-works contract is awarded to the supplier of the original contract, German law contains a provision which prevents suppliers from arbitrarily increasing the price of modified works or multi-works.
Calculations must be made taking into account the prices agreed in the original contract.
In addition to extra work, there may be less work during construction, i.e. works that were not needed.
In the Czech Republic, less work and extra work cannot be compensated for each other.
Main control findings
BHR
Technical specifications and product-neutral invitation to tender
In rare cases, the specifications referred to national technical requirements or standards, but these have been replaced in the meantime by EU standards.
In some cases, the specifications contained data requiring a trade mark, e.g. for a system of resilience of public inscriptions, for preventing water penetration or for noise-cancelling, although this was not needed.
In some cases, the specifications were so detailed that only one product met the requirements.
Quantity specifications broken down into items
Even in a single case of scrutiny of procurement procedures, the BRH did not record non-compliance with the general requirements for the invitation to tender for supplies and services according to the quantitative specifications divided into items.
Completeness of specifications
In most of the cases audited, the tender documents were fully drawn up before the call for tenders was announced.
However, in various cases, documents had to be modified during the procurement procedure when changes in the items or timetable had to be taken into account.
In rare cases, it contained the tender documents for the work and supplies, the need for which was uncertain.
One tender dossier for demolition work contained almost exclusively such items.
Contract splitting and award criteria
In many cases, the required justification for not dividing deliveries into parts has not been demonstrated.
For the evaluation criteria for tenders prior to the award of the contract, BRH found no shortcomings.
Include the names of authorised independent experts
Many of the documents featured interested authorized experts.
Names were listed on the opening pages of documents or on plans or attached opinions.
In one case, the contracting authority even invited tenderers to contact the explicitly appointed architect with their questions on the tendering procedure.
For building projects, these cases were found mainly in the case of tender documents, where self-employed professionals were responsible for processing the specifications.
The contracting authorities said they did not have sufficient staffing capacity to scrutinize the tender documents in detail.
SAO
Technical specifications and product-neutral invitation to tender
In the case of a public contract for the construction of a house of 12 flats, the reference was directly to specific manufacturers and brands of products.
The contracting authority did not allow the use of other similar types of products nor justified why it required the delivery of specific products.
For the construction of a college facility, the tender documents included references to specific trading firms and specific product labels.
Overview of specifications and sub-species
For the construction of certain industrial zones, the contracting authority did not clearly define in the tender documents the quantity and type of required works, supplies or services in the statement of assessment and set only the enclosed space in cubic metres for each building as a specific unit.
Completeness of specifications
During the procurement procedure for the construction of the ring road, the tender documents for the narrower procedure were amended four times between August and September 2009.
This was due to changes in the project documentation triggered by an extension of the scope of the contract and a change in the technical conditions.
For the construction of social objects, the tender documentation had defects that forced the creation of additional works (there was no precise focus, a sufficient construction-technical survey was not carried out, drawings were missing).
The tender documentation for the construction of a large library featured interior elements only in descriptive terms, without specifying the qualitative requirements for products.
The delivery of the interior furnishings of the building was provided by subcontractors, who purchased some above-standard and very expensive equipment.
Parts and criteria for awarding the contract
There is no obligation to award a contract in parts in the Czech Republic.
An analysis of three large road constructions carried out in the construction of the ring road showed that when they were commissioned in open driving in parts (after each other after selected buildings), savings of up to 790 million could be achieved. CZK from the achieved public procurement price 15,508 mil. CZK.
For example, when awarding six building objects as a separate part of the public contract, savings of CZK 62.5 million could be achieved.
CZK, i.e. 25% of the contracted price and when awarding 20 bridges as a separate part of the public contract, savings of CZK 287.8 million could be achieved. CZK, i.e. also 25%.
The contracting authority, when constructing roads in the tender documents, laid down qualification criteria that limited the participation of small contractors in the procurement procedure.
In the tender conditions of the open procedure for the contractor for one construction of the motorway construction, the contracting authority requested, among other things, the contractor's practice of implementing at least three road constructions with a financial volume of more than EUR 700 million each. CZK, completed or operational over the last five years.
There are only nine companies in the Czech Republic that meet the condition of completing buildings over CZK 700 million. CZK in the last five years.
The public contract for the supply of another highway construction in an open procedure included six separate works for which the contracting authority had requested a minimum annual volume of construction work in the last three years of EUR 12 billion.
Two thirds of financial volume of road construction works (i.e. € 2.5 billion out of € 3.7 billion) in the period of 2008–2009 were realized by 5 suppliers or either individually in form of consortium.
For 46 contracts for a total of 13.2 billion CZK, there were only two or even one bidder.
The SAO pointed out that limiting market potential could lead to a large increase in costs.
Area of multi-works
In the construction of the ring road, the contracting authority did not enter into a written contract for the supply of additional works of construction in two cases, and the extra work did not enter into any of the procedures set out in the Act.
The value of pre-approved additional works in one case was EUR 1 591.4 million. CZK without VAT (an increase of 21%) and in the second case 4 135.8 mil. CZK without VAT (increase of 91%).
The reason for the extra work was mainly the ambiguous definition of the quantity and type of work required.
For the construction of a university facility, the contracting authority did not include in the tender documents certain works and supplies, the necessity of which it was already aware of when awarding the contract.
For these works and deliveries, he concluded amendments to the contract for the work with the contractor of the construction with an increase in the price, in a negotiated procedure without publication, even though the volume of additional works exceeded the national limit of 20% of the value of the original contract.
In connection with the construction of the Justice Palace, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional works without a procurement procedure.
During construction, the contracting authority increased the scope of the contract by CZK 50.5 million. CZK.
The unit prices of additional works determined without competition were significantly higher than the comparable works carried out by the same supplier.
Other findings
The SAO found on a selected sample of buildings that the average construction costs for the construction of one kilometre of the four-lane motorway in the Czech Republic are 355.0 million. CZK.
According to long-term data obtained from the German Ministry of Construction, the average cost in Germany per kilometre section of the four-lane motorway is CZK 260.0 million. CZK.
This comparison suggests that the acquisition of a motorway in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.
Summary
The legal provisions on tender documents are almost identical in both countries and are in line with the requirements of European law.
The aim is to ensure full and equal competition and prevention of corruption.
The specifications must be sufficiently precise to allow interested parties to calculate the costs and prepare their bids.
In addition, this requirement limits the scope for speculation and the contracting authority is protected against the need to outsource additional work.
In Germany, the basic legal provisions on tender documents are complemented by other rules designed to further reduce the possibilities for restricting competition and carrying out manipulation.
Although there are no detailed requirements of this kind in the Czech Republic, there is higher transparency achieved by publishing award criteria.
In both countries, specification requirements are mostly met.
However, in some cases, deficiencies have been identified which could lead to a reduction in competition.
At the same time, the rule in Germany requiring the division of bulky construction projects into parts seems appropriate for strengthening the competitive environment and achieving cost-effective results.
The SAO found that in the Czech Republic, awarding contracts for large-scale projects without partial procurement or division into large parts can limit the circle of candidates to a small number of large suppliers.
The strict requirement for references of bidders, which is applied in the Czech Republic for the selection of bidders for road construction work, is the fact that public contracts are awarded only to a small circle of bidders, and small and medium-sized companies thus have no chance of competing.
A limited number of applicants also increases the risk of fixing prices and other illegal conventions.
As regards the award of additional contracts for additional work or modified work and their reimbursement, regulatory approaches are different in both countries.
If the value of the additional works under European and German law does not exceed 50% of the value of the original contract, additional works may be awarded without a procurement procedure and its notification.
In the Czech Republic, a stricter limit of 20%.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
This limit is often exceeded by the sponsor.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
If the 20 % limit is exceeded, additional work must be awarded on the basis of a new procurement procedure.
By dividing the work into parts, it is possible to avoid restricting competition as well as the subsequent dire consequences.
Identification of the type of procurement procedure with respect to EU limits
By determining the type of procurement procedure, the contracting authority defines the circle of potential contractors who will be admitted to the competition.
A procuring entity may keep the range of potential suppliers unlimited or may limit the range according to the criteria entered.
In the case of major project work whose value is or exceeds the limits set by the EU, a European procurement procedure must be conducted.
Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption
In particular, when choosing the type of procedure, the contracting authority must comply with the requirements of European law relating to the competitive environment and transparency.
If the estimate of the total cost of the contract for the required works reaches or exceeds the current EU limit of €5.0 million (€125 million). CZK), it is always required to issue an open or restricted procurement procedure at European level.
In exceptional cases, a negotiated procedure or a competitive dialogue is permitted.
If a construction project reaches an EU limit, the contracting authority may deviate to a limited extent from the European procurement procedure by issuing a national procedure where the total value of the relevant part is below €1.0 million (€25 million). CZK) and the total value of all parts does not exceed 20% of the value of the estimate of the entire contract.
Dividing a construction project or intentionally estimating its costs too low with the intention of avoiding a fundamental obligation to call a European procurement procedure is not permissible.
Choosing the type of proceedings is very important for preventing corruption, as restricting competition substantially increases the risk of manipulation.
Therefore, an important part of the procurement documents is a detailed justification for the type of procedure chosen, in particular in relation to the obligation to apply European procurement law.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
Both countries have fully implemented the EU's legal requirements for procurement procedures and limits in their national legislation.
Different provisions
The Czech Republic has introduced the principle of equal validity of open and narrower procedures as well as for procurement procedures at national level.
Open and narrower procedures can always be chosen, while other types of proceedings are only allowed if the conditions laid down by law are met.
Unlike the Czech regulation, the relevant German regulation of budgetary law and the principles of prevention of corruption prefers open procedures or a public call for participation in the proceedings.
Other types of proceedings, including restricted procedures, are permitted only exceptionally, where permitted by legislation.
Such exceptions must be justified and documented.
The principle of open management preference is intended to ensure that the restriction of competition is prevented to the maximum extent and that the opportunity for manipulation (previously selected specific candidates) is limited.
In Germany, this principle of public procurement is at the heart of corruption prevention.
The correct estimate of the expected contract price is an important basis for deciding on the appropriate type of procurement procedure.
When estimating the costs of building projects, contracting entities in Germany can rely on budgetary and cost databases of public administrations and other organisations.
These were compiled on the basis of an analysis of completed construction projects and include, among other things, standard cost values for building types, building units, construction parts and partial construction works.
Based on such standard cost values, it is possible to estimate the value of the contract of the planned project or works.
Only a few building administrations in Germany already have a similar database for road construction.
However, the database is expected to be expanded at national level.
Contracting entities in the Czech Republic do not use any central database or average prices of comparable objects to determine the expected costs of public contracts for ground construction.
In many cases, cost determination is based on an estimate by the project-funded entity or based on the value of the resources available to that body.
The standardisation measures are still at an early stage.
Based on the anti-corruption programme for the period 2011-2012, the relevant ministries are to draw up a database of standardised commodities prices.
The application of the price system for determining the expected price of the contract is determined by a new regulation ordering the determination of the subject-matter of the contract in detail.
The pricing system should serve as a set of information on construction and assembly work, materials and products and other data to calculate the necessary costs and to set unit prices.
The Ministry of Transport has issued prescriptive prices for transport constructions for their control, which are regularly updated.
The database is designed to determine the price of a project (investment) plan and should play a comparative function in the next stages of construction work preparation.
Main BRH control findings
Selection of procurement procedure
The audited contracting authorities generally awarded contracts in an open procedure or in the form of a public call for participation and thus complied with the requirements of budgetary and procurement legislation.
In 2011, the share of public tenders in the total volume of federal construction projects in the field of building construction was 59.5%.
In road construction, the share was 94.8%.
BRH found that in some cases the use of non-public competition was not sufficiently justified.
In the case of blanket control, BRH found, on the basis of information collected from more than 16,000 proceedings, that limited management has a clear disadvantage compared to public proceedings and a public challenge, and limited procedures also increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
According to the BRH study, tenders in restricted procedures and negotiated procedures were between 6% and 10% higher than in public procedures.
Parallel studies by the Ministry of Construction and the Land Inspectorate confirmed the differences in value for money raised in public and limited management.
A study by the Ministry of Construction even found that prices in restricted procedures were twice as high as those in public proceedings.
Compliance with EU limits
For projects whose total value of the contract was estimated at more than €5 million (€125 million). CZK), audited contracting authorities generally prepared tender plans specifying which works would be awarded in the European procurement procedure and which in the national procedure.
According to the procurement plans, the share of works awarded under European rules always exceeded 80% of the total work.
There has been no case of circumvention of the requirement for European management in the form of an exorbitantly low cost estimate.
However, in some cases the minimum proportion for pan-European proceedings has not been achieved as a result of the calculation error.
In the course of the work, some contracting authorities illegally changed the procurement plan.
They did not justify these changes in any way and did not show that the minimum share of European management was subsequently respected.
As a rule, the share of European management by project accounts was lower than the share set out in the procurement plan.
If the expected values of construction project contracts exceeded European limits, contracting entities did not apply the European procedure to all individual sub-parts values exceeding €1 million (€25 million). CZK).
Instead, they awarded the relevant contracts on the basis of a national procedure, without giving good reasons for the need for a derogation from the requirement.
SAO
Selection of procurement procedure type
In the case of several large construction projects (e.g. the construction of a road section, equipment for a large sports event and the construction of flats), the contracting authority divided one project into several parts, although these partial orders were of the same or similar nature.
The division resulted in a reduction in the expected value of the contract and the contracts were awarded in a less demanding regime or even outside the regime of the law.
Methods of calculating the expected price
Price standards applicable to road construction projects have not yet been an effective instrument for setting the expected price.
They were based on the prices set out in the completed procedures, but they were burdened with both wastefulness and excessive profit for suppliers.
The SAO found that the actual prices for the three parts of the ring road were about 37% lower than these price standards.
The Ministry of Transport is to update standards in relation not only to past prices, but also to other comparable markets and price developments.
For land buildings, the estimated price was based on the budget of the project carried out by the architects or on the investor's estimate.
The actual price then varied considerably from the expected price.
The estimated cost of building a large library was twice as high compared to the contract price, but increased by CZK 54 million during the implementation. CZK, i.e. 27%.
Similarly, for the construction of the depository of this library, the contract price was 33 % lower than the expected price.
In other cases, the price of the successful applicant was higher than the expected price and increased further during the implementation.
For the construction of a large library, it was 400 miles. CZK, i.e. 22%. For the construction of the Palace of Justice, the actual price during the construction process increased disproportionately (by 139%) compared to the increase in functional areas (only by 12%).
Summary
Both countries have implemented European provisions on the choice of type of procurement procedure and on respect for European limits in their national legislation, so the respective national adjustments of the two countries are almost identical.
However, the principle of public procedures in Germany is stricter than the European arrangements and the current national regulation in the Czech Republic.
Compared to a narrower procurement procedure, a public procedure or a public call for participation gives opportunities for more competitors to participate in a procurement procedure.
These types of procurement procedures generate a large number of bids that guarantee the best value effect for money.
Prevention of corruption is significantly strengthened as the circle of candidates is not limited by decisions taken in advance by the contracting authority, which thus gives room for manipulation and fixing prices among bidders.
The studies confirmed the advantages of the German provision on the preference of open procedures or public calls for participation.
The Czech legislation allows contracting authorities to award contracts in an open or narrower procedure.
However, the latest legislation of the Public Procurement Act introduces a prohibition on contracting authorities to limit the number of tenderers in narrower procedures.
Closer proceedings have now come very close to open proceedings.
In Germany, the contracting authority largely fulfils the requirement of a preference for an open procedure or a public call for competition, while in the Czech Republic some projects were divided in violation of the law, in order to circumvent the requirement to choose the relevant type of procurement procedure.
However, for some projects carried out in Germany, European limits were not respected, resulting in a minimum share of pan-European procedures.
A satisfactory system has not yet been introduced in the Czech Republic to facilitate the correct calculation of expected costs of construction work and projects.
Where appropriate, contracting entities should ensure, through more extensive checks, that the requirements for the selection of the type of procurement procedure and the volume of contracts awarded in European procedures are met, or should create the conditions necessary to allow for the correct calculation of expected costs.
Preliminary information and notice of initiation
Where contracts are awarded under the European procedure, the contracting authority must publish a procurement report.
Preliminary information and procurement announcements are an important basis for European competition.
Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption
Through prior notifications, the contracting authority must provide the basic specifications of the projects envisaged.
Preliminary notifications are required for projects where the estimate of total costs is equal to or greater than the European limit and when the contracting authority wishes to shorten the deadline for the submission of tenders in individual procurement procedures.
The contracting authority is obliged to publish a procurement notice with detailed information for all public contracts that require a European procedure.
The information is binding on the contracting authority after publication.
Among other things, the notification shall include specifications, time limits for the procedure and for the completion of the contract, specific requirements and selection criteria and their weightings.
To describe the subject-matter of the contract, a common dictionary must be used for public contracts.
Preliminary information and contract notices are published in the EU in the EU in the Official Journal of the EU and on the profile of the contracting authority.
In order to avoid discrimination against foreign candidates, notifications at national level are not to contain any additional information and are not to be published before the text of the EU Publications Office's notification is sent.
Incomplete or inaccurate information in a pre-notification may violate competition or even ease manipulation.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
Both countries have fully implemented EU provisions on preliminary information and procurement notices in their national legislation.
Different provisions
In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and notifications must also be published in the case of contracts for which a European procedure is not required.
Procurement procedures may not be initiated until one month after the prior notification has been sent.
The publication of the provisional information may be waived only in exceptional cases.
In Germany, preliminary information is not required in cases where a European procedure is not necessary.
In the case of national procedures, the public appeal must be published on the Federal Government's website and, where appropriate, in the press.
In the case of restricted procedures without competition from participants, a notice must be published where the estimated price of the contract is equal to or greater than €25,000 ($625,000).
Preliminary notifications must explain all planned parts of the project.
This is an important requirement given the number of small contracts in Germany.
Dividing projects into smaller parts is not as common in the Czech Republic and this measure is considered less important.
Main control findings
BRH
Prior notification
Contracting entities published a pre-notice notice on projects that included the work to be commissioned in the European proceedings.
In some open proceedings, they shortened the deadline, although the number of days between the sending of the prior notification and the sending of the contract notice was less than 52 days.
In the case of other summary procedures, the annual periods applicable to the provisional information expired and should have been renewed.
In many cases, the prior notification did not indicate the anticipated division of the works into multiple parts.
Notice of initiation of a procurement procedure
Some notifications contained codes from the common dictionary that deviated from the pre-notification content or did not specify precisely the work to be carried out.
In rare cases, notifications at national level included more information, e.g. on delivery dates, or were published before the notice was published in the Official Journal of the EU.
Ex-ante transparency
One contracting authority hired an external company to publish a national notice.
It published a notice on its platform, the use of which has been charged.
But the contracting authority did not check if the company had to comply with the request to send a further notice to a free online government portal.
The sample revealed that only a third of the notifications were actually published on the government portal.
SAO
Notice of initiation of a procurement procedure
When constructing a wastewater treatment plant, the contracting authority did not set out in the notification of the shortlisted procurement procedure for the construction contractor the criteria according to which it would reduce the large number of tenders for the evaluation procedure.
The method of selection (reduction) of the tenders for the evaluation was not able to be substantiated by the contracting authority.
Reducing the number of bids was made possible by previous legislation.
In the construction of the road circuit, the contracting authority did not specify in the notice of initiation of a narrower procedure or in the qualification documentation of the values by which it would assess the degree of fulfilment of the qualification criteria or the number of bidders to be invited.
The contracting authority assessed the fulfilment of the qualification in such a way that all six candidates in the short term complied with it, but excluded one of them, saying that it fulfilled only in the last sixth place.
The contracting authority's action was not transparent as it did not disclose in advance information on what the qualification data would be evaluated and how.
Disclosure of calls
For building modifications in former military installations, the contracting authority did not disclose, in violation of the law, a written invitation to submit tenders.
Conclusions and recommendations / summary
The two-stage pre-information information process and the publication of the notice of initiation is an important tool for meeting the transparency and strengthening of the competitive environment applied in European procedures.
By extending the obligation to publish preliminary information in the Czech Republic also for national procurement procedures and by strengthening this obligation in Germany in cases of restricted procedures, both countries increased the transparency of procurement procedures and improved the competitive environment.
Selection of candidates in restricted procurement procedures
Contrary to the open procedure, limited procurement procedures do not allow participation to all potential bidders who would be interested.
In restricted procedures, the contracting authority shall first select potential suppliers to be asked to submit a tender.
Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption
EU provisions allow the number of candidates in European restricted procedures to be capped.
However, a restricted procedure requires at least five tenderers to be invited to submit a tender and, in the case of a negotiated procedure with publication, at least three potential bidders must be invited.
In any event, the number of candidates invited must be broad enough to guarantee genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective and non-discriminatory and published in advance.
The selection of potential candidates to be invited is very susceptible to manipulation, e.g. preferences of some of them.
Reducing competition to a few bidders may ease their collusion.
This has a negative impact on the outcome of the proceedings.
Therefore, the contracting authority must take measures to prevent manipulation and ensure that it has effective control to ensure that this procedure is transparent and credible.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
The provisions for selecting candidates are similar in both countries.
In addition to the requirements of the European Directive, contracting authorities should replace the tenderers they invite to submit a tender.
It is also not permissible to limit competition from a regional point of view.
Contracting entities must document and justify the selection of candidates and the selection process.
Different provisions
In Germany, at least three candidates are required to be invited in the case of a restricted procedure and, in the case of a negotiated procedure, several suitable candidates.
Apart from two cases, the new Czech regulations do not allow the number of candidates contacted to be limited in the case of a narrower and negotiated procedure.
In Germany, the "four-ey principle" must be respected when selecting candidates.
While one worker proposes a list of them, another must substantially modify this proposal, e.g. by removing the proposed candidate or installing another.
This is intended to prevent a situation where an individual can definitively establish a range of candidates who take part in the procedure.
If such a provision is not in place, a far-reaching illegal agreement between the participants is allowed.
The list of tenderers who will be invited to submit a tender shall be confidential and shall not be divulged.
This is also indebted to authorized independent experts.
There is no similar measure in the Czech Republic, nor is there any measure for confidential treatment of the list of candidates.
Under German provisions, they may not designate candidates for external society, but may make proposals to the contracting authority.
There is no similar requirement in the Czech Republic.
Main control findings
BRH
Number of candidates
In addition to a few cases, the requirement to address the minimum number of candidates has been met.
An analysis of almost 7,000 terms of reference for works with a value up to the national limit showed that, in the case of limited procedures, contracting authorities called for an average of 6.6 potential bidders and, in the case of a direct negotiation procedure, an average of 4.4 bidders.
Changing suppliers and regional restrictions
The contracting authorities, especially in the area of building construction, did not change the circle of contacted bidders because they had had good experience with those with whom they had worked so far.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The contracting authorities argued that, in the case of a non-public procedure, they should guarantee that they would reach out to tenderers whose suitability they had already secured in advance.
Although there was no evidence for illegal regional restrictions, the range of candidates in the non-public procedure included a larger proportion of regional tenderers than in the case of public procedures.
Contracting entities explained this to the low amount of the contract compared to the public procedure and the high cost of travel for potential bidders.
Cross-check principle and proposals from self-employed professionals
For the most part, contracting authorities ignored the obligation to change the list of candidates proposed by self-employed professionals.
They argued, in particular, a lack of staff, time pressure or inadequate knowledge of a suitable candidate.
In many cases, it was not apparent from the records who had proposed the tenderer who had been asked to participate in the proceedings.
The check of some samples showed that the list of potential candidates was created by self-employed professionals and was accepted unchanged by the contracting authority.
Contracting entities did not adequately protect themselves from potential manipulation.
Confidentiality of handling lists of potential candidates
One contracting authority kept a list of candidates for invitations to the procurement procedure in a database to which all employees had access at any time.
This allowed the manipulation or unauthorised disclosure of the names of the presumed or accepted bidders, who could then agree on the price.
Documentation
The dossier referred to the reasons for the selection of candidates in only a few cases.
SAO
Criteria for selection of candidates
When constructing the ring road, those interested did not have information about what the data on their qualifications would be evaluated and how.
For actions related to the development and modernisation of waterways and ports in the announcement of the procurement procedure for participation in the restricted procedure, the criteria for limiting the number of tenderers have not been established.
All eight bidders met the qualifications, but this exceeded the number to which the contracting authority restricted participation in the procurement procedure.
The Commission then selected the candidates using the random selection method - drawing lots, which was legal at the time.
This procedure should have been mentioned as a criterion already in the contract notice.
Summary
In view of the high risk of manipulation in the selection of the winning bidder in restricted procurement procedures, both countries have introduced special measures to prevent illegal restrictions on competition.
The German rules limit such opportunities for manipulation by so-called cross-checking (the four-eye principle), by maintaining the confidentiality of the list of candidates and by prohibiting proposals to select candidates to external companies.
Czech rules aim to prevent potential restrictions with the aim of manipulation mainly by an unlimited number of applicants.
However, the inspection found that part of those rules had not been applied to a sufficient degree and that an inadmissible restriction of the circle of candidates had not been prevented in some cases.
Contracting entities are obliged to completely eliminate the aforementioned shortcomings.
Submission of bids
The procurement phase, in which potential bidders can draw up tenders on the basis of the tender documentation they have received, begins with the publication of information on the procurement procedure and/or a call to tenderers.
By the time the envelopes are opened, prospective tenderers can submit their bids to the contracting authority and thus apply for the award of the contract.
Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption
EU law does not prescribe specific requirements at this stage of the procurement procedure.
The contracting authority must comply with the national rules governing this stage of management and prevent potential manipulation.
Those provisions shall relate in particular to organisation and control.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
The principle is that the tender documents on the basis of which potential suppliers make their bids must always be sent by the contracting authority.
Projection offices involved in management should not fulfil this role.
The contracting authority must ensure that all candidates have received the same information during this procurement procedure stage.
In case of confusion in the tender documents or if further questions arise, information may be supplied to tenderers only by the contracting authority.
Projection offices responsible for drawing up the tender documents may not provide any information.
Throughout this phase, any contact between the design office and the bidders must be prevented.
They must remain anonymous throughout, as allowing contact with them can adversely affect competition.
Tenders sent by post or submitted directly must be submitted in a closed envelope.
Electronically submitted offers must be encoded.
Different provisions
In Germany, the contracting authority may entrust insured suppliers of external services with the printing and distribution of documentation, and their staff must be obliged to comply with confidentiality.
In Germany, tenders received must be marked, indicating the date of receipt and transmitted directly and immediately in their original state to the official responsible for safekeeping.
This worker must not be involved in the procurement procedure.
The offers received must be locked up until the closing date of the envelopes.
In the Czech Republic, the offers received are marked with a serial number.
The sponsor shall issue a report with the details of the competition, including the offer number and information on the preparation and receipt of the offer.
There are no specific provisions on the safekeeping of offers.
Main control findings
BRH
BRH checked the terms of the administration building.
Sending tender documents
The audited contracting authorities of the building administration sent out the tender documents either directly or entrusted its printing and distribution to an external firm.
Self-employed workers did not send any documentation.
Information provided to tenderers
For the part of the tender documents relating to the questioning and obtaining information, the contracting authority did not follow the decree for separate planning from the procurement procedure.
Contrary to the relevant regulations, he often did not mention in the documentation the names of his contact staff, but rather the staff of the project management department.
Some notices in the procurement procedure even included the names of firms or self-employed persons involved in the preparation of the tender documents.
In rare cases, tenderers who raised questions during the procurement procedure did not receive identical information.
Labelling of tenders
For the contracting authorities, all accepted tenders were stamped with a stamp and acknowledgement of receipt.
However, in some cases for the negotiated procedure, offers were accepted by self-employed professionals, violating the rule of one construction of corruption prevention.
Custody of the tenders
Once marked, not all tenders were passed on directly and without delay to the official assigned to them keep in custody locked the tenders in a steel cabinet.
For one contracting entity, the bids were temporarily placed in an open compartment of the mailroom to which all employees had access.
Another sponsor placed the box in the corridor without permanent supervision, and part of the bids thrown into the mailbox stayed there overnight.
The box opening was wide and unsecured, and was thus accessible not only to employees.
SAO
The SAO did not find shortcomings in this area.
Summary
Rules are laid down in both countries to prevent contacts, in particular between interested companies and design offices working together in procurement procedures, for the duration of the process.
Equal treatment is ensured by sending the same information to all tenderers.
For the receipt, custody and confidentiality of tenders, there are appropriate rules to prevent manipulation and corruption.
In Germany, the relevant requirements are somewhat more developed than in the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the accumulated control register showed breaches of the rules in some areas.
These discrepancies can be easily corrected.
Opening envelopes
Opening envelopes
During the opening of the envelopes, the offers that have been closed so far are opened, their contents are read and published.
The period for which the tenderer is bound by his tender begins at the time of expiry of the deadline for submitting envelopes or opening them and ends with a deadline specified by the contracting authority.
Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption
European legislation does not contain any specific provisions dealing with the opening of envelopes.
However, national rights and regulations contain extensive requirements for both the protection of tenders and competition during this sensitive phase of the entire procurement procedure.
The principles of "multiple eyes", the transparency and credibility of the envelope opening process are intended to prevent manipulations and modifications of tenders already submitted.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
The opening of envelopes must be carried out by several persons appointed by the contracting authority.
The coincidence with the "more eyes" principle is intended to prevent individuals from having hidden manipulation of offers.
Candidates may be present when opening envelopes.
When opening, all envelopes must be placed before the chairman of the commission and are opened one by one.
The tenders received late shall not be taken into account.
In order to ensure transparency when opening envelopes, this phase, including the conclusions (results), must be recorded in writing. The entry must include, among other things, the names of the tenderers and the prices offered.
The minutes must be read and signed by the group manager.
The minutes may also be signed by the candidates present.
Different provisions
In the Czech Republic, a commission is being set up to open envelopes.
The participation of independent experts is admitted.
Members of the Commission may also be entrusted with discussion in the subsequent stages of the procedure, i.e. the evaluation of tenders.
In Germany, the opening of envelopes takes place in the presence of a manager and registrar.
The manager must be an employee of the contracting authority.
The manager and, in the case of building construction, the registrar may not be participants in the preparatory phase (making the tender documents), may not decide on the award of the contract and shall not be members in the subsequent processing (management) of the contract.
German regulations require that the entry from the opening of envelopes contains not only bidding prices, but also all information about discounts and special (unusual) symptoms, e.g. damaged envelopes upon receipt or late received offer.
In the Czech Republic, in addition to the bidding prices, there must be an indication of the language of the tender and the signature mandate of the tenderer in addition to the bidding prices.
German regulations require all parts of the envelopes opened to be marked to avoid subsequent changes.
Offers, usually marked in the form of perforation indicating the date, must be kept confidential (secret) at the end of the opening of the envelopes and may be made available only to persons who further process them.
There are no such measures in the Czech Republic.
If a single tender is received in the Czech Republic, the envelope may not be opened and the tenderer must be notified without delay.
They do not have this adjustment in Germany and if a single offer is accepted, it is open and evaluated.
Main control findings
BRH
Principle of cross-checking
During the opening of the envelopes, the contracting authorities adhered to the four-eyed principle.
There were always a leader and registrar who was not given a different role.
However, in rare cases, for small court proceedings, natural persons have opened up tenders that have been sent to them, without the involvement of the contracting authority.
The opening process of envelopes
writings from the opening of envelopes have not always documented the course.
In some cases, tenders submitted were not marked late and in some cases there were no signatures.
Labelling of received bids
The contracting authorities marked perforation offers with a date, which was in line with the requirements.
Some of them have mislabeled offers in the past, but have changed practice after warnings from BRH.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
SAO
Deadline for receipt of tenders
In road repairs, a bidder's bid was handed over a month late for one event, and he accepted it anyway.
Summary
Substantial parts of the provision when opening envelopes are identical in both countries to the principle of "multiple eyes" and the principle of transparency, thus making it possible to substantially reduce the risk of corruption and manipulation.
The German rules are more complex compared to the Czech Republic, especially the requirements for precise documentation of the procedure.
The marking, safe retention and respect for the confidentiality of tenders substantially limit the possibility of subsequent changes to the tenders submitted.
In addition, workers responsible for opening envelopes may not carry out any other activities related to the contract to be awarded.
The findings, despite the discovery of some irregularities, confirm that the rules for opening envelopes are largely applied.
Assessment and evaluation of tenders
The contracting authority must review and evaluate the tenders received within the time limit set.
At the same time, they must award the contract to the tenderer who best meets the award criteria in the tender.
Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption
EU law sets out the process of assessing and evaluating bids in several steps:
The first step examines the suitability of applicants.
They must have a good economic and financial position and the required professional and technical knowledge and skills.
Candidates who have ever been convicted of bribery or embezzlement must always be excluded from procurement procedures.
Offers of excluded tenderers must be evaluated in terms of numerical accuracy, technical suitability and value for money on the basis of previously published award criteria.
The contracting authority must identify the most economically favourable offer and, in particular, examine all significantly low price offers.
Review and evaluation is particularly sensitive and prone to manipulation.
Candidates may, for example, be excluded without a legitimate reason, or tenders that do not meet the requirements may be kept in competition.
The outcome of the evaluation may be wrongly influenced by the preference of a tenderer or its disadvantage, which may prevent the selection of the most economically advantageous tender.
The contracting authority must therefore take specific measures to select the persons integrated into the process and must ensure that they meet the requirements of integrity and technical knowledge.
They must also make sure that the whole process and the decisions taken are transparent and credible.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
Consistent with EU requirements, the relevant provisions in both countries require the review and evaluation of tenders in step-by-step.
During the evaluation, the requirements for demonstrating the suitability of tenderers, the evaluation criteria and their weights set out in the notice or the procurement documents shall not be amended.
The criteria set for assessing the suitability of candidates cannot be further applied.
Further evaluation can only be carried out on the basis of evaluation criteria.
The tenders submitted must first be examined from a formal point of view whether they are complete or do not include suspicious elements that might encourage manipulation.
Where tenderers are excluded from further examination and evaluation of the tenders submitted by them, they shall be informed immediately.
Where the evaluation of the tenders results in a finding of a disproportionately low bid price, the tenderer concerned must be given the opportunity to comment on the situation before the possible withdrawal of his tender.
The reasons for the decision must be documented transparently.
Different provisions
In Germany, tenderers must remain silent and only authorised persons may participate in the evaluation of tenders.
The mathematical accuracy of tenders can only be reviewed by the contracting authority.
Assessments may only be entrusted to staff who are not integrated into the decision-making phase of the choice of supplier or in the project implementation phase.
There are no precise provisions on who can carry out further reviews and evaluations.
If external companies are entrusted with reviewing and evaluating tenders, they must be aware that the offers are confidential and respect that fact honestly.
They can only make proposals to the contracting authority for decisions.
In the Czech Republic, bids must be reviewed and evaluated by a commission appointed by the contracting authority, which will draw up a report with a draft conclusion of the contract.
However, in both countries, the final decision depends on the contracting authority.
If the documents and declarations required in connection with the submission of tenders are incomplete in Germany, the tenderers concerned must subsequently submit the required documents within six days.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
If tenderers fail to comply with this obligation, their tenders must be excluded.
In the Czech Republic, the contracting authority may decide whether to give the tenderer the opportunity to complete the missing documents.
If the candidate does not substantiate them, they must be excluded.
In Germany, not only the total price but also the unit prices must be reviewed.
If the bid price structure shows that prices for parts of the total project have been estimated disproportionately high or low, bidders must be asked to explain.
If they do not provide an explanation and if the contracting authority can prove that the tender contains compensatory prizes, such tenders must be excluded.
This is to prevent bidders from submitting price calculations based on the assumption that substantial quantitative changes will be made to individual parts of the overall project, which may lead to a significant increase in project costs.
In the Czech Republic, the total price of the work is evaluated and the prices of individual parts are not examined in detail.
Compensation of valuation is not a reason to exclude the offer.
In Germany, a contract cannot be awarded to a tenderer who offers a disproportionately high or low price.
If one or more offers vary in price by 10% or more than the price estimated by the contracting authority or other tenders, tenderers must demonstrate that their tender has been credibly and convincingly calculated.
If they are unable to do so, the contracting authority should exclude them.
In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure may be cancelled after a price review if only tenders with disproportionately low prices have been received and the bidders have not justified these prices.
If the price of a tender is significantly higher than the contracting authority's estimate, that is not a reason for refusing to award a contract to the tenderer concerned (unlike German contract law).
Where there is a suspicion in Germany of conduct intended to limit competition, the contracting authority is obliged to report this fact without delay to the competent superior authority.
This must decide on the way forward and whether it is appropriate to inform the antitrust authority or law enforcement authorities.
It must also approve (e.g. if the contract exceeds €50,000 and the contract has not been awarded to the tenderer with the lowest bid), whether the contract will be awarded when the contract is negotiated or whether the procurement procedure will be cancelled.
Czech rules do not regulate this area.
Main control findings
BRH
Examination of suitability and procurement criteria
Most of the procurement procedures examined were in line with the relevant requirements.
In the case of some recommendations by potential suppliers made by self-employed workers, the contracting authorities themselves did not check the suitability of the tenderers themselves.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In some cases of procurement procedures, insufficient documentation was submitted as to whether the contracting authority took into account all published evaluation criteria or whether the selection decision was based solely on the price criterion.
Selection of interested persons and confidentiality of offers
Some contracting authorities used the services of unauthorized persons, such as self-employed workers or employees of construction offices.
They were incorporated into the planning or implementation process of construction projects, performing functions that were to be held exclusively by the contracting authority.
Contracting entities have sought to substantiate this with their lack of human resources in the sector.
In some cases, self-employed professionals used to review the offers of services of persons who were not formally bound to maintain the confidentiality of tenders and to perform with due care the fulfilment of their obligations under the contract.
As far as contracting authorities are concerned, there was generally no evidence of whether offers in the custody of self-employed professionals were available only to designated persons.
Review and mathematical control of bids
Some contracting authorities have handed over open envelopes for further examination to self-employed professionals without first carrying out the prescribed verification of tenders and mathematical examination and without documenting the results of these examinations.
In the event of any intent to manipulate, third parties could make changes to the bids that could not be identified by the contracting authority.
The examination of documents revealed a number of cases where unusual elements in the bids were not adequately labelled or where data on prices and products were missing.
Performance audits
A model check by one contracting authority revealed that in 75% of procurement cases, the most advantageous tenders deviated by more than 10% from pre-arranged costs.
One of the 20 procurement procedures was cancelled due to inadequate bidding prices.
In many cases, there was a lack of evidence or sufficient documentation on the examination of bids or negotiations with tenderers for further clarification.
In many cases, detailed information was also lacking, for example, about unit prices of the most important invoiced items.
The reason for the derogations were often cited changes in market prices or increases in material costs.
Contracting authorities have argued that identifying and proving compensatory prices is difficult.
In the case of one call for tenders made by an entity outside the ordinary contracting entity, a 66 % lower price was offered compared to the initial cost estimate.
No data on a closer examination of the cost or on the determination of the reasons for the deviations were not recorded.
In clarifying this issue, the contracting authority found no indication of price dumping for the tenderer to whom the contract was eventually awarded.
It was therefore not clarified whether the initial cost estimate was excessive or whether the price offered was too low.
Later, the contracting authority of that tenderer was assessed as a "low-cost company" which was unable to meet either qualitative requirements or deadlines.
In another procurement procedure, the contracting authority awarded the contract to a tenderer whose price was 35 % higher than the initial cost estimate.
The contracting authority did not cancel the tendering procedure and put forward an unfounded argument that the tenderer could be presumed not to have incurred a disproportionately high cost setting of its prices.
Suspicion of irregularities
Two incidents of irregularities were found with one contracting authority, and they were reported to a company responsible for technical supervision.
In one procurement procedure, two bidders submitted bids containing an identical price calculation, prompting the contracting authorities to exclude both bids.
The inspections did not show any material shortcomings in the application of other provisions.
SAO
Verification of suitability
For many construction actions, such as university buildings, roads and railways, contracting entities have not excluded tenderers from participating in the procurement procedure, even though they did not meet the requirements of the contracting authority referred to in the terms of reference, or did not substantiate the qualifications to the extent required, or, on the contrary, one contracting authority could not substantiate or explain the reason for the exclusion of the candidate who met the requirements.
Evaluation
For the construction of the wastewater treatment plant, the individual evaluation criteria of the tender procedure for the contractor of the construction were determined, but the contracting authority did not respect them during the procedure.
For actions in the field of railway infrastructure development, the weighting of the evaluation criteria for the award of the contract was not determined at the initiation of the procedure, but only at the beginning of the evaluation.
For the road repair project, the assessment of the criterion of "shortening construction time" was not carried out correctly.
For bidders in second and third place, the evaluation incorrectly stated a greater reduction in the construction time than indicated in their tenders.
Documentation of the reasons for the selection of the candidate
For the three housing promotion actions, the contracting authority did not substantiate on the basis of which criteria it assessed the offers received and how it selected the most suitable of them.
Correctness of the selection of suppliers of small-scale contracts associated with the construction of a ring road with an estimated price of up to 500 thousand.
The CZK could not be verified because the suppliers were selected only on the basis of telephone consultations on the price and date of fulfilment, but the documents on these negotiations were not prepared.
Summary
In both countries, the rules for the verification and evaluation of bids correspond to EU requirements.
However, it differs in the light of the specific management steps and the selection of individuals involved in the management.
Unlike in the Czech Republic, these steps in the procurement process are governed by stricter and more detailed requirements, especially as regards the application of the cross-price principle and the protection of tenders.
The same applies to the rules for verifying the appropriateness of the prices offered.
In both countries, in some cases of checks, it was found that substantial steps of the process in the verification and evaluation of the bids were not documented at all and, if so, only partially.
The absence of control tools and transparency in decision-making during the review and evaluation of tenders allows for manipulation.
The checks showed serious defects, such as the transmission of bids to third parties without prior appropriate examination and documenting the tenders by the contracting authority.
Where contracting entities entrust a third party with the performance of the functions associated with the examination and evaluation of tenders, appropriate measures and increased control of measures against increased handling options are necessary.
When checking price legitimacy, the audited German contracting authorities did not use the complete set of available instruments in all cases and did not deal with their own pricing structure.
In the Czech Republic, deficiencies were identified in the evaluation of the suitability of tenders and the application of evaluation criteria.
Completion of procurement procedure
After examining and evaluating the tenders, the procurement process is completed by awarding the contract or cancelling the procedure.
Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption
In the case of a European procedure, all tenderers must be informed in advance of the award decision.
Suppliers shall have the opportunity to review the decision taken within a limited period of 10 or 15 days and to request its examination where appropriate.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The period of 10 days shall apply to electronic submissions and 15 days to other submissions.
The contract shall not be concluded before the expiry of that period or before the review procedure has expired.
If the review body rejects the complaint and confirms the decision, candidates and tenderers must be given the opportunity to have the right to be reviewed by an independent court.
This measure ensures that no contracting authority will be able to circumvent the legal protection of suppliers by rapidly implementing the decision of the procurement procedure.
The contracting authority must properly document the conduct of the proceedings.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
Both countries implemented management information obligations.
In both countries, the final decision on the outcome of the procurement procedure lies with the contracting authority.
However, he cannot arbitrarily deviate from the results of a properly carried out examination and evaluation.
The contracting authority is to conclude the contract within a specified period of time.
This is due to the fact that the tenderer is not bound by its tender after that period has expired.
The content of the contract must not deviate from the winning bid.
Failed bidders are to be informed of the outcome in a timely manner, stating the reason why their bid was not accepted.
The cancellation of the procurement procedure is only permissible if certain conditions are met, e.g. if the prices in tenders do not correspond to the specifications.
Different provisions
In the Czech Republic, the mandatory waiting period prior to the conclusion of the contract covers both European and national procedures.
In Germany, the equivalent provision applies only to European procedures.
In all other procedures in Germany, tenderers cannot be informed of the award of the contract before deciding on its EU provisions and review award.
In the Czech Republic, the tendering procedure must be cancelled if a single tender has been received or only a single tender met the requirements for its consideration and evaluation.
In Germany, the contract must be awarded even if a single tender has been received, provided that the tender fulfils the conditions set out in the tender documents and is cost-effective.
Main control findings
BRH
The checks found few discrepancies in the completion of the audited procurement processes.
In some cases, European procedures have received authorising letters before the expiry of the notification period, which may invalidate the contract.
Also, in several cases of open procedures, the authorising letters of modification were incompatible with the content of the tender, such as new deadlines.
In some cases, the contracting authorities did not meet the time limits for awarding the contract.
In one open procedure, the contracting authority selected the second most advantageous tender because the bidder offering a price more than 50% lower no longer wished to fulfil the contract at the price originally offered.
SAO
During the reconstruction and construction of the university, in one case the contracting authority did not conclude a contract with the contractor in accordance with the draft contract contained in the tenderer's tender.
For some road repair and maintenance actions, highway construction and ring roads, contracts were concluded later than stipulated by law.
For building modifications in former military installations, the contracting authority sent a notice of the selection of the most suitable tender to all bidders only after the legal deadline had expired.
Summary
Both countries implemented EU rules on the termination of the procurement procedure.
The legal protection of unsuccessful candidates contributes to reducing corruption.
The Czech Public Procurement Act includes an institute of legal protection even in cases of contracts below EU limits.
In both countries, it was found that the limited time limit for concluding the contract was exceeded.
This can cause adverse economic consequences and increase the risk of manipulation.
In the future, contracting entities should eliminate such shortcomings in the conclusion of the procurement procedure.
Documentation, notifications, information obligations
The procurement process, with all its various stages, relevant findings and decisions, including the relevant justifications, shall be documented in a transparent manner.
Completion of the procurement procedure at European level must be published.
Data on procurement procedures are summarised in EU statistics.
Requirements of European law and the prevention of corruption
The obligation to document procurement procedures is in line with the essential requirement of the principle of transparency, applied at EU-wide level.
Only a proper and time-consuming decision-making and justification documentation gives a guarantee of transparency in the procurement process and, above all, guarantees effective legal protection of the interests of each tenderer in cases where the value of the contract exceeds the European limits.
The relevant documentation is also an essential part of the anti-corruption measures, as the obligation to substantiate individual decisions in detail and their merits significantly reduce the scope for manipulation.
In cases of European procurement procedures, the contracting authority must notify the completion of the EU Publications Office (EU's Office of Official Publications) within 48 days from the date of award of the contract.
The Authority publishes a notification in the EU's Official Journal and this also fulfils the transparency requirement.
The contracting authority must summarise the essential information on its procurement procedures and communicate them to the European Commission through the relevant national ministries.
On this basis, the European Commission issues annual statistics that make it possible to get an overview of the development of the single market in the field of construction.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
Both countries have fully transposed into their national legislation the provisions of the European law on documentation and notification obligations.
The provisions on documentation and notification for the purposes of European statistics are almost identical in both countries.
Different provisions
In the Czech Republic, the obligation to announce the award of a contract applies not only to European procedures, but also to national procurement procedures.
The notification period is only 15 days from the conclusion of the contract.
In Germany, the obligation to notify procurement procedures, in addition to those that are mandatory under European law, applies only to limited procedures exceeding the limit of €25 thousand ($625,000) and direct procedures exceeding the limit of €15,000 ($375,000) including VAT.
Only the parties to the proceedings are informed below this limit.
Main control findings
BRH
Documentation
A large number of assignments have not been fully documented.
The notification did not contain all the necessary information, e.g. the reasons for the delivery specifications and the national rules.
In the case of one procedure, the contracting authority did not explain why it had concluded a contract with a tenderer whose tender did not contain mandatory requirements.
In several cases, some required records were also missing.
Publication of award
In the case of some European procedures, the contracting authority erred in the publication of the notice.
In the case of several terms of reference, there was no evidence of disclosure of the notice.
Reporting obligation
The statistically proven files included the required minimum of information and were created and sent in time.
Preliminary transparency
In most cases, the contracting authority published information about the outcome of the contract.
In the case of one contracting authority, contract information was not disclosed due to a communication error.
It took the contracting authority six months to notice the error.
Consequently, the outcome of the proceedings was not disclosed during that period.
SAO
Documentation
For events related to the organisation of a major sporting event, significant deficiencies were identified in the documentation of the course of the procurement procedure, such as incorrect information on bidding prices in the evaluation committee's discussions.
In addition, some documents on opening envelopes have not been signed.
Publication of award
In the preparation of repairs and maintenance of roads, the construction of the motorway and the ring road, the announcement of the award of the public contract was sent after the deadline or it was not made public.
Summary
The provisions on documentation and notification and notification obligations include European requirements and are almost identical in both countries.
This generally ensures the transparency of procurement procedures and final selection.
Czech reporting obligations are somewhat stricter compared to German ones.
The inspections have identified shortcomings substantially reducing the value of documentation as a means of preventing corruption.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Contracting entities should continue to strengthen the transparency of their procurement procedures and fully meet the notification and notification requirements.
Aggregate evaluation and recommendations
Parallel controls of the SAO and BRH were focused on two areas that are essential for the public procurement process both in the Czech Republic and Germany, namely the application of EU procurement law and the prevention of corruption.
EU legislation gives opportunities to international competition within the EU to create a single European market.
Measures aimed at preventing corruption are not only to avoid or at least reduce it, but also to prevent financial damage and potential loss of confidence in the integrity of the government.
The audited supervisory findings of the two audit institutions - the SAO and BRH - with regard to the application of the procurement law of both countries and the comparison of its relevant provisions, give an internal view of the common and distinct elements which may assist both countries in the further development and application of this right.
Application of EU procurement law
Both countries have transposed EU public procurement law into their national legislation.
In both countries, there is thus an important common base for public procurement and the fulfilment of essential requirements in the field of: competition; equal treatment of candidates; transparency of procurement procedures.
Contracting entities reinforce these requirements in part with very large measures.
The Czech Republic has extended the provisions on public procurement requiring European procedures to procedures below EU limits and are therefore governed by national legislation.
However, the checks have shown that contracting entities are not always fully in line with all relevant provisions of EU requirements.
German contracting entities should continue to improve the quality of their procurement procedures in order to eliminate the aforementioned irregularities taking into account the implementation of EU requirements.
In the Czech Republic, the controls identified risks affecting economy and achieving value for money.
These include, in particular, the incomplete definition of the subject-matter of the public contract, which resulted in additional works which were often awarded in breach of the law, the lack of definition of the anticipated price and the required qualification prerequisites narrowing the possible circle of tenderers and thus reducing competition especially in the field of transport constructions.
Prevention of corruption
Joint controls were not intended to detect corruption cases.
The reason was that both BRH and the SAO did not have sufficient tools to do so.
However, they can examine whether the competent authorities of both countries are taking measures to reduce corruption and manipulation in public procurement and how these measures are applied.
When it comes to preventing corruption, both countries have focused on different aspects.
Above all, German provisions give room for broad and unlimited competition, transparency and controls as a central element in the prevention of corruption.
Czech regulations mainly monitor the strengthening of the transparency of procurement procedures.
BRH
In Germany, there are general principles for the prevention of corruption that apply to the entire federal administration.
These principles were also included among the procurement requirements and were adopted to meet the specific needs of such procurement.
The relevant provisions specify, at times with great precision, ways of complying with the requirements for preventing corruption during the procurement procedure and the selection of persons incorporated therein.
In BRH's view, the principle of preference for open procurement and calls for participation is a particularly appropriate tool for substantially reducing the risk of corruption in public procurement, while restricting competition increases the risk of manipulation.
Risk analysis and adequate controls (particularly the principle of cross-checking), transparency requirements, procurement documents and various organisational measures are also an effective mechanism to prevent corruption and manipulation.
BRH therefore does not feel the need for substantial changes to the current provisions that public institutions have to comply with in public procurement.
Anti-corruption measures are widely applied in practice.
Irregularities found in some areas have highlighted weaknesses in compliance with certain requirements.
Therefore, contracting authorities should provide further training to their staff, familiarising them with anti-corruption requirements and further raising their awareness in this area.
A significant proportion of the weaknesses revealed apply to activities delegated by the building administration to private entrepreneurs.
However, the absence of adequate controls in delegating powers increases the risk of abuse.
Activities susceptible to manipulation and corruption should therefore only be passed on to third parties if the administration can guarantee a sufficient degree of protection against unauthorised interference.
SAO
Anti-corruption strategies have been adopted at the government level in the Czech Republic, which also significantly affect the area of public procurement.
The SAO's auditing actions took place during the period when one of the most important parts of this strategy was implemented, namely a significant change to the Public Procurement Act and the adoption of follow-up implementing regulations.
The strategy adopted and the new legal regulations can be effective steps to improve the situation.
For example, under the new regulations, the contracting authority must justify the effectiveness of the public contract, the determination of the anticipated value of the contract, the adequacy of the requirements for the qualification conditions, the establishment of the basic evaluation criteria and the method of evaluation of the tenders, and properly document and publish everything properly.
Recommendations
Overall, both the SAO and BRH have a favourable opinion about the ways of implementing EU requirements.
In practice, their broad application has confirmed that EU competition, equal treatment and transparency requirements provide an appropriate basis for public procurement within the EU.
The transnational model, introduced in the EU, can also serve as a basis for similar projects aimed at facilitating and promoting international competition.
Taking into account the great potential of material and intangible damage caused as a result of manipulation and corruption in connection with public procurement, both the BRH and the SAO insist that it is the responsibility of contracting authorities to continue measures against corruption and manipulation and to improve them where possible.
In particular, organisational structures and procurement procedures should be continuously monitored in terms of weaknesses and risks in order to identify and respond appropriately to the need for corrective action.
Compared to practice in Germany, it has emerged that the share of open procurement procedures in the Czech Republic should increase, giving room to competition and substantially reducing the possibility of corrupt behaviour.
The award of contracts in parts may also have a positive impact on the price achieved in cases where it is permissible and appropriate for the contracting authority. A higher number of applicants put pressure on the price achieved.
The provision of its organisation also has an impact on the conduct of the procurement procedure.
It is provided by special state organisations in Germany, while in the Czech Republic, with the exception of transport structures, it is organised by the central authorities themselves or through contractual organisations.
Both the SAO and BRH want to further develop knowledge in their work where appropriate and address them with their parliament and government beyond their joint project.
Moreover, they are convinced that the principles of procurement law and their implementation, as described in this report, will also be of interest at the level of the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), as these principles and findings are of general importance for effectively tackling corruption and to guarantee that public procurement is awarded in a regime of well-functioning and honest competition and that value for money is achieved.

JOINT FINAL REPORT on the results of parallel controls on excise duty management in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic
Joint final report
May 2017
Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic
Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic
Introductory word
The joint report submitted informs about the course and outcome of international cooperation during parallel inspections carried out by the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic, with a focus on the management of excise duties in 2012-2015.
Cooperation between the highest audit institutions of both countries was implemented on the basis of a cooperation agreement between the SAO of the Slovak Republic and the SAO of the Czech Republic in the exercise of parallel controls aimed at the administration of excise duties concluded in August 2015.
The topic of parallel controls was chosen on the basis of the fact that the two EU Member States are based on common European legislation to see how it is applied at national level, how the excise tax management system is set up and how the systems in Slovakia and the Czech Republic are different.
The greatest benefit of the control actions carried out was the exchange of experience, the identification of differences and the identification of good practice.
Last but not least, the finding that the international comparability of data on the performance and efficiency of excise duty management was very limited without parallel controls being carried out.

on the results of parallel controls of the SPD administration in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic
Summary and evaluation
The legislation on excise duties in the Czech Republic and Slovakia and their administration is in line with EU legislation and significantly exceeds EU requirements.
Differences were found between the adjustment of excise duties in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic, in the Czech Republic it contributes to the effective administration of excise taxes verification of the economic stability of applicants for the issue of permits and the obligatory marking and colouring of selected mineral oils and some other oils; In the SR, the distribution of control signs is simpler than in the Czech Republic and less burdensome tax administrator.
In the fight against excise tax evasion, supervision of the movement of raw tobacco or tobacco raw material, the implementation of the institute of fuel distributor and the registration of consumer packaging of alcohol has proved to be a good practice in both countries.
Revenue from excise duties in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic is growing more slowly than other tax revenues.
The EU's targets of reducing labour taxation, introducing environmentally austerity measures and reducing dependence on tobacco and alcohol have not yet been met in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, including because there is no indexation of excise tax rates in both countries.
This has the effect of reducing the materiality of excise duties on total tax revenues and, as a result of increasing purchasing power, a real reduction in the tax burden on excise duties.
The state has long supported the implementation of environmental measures financially, but these measures have a negative impact on excise revenues, which will need to be replaced in the future by other revenues or by reducing state spending.
Administrative expenditures spent on excise tax management in both the Czech Republic and Slovakia have been growing for a long time, mainly due to wage growth, and their efficiency is declining.
In the Slovak Republic, this efficiency is also negatively affected by the expenditure on computerising the administration of excise duties (IT expenses) and the expenses incurred on the wages of employees carrying out permanent tax supervision in alcohol tax warehouses.
The electronicisation of excise tax management in the SR did not significantly affect the reduction in the number of tax administrations.
The SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO SR recommend to the FŘ SR to reconsider the merits of the exercise of permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses on alcohol.
In the Czech Republic, the efficiency of administrative expenditures was influenced by the fact that the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic did not apply procedures in the audited period that would lead to a reduction in the staffing demands of the administration of excise duties.
The number of comparable administrative tasks of tax administrators was similar in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic in individual years of the audited period, while the number of comparable tax entities in the Slovak Republic is about a third lower than in the Czech Republic.
Tax administrators in the Slovak Republic carry out administrative tasks mainly in the form of physical exercise of tax supervision, while tax administrators in the Czech Republic emphasize remote supervision and risk analysis.
The administration of excise duties in the Slovak Republic is administratively more demanding than in the Czech Republic and, given the ratio of the number of tax acts to the number of entities, even more costly.
Electronization of excise tax administration in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic took place in different areas.
In the SR the administration of tax returns to excise taxes is fully electronized, in the Czech Republic documents proving taxation of selected products in free tax circulation are electronically handed over.
Both methods of electronization support effective administration of excise duties, which is why the SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the SR recommend applying them not only in both countries.
The total expenditure on the deployment of EMCS could not be compared, as the FŘ SR provided expenditure data only for the upgrade of the system in the period 2011-2015, but expenditure was also spent before this period.
Expenditure incurred in that period only for EMCS upgrades in the SR was about 20% higher than the expenditure incurred in the Czech Republic for both the introduction of EMCS and the upgrade of this system over more than a decade.
The administrators of excise duties in the Czech Republic and Slovakia did not reach comparable values of qualitative indicators when spending comparable expenditures.
The level of supervision is comparable in both countries, but in the SR the administration of excise duties is significantly more resource-intensive.
The introduction of an electronic system for monitoring the movement of excise products (EMCS) made the administration of excise duties more efficient, but in the Slovak Republic to a lower extent, as significantly higher expenditure was incurred on the introduction of the system and its modernisation than in the Czech Republic.
Basic information
The cooperation between the two audit institutions was carried out on the basis of the Cooperation Treaty in the implementation of parallel controls aimed at the management of excise duties of 18 August 2015.
The SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic have agreed to carry out parallel controls that will primarily focus on the issue of excise tax administration and the results of which will allow analysis, mutual comparison and evaluation of the established facts.
Common audit issues were agreed on which parallel controls were based.
Characteristics of the subject and the parallel control objective:
The parallel controls aimed to compare the performance of excise administrators, taking into account qualitative and quantitative indicators, and to identify the weaknesses of the excise tax administration process.
In particular, the following main audit issues should have been answered:
Did excise administrators in the Czech Republic and Slovakia achieve comparable values of qualitative indicators when spending comparable expenditures?
Was the introduction of an electronic system for monitoring the movement of products subject to excise duties (EMCS) to streamline the management of excise duties and was the cost of implementing it effectively incurred?
The parallel checks carried out were to identify the causes of significant differences affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of the tax administration in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, especially in the area of regulation and in the setting of the organizational structure.

Legislation for excise duties in the Czech Republic and Slovakia
The excise tax administration legislation is divided into the level of EU legislation (see Annex 1) and the level of national legislation (see Annex 2).
Council Directive 2008/118/EC, on the general arrangements for excise duties and repealing Directive 92/12/EEC, defines excise duty and lays down basic rules for the management of taxes and the management of energy products and electricity, tobacco products, alcohol and alcoholic beverages.
This directive makes it possible to impose taxes on consumption on other products.
EU legislation regulates in particular the minimum conditions for: the level of tax rates for each type of product selected, the production, storage, processing and possession of products subject to tax, tax exemption and refund, supervision of the transport of selected products between EU Member States, international cooperation and the keeping of registers on economic operators and tax warehouses.
EU legislation makes it possible to introduce control procedures and institutes at national level, provided they do not distort competition.
Legislative of excise duties in the Czech Republic
Definition of legislation in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, excise tax legislation is concentrated in the Excise Tax Act (Act No. 353/2003 Coll.), which regulates the administration of the tax on mineral oils, taxes on alcohol, taxes on tobacco products, beer taxes, wine tax and intermediate products and taxes on raw tobacco.
This law defines forms of disposal of products subject to excise duties, tax payers, authorisation procedures, conditions for the transport of products, tax returns and penalties for infringements of legislation.
The law and subsequent decrees further regulate certain other conditions for the management of mineral oils (branding mineral oils), restrictions on the sale of spirits and tobacco products, monitoring of the handling of special mineral oils and storage of raw tobacco for a purpose other than the production of tobacco products.
Taxes on other energy products (i.e. natural gas and certain other gases, solid fuels and electricity) are regulated in parts 45 to 47 of Act No 261/2007 Coll., on the stabilisation of public budgets.
In the Czech Republic, a number of provisions related to the administration of excise duties are contained in special legislation. The Fuel Act No. 311/2006 Coll. and the implementing regulation govern the conditions for the sale, dispensing, distribution of fuel and keeping of the registration of fuel put into free tax circulation.
Act No. 61/1997 Coll., on alcohol, and its implementing regulations define the conditions for the production, storage, registration and control of the production and circulation of alcohol.
Act No. 307/2013 Coll., on Compulsory Alcohol Labelling, and the relevant implementing regulations provide for mandatory marking of alcohol in consumer packaging, conditions for handling control tapes and conditions for the handling of alcohol (i.e. for production, processing, sale or other transfer, transport, transport, storage, takeover, use, possession, import or export of alcohol).
The procedures for tax proceedings, which are not specified in special regulations, are governed by Act No. 280/2009 Coll., the Tax Code.
Penalties are imposed by procedures under Act No 500/2004 Coll., the Administrative Code.
The conditions for the issuance of a trade licence (concession) to operate a trade "production and processing of fuels and lubricants and distribution of fuels" and "production, modification and sale of fermentation, alcohol of consumer and spirits" are regulated by Act No. 455/1991 Coll., on Trade Licensing Business (Trades Licensing Act).
The Czech Republic has used the power to introduce control procedures and institutes for controlling the transport of selected products in free tax circulation and for monitoring compliance with the legislation when dealing with selected products for which excise duty has not been paid, as well as when dealing with selected products for which the tax has already been paid.
These are monitoring the handling of special mineral oils and raw tobacco, marking some other mineral oils, labelling tobacco products and alcohol in consumer packaging.
The Czech Republic has used the right to apply excise duty to other products and introduced an excise duty on raw tobacco as one of the measures against tax fraud.
Structure of legislative changes for individual types of excise duties in relation to the subject of control in the Czech Republic
On the basis of the Government of the Czech Republic's resolution of 3 October 2012 No 735, the implementation of the "zero tolerance plan for the black market for spirits," there were major legislative changes in the Czech Republic in 2012-2015 introducing a number of measures against excise duty fraud.
During the same period, there were also substantial changes in the legislation on mineral oil tax, tobacco products tax and the criminality of preparing the tax cut.
Criminal protection of tax revenues
With effect from 1 July 2016, the criminality of preparing the offence of "reduction of tax, fee and similar compulsory payment" is introduced. The adjustment made should allow police authorities to take more effectively and timely measures to reduce tax fraud, such as the deployment of operational search means.
General provisions for excise duty management
The issue of an authorisation to dispose of products subject to excise duty under the Excise Tax Act shall be subject, with effect from 1 January 2015, to: reliability; indebtedness; economic stability; the right to operate a trade enabling the pursuit of an activity related to authorisation; a situation where the claimant is not in liquidation or bankruptcy.
In particular, the aim of the legislation was to address the issue of the emergence of tax arrears, namely by reducing operators with a licence to deal with products subject to excise duty taxation.
The economic stability condition newly allows the tax authority to take into account the financial situation of tax entities both within the authorisation procedure and after the authorisation has been issued.
The purpose of this measure is to prevent entities that do not have sufficient financial income to properly comply with their tax obligations in order to dispose of the products selected.
Indicators have been established to assess the economic stability of the proposer (capacity, liquidity, financial stability, activity, labour productivity) on the basis of which a financial analysis is carried out.
In addition to these indicators, it is also up to the administrative discretion of the tax administrator with regard to the individual conditions of the procedure.
The law stipulates the periodicity of examining the fulfilment of the condition of economic stability due to the timeliness of the data - the screening takes place once a year following the deadline for filing a return on income tax.
The tax administrator has the possibility to set other conditions needed for the administration of the tax.
If the authorisation holder does not comply with the conditions, the tax administrator is entitled to revoke the authorisation or, if necessary, cancel the permit.
Of the 2,609 entities for which the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic examined the condition of economic stability, 18.6% were found to be economically unstable at a high risk of arrears if the tax liability exceeds the amount of tax security (e.g. repeated beneficiaries).
The permit was revoked by 10 entities, other applicants increased the tax collateral, capitalised their deposit into the company or substantiated up-to-date accounting data, according to which they had already fulfilled all the conditions for issuing the permit.
In addition to the applicant, the conditions of reliability and indebtedness must be met by a natural person who is a statutory body or a member of the statutory body, or a natural person who, while not being the appellant's statutory body or a member of it, carries out that activity (sponsorship of legal persons as a statutory body or its member, so-called established entities).
By the end of 2016, more than 30,000 established entities had been examined.
The records kept under the Excise Tax Act (Sections 37 to 40 and Section 60 of Act No 353/2003 Coll.) contain data on:
the type, name, code and quantity of goods manufactured, taken over, issued or dispatched, broken down by type of tax treatment regime (contingent exemption scheme, import, re-entry into the conditional exemption regime, export, free tax circulation, self-consumption, loss);
the identifier (SEED ID) of the recipient or supplier of the selected products, the declarant, the date of the occurrence and registration;
transport of selected products (e.g. means of transport, carriers, transport number);
registration numbers of related documents;
notification of the placing of alcohol in a consumer package marked with a check band for free tax circulation and details of its distribution.
The post-transport takeover record must be made without delay after it has been completed.
In the case of records kept electronically, the record must be kept or allowed to output in xls, xlsx, ods.
Líh
After 2012, the Czech Republic introduced a complex of measures designed to provide a detailed overview of the activities of the entities (see Annex 3, Scheme A) from the production of raw alcohol through the marking of control tape to its distribution to the final seller or the authorized user of the exempt spirit.
In the Czech Republic, the supervision of customs authorities is also subject to production facilities for the production of alcohol, which is not in operation.
The aim of the new legislation was to increase the overview of the processing of alcohol and the production of spirits and to identify persons handling alcohol in consumer packaging, to reduce the management of alcohol to financially stable and reliable persons, and to ensure constant supervision of the production and labelling of spirits.
The most significant measures are: The records of the production, reception, inventory and the issuance of alcohol contain information on the amount of alcohol according to the stages of alcohol production and processing, indicating the document numbers.
Limiting the volume of consumer packaging, packaging material and limiting the number of packages with broken control tape at the point of sale or issue to the consumer.
Consumer packaging means a container or other container of max. one litre or three litres if it is a container made of glass.
Spirits in larger packages are viewed as unmarked, which it is forbidden to dispose of.
At the point of the final sale to a natural person for his personal consumption, there may be a maximum of one consumer pack with broken control tape, or three if they are fitted with a single-way valve.
Mandatory registration of a person who lists ethyl alcohol in products in consumer packaging having at least 15 % volumetric alcohol for free tax circulation and is: importer of alcohol, alcohol producer in the Czech Republic or operator of a tax warehouse under a conditional exemption regime, provided that personal and technical conditions are met.
Personal terms - reliability, integrity and failure to declare a disqualification - must be met by the applicant and the person in the capacity of the statutory body or the responsible representative.
The applicant must provide a deposit of CZK 100,000 to CZK 5,000,000 (i.e. approx. €3,700 to €185,000), depending on the anticipated amount of control strips taken.
The technical conditions for registration are a suitable place for alcohol marking and the equipment of the marking point or tax warehouse with a camera surveillance device with continuous operation and remote access of the tax administrator.
The registration markings of the control tape are introduced for the marking of spirits with a volume of more than 0,06 litres.
When carrying control tapes, the registration marking of control bands shall be included in the transport documents or customs declaration at the time of export.
The control tape until 30.11.2013 contained a 10-digit registration code, which included a four-digit registration number, the application code for the allocation of control tapes and a classification code according to the level of volume concentration of ethanol.
The control tape from 1.12.2013 newly contains two types of identifiers and the amount of alcohol in consumer packaging expressed in millilitres of ethanol at 20 °C, with rounding to the whole milliliters downwards.
The register of control bands to mark spirits contains daily entries on individual ways of handling control tapes according to the registration codes, as well as documents on the basis of which the registration took place.
In the event of the destruction, loss or theft of specific control tapes, their holder is obliged to notify the tax administrator by electronic means the registration code of the control tapes concerned and their number on the following working day following the operative event.
Introducing the new facts of the offences and adjusting the level of penalties imposed for infringements of the legislation when dealing with control tapes.
Penalties may be imposed up to or exceeded by up to ten times the amount of excise duty (e.g. when control strips are destroyed or lost in a number exceeding 0,1 % of the total quantity of the individual orders of control tapes made, if the control tape is not returned within the statutory time limit).
Restrictions on the handling of control tapes only to registered holders who may not assign them to another person, with the exception of providing them to a foreign supplier for the purpose of indicating spirits in consumer packaging manufactured outside the Czech Republic.
The checked tapes exported must be placed on consumer packaging and imported back no later than nine months after receipt from the tax administrator.
Compulsory registration of a distributor of alcohol in consumer packaging, subject to the fulfilment of similar personal conditions as for the person obligated to mark alcohol and with the obligation to deposit a deposit of up to CZK 5,000,000 (i.e. around €185,000).
Defining persons for the sale or purchase of alcohol in consumer packaging.
Authorised persons are obliged to sell alcohol in consumer packaging to other registered persons or final sellers, or they may sell them as final sellers.
They can pick up alcohol from other registered persons, insolvency administrator, administration, organisational units of the state or non-registered persons in the execution of tax execution.
Notices of the inclusion of alcohol or sale in consumer packaging for free tax circulation shall be required to send the alcohol to the tax administrator immediately the following day after the relevant fact to the tax administrator through an information system maintained by the tax administrator (ORO web client) or while respecting the content in the xml format.
The notification shall include the number of control bands used, the volume and type of consumer packaging, the volume percentage of alcohol, the European goods code (EAN), the identification of the distributor or the final vendor, as well as the name of the product and the batch of production.
Tax entities sent about 10.5 million notifications in 2014 and 2015.
Compulsory concession (specific form of trade licence) not only for the production and modification of alcohol, but also for the sale of alcohol in consumer packaging by the entrepreneur to a natural person for his personal use or to another legal or business license to a natural person for his own internal use.
Concession trades can only be performed once a decision is made by the Trade Licensing Authority upon the fulfilment of professional competence and other conditions.
No prescribed professional qualification is required for the sale of alcohol.
The benefit for tax administrators is an overview of retailers and their establishments and restrictions
trading on reliable entities.
In the Czech Republic, for a field including the production, treatment of fermentation, alcohol of consumerism, spirits and other alcoholic beverages, and sales were registered in 2014 about 94 thousand and in 2015 about 104 thousand concessions.
Checks on compliance with legislation in the field of handling products subject to excise duties in the Czech Republic also ensure in their activities outside the tax administrator: trade licensing offices, the State Agricultural and Food Inspection Authority, the authorities of the Financial Administration of the Czech Republic, the authorities of the Czech Trade Inspection Authority.
If it finds that there has been a breach of the obligation or a breach of the prohibition, it shall inform the excise administrator without delay.
Mineral oils
The Czech Republic has introduced a comprehensive system of supervision (see Annex 3, Scheme B), to which mineral oils loaded with excise duties are subject, but also selected mineral oils of excise duty unburdened, which have been misused for tax evasion.
The system includes supervision from mineral oil production through storage, transport, marking and dyeing of selected mineral oils, marking of certain other mineral oils to delivery to the final consumer or user and, in some cases, mineral oil consumption.
Customs supervision also includes the manufacture of markings for the marking of mineral oils and the management of these substances.
The labelling and colouring of selected mineral oils are subject to mineral oils listed under Combined Nomenclature codes 2710 19 25 (petrol other), 2710 19 29 (other not elsewhere specified medium oils) and heavy gas oils 2710 19 41, 2710 19 45 and 2710 19 49 unless their tagging is prohibited.
The labelling of certain other mineral oils is subject to e.g. benzol, toluene, xylol and lubricating oils and other oils intended for purposes other than engine propulsion.
Mark and colour selected mineral oils and some other mineral oils with a marker is only possible on the basis of the tax administrator's permission.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The most significant new measures since 2012:
Monitoring of the handling of special mineral oils, which is a group of mineral oils under the Combined Nomenclature codes 2710 19 71 to 2710 19 99 (i.e. lubricating oils and other oils intended for purposes other than engine propulsion), whose kinematic viscosity at 40 °C is less than 12 mm2. s-1 inclusive and have at least one of the following characteristics: the flash point is less than 150 °C, the distillation test shall be at least 20 % of the volume, including losses up to a temperature of 350 °C.
These mineral oils were misused as an addition to finished fuel, in particular diesel, or were directly used or sold for engine propulsion because the physical characteristics are very similar.
Registration with the tax administrator shall be subject to entities dealing with monitored mineral oils in bulk or in packages exceeding 220 litres.
In order to issue a marketing authorisation, the personal conditions of the applicant, the statutory body and the representative responsible must be met, which applies throughout 2 With the exception of beer, fruit wines, other wines and mead and fruit spirits obtained by burning.
3 Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff.
4 For example, when mineral oil is used as fuel (excluding water navigation if they are not private pleasure craft) or as components for the production of fuel, if the markings are of a defect in their use.
registration.
As of 30 November 2016, the register of persons handling special mineral oils contained 54 valid registrations, on the proposal of the marketing authorisation holder, four registrations were cancelled.
Electronic registration shall include detailed information on the receipt, self-consumption and sale or transfer of mineral oil including document numbers, numbers of notification of acquisition to the tax administrator, place of storage and consumption, purpose of consumption, place of storage and consumption, or on sale, place of delivery and registration number of the customer.
Notification of any acquisition of special mineral oil must be made to the tax authorities at intervals of 24 to 72 hours before admission.
Identification of business partners, name and nomenclature of special mineral oil, quantity, purpose of consumption or sale or transfer information shall be reported.
The notification of the anticipated quantity in the relevant year of the acquired, sold or consumed mineral oil shall be submitted by the body together with the application for registration or by the end of January of the relevant calendar year.
Notifications of the purpose of use and marking, storage or consumption point, identification data of the person who is further sold or transferred by the special mineral oil shall be transmitted before each change.
Notifications are submitted electronically via smart forms or a PDFa data box.
In 2015, persons handling special mineral oils submitted 630 notifications.
The seizure and forfeiture of special mineral oils or, where appropriate, means of transport must be pronounced by the tax administrator in cases where it finds the handling of special mineral oils without registration or where the registered person fails to comply with his notification obligation.
As in the case of failure to comply with obligations in the transport of products subject to excise duties, these deficiencies cannot be remedied retrospectively.
Registration of a fuel distributor is mandatory for persons who sell or are entitled to sell fuel.
Registered fuel distributors may only be persons meeting the following criteria:
Compulsory licence of the Trade Licensing Office (specific form of trade licence).
The application for a concession or, where appropriate, the appointment of the responsible representative, shall be given an opinion by the customs office examining whether the applicant for the concession, the statutory body or the members of the applicant's statutory body - the legal person and the appointed responsible representative fulfil the condition of reliability.
Where such persons satisfy the condition of reliability, the customs office shall issue an affirmative opinion.
A reliable person means a person of integrity, in terms of a criminal-law property nature, customs and tax law.
The condition for the issuance of the concession is professional competence.
The integrity of the same circle of persons as in the case of reliability.
The debtor is a person who provides sufficient guarantees that he will properly and timely fulfil his payment obligations towards the state, i.e. he does not have arrears to the state budget and on general health insurance.
The fuel distributor shall not be subject to a prohibition by the court or administrative authority of the activity preventing the pursuit of its activities.
The fuel distributor shall not be in liquidation or bankruptcy.
The deposit (if any bank guarantee) of CZK 20,000,000 (i.e. about €740,000), which can be reduced to CZK 10,000,000 (i.e. approx. €370,000) after three years of registration by a fuel distributor and the fulfilment of other conditions.
Notice of distribution of fuel is required by the distributor to the customs office within 20 days after the end of the calendar month.
The electronic notification shall include details of individual fuel purchases and sales.
The reported data are details of business partners, document numbers, selected product, quantity, price, carrier and transport, loading point and unloading.
The right to refund the tax on mineral oils consumed in agricultural primary production was reintroduced at the end of 2014.
The refund of excise duty on mineral oils can only be claimed for that activity which is manifestly linked to the activity carried out on land.
In 2015, there were about 64,000 claimed refund claims totalling CZK 1,172,844,680 (i.e. €43,401,720).
Since 2017, the government of the Czech Republic has also introduced the refund of excise duty on fuel to livestock farmers.
Newly, farmers or breeders who deal with cattle, pigs, poultry, sheep and goats, for example, will be able to claim this entitlement.
Tobacco products
Restrictions on the sale of tobacco products at the old tax rate
In response to the long-term below-budgeted revenue from excise duty on tobacco products, the Czech Republic introduced, with effect from 1 December 2014, a restriction on the sale of tobacco products at the old rate of tax in the event of a change in the tax rate.
Excise duty on tobacco products is paid by the use of tobacco stickers.
The use of a tobacco sticker means its placement on unit packing (Section 116 of the Excise Tax Act).
For the application of the rate of excise duty, the production of a tobacco product in a state intended for the final consumer is decisive, with no need to remove it, supply, dispatch or sale or sale to the final consumer.
The letter of the alphabet characterising the excise duty rate is shown on the tobacco label together with the price for the final consumer of cigarettes, the label also lists the number of pieces in the pack or the amount of smoking tobacco in kilograms.
The tobacco sticker has no identifier.
The length of the transitional period for the sale of unit packs of cigarettes intended for direct consumption and bearing a tobacco label with a previous (old) rate of tax was established until the end of the last day of the second calendar month following the application of the new rate of excise duty.
The evolution of tobacco stickers in 2014 and the comparison with developments in previous years show that tobacco manufacturers have significantly frontloaded tobacco products with an "old" tax rate each year, resulting in a de facto shift in the effectiveness of the "new" tax rate by about one year.
Tax on raw tobacco
Due to the misuse of raw tobacco for the production of tobacco products without the authorisation of the tax administrator and the non-payment of excise duty, a raw tobacco tax and monitoring the handling of raw tobacco were introduced as anti-tax fraud measures.
With effect from 1 July 2015, the excise duty shall be subject to raw tobacco which has not been used or delivered for the manufacture of tobacco products to another Member State or third country or for which the origin, use or person to be supplied or to be supplied with raw tobacco has not been established.
Restrictions on dealing with raw tobacco
Measures such as the supervision of the transport and production of tobacco products, the marking of unit packs with control tape and the restriction of sales at the designated sites have been supplemented by restrictions on the handling of raw tobacco.
Production equipment for the processing of tobacco raw material and the manufacture of tobacco products is not subject to the supervision of customs authorities.
Only a registered person may store raw tobacco for a purpose other than the manufacture of tobacco products, but such tobacco may not be further processed or modified.
Only a person who meets the personal circumstances of the applicant, the statutory body and the responsible representative may be a registered person, which is valid throughout the registration.
The conditions of registration are: (a) the authorisation to operate a trade allowing the performance of the activity of the person storing raw tobacco, (b) reliability, (c) indebtedness, (d) the fact that the person storing raw tobacco has not been banned from operating activities, (e) the fact that the person storing raw tobacco is not in liquidation or bankruptcy, (f) the provision of a deposit of 20 000 000 CZK (i.e. approx. 740 000 €).
Electronic registration shall include the date of receipt or dispensing of raw tobacco, the document number, identification of the trading partner, the quantity and type of raw tobacco.
Notification of any acquisition of raw tobacco by a person storing raw tobacco shall be made to the tax authorities between 24 and 72 hours prior to receipt or dispatch.
Details of the trading partner, the quantity of raw tobacco, the address of storage, the purpose of use and the details of the carrier shall be reported.
The notice of the anticipated quantity in the relevant year of received or dispatched raw tobacco shall be submitted by the body together with the application for registration or by the end of January of the relevant calendar year.
Notifications are submitted electronically by a PDFa data box.
The transport of raw tobacco must be accompanied by a document with the prescribed essentials.
Legislative of excise duties in SR
The legal framework regulating excise duties in the SR is based on EU legislation and thus co-creates its single tax system.
Individual types of excise taxes are exhaustively determined by SR legislation, which is similar to the legislation of the surrounding countries.
Definition of legislation in the Slovak Republic
The legislative regulation of excise duties is ensured by four laws according to individual subject-matter of the tax.
Harmonisation was achieved by the adoption of the following laws on excise duties: Act No 98/2004 Z. z., on excise duty on mineral oils, Act No 106/2004 Z. z., on excise duty on tobacco products, Act No 530/2011 Z. z., on excise duty on alcoholic beverages, Act No 609/2007 Z. z., on excise duty on electricity, coal and natural gas.
All excise tax laws are rules of substantive law and deal with the taxation of the subject-matter of excise duties in the tax territory.
Act No 563/2009 Z. z., on tax administration (tax rules), is a matter of procedural law, regulating the administration of taxes, rights and obligations of tax entities and others.
This legal framework transposed the individual provisions of Council Directive 2008/118/EC of 16 December 2008 on the general arrangements for excise duty and repealing Directive 92/12/EEC, and transposed the provisions of other directives and legislation of the European Community.
Structure of legislative changes for individual types of excise duties in relation to the subject of control in the Slovak Republic
Since 2011, legislation on the administration of excise duties has undergone several major changes according to the structure of individual excise duties.
In EMCS, the monitoring of the transport of selected products subject to excise duties under a conditional exemption scheme has been changed from a documentary accompanying administrative document to an exclusively electronic system where these services are monitored in real time.
Under the EMCS electronic system, an institute of suspension of access to EMCS was introduced in 2015.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The customs office has the option of suspending access precisely on justified concern about the non-payment or undetermined tax on previous tax periods and its unenforceability.
This applies to the maturity of the tax, as the transport of excise goods requires the composition of the collateral, which shall, however, be released by the end of transport.
Excise duty on mineral oils
A major change in the administration of excise duty on mineral oils occurred in 2011, when the possibility of using so-called red diesel was abolished.
The gas oil, commonly also called red diesel, was one of the mineral oils.
In the past, red diesel was used for specific legally defined purposes, e.g. in agriculture, and its use was favoured by a lower rate of excise duty.
This change had a positive impact on the revenue part of the state budget.
The abolition of red diesel was aimed at reducing the public deficit, simplifying the system for taxing mineral oils and reducing the administrative burden on the business entities concerned.
In 2012, a new type of tax entity was created, namely a fuel seller.
The purpose of this legal change was to introduce a registration obligation for all petrol stations.
Clarification of the movement of taxed gasoline and diesel is linked to the obligation to buy petrol and diesel from a fuel distributor.
In 2014, new institute institutes of tax entities were introduced, namely a fuel distributor and a fuel consumer.
That change contributed to the elimination of tax evasion for petrol and diesel and clarified the movement of these propellants (see Annex 4, Scheme A).
As part of the fight against tax evasion, legal provisions on the registration of tax entities trading lubricating and base oils have been extended.
In the SR, however, these mineral oils are not subject to the obligation to designate an indication.
Excise duty on tobacco products
In order to combat tax evasion and the monitoring of tobacco raw material, the scope of the Tobacco Raw Materials Act has been extended and a new tax entity - a tobacco raw material trader - has been introduced.
Tobacco raw material is not a harmonised tobacco product and its movement is not monitored within the EU.
In addition, an obligation was introduced to record technological equipment for the production of tobacco products.
The legislation has brought about a new system for ordering, judging, printing, distribution and use of check marks designed to mark consumer packaging of tobacco products.
The checkpoint refers to cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos and tobacco.
Under the new system, the purchaser of the check marks must apply to the customs office electronically for the issue of the check marks by means of an information system for the collection of control marks.
This step introduced electronic communication between the tax entity and the tax administrator.
One state stamp printer was set up – in the Kremnice Mincovna.
The exercise of the tax oversight of the printing of control stamps was also introduced.
The changes have contributed significantly to the elimination of tax evasion.
The new system for printing check marks strengthens the goods control system, as a unique identification number is generated on the check mark, which can simply verify whether the goods come from legal sources.
A unique 12-digit identification number (1-2nd place is the check sum; 3rd place determines whether the code belongs to a checkpoint or a group of packages; 4th place is a series identifier; 5th-8th place is the alphanumeric part of the sequence; 9.-12th place is the decimal part of the sequence) can also be applied in the form of a two-dimensional barcode.
The checkpoint intended for the labelling of cigarettes must also indicate the price of cigarettes, the emblem for the validity of the excise duty rate, the number of cigarettes in consumer packaging and the length of cigarettes.
Excise duty on alcoholic beverages
The biggest legislative change affected alcohol, wine and beer because the original three substantive law regulations were repealed and one common law on excise duty on alcoholic beverages was created.
The law was developed mainly because of the need for a comprehensive solution to the issue of the taxation of alcoholic beverages, the management of their production, the monitoring of movements, the provision of the tax, as well as the need to improve the business environment in the area, to streamline the performance of tax administration, to reduce the administrative burden for small and medium-sized entrepreneurs.
A new way of addressing the issue of taxation of individual types of alcoholic beverages introduced the use of a uniform rate of excise duty on alcoholic beverage and took into account the volume percentage of actual alcohol content.
For non-fat wine, sparkling wine and fermented beverages, the volume percentage of actual alcoholic strength in the final product is taken into account.
The concentration of beer is also expressed as a percentage of the actual alcoholic strength in the finished product.
A category of small-scale fermented beverages has been introduced, the essence of which is to exempt from excise duty for a natural person who produces a sparkling fermented self-consumption drink and for the consumption of his household for a maximum of 1 000 litres per marketing year.
The legislation has brought about a new system for ordering, assessing, printing, distributing and using check marks for labelling consumer alcohol packaging.
Under the new system, the purchaser of the check marks must apply to the customs office electronically for the issue of the check marks by means of an information system for the collection of control marks.
This step introduced electronic communication between the tax entity and the tax administrator.
One state stamp printer was set up – in the Kremnice Mincovna.
The exercise of the tax oversight of the printing of control stamps was also introduced.
The changes contributed significantly to the elimination of tax evasion (see Annex 4, Schedule B) and the elimination of falsification of control signs.
The new system for printing check marks strengthens the goods control system, as a unique identification number is generated on the check mark, which can simply verify whether the goods come from legal sources.
A unique 12-digit identification number (1-2nd place is the check sum; 3rd place determines whether the code belongs to a checkpoint or a group of packages; 4th place is a series identifier; 5th-8th place is the alphanumeric part of the sequence; 9.-12th place is the decimal part of the sequence) can also be applied in the form of a two-dimensional barcode.
Comparison and evaluation
Comparison
Excise taxes on alcohol, mineral oils, tobacco products, beer, wine and intermediate products are regulated in the Czech Republic by one common Act No. 353/2003 Coll.
Solid fuel tax, tax on natural gas and certain other gases and electricity tax are part of Act No 261/2007 Coll.
In contrast, in the Slovak Republic, every excise duty is regulated by a special law, except for the Excise Tax Act on alcoholic beverages, which contains a tax on alcohol, beer, wine and intermediate products.
A special law regulates excise duty on electricity, coal and natural gas.
In the Czech Republic, as of 1 January 2015, the issue of an authorisation to dispose of products subject to excise duty under the Excise Tax Act is conditional, among other things, on the demonstration of the economic stability of applicants, which customs authorities verify annually by carrying out a financial analysis.
In the SR, a similar form of analysis is carried out only when deciding to waive or reduce tax security.
FŘ SR exercises tax supervision in the form of the presence of an employee of the Financial Directorate over the handling of control marks for the marking of alcohol and tobacco products, their disposal in the printer and their sale to individual customers.
The law stipulates that the production of control stamps is provided by the state enterprise Mincovna Kremnica.
The production of tobacco stickers and control tapes in the Czech Republic is not introduced in the printing works by customs authorities.
He will take the tobacco stickers and control tapes from the printer commissioned territorial office of the customs office in Kutná Hora.
Tobacco stickers are taken over by their customers at this territorial workplace, the control tapes to mark alcohol are further distributed to individual locally competent tax authorities according to the location of the marking.
The legislation of the Czech Republic does not define the manufacturers of tobacco stickers and control tapes.
In the SR there is an obligation to register technological equipment for the production of tobacco products or its part, in the Czech Republic such an obligation is not introduced.
In the Czech Republic, the tobacco sticker bears the excise duty on tobacco products, which is paid when collecting tobacco stickers at the designated customs office.
In the SR, on the other hand, the control mark does not contain excise duty on tobacco products.
In the Czech Republic, a refund of excise duty on mineral oils was introduced in the Czech Republic in the case of their use for agricultural plant primary production, the so-called green diesel.
Since 2017, this tax refund has been extended to livestock production.
In the SR, such support for farmers is not introduced (it existed until 31.12.2010 as so-called red diesel).
To strengthen the fight against tax fraud, bail of CZK 20 million was introduced for fuel distributors in the Czech Republic. CZK (i.e. 740 thousand €).
As a result of the introduction of this measure, the number of fuel distributors was reduced from 1,891 entities in 2013 to 174 in 2014 (i.e. a decrease of 1,717 tax entities).
A similar institute of a fuel distributor is introduced in the SR, but without the deposit of the deposit needed to ensure excise duty on mineral oils.
There were 303 distributors registered in the SR in 2014 and 407 distributors were registered in 2015.
In the SR, an institute of a fuel seller and a fuel consumer is in place, which is authorised by the locally competent customs office.
Such an institute is not introduced in the Czech Republic.
In the Czech Republic, selected mineral oils and also some other mineral oils are subject to labelling, in the Slovak Republic, after the abolition of so-called red diesel, the labelling of mineral oils is not applied.
In the Czech Republic, the alcohol marking control tape contains an eight-digit individual code used to verify the origin of the alcohol and a 12-digit registration code indicating the spirit drink, according to which a record of control tapes is kept.
Destruction, loss and return of the control tape are entered in the register the following working day.
The holder of the tape is obliged to notify their use within the same time limit.
In SR, the control mark intended to mark alcohol in consumer packaging contains a unique 12-digit identification number, which, if used once a month, is communicated to the tax administrator and is used to verify the authenticity of the check mark.
The register contains the number of collected, used and claimed check marks.
Both the Czech Republic and Slovakia introduced the institute of mandatory registration or registration of the distributor of alcohol.
In the SR, registration is subject to compliance with, inter alia, a storage area exceeding 200 m2; an annual turnover from the sale of a consumer pack of alcohol at least €100,000 or a paid-up equity of at least €100,000; a minimum of 10 employees.
In the Czech Republic, obtaining a registration is subject, among other things, to deposit a deposit of CZK 5,000,000 (i.e. €185,000) in favour of the tax administrator for the entire period of validity of the registration.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In Slovakia, the production of alcohol not only in consumer packaging requires a permanent presence of the tax administrator.
In the Czech Republic, the production of alcohol in consumer packaging requires a special form of registration of a person obligated to mark alcohol with the condition of posting bail in favour of the tax administrator from CZK 100,000 (i.e. €3,700) up to CZK 5,000,000 (i.e. €185,000) depending on the amount of control strips collected and the installation of a tracking device with the continuous approach of the tax administrator.
Evaluation
The legislation of the Czech Republic and Slovakia far exceeds the EU's minimum requirements for subject matter and administration of excise duties and responds to identified risks from other Member States as well as to the risks identified in tax territories.
Legislative changes adopted in the audited period allow tax administrations to more pre-empt the emergence of possible tax evasion.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, in the fight against tax evasion in the form of misuse of tobacco raw material (e.g. sheets), an excise tax on raw tobacco or tobacco raw material has been introduced beyond EU legislation.
Although raw tobacco and tobacco raw material are not a harmonised tobacco product, they monitor both the Czech Republic and Slovakia's movements.
The SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic can recommend that this measure be applied in other EU Member States.
In the Czech Republic, good practice has shown that the examination of economic stability for applicants for authorisation under the Excise Tax Act has proved successful because it reduces the risks of tax arrears.
For this reason, both audit institutions recommend applying such vetting also in SR conditions.
The distribution of check marks in the Slovak Republic is more efficient than in the Czech Republic because it does not burden customs authorities with the costs associated with transport between the printer and the customer of control tapes and tobacco stickers.
The SR Financial Administration has a better overview of the existence and location of technological equipment for the production of tobacco products.
In the Czech Republic, however, the collection of tax on tobacco products is more efficient, because the tobacco sticker order itself is a tax return with a subsequent tax payment.
Thanks to the introduction of "propellant sellers" and "fuel consumer" institutes, the financial administration in Slovakia has a better overview of fuel sales points.
The introduction of mandatory mineral oil labelling in the Czech Republic makes it easier to control the misuse of mineral oils with a reduced tax rate or exempt.
In the Czech Republic (2013) and in SR (2014) a new control tape, or a stamp containing the identification code, was introduced.
The control tape in the Czech Republic also contains a registration code, while in Slovakia the new legislation has abandoned its introduction.
The impacts cannot yet be assessed due to the short effectiveness of legislative changes.
The introduction of effective labelling of consumer packaging of alcohol by a control mark or tape is an effective measure in the fight against tax evasion.
The SAO of the Slovak Republic and the SAO of the Czech Republic may also recommend the introduction of this control measure in other Member States.
The SR's position on the conditions for the distribution of alcohol is characterised by a pro-ient approach that does not block the funds of tax entities.
By contrast, the Czech Republic's approach is rather restrictive because it introduces a bail burdening the cash flow of tax entities, but it further reduces the risk of tax arrears.
Development of income from excise duties
Excise duty is an indirect tax introduced by the State to increase the revenue of the state budget and also to regulate the quantity of goods sold, the consumption of which is considered harmful to the individual and/or to society (regulatory functions of the tax).
According to the Communication from the Commission: EUROPE 2020 - A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth of 3.3.2010 under the flagship initiative Europe less resource-intensive, the European Commission's intention is to improve the market-based framework for the use of instruments, including in the form of a revision of energy taxation with a focus on reducing energy consumption and resources.
In order to fulfil the EC's intention, Member States should seek to shift the tax burden from the workforce, including to energy and environmental taxation, as part of greater "environmental" tax systems.
The collection of tax revenues from excise duties in the Czech Republic and Slovakia includes the collection of excise duty on mineral oils, tobacco products, alcohol, beer, wine and intermediate products, as well as natural gas, solid fuels and electricity.
The share of excise duties in total tax revenues and share of GDP is also monitored by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), among others.
Both supreme audit institutions used the following selection criteria to enter a query on the OECD website.
Collection of excise duties in relation to macroeconomic indicators in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, the share of excise duties in total tax revenues and the share of GDP fell slightly, according to OECD data.
The exchange rate of the European Central Bank of the ECB was used to convert the amounts in CZK to EUR 31.12. of the relevant year.
The nominal exchange rate of CZK against € in 2013 weakened by 9.1% year-on-year compared to 2012 (from 25,140 to 27,425).
This was mainly due to the CNB Bank Board's monetary policy decision of 7 November 20136.
The resulting values of collection of excise duties, excise duties and income per capita in € have decreased significantly due to the exchange rate difference.
The significant reduction in the share of excise duties in 2014 was due to a one-off shortfall in excise duty revenues from tobacco products due to the impact of new legislation restricting the sale of old-tax tobacco products.
The share of excise duties is also influenced by the rise in revenue tax collection, which has grown significantly as a result of the improved overall economic situation of the Czech Republic.
The excise tax on mineral oils accounts for the largest share of the total collection of excise duties (about 55.7% in 2015), but this fell despite significant economic growth compared to 2012.
The collection of excise duty on mineral oils in 2013 and 2014 was significantly lower than in 2012 and 2015, although registration of fuel distributors was introduced in 2013 as anti-tax fraud measures.
The trend of environmentally-saving vehicles and the promotion of biofuels are negatively reflected in the tax revenue.
A negligible share is the tax on natural gas, the tax on solid fuels and the electricity tax, which is due to the low tax rate, which is close to the minimum rates set by the EU, compared to the surrounding states.
In the future, if there is no rate hike, their share will decline in the future in view of the ever-increasing energy performance of buildings and production processes.
The collection of excise duty on alcohol in 2013 and 2014 was negatively affected by the repercussions of a large-scale case of tax fraud consisting in the marketing of untaxed alcohol, alcohol containing methanol or insufficiently denatured alcohol in the form of spirits.
In 2015, following the adoption of a series of measures against such conduct and the recovery of the spirits market, the collection of excise duty on alcohol exceeded by EUR 4 million.
The share of the tax on tobacco products increased as a result of rising rates.
The basic rates of excise duties changed between 2012-2015 for the tobacco tax, where the rate was increased mainly due to compliance with Council Directive 2011/64/EU, on the structure and rates of excise duty on tobacco products.
Due to the CNB's currency intervention, the real rate of excise duties in €, in addition to the tobacco product tax, has fallen significantly. It has risen only slightly for tobacco products.
In relation to price growth, GDP or living standards, the indexation of the excise tax rate is not set, so the function of excise taxes to regulate socially problematic activities may not be fulfilled.
With the economic growth of the Czech Republic and the rise in living standards, real rates of excise duties are decreasing.
7 Indexation – automatic adjustment of a certain economic quantity for inflation, this adjustment takes place on the basis of a law or contract (for pensions paid by the State, it is called indexation).
Collection of excise duties in relation to macroeconomic indicators in the Slovak Republic
The current legislation on excise duties in the SR does not address the indexation of the level of excise duty rates on consumer price developments because they are fixed.

Of all the excise taxes introduced in Slovakia, it is the excise tax on mineral oils that accounts for the largest share of the national budget's full-year tax revenues, while its share did not fall below 52% in the whole audited period.
The second largest share is excise duty on tobacco products.
This tax accounts for an average of around 32% of total collection from excise duties.
Between 2012 and 2015, there was an increase in the collection of excise duty per inhabitant of the SR.
This development is due to a rise in excise duties on tobacco products, higher purchasing power and higher consumption of the population in a given year.
The growth in excise duty collection per inhabitant of the SR is constant and corresponds to the evolution of excise duties on tobacco products, higher purchasing power and higher consumption of the population in a given year.
In the Czech Republic, the reduction in income in € per capita is influenced by the CNB's intervention on the exchange rate of the koruna against the euro.
The difference between the Czech Republic and Slovakia in the total collection from the SPD is mainly due to the collection of excise duty on mineral oils and tobacco products, which is about 2.7 times higher in the Czech Republic, respectively 2.8 times higher, per inhabitant of the Czech Republic, however, the collection for these selected products is already only about 1/3.
This is due to the lower price of these selected products in the Czech Republic due to lower excise tax rates in the Czech Republic and the CZK exchange rate against foreign consumers.
The mineral oil tax also causes greater transit through the Czech Republic and cross-border purchases.
In the case of a tax on tobacco products, growing foreign tourism to the Czech Republic and cross-border purchases have a not insignificant effect.
Evaluation of Real rates of excise duties in the Czech Republic fell as a result of the CNB's interventions.
The share of energy taxes in the Czech Republic and Slovakia in total tax revenues is not rising and there is no shift from labour taxation to tax the consumption of selected products subject to excise duties, which is not in line with EU strategies.
However, the achieved values of the share of excise duties are consistently above average compared to the OECD average.
The overall collection of excise duties is mainly influenced by the change in excise duty rates, the development of economic condition and the behaviour of the population.
Future shortfalls in excise duty collection due to environmental measures subsidised by the State in various forms will need to be replaced by other revenues or by reducing state spending.
By not introducing an indexation of excise duty rates in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, their regulatory functions are reduced and the EU's objectives of a less dependent environmentally dependent on environmentally unsparing sources and reducing dependence on alcohol and tobacco are insufficiently supported.
The higher collection of excise duty per capita in the Czech Republic shows higher consumption of selected products by foreign consumers, which is influenced by the lower total price of selected products in €.
Administrative expenditure of excise duties
The efficiency of administrative costs reflects the correlation between expenditure and revenue related to the administration of excise duties, i.e. it expresses the amount of expenditure per 100 units of revenue (CZK, €).
The higher the resulting value, the worse the efficiency of administrative costs.
The efficiency of the tax administrator in tax administration is influenced by the scope and organisational layout of the tax administrator, the management of the organization, the legal environment and the level of electronization of individual activities.
The determination of the efficiency of the administrative costs of tax administration by the conversion coefficient method is based on the number of employees involved in the administration of excise duties in a line-based structure.
In the Czech Republic, the administration of excise duties is carried out by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, which is a separate organizational unit of the state and the accounting unit.
In the Slovak Republic, the tax administration is provided by the Financial Administration of the Slovak Republic, while the customs authorities are an internal organisational unit, costs and revenues are included collectively for the entire organisational unit.
Therefore, in view of the possibility of comparing the efficiency of the administration of excise duties, the expenses and revenues of the Financial Administration of the Czech Republic were included in the calculation of the efficiency of administrative costs.
Administrative costs of excise tax administration in the Czech Republic
The administration of excise duties is a complex of administrative tasks carried out mainly by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.
Some sub-control operations are carried out by other public authorities, but their importance is negligible.
In particular, the administration of excise duties shall be carried out by the following departments:
General Directorate of Customs
Department 23 DAŇOVÝ

Administrative costs of excise tax management in the SR
Since 1 January 2012, the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic has undergone a challenging transformation process in accordance with the approved UNITAS programme.
The formation of the FŘ SR was also reflected in the composition of the employees of the newly created departments of the merged customs and tax administration.
In relation to the performance of excise duty management, excise duty management activities within the organisational structure of the FŘ SR have been integrated into a larger number of different sections and related unions.
Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic Section of Customs and Tax Section of the SR Department of Excise Taxes (Loth-Slovakia):
Excise duty separation - directs and coordinates activities in the field of excise duty management; draws up expert opinions; makes proposals and comments on legislative changes; issues decisions on the delegation of territorial jurisdiction to tax authorities; allocate and repeal registration numbers;
the tax supervision department - directs and coordinates activities in the field of tax supervision and tax control; carries out tax supervision;
ELO and SPD systems - guides and coordinates mutual administrative cooperation activities in the field of excise duties, including the exchange of information through SEED and MVS; ensures management and updates in SysNeD and EMCS application equipment;
Unit of the check marks - directs activities in the field of printing and handling of check marks; carries out tax supervision of the loading and disposal of printing sheets and checkpoints in the printer.
The Department of the Vice-President of the Financial Administration
Expert of legal remedies for excise duties and duties (wide-Slovak scope):
the separation of legal remedies for excise duties - reviews the decisions of the customs offices on the basis of the proper and extraordinary remedies applied; the appeal procedure at the second instance of the decision-making process.
The Customs Section was established during 2012; individual customs offices (9 customs offices) which have territorial jurisdiction designated by higher territorial units were directly incorporated under it, with the exception of one customs office established, inter alia, to carry out tasks in relation to the external border of the Community.
Customs offices:
the separation of excise duties - the pursuit of a methodological activity in relation to branches of customs offices and to customs offices' stations; performs direct acts of the tax administrator for selected entities, and this decides on the registration (tax warehouse, authorised recipient repeated, registered consignor), on the amount of tax security, fixes and returns tax, carries out tax supervision and tax control; decides to waive the suspension of the obligation to safeguard the presence of a customs office employee in a liquor tax warehouse;
legal – decision-making activities in respect of tax infringements; activities related to sound and extraordinary remedies; tax enforcement proceedings;
a branch of the customs office - decides on the registration (with the exception of the tax warehouse, the authorised recipient for re-entry, registered consignor), the amount of the security of the tax; prescribes and returns the tax; exercises tax supervision and tax control; decides on the security and forfeiture of the goods;
customs office station - the exercise of tax supervision of the holding and movement of excise goods; ensures the exercise of permanent tax supervision in a liquor tax warehouse; decides on the security and forfeiture of goods.
SR's financial administration's spending on excise tax management is steadily rising as, with the exception of wage growth, investment increases in effective tax administration and computerisation of financial management.
Although revenue from excise duties rose, spending grew faster as a result of IT adjustments related to the UNITAS project.
Wage expenses in the Slovak Republic are significantly affected by the performance of permanent tax supervision in alcohol tax warehouses, which the Czech Republic does not apply.
Expenditure by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic on excise tax management increased significantly between 2012 and 2015 in 2015, this growth was mainly due to increases in wage expenditure and technical support expenditure.
In the Czech Republic, revenues from excise duties also grew at approximately the same rate.
Wage expenses in the Czech Republic are positively influenced compared to the Slovak Republic by the wider competences of the customs administration, e.g. the weighing of trucks, the control of the fulfilment of obligations in connection with the myth.
The efficiency of administrative costs in the Slovak Republic shows a slightly deteriorating trend year-on-year.
The number of employees did not change significantly, but spending per employee grew.
In the Czech Republic, too, the number of employees did not change significantly, but spending per employee grew more slowly compared to SR.
Evaluation
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, wage growth is an important factor in the worsening efficiency of administrative spending, which can be assessed as a natural development.
In both countries, maintaining a significant administrative burden in administering excise duties appears to be a negative factor, confirming an undisturbed number of employees in the field of excise tax administration.
In the SR, however, the administration of excise duties at lower revenues is significantly more demanding on staffing capacity.
Performance indicators of excise tax administration
The management of excise duties is a set of activities aimed at correctly identifying, determining and securing the payment of the tax.
The main processes in the administration of excise duties are tax assessment, authorisation and registration for activities, traffic supervision, control and search of tax entities.
The numbers of administrative tasks and managed entities are indicators of the performance of the tax administrator.
The correlation between the observed indicator and the number of tax administrations expresses the effectiveness of the tax administrator's activities and defines the cost of a particular activity.
Authorisation and registration for activities are a prerequisite for the handling and transport of selected products for commercial purposes under a suspensive exemption scheme.
The tax administrator is obliged to carry out a continuous administration with a view to supervising the fulfilment of the legislation and the conditions laid down by the tax administrator, for which adequate staff resources must be allocated.
The indicator monitored was the number of valid permits or registrations to operate on 31 December of each year.
The number of permits or registrations issued is not the same as the number of tax entities.
Administrative acts are specific administrative acts in the case.
The administrative tasks monitored are the most significant actions of the tax administrator (tax declaration, administration of transport in EMCS), or activities which are the sequence of acts concluded by a report or decision.
Performance indicators in the Czech Republic
Permission and registration for activities in the Czech Republic
Tax warehouse:
It is possible to produce, process, store, receive or dispatch selected products on the basis of the tax administrator's permission to operate a tax warehouse.
If the tax warehouse operator has multiple warehouses, the authorisation for each shall be issued separately, including the security of the tax.
Tax security is not required in the case of distilleries under the permanent tax supervision of the tax administrator (i.e. the physical presence of an official and the provision of equipment by the tax administrator's conclusions).
In the Czech Republic, permanent tax supervision is not applied.
The operator of a tax warehouse is also registered for tax under Section 125 of Act No. 280/2009 Coll.
Authorisation to operate a tax warehouse is a condition for the transport of selected products suspended from tax purposes to a tax warehouse, to an authorised consignee in another Member State, to an export point in another Member State or to a consignee in another Member State (replaces the status of registered consignor pursuant to Article 4(10) of Council Directive 2008/118/EC).
Tax warehouse statistics do not include authorisations for the acquisition of electricity, natural gas and solid fuels, excluding tax purposes, which are analogous to the authorisation of a tax warehouse.
Growing brandy produces alcohol with a reduced 50% tax rate (14,300 CZK/hl ethanol) – fruit spirits for growers. It is not tax in stock and the permit for operation is issued by the Ministry of Agriculture.
The reduced tax rate can be applied to 30 litres of pure alcohol per household of a grower intended for personal consumption over the production period (July-June).
The registration of cultivation burning, which is kept by the operators of the distillery and made available to the tax authorities, must contain information on the grower, the basic raw material, the distillate issued, the origin of the fruit and the production of the distillate.
A beneficiary authorised for the re-admission of selected products and authorised beneficiaries for the one-off acceptance of selected products shall, on the basis of the authorisation of the tax administrator and the conditions laid down, be entitled to accept or repeatedly accept selected products in a conditional system carried from another Member State.
The beneficiary is not the operator of the tax warehouse and may not store or dispatch the selected products under the suspensive exemption scheme.
The user of selected products exempt from tax is a legal or natural person who accepts and uses, or according to Section 52a or 53 of Act No 353/2003 Coll., sells selected products exempt to another user; users have the status of tax entities without the obligation to register for tax purposes.
Exempt-free products may be accepted and used only on the basis of a final authorisation, and only from the supplier referred to in the permit.
On the basis of a permit, exempt mineral oils may be sold to another holder of an authorisation for use or to a user who is entitled to use mineral oils without authorisation.
Without a permit, exempt mineral oils may be sold in statutory cases, e.g.:
waste oils in quantities of less than 10 000 litres per calendar year if the user produced them themselves or were created during its operation,
exempt mineral oils collected in unit packings of not more than 20 litres intended for purposes other than engine propulsion or heat production, while intended for sale to the final consumer.
It is possible to transport exempt selected products with an exemption document.
The distributor of alcohol in consumer packaging is entitled, after compulsory registration with the tax administrator, to sell or otherwise transfer the ethyl alcohol put into free tax circulation.
The warehousekeeper of raw tobacco is entitled, on the basis of registration with the tax administrator and the conditions laid down, to store raw tobacco for a purpose other than the manufacture of tobacco products.
A person dealing with special mineral oils is entitled, on the basis of registration with the tax administrator and the conditions laid down, to acquire, sell or otherwise transfer special mineral oils which are in bulk or placed in a package exceeding 220 litres.
The fuel distributor is entitled, on the basis of the concession issued and the registration of the tax administrator, under specified conditions, to sell fuel in the territory of the Czech Republic, with the exception of the sale of fuel from the service station.
The transport of PHM must be accompanied by a tax document, proof of sale or proof of transport, or a delivery plan and bottling tickets.
These documents may be replaced by electronic documents sent before the commencement of transport to the tax authorities.
The operator of the petrol station is the owner of the fuel sold at the petrol station.
Petrol stations are places where, on the basis of permission from the building authority, the sale or dispensing of PHM is usually allowed into the fuel tank.
The Ministry of Industry and Trade records petrol stations and their operators broken down into: registered – normal sale or dispensing of PHM as a rule to vehicle fuel tanks; with a defined approach – operation generally in various company sites (e.g. quarries, sawmills, agricultural farms, transport organisations, building courts), sales are made here for the other party limited on the basis of specific contractual relations; non-public - fuel dispensing points only for the operator's own consumption.
The pumping station is not the construction or equipment in the form of an operating tank located in operation (e.g. on the chassis) if the fuel is issued for its own use only.
Operating tanks are not subject to the permission of the tax administrator and are not registered.
To buy, receive and sell liquefied petroleum gases put into free tax circulation for resale for resale, natural and legal persons may, on the basis of the authorisation of the tax administrator.
They must also be authorised if they purchase or obtain liquefied petroleum gases for their own consumption exceeding 20 tonnes per calendar year.
Administrative tasks in the Czech Republic
Tax control is a set of actions. Tax control is subject to tax liability, claims made by the taxpayer or other circumstances relevant to the correct determination and determination of the tax relating to a single tax procedure.
Tax control can be carried out jointly for multiple tax proceedings of one taxpayer.
Repeated tax control can only be carried out under the conditions laid down by law and justification at the start of the inspection.
Tax control shall be carried out within the time limit for determining the tax, which is three years, the time limit being extended by one year under the conditions laid down by law (e.g. filing additional tax proceedings, bringing criminal proceedings in relation to the tax in question) or building (court proceedings, international cooperation).
The time limit for determining the tax shall expire at the latest 10 years after the expiry of the period for making a proper tax claim.
The tax administrator is not required to carry out a tax check on each taxpayer.
The start of the tax inspection puts the time limits for the possibility of filing an additional tax return or additional billing by the tax entity (Section 141 of Act No. 280/2009 Coll.) and reopens the running of the time limit for determining the tax (Section 148 of Act No. 280/2009 Coll.).
Based on its outcome, the tax may be charged ex officio.
A local investigation is an individual time-limited act (one day) in which the tax administrator searches for evidence and carries out the examination of premises, goods, documents, records, means of transport and transport packaging with tax entities and other persons involved in the tax administration, on the spot outside the premises of the tax administrator (e.g. at the tax entity, at the point of sale, on the road to transport).
The tax administrator is entitled to borrow documents and belongings, take samples or secure them.
Based on the outcome of the local investigation, tax cannot be separately assessed, but the taxpayer can be asked to file an additional tax return (Section 145(2) of Act No 280/2009 Coll.).
The control of traffic data in EMCS is not a local investigation.
Ordering control bands to mark alcohol may only be submitted to the tax administrator to the locally competent marking point of the markings by the registered person liable for alcohol and is carried out through intelligent forms that are automatically imported into the application of the alcohol marker register.
The tax administrator processes the order, evaluates the adequacy of the ordered amount of control tapes and orders production.
He doesn't supervise the production of control tapes.
Production is provided by the State Securities Printer, a state enterprise.
A purchaser of control tapes takes control tapes from the tax administrator to the locally relevant marking point.
Ordering tobacco stickers to mark cigarettes, cigarillos, cigars and smoking tobacco perform the function of a tax return.
The value of the tobacco sticker corresponds to the amount of the tax liability, whereby the purchaser of the tobacco stickers is obliged to pay their value within 60 days from the date of their removal from the tax administrator.
The customer is obliged to calculate in the order himself the value corresponding to the amount of tax liability of the ordered tobacco stickers.
This period applies only if the value of the tobacco stickers is secured.
The order of tobacco stickers shall be submitted on a form set out by the Ministry of Finance in writing or via a data box with the possibility of using intelligent forms.
The production of tobacco stickers is provided by the State Securities Printer, a state enterprise.
The designated tax administrator, which is the Customs Office for the Central Bohemian Region (Kutná Hora territorial workplace), ensures the purchase and transport of tobacco stickers to the tax administrator, which further distributes them and further examines their transport, storage and use with customers.
Tax claims include proper tax returns, additional and corrective tax returns, including tobacco sticker orders, filed by tax entities.
Included is not the allocation of tax under the customs procedure on the basis of customs declarations and the granting of claims for refunds on: mineral oils used for the production of heat, other petrol used in the course of a business other than for the production of heat or engine propulsion, mineral oils used for agricultural primary production.
The fines imposed include administrative proceedings to deal with established infringements, a set of successive administrative acts. The international exchange of information on tax entities (ELO) within the meaning of Council Regulation (EU) No 389/2012 takes place in the form of: requests for administrative cooperation, response to a request for administrative cooperation, spontaneous information, event reports, inspection reports.
Transport under a conditional tax exemption regime between the Czech Republic and EU Member States - the Czech customs office is the tax administrator of the receiving or sending tax warehouse or authorised recipient.
Performance indicators in SR
Authorisation and registration for activity in the SR
The administration of excise duties in the Slovak Republic is mainly ensured by the customs authorities and the Department of Excise Taxation of the Section of Customs and Taxation of the SR, whose procedure for administering excise duties is governed by individual excise tax laws and the tax code.
These laws provide not only for the scope of the authorisation for the CÚ and the FD of the SR to administer excise duties, but also the rights and obligations of tax entities in connection with the registration or payment of excise duty.
The largest year-on-year increase in tax entities (by 234%) was recorded in 2012 and 2013, due to an increase in tax warehouse permits issued, an increase in the registrations of the beneficiary for re-admission and the registration of a large number of user enterprises.
The legislation refined the transport of certain bulk mineral oils as well as the notification obligation if they are transported freely or in packaging with a content of more than 150 litres or 230 litres, respectively, and also extended the list of mineral oils subject to control and procedure for transport with other goods, such as anti-ticking preparations, oxidative inhibitors, bitumen inhibitors, viscosity improvement products, anti-corrosion products.
For lubricating oils, a mandatory indication was introduced regarding the indication of their kinematic viscosity.
The approximation of the registration process for selected tax entities within the meaning of national legislation in the SR is set out in the following parts of the document.
Operator of a tax warehouse
Under SR's national legislation, when registering a tax warehouse operator under all items of excise duty, a person wishing to operate a tax warehouse must also apply at the same time to register and issue an authorisation to operate a tax warehouse.
The resulting decision in the registration process is the registration certificate for the relevant excise duty, by which the tax warehouse operator obtains legal personality for all tax warehouses.
At the same time, the CÚ shall issue an authorisation to operate a tax warehouse which entitles the tax warehouse operator in that tax warehouse to produce, process, store, receive or dispatch selected products under a conditional exemption scheme.
If the tax warehouse operator has tax warehouses in multiple locations, the tax administrator shall issue a separate licence to operate a tax warehouse for each tax warehouse.
The transport of the subject of excise duty under the suspensive tax regime is monitored electronically through EMCS.
Each shipment generates a unique reference code, the so-called
ARC code under which the transport can be tracked online and therefore in real time.
If the operator of a tax warehouse is also a person authorised to distribute alcohol, it is obliged to notify electronically the commercial name of the consumer pack of alcohol, the volume and volume concentration of alcohol in the consumer packaging of alcohol and the EAN bar code for each new type of consumer packaging which it puts into free tax circulation at the latest on the date of its introduction.
Registered sender
The registered consignor is a special type of taxpayer which cannot also be registered as a tax warehouse operator at the same time, even if it dispatches the subject of excise duty under the suspensive regime after its release for free circulation.
Under the national legislation of the SR when registering a registered consignor under all subject-matter of excise duties, a person wishing to dispatch the subject of excise duty under a suspensive exemption scheme after his release under the customs procedure "free circulation" must also apply to the CCA at the same time for registration and the issue of an authorisation to dispatch the subject of excise duty under that scheme.
The CU shall issue a certificate of registration for the relevant excise duty and at the same time also issue an authorisation to dispatch the subject of excise duty under a suspensive exemption scheme after its release under the customs procedure ‘free circulation’.
Growing brandy
The basic act for the operation of cultivation brandy is to obtain a permit for the production of alcohol in a distilling plant from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Slovak Republic.
However, the permit from the Ministry itself does not entitle the holder of a permit to operate a cultivation distillery.
In order to be able to operate a cultivation distillery, a person must submit an application to the CU for registration and issue a registration certificate for the operator of a distillery.
The CU will issue a certificate of registration for the relevant excise duty, which at the same time authorises the operators of the cultivation distillery for the production of alcohol in the crop distillery.
The purpose of growing distillery is to provide services to growers.
Growing brandy cannot be a tax warehouse.
The legislator allows a reduced rate of tax to be applied to alcohol produced in a growing distillery, amounting to 50 % of the standard tax rate, i.e. 540 €/hl a.
The reduced tax rate shall apply to ethyl alcohol produced in a growing distillery of no more than 43 litres per grower and its household per production period in the tax area.
The production period runs from the 1st 7th current year to the 30th of the following year.
The production period is not the same as the calendar year and therefore it is possible to apply a multiple reduced tax rate to the alcohol produced within one calendar year, as the alcohol is produced in two production periods.
This is the production of alcohol outside the conditional exemption scheme, which in practice means that the alcohol produced is in free tax circulation.
The grower for the alcohol produced will pay the cultivation brandy not only excise duty and value added tax, but also the price for the services provided.
The grower's brandy will issue a removal certificate to the grower, which serves not only as proof of proof of origin and how to acquire alcohol, but also to pay excise duty.
The transport of alcohol thus produced is not subject to monitoring by the tax administrator.
Importer of consumer packaging
National legislation allows persons intending to import consumer packs of ethyl alcohol or cigarettes from the territory of a third country in business and to put it into free tax circulation in the tax territory to apply to the CPC for inclusion in the register of importers of consumer packaging.
The consumer packaging importer shall not register for the relevant excise duty but shall be issued with a certificate of inclusion in the register of importers of consumer packaging.
That certificate authorises the importer to import a consumer pack of alcohol or a consumer pack of cigarettes from the territory of a non-member country.
At the same time, before issuing the check marks, they must lodge a tax guarantee equal to the amount of alcohol or cigarettes it wishes to put into free tax circulation.
The consumer packaging importer must put into free tax circulation only the consumer pack bearing the check mark.
For this reason, it must submit to the customs office the number and identification number of the check marks exported to the territory of a third State.
On importation, the importer is obliged to have the number of check marks imported back from the territory of a third country confirmed by the customs office of importation.
When importing consumer packaging, the importer proceeds within the meaning of customs legislation, where the amount of excise duty is also part of the customs debt.
In the event of the release of consumer packaging for free tax circulation, the tax guarantee lodged shall be returned to the importer or may be used to pay the customs debt.
The consumer packaging importer is not tax in stock.
If the consumer alcohol-pack importer is also the person authorised to distribute the alcohol, he is obliged to notify electronically to the CU the commercial name of the consumer pack of alcohol, the volume and volume concentration of ethyl alcohol in the consumer pack of alcohol and the EAN bar code for each new type of consumer packaging which he puts into free tax circulation at the latest on the date of its entry.
Seller of consumer packaging of alcohol in free tax circulation
In order to monitor the movement of alcohol in free tax circulation and the elimination of tax evasion, the legislator has introduced a new tax institute for the consumer packing of alcohol.
A person who wishes to hold a permit for sale must apply to the CU for authorisation and comply with the legal conditions (business license for a commercial activity; integrity in relation to intentional economic crimes; it has not been withdrawn for ten years for sale; it is not in liquidation or bankruptcy).
As it is a consumer packaging of alcohol in free tax circulation, a accompanying document is not required when transporting these goods.
For example, an invoice is sufficient to prove how to acquire consumer packaging of alcohol, which also contains the number of the holder of the distribution authorisation.
The holder of the permit shall keep a record for each establishment per calendar month the number of pieces of consumer packaging of alcohol received, the number of pieces of consumer packaging of alcohol issued, the stock of alcohol in consumer packaging of alcohol on the last day of the month and the registration of the shortage or surplus in the number of consumer liquor packages received and issued.
The holder of the authorisation is obliged to buy or otherwise purchase alcohol in consumer packaging in the course of business only from the person authorized for distribution.
Distributor of consumer alcohol packaging
In order to monitor the movement of alcohol in free tax circulation and the elimination of tax evasion, the legislator introduced a new tax institute for distributors of consumer alcohol.
A person intending to hold a distribution authorisation must apply to the ACT for a distribution authorisation.
The applicant must meet the legal conditions (business license for a commercial trade licence; the storage area exceeds 200 m2; the annual turnover from the sale of consumer packaging of alcohol at least €100,000 or a paid-up share capital of at least €100,000; a minimum of 10 employees; has no arrears against the customs office; it does not have arrears on compulsory levies; integrity in relation to intentional economic crimes; it has not been withdrawn for sale for ten years; it is not in liquidation or bankruptcy).
As it is a consumer packaging of alcohol in free tax circulation, a accompanying document is not required when transporting these goods.
For example, an invoice is sufficient to prove how to acquire consumer packaging of alcohol, which also contains the number of the holder of the distribution authorisation.
The holder of the distribution authorisation shall, for each establishment, keep a record for each establishment of the number of received pieces of alcohol consumer packaging, the number of pieces of consumer packaging of alcohol issued, the stock of alcohol in consumer packaging of alcohol on the last day of the month and the registration of the shortage or surplus in the number of consumer packs of alcohol received and issued.
The holder of the distribution licence is obliged to buy alcohol in consumer packaging only from another person authorised for distribution.
The person authorised for distribution shall notify the data for each calendar month electronically by the 25th day of the following calendar month.
Retailer of fuel
Due to the monitoring of free-tax propellants as well as the elimination of tax evasion, a new type of tax entity has been introduced, namely a fuel seller.
In the territory of the SR there is no special regulation regulating petrol stations.
That is why petrol stations are incorporated in SR's national legislation as fuel retailers.
A person who wishes to sell petrol, diesel or LPG for final consumption in free tax circulation in the tax area is required to apply to the CU for a sale permit before commencing the sale and provide a document proving that the storage facility is certified and equipped with an appropriate verified measuring device allowing the amount of mineral oil when receiving and dispensing, and the tank must comply with technical standards.
If the fuel seller is a tax warehouse operator, an authorised consignee or a registered consignor, the CU will also automatically issue an authorisation to sell fuel to registered persons.
The fuel seller is obliged, among other legal obligations, to keep a record of purchased and sold petrol, diesel or LPG per calendar month and is also obliged to notify the CU of the new supplier (distributor) of the fuel.
The fuel seller is legally obliged to purchase or otherwise purchase fuel only from a fuel distributor or from a registered person.
As they are free-tax propellants, a accompanying document is not required when transporting these goods.
However, when delivering the fuel through the car tank, the distributor, when pumping the propellants, the distributor prints a so-called bottling plant from a measuring device embedded in the car tank.
That document shall include, in addition to the details of the quantity, the date and time of delivery and the registration number of the car allocated by the Transport Inspectorate.
For example, an invoice is sufficient to prove how fuel is acquired, which also contains the fuel distributor's number allocated by the tax administrator.
The tax administrator in the territory of the SR in the exercise of tax supervision of mineral oils records tax evasion related to the transport of this type of goods.
Above all, it is an effort to avoid roadside checks when transporting roadside, so carriers use secondary roadways, circumventing the toll collection system due to more difficult monitoring of actual transport.
Also carried out are the transport of mineral oils in converted double-bottomed tankers.
Many times it happens that illegal transport is accompanied by a vehicle that carriers report possible mobile patrols to change routes and avoid roadside checks.
There is also mixing of propellants with light fuel oils or waste oils.
Distributor of propellants
Due to the monitoring of free-tax propellants as well as to eliminate tax evasion, a new type of tax entity has been introduced, namely a fuel distributor.
A person who intends to distribute petrol, diesel or LPG in the tax area in the course of a business activity in the free tax circulation is required to apply to the customs office for a distribution authorisation before commencing the distribution and to provide a document proving that the storage facility is certified and equipped with appropriate verified measuring equipment, as well as a list of suppliers and purchasers.
The fuel distributor is obliged, among other legal obligations, to keep separately for each establishment the registration of petrol, diesel or LPG for the calendar month.
The fuel distributor is legally obliged to purchase or otherwise purchase fuel only from a fuel distributor or from a registered person.
The fuel distributor can only sell in the tax territory to a fuel distributor, registered to the person or consumer of propellants.
However, when delivering fuel through a car tank, the distributor prints, when pumping propellants, the fuel seller, or the consumer of propellants, the so-called bottling from the measuring device embedded in the car tank.
That document shall include, in addition to the details of the quantity, the date and time of delivery and the registration number of the car allocated by the Transport Inspectorate.
As they are free-tax propellants, a accompanying document is not required for the transport of these goods.
For example, an invoice is sufficient to prove the method of acquisition of the fuel, which also contains the number of the distributor of the fuel, or the registered person, allocated by the tax administrator.
Consumer of fuel
The consumer of fuel has a special status in national legislation.
A person who buys in the tax territory in the free tax circulation for the own consumption of petrol, diesel or LPG and that mineral oil is stored in a storage facility, the volume of which is 15 000 litres or more, is required to notify the customs office of this fact at the latest before the first placement in the storage facility.
Motor consumption shall be included in the register by the customs office.
In addition to legal facts, it is obliged to give the address of the location of the storage facility.
In practice, these are large shipping companies, cooperatives, bus companies, road construction companies and other entities.
Storage equipment shall be verified and equipped with a measuring device enabling the amount of propellants to be measured when receiving and dispensing (condition, measuring rod).
The tank must comply with technical standards.
The fuel consumer must only purchase fuel from a fuel distributor or from a registered person.
As they are free-tax propellants, a accompanying document is not required for transport.
However, when delivering fuel through a car tank, the distributor prints a so-called bottling from a measuring device embedded in the car tank when pumping propellants to the consumer.
That document shall include, in addition to the details of the quantity, the date and time of delivery and the registration number of the car allocated by the Transport Inspectorate.
For example, an invoice is sufficient to prove how fuel is acquired, which also contains the fuel distributor's number allocated by the tax administrator.
The tax administrator in the territory of the SR in the exercise of tax supervision of mineral oils records tax evasion related to the transport of this type of goods.
Small independent brewery
The operator of a small independent brewery is a person who produces beer in the business and meets the legal conditions.
Provided that the conditions laid down by law are met, a small independent brewery may apply a reduced rate of tax, i.e. €2,652 per hl/percent volume of actual alcoholic strength.
Annual beer production is limited to up to 200,000 hl of beer.
As it is the production of beer outside the conditional exemption scheme, there is no need for a accompanying document for transport as it is in free tax circulation.
A small independent brewery cannot be a tax warehouse.
In practice, it is small family businesses that also run restaurants or saloons in which they offer their own-made beer for sale.
Administrative acts in SR
This sub-chapter brings the exercise of the tax oversight of excise tax administrations to selected tax entities within the meaning of national legislation in the Slovak Republic.
The largest year-on-year increase in administrative operations (by 5.3%) was recorded between 2012 and 2013, due to the implementation of more transport in EMCS.
By contrast, the biggest decline was recorded year-on-year in 2014, by up to 4.3%, due to fewer completed tax inspections and fewer tax returns filed.
That decrease related to legislative changes.
Tax controls
By carrying out the tax audit, the CPO ascertains or examines the facts decisive for the correct determination of the tax.
CÚ staff are shown in the performance of the tax audit by delegation to carry out a tax audit, which includes, among other things, the purpose and subject-matter of the control and the extent of the tax periods checked.
In practice, this means that a controlled tax period can be one month, but also more tax periods.
The extent of the tax periods checked is determined by the CPU.
The tax audit begins with the drafting of the tax inspection notice.
The receipt of the documents will be confirmed by the ACT.
The issued documents are obliged to be returned by the CÚ within 30 days of the completion of the tax audit.
An employee of the CÚ will draw up a report from the tax audit.
If the tax audit finds a difference in the sum that the audited taxpayer was required to pay, to declare or to which he claimed the refund, the CÚ, together with the protocol to the audited taxpayer, will also send a notice of comment on the findings set out in the Protocol.
The tax inspection shall be terminated on the date of receipt of the Protocol.
The deadline for carrying out the tax audit shall be no more than one year from the date of its commencement.
The tax inspection for registered persons and selected registered persons shall be carried out as necessary, but at least once until the day of the expiry of the right to set the tax, which is 5 years.
The FŘ SR issued an internal management act regulating the abovementioned deadlines because of the uniform procedure of the tax administrator in the territory of the Slovak Republic.
Local investigations
A local investigation is the activity of the tax administrator, in which it searches for evidence, examines and ascertains the facts that are needed for tax administration purposes.
A CÚ employee writes an enrollment on the local investigation and submits his copy to the taxpayer.
When conducting a local investigation, the CÚ employee has the right to unlimited access to land, operational buildings, rooms and places including means of transport, transport packaging and accounting documents.
The clearing of the quantity of alcohol produced shall be determined in the form of a local investigation.
The facts found are the basis for carrying out tax control.
Also in the performance of the local investigation, the CCA is entitled to take samples as well as to secure the item.
The FŘ SR issued an internal management act regulating the exercise of tax supervision and the local investigation for individual items of excise duty due to the unification of the tax administrator's procedures.
Permanent tax supervision in alcohol tax warehouses
With the accession of the Slovak Republic to the European Union on 1 May 2004, there was also a change in the area of excise duty management.
The need for more efficient spending of state budget funds in managing excise duty on alcohol, improving the business environment in the area and introducing legislative tools for more effective suppression of the grey economy in the area resulted in the adoption of new laws in connection with the administration of excise duties in 2004.
One of the measures brought about by the new legislative change was not only the transfer of the tax administrator in the area of excise tax administration from tax authorities to customs offices, but also the introduction of the need for a tax administrator to be present in a liquor tax warehouse.
In the territory of the Slovak Republic, national legislation exhaustively defines that it is possible to adopt, issue, produce or process alcohol in a tax warehouse only in the presence of an ECA employee.
This does not apply to a tax warehouse which receives, stores or sends alcohol only in consumer packaging of alcohol.
At the same time, the CÚ is obliged to secure employees in the tax warehouse so that the income, dispensing, production or processing of alcohol is not restricted.
The operator of the tax warehouse creates an obligation to safeguard the conditions of the working environment for CÚ employees.
On the basis of a contract concluded with the FŘ SR for the premises provided, the CÚ pays the rental costs to the operator of the tax warehouse on a monthly basis.
In a tax warehouse in the production, processing or storage of alcohol, the production facilities for the storage of alcohol must be adapted in such a way that the quantities of alcohol produced, processed alcohol, alcohol stored, including stocks of alcohol and alcohol contained therein, can be ascertained at any time.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
If alcohol is not accepted in a tax warehouse, issued, produced or processed, the customs office may waive the obligation to safeguard the presence of a customs office employee, who is obliged to secure that area through the closure of the customs office.
In practice, however, this option is not used very often, as tax warehouse operators use the continuous presence of a customs office employee to their advantage.
Some tax warehouse operators make use of the legal option within the meaning of Law No 467/2002 Z., on the production and marketing of alcohol, and use production facilities to produce alcohol in a distillery for cultivation burning and also for the purposes of the distillate distillate distillate distillery, which must be tax warehouse.
The exercise of permanent tax supervision in tax warehouses on alcohol is ensured by approximately 250 customs officers.
Issuing vouchers to collect alcohol control stamps
The basic act for the collection of control marks is the sending of an application to the customs office for the allocation of a registration subscription number and issuing a voucher for the collection of alcohol control stamps.
Alcoholic beverage, which is ethyl alcohol, means goods of the Combined Nomenclature 2207 and 2208 with an actual alcoholic strength of more than 1.2 per cent vol.
The check mark is intended for the labelling of consumer alcohol packaging.
Consumer packaging of alcohol is considered to be closed consumer packaging filled with spirit intended for direct human consumption.
Consumer packaging of the Combined Nomenclature code 2207 and 2208 may be entered into free tax circulation in the tax territory only if it is marked with a check mark.
Only the operator of a tax warehouse, the authorised recipient and the consumer packaging importer, who will put it into free tax circulation, may mark the consumer packing.
The check stamp contains, among other things, an identification number consisting of a 14-digit numerical character. The identification number contains the registration number (1-6 instead of the numerical character), the volume of alcohol (7.-11. instead of the numerical character) and the volume concentration of alcohol in the consumer pack (12.-14. instead of the numerical character).
Original pattern of control mark on alcohol:
The registration subscription number shall be assigned to each customer by the CU's check marks separately.
Only a check mark may be used to indicate the consumer packaging of alcohol, the identification number of which corresponds to the volume of consumer packaging, the volume concentration of alcohol in the consumer pack and the customer's control mark.
National legislation at the end of 2014 brought the introduction of a new information system for control stamps.
The aim of the new information system for control marks was to simplify and inform the system of ordering, assessment, printing, distribution and use of control marks intended for the labelling of consumer alcohol packaging.
Only the operator of the tax warehouse, the authorised recipient, the consumer packaging importer and the consignee (the customer) of alcohol, may mark the consumer packing.
A purchaser of the check marks wishing to take control marks under the "new system" must apply to the customs office electronically for the issue of the check marks.
Through the electronic system, the purchaser of the check stamps is obliged to request their issue, report data arising from the national legislation of the Slovak Republic and keep a register of check stamps.
The number of items of control stamps ordered shall not be less than 500 pieces or their multiple.
The tax administrator also communicates with the purchasers of the check stamps through the electronic system of control stamps, in particular when announcing the number of check marks that the purchaser of the check stamps can remove, or when determining the date of receipt of the check stamps by the customer of the check stamps in the printer.
The purchaser of the check marks is obliged to deposit on behalf of the tax administrator funds corresponding to the price of the check marks, which he may withdraw and the amount of which shall be notified to him by the customs office before taking control stamps.
The price of the check mark takes into account the amount of the printer's refunds. However, it does not take into account the level of excise duty.
The checkpoints are entitled to print the state enterprise Mincovna Kremnice.
FŘ SR supervises the handling of control marks and their disposal in the printer.
The FŘ SR is obliged to ensure the presence of an employee of the Financial Directorate in the printing works when dealing with checkpoints.
FŘ SR secures the sale of control stamps to the supplier of check stamps in the printer.
Remove check marks can only be taken in the printer from the Financial Directorate employee.
Issuing vouchers for the collection of control marks on tobacco products
The purchaser of the check stamp must ask the CPU to allocate the registration number and issue a voucher for the collection of the check stamp.
Consumer packaging of cigarettes can only be put into free tax circulation if it is marked with a checkpoint.
It is only possible to label consumer packs of cigarettes with a checkpoint only in a cigarette company.
The purchaser of the check marks may only be a tax warehouse operator, an authorised recipient or importer of tobacco products who wishes to place tobacco products for free tax circulation in the tax territory.
Only a check mark may be used to indicate the consumer packaging of cigarettes, the data of which corresponds to the relevant price of cigarettes, the number of cigarettes in the pack, the length of cigarettes, the emblem of the tax rate and the registration number.
Consumer packaging of cigarettes can only be sold for final consumption at the price shown on the control mark.
National legislation at the end of 2014 brought the introduction of a new information system for control stamps.
The aim of the new information system for control signs was to simplify and inform the system of ordering, assessment, printing, distribution and use of check marks designed to mark consumer packaging of tobacco, cigars, cigars, cigarillos and cigarettes.
A purchaser of the check marks wishing to take control marks under the "new system" must apply to the customs office electronically for the issue of the check marks.
Through the electronic system, the purchaser of the check stamps is obliged to request their issue, report data arising from the national legislation of the Slovak Republic and keep a register of check stamps.
The checkpoints are entitled to print the state enterprise Mincovna Kremnice.
FŘ SR supervises the handling of control marks and their disposal in the printer.
The FŘ SR is obliged to ensure the presence of an employee of the Financial Directorate in the printing works when dealing with checkpoints.
FŘ SR secures the sale of control stamps to the supplier of check stamps in the printer.
Remove check marks can only be taken in the printer from the Financial Directorate employee.
The consumer packing of tobacco with a check mark may be indicated by the operator of the tax warehouse or the importer of tobacco products.
The consumer packing of cigars or cigarillos with a check mark may be indicated by the operator of a tax warehouse, an importer of tobacco products or an authorised recipient.
Only a check mark shall apply to the labelling of consumer packaging of tobacco, cigars or cigarillos, the particulars of which correspond to the emblem for the validity of the rate of excise duty.
It is only possible to mark consumer packs of cigarettes with a check mark in the company that made them.
The number of items of control stamps ordered shall not be less than 500 pieces or their multiple.
Within three working days at the latest, the CÚ shall notify the purchaser of the check marks by electronically the number of check marks he can withdraw, the price of the check stamps and the FŘ SR account number.
The CÚ may reduce the number of items of control stamps ordered if there are circumstances on the basis of which it can reasonably be assumed that there may be a tax infringement.
FŘ SR will determine the date of receipt of the control stamps by the customer of the check stamps, but no later than 10 days.
The date of receipt of the control stamps of the FŘ SR will notify the purchaser of the control stamps through the electronic system of control stamps.
The verification marks are issued exclusively by the Financial Directorate in the printer, but only after the receipt of funds corresponding to their price to the relevant account indicated in the electronic notification of the customs office.
The purchaser of the check stamps is obliged separately in the breakdown for cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos and tobacco to keep a register of check stamps in the electronic system of control stamps.
Administrative cooperation between EU Member States (ELO)
Within the meaning of Council Regulation (EU) No 389/2012, the separation of the ELO and the SPD systems of the Department of Excise Taxation of the SR shall be responsible for securing the exchange of information on the basis of a request for administrative cooperation between EU Member States and the competent authorities of the financial administration.
These include, in particular, requests for screening of entities in the context of the administration of excise duties, requests for information relating to the administration of excise duties, as well as requests for confirmation of information from the SEED database.
The exchange of applications takes place in electronic form under the EMCS.
The following acts are included in administrative cooperation between EU Member States: requests for administrative cooperation (application for verification, request for information on excise tax administration, request for confirmation of registration in SEEDs); response to a request for administrative cooperation; spontaneous information; event report; control report.

Permission and registration
In SR, permanent tax supervision is applied to alcohol tax warehouses, in the Czech Republic this supervision is replaced by the continuous supervision of the tax administrator through a tracking device.
In the Czech Republic, small independent breweries are tax warehouse, in Slovakia they are only registered by the tax administrator.
In SR, an institute of a registered consignor is introduced, which is included among tax warehouses in the Czech Republic.
In the SR, at a reduced rate of excise duty on alcohol in the case of cultivation burning, it is possible to burn 43 l a.
In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, the reduced rate of alcohol tax can only be applied for 30 litres.
Growing distillery in Slovakia must be licensed not only by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Slovak Republic, but also from the tax administrator.
In the Czech Republic, only the Ministry of Agriculture allows growers.
In SR, imports of consumer packaging of alcohol are made, in addition to the tax warehouse operator, by the importer of consumer packaging of alcohol.
The authorisation of the importer shall be subject to registration of the applicant with the excise administrator.
In the Czech Republic, no special permission from the tax administrator is required to import consumer packaging of alcohol.
In SR, the sale of consumer packaging of alcohol is subject to the issuance of a licence from the tax administrator for retailers.
The seller of consumer packaging of alcohol has a statutory obligation to keep a register of, among other things, the purchase and sale.
In the Czech Republic, the tax administrator does not issue any permit for the final seller of consumer packaging alcohol, it is sufficient to issue a concession for the sale of alcohol by the Trade Licensing Authority; the final seller does not keep any special records.
In SR, a fuel seller must have a permit from the tax administrator to sell them.
The national legislation in SR does not regulate any special regulation of the petrol station, all activities relating to petrol stations are regulated only in the Excise Tax Act on mineral oils.
In the Czech Republic, petrol stations are regulated by a special law on fuel, but the tax administrator does not issue any permit to sell fuel.
Petrol stations are registered and their list is published by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
In SR, it is technically impossible to get a list of petrol stations from the financial management system.
In Slovakia, there has been a significant increase in the number of selected permits or registrations of tax entities since 2012.
This increase was due to a legislative change in that period.
In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, the number of selected permits fell significantly in 2013 due to the introduction of bail for fuel distributors.
Administrative acts
In the SR, substantive legislation provides for the obligation to exercise tax control of selected tax entities.
This issue is further specified by the internal management act issued by the FŘ SR due to the application of the uniform procedure of the tax authorities in the territory of the Slovak Republic.
In the Czech Republic, substantive legislation does not regulate the obligation to exercise tax control, the procedural law stipulates only the possibility of carrying out an inspection at the latest by the time limit for tax assessment.
The reason for the large differences in the number of tax inspections carried out and local investigations in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic is that the internal management act of the FŘ SR determines in what cases and under what time limits the tax administrator must carry out a tax inspection, while in the Czech Republic the accuracy of the declared amount of excise duty or its refund is verified mainly by local investigation.
The number of comparable administrative tasks in the Czech Republic has increased since 2012 as a result of the increase in the number of transport services in the EMCS system and at the same time as a result of the increase in the number of tax returns filed.
In the SR, the number of administrative tasks between 2012 and 2015 had a slightly increasing trend, which was influenced by the increasing number of transport services in EMCS and at the same time the decrease in the number of tax returns.
Evaluation
The large differences between the numbers of comparable permits and the registration of tax entities were reflected in the different legislative arrangements.
The number of comparable administrative tasks of tax administrators was similar in the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic in individual years of the audited period.
In Slovakia, the total number of comparable tax entities, which is about two-thirds compared to the number of tax entities in the Czech Republic, accounts for approximately the same amount of administrative tasks.
From this it can be concluded that the SR is more focused on carrying out administrative tasks by the tax authorities, e.g. the exercise of physical tax supervision.
In the Czech Republic, emphasis is placed more on remote surveillance, e.g. tracking devices, immediate sending of data via a web interface and risk analysis.
Electronization of administrative tasks
Electronization of administrative tasks in the Czech Republic
Tax returns can be filed via a data box.
The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic has introduced so-called interactive tax return forms, which, however, can no longer be automatically processed.
The data must be further transcribed to the taxpayer's personal tax account.
The benefit is to limit the error rate of the filed tax returns (DAP), which saves the actions of the tax administrator related to the repair proceedings erroneously filed by the DAP.
DGC is working on a new DAP electronic processing application.
In addition, through intelligent forms: filing applications for tax or registration for activities and notifications of changes to data, to make refund claims, to comply with reporting obligations when dealing with special mineral oils, the handling of raw tobacco and the fulfilment of biofuel obligations.
Loading with control tapes is recorded by tax entities in the ORO WebKlient information system, which is available to registered entities for the registration of the tax administrator of the specified data.
Transport of selected products around the Czech Republic under the conditional tax exemption regime must be implemented in the Czech Republic on the basis of an electronic accompanying document, which is implemented in the Czech Republic as a national functionality in the electronic system for monitoring the transport of selected products (EMCS).
Transport of selected products in free tax circulation around the tax territory of the Czech Republic can always be carried out with proof of their taxation, proof of exemption from excise duty, by a decision of the customs office to release the selected products under the customs procedure, a simplified accompanying document or another decision to assess excise duty.
The required content of the data is determined by law.
In order to facilitate the fulfilment of these obligations, the Czech Republic has introduced a voluntary electronic system for issuing alternative documents (Sections 5 and 6 of Act No. 353/2003 Coll.).
This allows the document form of documents to be replaced or supplemented by electronically issued documents sent through the web interface of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic to a data warehouse, where each such document is assigned a unique 12-digit identification code (JIK).
JIK is used for the purpose of checking by the customs authorities on the way and prevents repeated transport on the same document.
For the largest operator of a fuel tax warehouse in the Czech Republic, which puts about half of the volume of PHM into free tax circulation, CS ČR has on-line access to an electronic registration system into which the entity automatically stores issued tax documents.
CS CR is considering the introduction of e-VDO, i.e. an electronic system for recording and monitoring of the transport of selected products carried out in free tax circulation.
This system should use 70% of the existing EMCS functional specification.
The advantage will be a user-known environment for both declarants and customs officers.
It will also be linked to a system of global guarantees, to a tax registry or a risk analysis system.
The system should allow for an overview of free circulation traffic between Member States, which so far operates on the basis of written documents without registration and sharing of negotiating numbers through simplified accompanying documents.
The risks of the current process of registering the transport of selected products in free tax circulation can be seen primarily in the abuse of a simplified accompanying document, the reuse of one document or illegal transport without any document.
Electronization of administrative tasks in SR
When administering excise duties, the SR Financial Administration uses electronic communication in monitoring the movement of goods in the EMCS system under a conditional exemption regime, control stamps, filing tax returns, as well as when registering and registering tax entities.
In 2014, a one-way electronic communication of tax entities with the tax administrator was also introduced, which was extended to two-way communication in 2016.
As part of electronic communication, the tax entity has access to a personal internet zone, the so-called electronic personal mailbox, which is designed for communication with the financial administration, after entering the access data.
Within this zone, the taxpayer has access to an electronic mailroom through which it submits applications, notices, tax returns and other documents relating to the administration of excise duties.
However, electronic communication through a personal internet zone does not apply to all tax entities.
National legislation defines tax entities that are obliged to communicate with the tax administrator electronically.
These are mainly value added tax payers, a tax adviser representing a tax entity and lawyers representing a tax entity.
The SAO SR also addressed the issue of the scope of computerisation of excise tax administration during the audit.
These were only fully electronic acts, namely tax returns and electronic communications within the ELO.
Apart from the transport carried out in EMCS, there has been an increase in the computerisation of selected comparable administrative tasks, which is also a requirement for modern tax administration.
Comparison and evaluation
Comparison
A fully electronized processing of the tax return is already in place in the SR, from filing it to registration of the tax liability.
In the Czech Republic, the electronic processing of the tax return is not set up.
In the Czech Republic, the possibility for tax entities to insert mandatory documents for individual transports in free tax circulation is set up for tax entities.
In the future, the reporting of transport in free tax circulation is being prepared in the form and on the basis of the EMCS system.
Evaluation
The system of reporting transport in free tax circulation in the Czech Republic contributes to tax supervision, thus eliminating the transport of selected products for which excise duty has not been paid in violation of the legislation.
These can be recommended as good practice.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Due to good practice in the Slovak Republic in the area of electronization of tax returns, the SAO recommends the SAO of the SR and the SAO of the Czech Republic to complete the computerization of the processing of tax returns in the Czech Republic.
Analysis of changes to the organisational structure and staffing in excise duties
The organizational arrangement of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic and the Financial Administration of the Slovak Republic has undergone fundamental changes.
Organizational arrangement of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic
The customs administration of the Czech Republic since 1 January 2013 consists of the General Directorate of Customs and Customs Authorities, which are administrative offices and organisational units of the state.
The DG is an entity for the entire customs administration.
The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic has been carrying out comprehensive excise tax management since 2004 as one of the many competences it provides.
CS CR also performs:
(a) control:
In the field of road transport (weighting of trucks, payment of charges for the use of roads, fulfilment of conditions for the transport of dangerous goods, professional supervision of the work of vehicle crews in international road freight transport and in matters of international passenger transport),
the management of waste and packaging material,
The safety of imported food,
In the area of consumer protection and the protection of intellectual property rights,
The employment of foreigners,
(b) customs management - it is a comprehensive application of customs legislation, commercially policy measures and formalities on the import and export of goods;
(c) the collection and enforcement of cash benefits imposed by other public authorities within the framework of a shared administration;
(d) the activities of the police authority (referred to customs authorities) in criminal proceedings committed by breaches of customs and related regulations and tax regulations, if the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic is the tax administrator.
While the scope of competencies (the exercise of control activities) increases the overall cost of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, there are savings in costs from the extent, as the public administration does not have to spend expenses on the position of the control group for each subject of control separately.
At the same time, the administrative burden of the audited persons is reduced by repeated control.
10 The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic continues to exercise the scope to verify the fulfilment of obligations in the record of sales (Section 2(2) of Act No. 112/2016 Coll., on the Registration of Sales) and, as of 1 January 2017, supervision of compliance with the law and conditions of operation of gambling, including the imposition of sanctions (Section 116 of Act No. 186/2016 Coll., on Gambling).
As part of the Modernisation of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic project, the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic changed the three-tier structure into a two-tier structure with effect from 1 January 2013, while the middle article of the management (customs directorates) was abolished.
The DGs spent around CZK 51 million on the project. CZK (i.e. approx. 2,031,000 €).
CS CR since 1 January 2013 consists of DGCs and regional customs offices, which are administrative offices and organisational units of the state.
Customs and their competences are laid down by law, the administration of excise duties is carried out by all customs offices through departments and territorial workplaces.
The territorial workplaces are the internal organisational units of customs offices.
The Ministry of Finance is entitled to establish and abolish territorial workplaces and to determine their material scope by decree.
Legislation does not provide for any competence for territorial workplaces; the territorial workplace exercises the competence of the customs office on its behalf.
Organisational structure by 31.12.2012
Organisational structure from 1. 1. 2013
The administration of excise duties until 31.12.2012 was carried out by the DGC, eight CŘ and 58 departments of the CÚ (including branches), i.e. a total of 67 trade unions and departments.
As of 1 January 2016, the administration of the DG and 51 departments in the CÚ and their territorial workplaces, as well as eight departments of the legal department of the DGC and the CÚ services ensuring mobile supervision, i.e. about 60 posts.
The CS CR's costs are most significantly influenced by wage expenditure.
As a result of the reorganization of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, there were no savings in personnel resources.
The performance of the main processes is ensured by customs officers in service under the law on the service of members of the security forces.
The possibility of reducing the numbers of these members is only very limited in the Czech Republic, because under the provisions of Section 42(1) of Act No 361/2003 Coll., on the service of members of the security forces, they can be dismissed from the service only in cases exhaustively defined.
Reduction of posts due to organisational changes in the Security Corps is not grounds for dismissal and the employer is obliged to provide members with the allocation of adequate service posts within the corps, or to provide posts with another security force (e.g. The Police of the Czech Republic, the Prison Service of the Czech Republic), otherwise they will be reassigned to a reserve for temporarily non-attached, in which members of the security forces are entitled under the law to 80% of the average service income.

Organisational arrangement of excise tax administration in SR
As part of the programme statement for the years 2012 to 2016, the Government of the Slovak Republic set as one of the priorities the completion of the reform of the tax administration through the UNITAS programme, which will secure additional budgetary resources by unifying the collection of taxes, duties and levies and the suppression of tax evasion.
In this context, the tax reform was implemented at the central level, bringing about the merger of the Slovak Tax Directorate and the SR Customs Directorate into the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic and the creation of the financial administration.
The FŘ SR was established as of 1 January 2012 by Act No 333/2011 Z., on the bodies of state administration in the field of taxation, fees and customs, as amended, as a budgetary organisation which is based in Banská Bystrica and is connected to the state budget through the budget chapter of the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic.
FŘ SR, CÚ and Criminal Office of the Financial Administration within the meaning of Act No 199/2004 Z. z., Customs Act and amending and supplementing certain laws, as amended, are customs authorities if they carry out tasks under customs regulations.
Within the meaning of Act No 333/2011 Z. z., on government bodies in the field of taxation, fees and customs, as amended, together with the tax authorities, forms the financial administration.
The new organisational structure of the financial administration as of 1 January 2012 consists of the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic, the Criminal Office of the Financial Administration, the Financial Operations Centre, the Tax Office, the Tax Office for selected tax entities, branches of tax offices, customs offices, branches of customs offices (CÚ tax branch, branch of CÚ combined, branch of CÚ customs) and customs office stations.
The main mission of the FŘ SR is to effectively collect and administer taxes and duties, i.e. also excise taxes, to fulfil the revenue part of the state budget and to protect the economic interests of the state.
The statutory body of the FŘ SR is the President of the Financial Administration, who is appointed and dismissed by the Minister of Finance of the Slovak Republic.
The president of the financial administration is responsible for the activities of the entire financial administration and therefore for the activities of the FŘ SR, which he manages and represents in full.
Organisational structure of FŘ SR from 1. 1.2012 in abbreviated form
Within all customs offices in the territory of the Slovak Republic, the activities and processes in the field of excise duty management ensure, in addition to the branches of customs offices (38 branches) and customs offices (18 stations), the excise tax departments (9 departments) and the legal department (9 departments).

Comparison and evaluation
Comparison
Within the organisational structure of the SR financial administration, 74 organisational units with a total of 1,300 employees were involved in the management of excise duties in 2015, in addition to the FŘ SR; these departments manage nearly 48,000 tax entities.
Within the organizational structure of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, in 2015 the administration of excise duties dealt with about 60 organizational units with a total of 1,011 employees, which manage about 114,000 tax entities.
In the Czech Republic, the performance of individual activities of the administration of excise duties is divided between several personally independent departments.
Their mutual coordination and cooperation is addressed through middle and top management.
In the SR, the pursuit of individual activities (registration, tax return, tax control) in the field of excise tax administration is distributed between the excise tax department and the branch of the customs office, under which the same employees of the tax administrator often deal with that agenda.
Evaluation
In the SR, the number of tax entities is about one-third of the total number of employees in the field of excise tax administration compared to the situation in the Czech Republic; the effect of the higher number of employees on the efficiency of excise tax administration is not clear.
EMCS
According to the preamble to Decision No 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 on the establishment of an electronic system for the transport and monitoring of products subject to excise duty, the aim of the introduction of an electronic system for monitoring the transport of selected products was to enable real-time information on transport and to carry out prescribed controls, to simplify the movement of intra-Community goods under suspension of excise duty.
When implementing the system, Member States should have allowed economic operators, in particular SMEs active in the sector, to use these national elements at the lowest possible cost.
Article 3 of that EP and Council Decision allows national specifications, national databases forming part of the system and those technical or software which the Member State deems necessary to ensure the full use of the system within its administration are included in the EMCS.
EMCS in the Czech Republic
Development and functionality of EMCS
In the Czech Republic, EMCS was preceded by a system of registration of selected products (EVV), which was operated from May 2004 to the end of March 2010.
EMCS has been fully operational in the Czech Republic since 1 April 2010 and is continuously supplemented with European and national functionalities (see Annex 5).
In the Czech Republic, the so-called customs module and the declarant module were introduced.
The tariff module contains a number of national functionalities.
Beyond the Community system, in the EMCS system, shipments are monitored in the EMCS system under a conditional tax exemption scheme initiated and terminated in the Czech Republic.
The system ensures, after approval, a notification of receipt intended for the authorised recipient for the one-time receipt of the information to the tax registry with subsequent invalidation of the authorisation.
The system fully ensures administration of received and sent requests for international cooperation and spontaneous information from the ELO including sending answers with an attachment in any format and securing translations.
It is also possible to receive a report on manual termination of exports in the ECS (only the referral of an automatically created message is implemented in the EU).
Risk profiles for outgoing or incoming shipments are set according to the currently required criteria.
The EMCS will not allow the approval of an e-AD or notice of admission without the reaction of the competent customs authority to the risk profile (the risk profile cannot be ignored).
The declarant module is available for tax entities free of charge, it has the form of a web application to which the user logs in with a user name and password (coordinates) that are allocated to him after registration with CS ČR.
Each action against the EMCS customs module shall be provided with a valid electronic signature in the EMCS Treaty module.
The Declarant module allows tax entities to directly register data on commenced and terminated services under the suspensive exemption regime, so that tax entities do not have to spend funds on the acquisition of the scheme.
The national functionalities of the declarant module make it possible to retrieve and store data off-line (saves time for frequently used data), fill in recipient data based on SEED ID control, and require mandatory completion of data that is optional at EU level (maximum data for risk analysis).
The system also allows for every shipment sent from the Czech Republic in real time to block the provision of excise duty at the appropriate amount of taxable supply until the end of the transport.
The amount of collateral is calculated automatically by EMCS.
Without sufficient collateral quantity, it is not possible to send the e-AD proposal for approval to the CA of dispatch from the declarant module EMCS.
Each warranty has a unique number and contains ARC transport (including the amount of blocked collateral) for which it was used.
The taxpayer can manage its guarantees directly in the EMCS Treaty module, where it sees the current amount of blocked and unblocked excise tax guarantees.
Expenditure on the deployment and use of EMCS
The development of EMCS was carried out on the basis of eight performance contracts from 2006 to 2017 totalling CZK 46,791,924.60 (i.e. 1,761,412.56 €) excluding VAT.
In accordance with the concluded contracts, the contractor issued invoices for a total amount of CZK 43,577,255.19 (i.e. £1,640,401.10) excluding VAT from 2006 to the end of 2015.
In the audited period, expenses of CZK 14,545,454 excluding VAT (i.e. € 547,438.99) were spent on the EMCS upgrade.
The amount spent on EMCS upgrades in the audited period and converted into one transport injected into EMCS averages CZK 16.49 (i.e. €0.62), excluding national transport, this expenditure per transport between the Czech Republic and EU Member States is CZK 24.40 (i.e. €0.92).
The technical support for EMCS was implemented on the basis of four performance contracts from 2011 to 2017.
By the end of 2015, the total amount of technical support of CZK 7,499,6775 (i.e. €281,389,77), including value added tax, had been invoiced.
The average amount of technical support spent since 2011 on a single transport injected into EMCS since 2010 is CZK 6.18 (i.e. €0.23).
The development and technical support invoices related to the national solution and led to the development of the EVV application, which the DGC already operated before EMCS itself.
Invoices were paid under programme funding from national sources.
Technical support is invoiced as part of the supply of services as well as other applications provided by the supplier for Customs Administration of the Czech Republic.
EMCS in SR
EMCS is an electronic system operated by EU Member States to monitor the movement of excise goods between Member States under a conditional exemption scheme.
It replaced the accompanying administrative document - SAD, which was used before the system took effect, thus ensuring better control and traffic management.
It has been in place in the SR since 1 April 2010 and is continuously supplemented with the requirements of EU legislation.
For each transport, a unique reference code is generated, so-called
ARC code under which this transport can be tracked online, i.e. in real time.
Development and functionality of EMCS
EMCS ensures the receipt and dispatch of excise goods by only such tax entities that are authorised to use EMCS, which greatly reduces the risk of tax evasion.
The biggest development of functionalities occurred in 2011 when EMCS was fully operational (see Annex 6).
Expenditure on the deployment and use of EMCS
The introduction of EMCS was implemented as another module of SysNeD application equipment and therefore it is not possible to accurately determine the cost of its initial application on the Slovak side.
Comparison and evaluation
Comparison
EMCS's goal was to replace the system based on administration of transport in paper form.
The benefit of the EMCS is a comprehensive overview of transport between individual Member States within the EU from the announcement of the start of transport to its termination, while the reduction in administrative costs for tax administrators and tax entities for the processing, transmission and archiving of documents is significant.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, a national functionality was introduced into the EMCS system allowing traffic monitoring in a conditional system between two locations in the Czech Republic or Slovakia.
In addition, automatic functionality of online monitoring and ensuring a guarantee for excise duty is applied in the Czech Republic.
There is also a national functionality that monitors the riskiness of the taxpayer or transport, with the subsequent mandatory response of the tax administrator.
The Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic record a comparable number of intra-EU transport in the EMCS system.
However, spending in the SR on upgrading this system was €744,310,01 higher than in the Czech Republic between 2012 and 2015.
The SAO of the SR received data from the FŘ SR on the upgrade of EMCS only for the period from 2011, although this system was introduced and operated earlier.
Nevertheless, the expenditure incurred on the EMCS upgrade in the SR was €188,134.44 higher than the expenditure for the deployment and upgrade of EMCS for about ten years of its operation in the Czech Republic.
Evaluation
For the audited period, the volume of expenditure related to the upgrade of EMCS in the SR per transport 2.3 times exceeds the expenditure of the same type in the Czech Republic.
Conclusion
The cooperation of the SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO SR met the objectives.
Both audit institutions gained a deeper knowledge of the excise tax management system in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
It was found that, despite the common basic legal framework, there are significant differences in both tax systems that affect the efficiency of excise administration.
During parallel controls, examples of good practice have been identified that could contribute to curbing tax fraud, their importance with rising tax rates will increase.
Procedures have also been identified to reduce the costs of administering excise duties.
Mutual cooperation has revealed differences that significantly affect the efficiency of tax administration and limit international comparisons when mutually coordinated due diligence is not carried out with the tax administrator.
In this, the role of supreme audit institutions is irreplaceable.
Report on the results of the parallel control of the value added tax administration carried out in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany
Introductory word
The 1977 Lima Declaration underlines that the highest audit institutions (SAI) have the power to audit all public financial operations.
The Declaration calls for tax revenues to be checked to the greatest extent possible.
The Organisation of the European Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers taxation to be one of the most important parts of public revenue.
The VI. EUROSAI Congress held in Bonn in 2005 dealt with the audit of public revenue carried out by the SAI.
A major step towards optimising SAI control activities is the development of a specific strategy for auditing public revenues.
This applies in particular to taxes as the bulkiest source of public revenue, which is most prone to large losses.
As national economies become increasingly interconnected and dependent, SAI may be unable to carry out control activities without cooperation with another state's SAI.
An example is the audit of internationally organised fraud, which causes substantial losses in the income of many countries.
To combat this offence, the responsible authorities need to cooperate with each other.
The SAI carrying out checks in this area must be willing to engage in closer cooperation with each other.
It was at the EUROSAI Congress in Bonn that the idea of carrying out an inspection of the Value Added Tax Administration (VAT) and the VIES system in the framework of the cooperation of the Supreme Audit Office and the Federal Court of Auditors, the Bundesrechnungshof, arose.
Careful preparation followed, with both sides first having to familiarize themselves with the legal environment and procedures for managing VAT in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.
Based on the analysis of this information, a selection of control topics was carried out which was included in the control programme.
Achieving an effective and efficient VAT administration is a long-standing problem, and individual states (especially the Member States of the European Union) are looking for solutions to improve, simplify and make the collection of this tax more transparent.
We believe that the results of our control can serve not only to improve the work of tax administrators, but also as a basis for a proposal to improve the international information exchange system.
Report on the results of parallel checks on the management of value added tax carried out in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany
Introduction
Control number: (CZ) 06/27 (D) VIII 2 – 2005 – 1215
Subject-matter of the inspection:
(CZ) Value Added Tax Administration after the Czech Republic joined the European Union
(D) Examination of administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2004
Objective of control:
(CZ) The aim of the control action in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedure of the financial authorities in the management of value added tax after the integration of the Czech Republic into the single internal market of the European Union (EU) linked to the free movement of goods and services and to examine the use of the VIES system, in particular when checking the application of the right to a value added tax exemption for intracomonity delivery.
(D) The aim of the audit was to examine the system of control of intracomonarian value added tax, with a particular focus on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax under the aforementioned regulations.
The result should be a report on weaknesses and recommendations for their elimination.
System of exchange of information on value added tax Audit actions were carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the SAO) and the German Bundesrechnungshof (BRH) in mutual cooperation on the basis of a contract concluded between the two audit institutions on 8 June 2006.
The cooperation focused mainly on the examination of selected commercial transactions carried out between payers from the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the Czech Republic) and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter referred to as the "CFN"), the use of information obtained in the form of international cooperation between tax administrations and the comparison of VAT management systems of both countries.
The joint final report on the results of the control actions was prepared within the meaning of European Directive 31 for the implementation of INTOSAI audit standards.
The audited period was the period from 1 May 2004 to 31.12.2005.
Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions
Parallel control in the area of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of a contract between the two SAI.
Outside the main point, exchanges of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2004 – covered other topics, such as the registration of payers, VAT returns and recapitulative statements, which are closely linked to the main point.
In addition, the inspection included the legal situation in the area of international bus passenger transport and a comparison of some statistical data.
Comparing the VAT systems of the two countries found differences in the following areas:
1) VAT registration.
While entrepreneurs are registered in Germany regardless of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the primary criterion (among other things) is for registering exceeding the limit set in the VAT Act.
In the Czech Republic, only one tax identification number is allocated to payers, which they also use in intra-community transactions.
In Germany, a VAT number is allocated to payers when registering for VAT, serving only for commercial transactions in the territory of Germany.
If a German payer intends to carry out intracomonality transactions, he must apply for the allocation of a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID.
As different methods of registration cause problems, conditions should be levelled across the EU (see 4.1).
2) International bus passenger transport.
In the Czech Republic, the international bus transport of persons is exempt from VAT with the right to deduct VAT.
In Germany, the part of the transport taking place on German territory is subject to VAT.
Efforts should be made at EU level to harmonise the situation within the meaning of Article 393 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC, on the common system of VAT (see 4.2)
3) VAT tax returns.
While in the Czech Republic, payers file VAT returns only for individual tax periods (month or quarter), in Germany, payers are obliged to file so-called preliminary VAT tax returns (monthly or quarterly) and have to file an annual VAT return at the end of the calendar year.
Unlike the Czech Republic, payers in Germany are obliged to file preliminary tax returns electronically.
The introduction of the obligation to file VAT returns electronically in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech tax administration (see 4.3).
4) Summary reports.
While in the Czech Republic, payers submit recapitulative statements to the tax authorities, in Germany, payers submit recapitulative reports to the CLO.
The tax authorities in the Czech Republic therefore have data from the recapitulative reports available immediately after their submission.
The German tax authorities have information from the recapitulative reports only after they have been processed at the CLO.
Combating VAT fraud requires updated information on intracomonality transactions to be available as soon as possible.
The monthly submission of recapitulative statements would shorten the time difference between the date of the transaction and the update of the VIES data.
This would in turn allow for early verification of taxation in the Member State of the acquirer (see 4.4).
Which, but would require all Member States to adopt the same deadline for submitting a recapitulative statement.
5) International exchange of information in the field of VAT.
The Czech CLO monitors compliance with the three-month deadline for received requests for information.
The German CLO does not track the past time.
As a result, the German tax administration handled a significantly lower percentage of the applications received within the deadline.
Because of these problems, BRH recommended the German CLO to carry out permanent warnings (see 4.6).
6) Risk management system.
Each of the two Member States is developing its own risk management system (risk management system, hereinafter referred to as "RMS"), which has its strengths and weaknesses.
The SAO and BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by just one Member State.
Successful RMS criteria, components and approaches must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State, otherwise fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5.).
As part of the cooperation, the two SAI examined selected cases of intracomonality transactions carried out between tax entities from the Czech Republic and Germany.
Together, using the legislation for the CLO, thirty-one cases of commercial transactions have been examined where there were doubts about their implementation or suspicion of VAT evasion.
It was found that:
In some cases, the tax authorities used information obtained in the form of international cooperation and assessed the VAT liability of the payers.
In these cases, the payers either improperly claimed a VAT exemption claim or did not declare the acquisition of the goods in the VAT return.
In some cases, the tax authorities could not use the information obtained because the information was either incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be used because of the various legal provisions in the two Member States.
In some cases, the tax administration of another Member State refused to respond to a request for information.
Cases have been found where payers erroneously reported business transactions in recapitulative statements.
As a result, the figures in the VIES were incorrect and tax administrations had to examine these cases (see 6.).
The course of the inspection
The course of the control action in the Czech Republic
The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by the Department II – the revenue department of the state budget and the territorial unions of Central Bohemia, northwest Bohemia, southern Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and northern Moravia.
The audited persons were: Ministry of Finance (hereinafter referred to as "MF") and 10 Financial Offices – Financial Office in Humpolec, Financial Office in Jihlava, Financial Office in Kadani, Financial Office in Liberec, Financial Office in Nymburk, Financial Office in Otrokovice, Financial Office for Prague 1, Financial Office for Prague 4 Financial Office in Sokolov and Financial Office in Třinec.
The audit conclusion of this audit was approved by the SAO College on 23 April 2007.
The course of the control action in Germany
The audit was carried out between June 2006 and February 2007 by the Audit Group on Indirect Taxation and Personnel Designated Regional Audit Offices in Berlin, Frankfurt am Main and Munich.
The audit was part of the 2006 control plan and was therefore notified to the Federal I.F. in 2006.
After the testing phase, the inspection started in the fourth quarter of 2006.
According to the cases selected by BRH and later elected SAO, BRH had to notify a review of a number of federal states.
In addition to interviews at the Federal I.F. and CLO, the check was carried out in the following federal states:
Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.
Included were the tax files of the following tax authorities:
Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, Munich - FÚ for Corporations/ Legal Entities (München-Körperschaften), Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hann-Hansa, Hamburg-Hordn-Mitte (Hamburg-Mitte), Hamburg-North (Hamburg-Nord) and Hamburg for large enterprises (Hamburg-Genburg),
In addition, negotiations were held with the Augsburg-City Financial Office (Augsburg-Stadt), Aurich, Düsseldorf-old city (Düsseldorf-Altstadt), Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.
A report on the control findings was submitted to the I.M.F. in May 2007.
Cooperation between the two audit institutions
As part of the preparation of parallel control actions, several meetings of representatives of the two audit institutions took place in the period prior to their start.
Participants in these meetings became acquainted with the organisation of tax administrations, the legislative regulation of VAT issues and the VAT management system in both countries.
At the meeting, which took place in May 2006, the topics of the testing phase were agreed.
The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.
As part of this negotiation, a timetable for the next progress of the work was agreed and the following topics of parallel checks were established:
1. Registration of VAT payers.
2.
International bus transport of persons - legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.
3. International exchange of information, in particular the procedure of tax administrators in handling requests for information and examining selected problem cases listed in requests for information and spontaneous information transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany.
4. VAT tax returns.
5.
Summary reports.
6.
Statistics on the delivery and acquisition of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany.
7. Risk management in the area of VAT.
On the joint audit day of the SAO and BRH, which took place in December 2006, the two sides became acquainted with each other with the course of the audit in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the results of parallel control actions so far.
The report on the results of parallel inspections of the VAT administration between the Czech Republic and Germany was drawn up at a working meeting in July 2007.
4. Value Added Tax Administration in the Czech Republic and Germany
Registration of payers in the Czech Republic
A) Payers who have their registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic
According to Act No. 337/1992 Coll., on the Administration of Tax and Fees (hereinafter referred to as Law No. 337/1992 Coll."), the taxpayer, the tax payer and the legal successor to a natural or legal person defined by law as a tax entity is understood.
As of 31 December 2004, a total of 421,865 tax entities were registered for VAT in the Czech Republic.
On 1 December 2005, there was an increase in the number of tax entities registered for VAT to 457 590.
A taxable person who has its registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic, whose turnover exceeds CZK 1,000,000 (EUR 33,575) for the next 12 consecutive calendar months, becomes a payer from the 1st day of the third month following the month in which it exceeded the registration limit (Section 94(1) of Act No 235/2004 Coll., on Value Added Tax; hereinafter referred to as "Law No 235/2004 Coll.).
The registration application is required by this person within 15 days of the end of the month in which they exceeded the registration limit.
The current legislation does not allow a taxable person to be registered so-called retrospectively in cases where the reason for registration is to exceed the legal limit for registration.
A taxable person with a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic who carries out taxable transactions or transactions exempt from VAT with a right to deduct may become a tax payer, even if he does not exceed a turnover of CZK 1,000,000 (EUR 33,575), if he fulfils one of the other conditions set out in Act No 235/2004 Coll.
A taxable person with a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic who does not comply with any of the conditions laid down by law can apply for registration for VAT voluntarily.
Delivery of the application for registration to the locally competent tax administrator initiates registration proceedings under Act No. 337/1992 Coll.
The voluntary VAT payer on the VAT registration application shall also indicate the date on which he applies for registration as a VAT payer.
The tax administrator shall examine the data communicated by the tax entity, i.e. the completed application for registration with all annexes.
If he has doubts about the data, he shall invite the taxpayer to explain, supplement or substantiate the data.
After verifying that the tax authority fulfils the conditions for registration, the tax authority issues a decision in the form of a certificate that the taxpayer is registered and has been assigned a tax identification number (hereinafter referred to as the Tax Code).
On the certificate, the tax administrator shall indicate the date of the VAT registration and the periodicity of the VAT registration period.
The tax period is the calendar quarter if the payer's turnover for the previous calendar year did not reach CZK 10,000,000 (EUR 335 750).
If the payer's turnover for the previous calendar year reached CZK 10,000,000 (EUR 335 750), the tax period is the calendar month.
The payer, whose turnover for the previous calendar year reached CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150), is entitled to choose a calendar month for the tax year and will notify the tax administrator of this change.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The allocation of the VAT number in the registration certificate is always of a constitutive nature and the taxpayer is obliged to state them in all cases of communication (including payments) with the tax administrator and in cases where a special law so provides (e.g. Act No. 235/2004 Coll. when issuing tax documents).
The VAT number contains the code "CZ" and the common part, which is made up of the general identifier.
The general identifier for a natural person is a birth number, or another general identifier, if a special law so provides, and an identification number for a legal person (Paragraph 33(12) of Act No 337/1992 Coll.).
If the taxpayer has not complied with its registration obligation even at the request of the tax administrator, it shall be registered immediately by the tax administrator concerned.
The registration procedure results in the issue of the Ex officio registration certificate, which is delivered to the taxpayer.
In the Czech Republic, a tax entity that obtained a business license is allocated to the Tax Code at the time of its first registration for any tax.
The same VAT is used by the tax entity even if it is registered as a VAT payer.
According to the wording of Act No 235/2004 Coll., which is effective from 1 January 2005, the tax administrator may, in the event of failure to comply with the VAT registration obligation, impose on the taxable person compensation of up to 10% of the sum of the proceeds or income for taxable transactions that this person has improperly carried out without tax for the period from the date to which he should have been a registered payer by law until the date on which he or she became a registered payer on the basis of a decision of the tax administrator (Article 98(1) of Act No 235/2004 Coll.).
Payment of the amount thus determined is considered to be a tax payment (Section 98(3) of Act No 235/2004 Coll.), i.e. it is not a penalty.
The abolition of registration of the VAT payer subject to compliance with the conditions laid down by law is possible for two reasons:
1)
Abolition of registration at the request of the payer, mainly in respect of the amount of turnover that does not reach the registration limit (Section 106(1) of Act No 235/2004 Coll.).
The payer is entitled to apply for the withdrawal of the registration at the earliest after 1 year of the effective date indicated on the registration certificate.
2) Revocation of registration "ex officio" (Section 106(7) of Act No 235/2004 Coll.), unless: (a) the payer did not take place without notice of reason to the tax administrator for 12 consecutive months of performance, (b) the payer fails to comply with his obligations under Act No 235/2004 Coll., (c) the payer ceases to be a taxable person.
B) Payers who do not have a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic A person registered for tax in another Member State who does not have a registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic, or a foreign taxable person who performs a transaction with a place of performance in the Czech Republic and is a person liable to declare and pay tax on this transaction pursuant to Section 108 of Act No 235/2004 Coll. (the so-called "unfounded payer") becomes a payer on the date of this transaction.
This person is obliged to submit an application for registration to the Financial Office for Prague 1 at the latest on the date of implementation of the performance.
It is required to indicate in the registration application all the TINs allocated to it in other Member States or in a third country.
If a "unsettled" payer submits an application for registration later than the date of the first taxable transaction in the Czech Republic, the Financial Office for Prague 1 registers it retroactively, because under Act No 235/2004 Coll., the taxpayer became a VAT payer on the date of the first taxable transaction in the Czech Republic.
During retroactive registration, the Tax Office for Prague 1 requires evidence from tax entities that the performance has been carried out (factures or explanatory letters).
If a "unsettled" tax entity applies for registration in the Czech Republic before the first taxable performance is carried out, then the Financial Office for Prague 1 requests the submission of contracts for the performance to take place.
As of 31 December 2004, 473 "unsettled" payers were registered at the Financial Office for Prague 1, 2004, of which 124 payers from Germany, and as of 31 December 2005 951 "unsettled" payers were registered, including 233 payers from Germany.
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 106(9) of Act No 235/2004 Coll., the tax administrator is entitled to revoke the registration of an "unsettled" payer on 31 January of the following calendar year, unless the payer incurred any obligation to declare and pay the tax during the current calendar year.
The SAO's audit found that if a "unsettled" payer submits a tax return abroad for postal transport on 25 January, i.e. in accordance with the statutory regulation within the deadline for filing the tax return, the tax office often does not have it available on 31 January.
In cases where the facts relevant for the possibility of deregistration of registration to the tax office are known later than 31 January, it is no longer possible in the Czech Republic in a given calendar year to cancel the VAT registration of the "non-sustodied" payer.
Registration of payers in Germany
In view of the legal provisions of the German Tax Code (Sections 137, 138 Abgabenordnung, ‘the AO’), anyone carrying out a business activity is obliged to inform the municipal/municipal authority or the relevant tax office.
The deadline for submitting information is one month after starting a business.
This information is processed by the Municipal/Municipal Office for the Financial Conduct Authority.
If the IRS finds out an undertaking that has started but has not registered, the competent tax authority may register that payer ex officio – even retroactively.
Taxpayers who are both tax residents and non-resident tax residents in Germany are required by law to register for VAT if they meet the criteria set out in Paragraph 2 of the German VAT Act (UStG).
This obligation does not depend on the volume of turnover they make.
There is no voluntary VAT registration in Germany.
For entrepreneurs permanently living abroad, there are special tax offices.
For example, for those who have their registered office in the Czech Republic, the relevant Financial Office is Chemnitz-Süd.
As of 30 April 2004, a total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered at the Chemnitz-Süd Financial Office; as of 1 March 2006, a total of 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered.
BRH found that these special tax authorities often refused to register so-called semi-dependent independent workers based in the new eastern EU Member States.
As the work permits of staff from the ten new EU Member States are limited after their accession to the EU, these independent workers have tried to avoid these restrictions by starting a business.
Those undertakings do not meet the criteria for entrepreneurs set out in Paragraph 2 of the UStG because they are usually dependent on a single employer who determines their working time and the way in which they perform their work.
For the purpose of registration, the entrepreneur must complete a questionnaire from the competent tax office in which he must provide information on the company and the activities he carries out.
The questionnaire is a standard form that is binding on all tax authorities in Germany.
It is processed either by special departments of the tax authorities or by services with a general focus responsible for assessing taxpayers.
This form carries out a risk assessment of individual taxpayers before the tax office issues a tax number.
The structure of the tax number for domestic transactions follows certain rules:
The first three digits provide information about the relevant tax office, the following three (or four) provide information about the relevant department at the tax office, the other five (or four) are to distinguish payers, the last being always the check digit.
If an entrepreneur intends to participate in an intracomonality trade, he or she needs an VAT identification number (VAT ID) in order to receive an exempt intracomonality supply.
CLO assigns a VAT ID at the request of the entrepreneur if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany and if he has a VAT tax number.
CLO assigns VAT ID to entrepreneurs automatically when payers indicate intracomonarian supplies in their VAT return.
The structure of the VAT ID is the country code (DE) followed by a series of nine digits.
Registration of an entrepreneur may be revoked: 1. at his request (for example, if he has ceased his business), after carrying out all administrative work (assessment for all marketing years) and 2. if the tax administration realises that he is no longer engaged in a business activity.
The validity of the VAT identification number is normally linked to the validity of the VAT tax number.
In such cases, the tax authorities are required to inform the CLO of the abolition of the tax number so that the CLO can terminate the VAT identification number.
Under the German VAT Act (Section 19 (1) of the UStG), tax residents in Germany are not obliged to pay VAT in the case 1. that the turnover plus the relevant VAT of the previous calendar year does not exceed EUR 17 500 and 2 in the following year is unlikely to exceed EUR 50 000.
So-called small entrepreneurs ("Kleinunternehmer") are not entitled to invoice other entrepreneurs VAT and are not entitled to deduct input tax.
Although they are not obliged to pay VAT, small entrepreneurs must be registered with the tax office and have to file an annual VAT return.
A small entrepreneur may declare that he will not apply the provisions of Paragraph 19(1) of the UStG.
This confession is binding on him for the next five years.
An entrepreneur can then invoice VAT and deduct input tax.
For tax non-residents, there is the possibility to appoint a tax representative (Section 22a of the UStG).
A prerequisite is that they carry out exclusively tax-exempt commercial transactions and are not entitled to deduct input tax.
The function of the tax representative is to fulfil the tax obligations of a foreign entrepreneur, who thus does not have to register for VAT.
The invoices must include information on representation for tax purposes.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation is different in both countries.
While entrepreneurs are registered in Germany regardless of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the primary criterion (among other things) is for registering exceeding the limit set in the VAT Act.
If the taxpayer does not exceed the specified limit in the Czech Republic, he has the option to apply for VAT registration voluntarily.
The registration procedure is standardised in Germany, but as a result of different organisational models in federal states, there may be differences.
In the Czech Republic, the payer is allocated a VAT number at the time of his first registration for any tax.
If the payer registers for VAT, he also uses the same VAT number in intracomonality transactions.
In Germany, a VAT number is allocated to the payer when registering for VAT, serving only for commercial transactions in the territory of Germany.
If a German payer intends to carry out intracomonality transactions, he must apply for the allocation of a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID.
As the SAO and BRH have discovered, the German two-tier registration system can cause many misunderstandings in other Member States, as in the Czech Republic, which allocates a single identification number for national VAT registration and registration to intracomonality transactions.
On the other hand, the two-tier system allows retroactive (national) registration in cases where payers refuse to inform the municipality or the relevant tax office of their business.
This retroactive registration allows for a correct assessment of VAT for the previous tax year, in particular an accurate estimate of the VAT liability.
As different methods of registration cause problems, conditions should be levelled across the EU.
The German parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number (hereinafter referred to as the Tax Code).
The Federal Tax Office will allocate the Tax Code at the birth of a natural person.
This VAT number will be valid throughout the life of a natural person who is a German resident.
If a natural person starts a business, the relevant tax office will apply for an economic VAT number to be used as a VAT ID.
In the future there should be no delay between the national registration of the payer and the allocation of VAT ID.
Work on the introduction of the IT device to manage the TIN has not yet been completed.
International bus transport of persons
Legislation in the Czech Republic
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 70 of Act No 235/2004 Coll., with effect from 1 May 2004, the transport of persons between individual Member States and also between Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic is exempt from VAT with a right to deduct.
Such carriage is exempt from VAT even if it is carried out by taxable entrepreneurs in other Member States or by a foreign taxable person.
The return transport is considered to be a separate transport.
If "unsettled" tax entities in the Czech Republic do not carry out other economic activities in addition to international bus passenger transport, they are not obliged to register as VAT payers in the Czech Republic.
International passenger transport in the Czech Republic was exempt from VAT on the basis of the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, Annex V. 5(1)(b), which states:
‘For the purposes of Article 28(3)(b) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Czech Republic may continue to exempt value added tax on international passenger transport in accordance with point 17 of Annex F to the Directive until the condition laid down in Article 28(4) of the Directive is met or while the same exemption is applied by an existing Member State, whichever is the earlier.’
Description of the legislation in Germany
Pursuant to Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006, implemented in Paragraph 3b(1) of the German VAT Act, the place of supply of passenger transport (i.e. transport services) is the route (i.e. the place where the transport takes place.
The German tax system therefore makes no distinction between national and international cross-border passenger transport.
Only that part of the route that takes place in Germany constitutes a taxable provision of transport in Germany.
The German tax system also makes no distinction between tax residents and non-residents.
If a non-resident taxpayer transports passengers through Germany, then the part of the route that takes place in Germany also represents a taxable provision of transport.
Before carrying out its services in Germany, the non-resident must notify his intention to provide passenger transport to the competent tax office.
The tax office shall register this non-resident tax (cf. 4.1.2) and issue a special certificate for any bus or coach specified in the taxpayer's notice.
The taxpayer is obliged to declare his taxable transport provision in the German VAT return.
As of 1 March 2006, the Chemnitz-Süd Financial Office registered 741 Czech payers who did business in passenger transport.
Where the carriage of passengers is provided to a tax resident who is a taxable person for VAT, the non-resident does not have to pay VAT himself to the tax office.
Instead, the entity required to pay VAT to the tax authority and the invoiced net amount to the non-resident taxpayer is a resident of the recipient of the services; this process is known as the ‘reverse charge’ and is in accordance with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC.
In addition to the notification of the non-resident tax and his VAT return, the German tax authorities have several means to assess the accuracy of the declared taxable provision of passenger transport.
Customs mobile control groups carry out an audit of the certificate of buses authorised (licenses) for foreign transport, which are used to transport passengers through Germany.
After each audit, mobile control groups send a control report to the relevant tax authority.
If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group is entitled to require the bus driver to pay VAT before continuing to carry out further transport.
A non-resident tax may deduct the VAT thus paid on the tax calculated in his VAT return.
If the IRS has doubts about the accuracy of the VAT return, it may notify the intention to carry out an audit that must be carried out at the Office of the Tax Office or may use the administrative cooperation funds referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 (see 4.6).
Even if a non-resident refuses to pay the amount of VAT assessed in accordance with its statutory rate, the tax office may apply for administrative cooperation under Council Directive 76/308/EEC.
If a VAT return is to be reviewed or the non-resident's obligations are to be carried out, BRH considers all these means of administrative cooperation to be too labour-intensive compared to the small amounts of VAT to be paid as taxable the provision of passenger transport.
In particular, the audit of the accounts of the non-resident gives rise to disproportionate costs for both the taxpayer and the tax administration.
The tax administration must carry out an audit of foreign accounting, which means not only the need to know a foreign language, but also a familiarity with foreign accounting standards.
An audit of this type is also likely to take more time than an audit of a tax resident, but this audit is limited to the provision of passenger transport carried out in Germany.
On the other hand, a non-resident does not only have to accept the right to carry out the control of his national tax administration, but also the right to carry out an audit by other Member States in which he transports passengers.
In addition, in each Member State in which only one provision of passenger transport takes place, the taxpayer is obliged to fulfil all the tax obligations applicable to it in those Member States, in all languages and on all tax forms of those Member States.
Actual taxation of cross-border passenger transport therefore entails disproportionate bureaucratic costs.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation in the two countries is different.
In the Czech Republic, the transport of persons between individual EU Member States, or between Member States and third countries, is exempt from VAT with a right to deduct tax on the basis of the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the part of the transport which takes place on German territory constitutes a taxable supply.
Where such transport is provided by a non-established payer in Germany for the first time, it is obliged to notify the competent tax authority in advance of the transport.
The tax office registers this payer and the payer is obliged to declare in Germany the taxable provision of part of the transport in the tax return.
Implementation of the law is very time-consuming in Germany.
At least three of the four Czech payers registered at the Chemnitz-Süd Financial Office are in passenger transport business.
Compared to the effort, the tax revenue, if it is realized, is rather low.
Member States collecting VAT in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of VAT shall be subject to time consuming obligations without a financially sensitive result.
In order to avoid disproportionate costs to impose VAT, the provision of cross-border passenger transport should be taxed in only one Member State.
This could be the state where the transport begins or where the provider is located.
Such taxation would require adaptation of Council Directive 2006/112/EC.
Tax returns for VAT
Submission and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic
The payer is obliged to file a VAT return on the form prescribed by the I.M.F. within 25 days of the end of the tax period, even if he has not been subject to a tax liability, unless the law provides otherwise.
The tax liability itself is due within the period for filing the VAT tax return, with the exception of the tax charged in connection with the import of goods pursuant to Section 20 of Act No 235/2004 Coll., for which the tax is determined by customs regulations.
If, as a result of the assessment of excess deduction, a refundable overpayment arises, the payer shall return without request within 30 days of the assessment of the excess deduction.
The deadline is not applied in cases where the tax administrator initiates tax proceedings relating to the payer's tax liability.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 73(11) of Act No 235/2004 Coll., the right to deduct can be exercised in a regular VAT return at the latest for the last tax year in which the right to deduct could be exercised.
At the end of that period, the right to deduct may be further exercised within 3 years of the end of the tax year in which the right to deduct could have been exercised first.
However, this is only possible in the form of filing an additional VAT return.
The amendment to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., effective from 1 January 2005, allows the filing of an additional VAT return only for the period when the right to deduct could be exercised for the first time.
The payer is obliged to submit an additional VAT return if (a) the sum of the corrections increases the tax liability, (b) he makes a correction that does not change the last known tax liability, but only the data by the tax entity previously claimed, (c) he corrects the rate and the amount of tax according to Section 49 of Act No 235/2004 Coll.
The payer may submit an additional VAT return if the sum of the corrections reduces the tax liability.
An additional VAT return is required to be submitted by the payer by the end of the month following the discovery of these facts.
The submission of a VAT return in electronic form can be made both via the Internet network or on a technical data medium.
Submissions over the Internet can be made as a submission with a data message bearing a guaranteed electronic signature or as a submission with a data message not covered by a guaranteed electronic signature.
In the case of submission with a data message not covered by a guaranteed electronic signature, submission is still required in written form, i.e. delivery of the computer assembly to the tax administrator (e-print).
The VAT tax return contains separate lines concerning the values of intracomonant supplies/equipment.
The values of the acquisition of services are reported on the special lines of the VAT return.
Some lines are used for the purpose of initial automated control within the ADIS system.
The values of the supply of goods to other Member States to taxable persons in other Member States shall be compared with those set out in the recapitulative statements submitted by Czech payers.
The values of the acquisition of goods from other Member States from taxable persons in other Member States shall be compared with those obtained through the VIES system from the recapitulative statements of payers from other EU Member States.
The tax office is undergoing a test of the credibility of VAT returns under the ADIS system.
This test takes place automatically, as tax returns for VAT cannot be assessed without a test.
The credibility test includes the calculation of the credibility criteria and the evaluation of risky types of VAT returns.
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 37(1) of Act No 337/1992 Coll., the Financial Conduct Authority may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 000 000 (EUR 67,150) within the prescribed period.
An automated tax information system used by the FC to provide technical support for tax administration.
The SAO's audit found that the tax authorities mostly did not use the possibility of imposing a fine on payers for not filing a VAT tax return.
Submission and processing of VAT returns in Germany
In Germany, we distinguish between a preliminary monthly or quarterly VAT return and an annual VAT return.
Those taxpayers who are obliged to submit preliminary VAT returns must still submit an annual VAT return.
Even small entrepreneurs who are not obliged to pay VAT must submit an annual tax return.
In general, taxpayers are required to submit a quarterly VAT return by the 10th day of the month following the quarter in which VAT is incurred (section 18(2) of the UStG).
However, if the VAT liability exceeds EUR 6 136 in the previous calendar year or, in the case of a newly established undertaking, the relevant entrepreneur is obliged to submit a monthly VAT return by the 10th day in the following month.
The taxpayer may also decide to file a monthly VAT return if a tax has been refunded last year which exceeded EUR 6 136 (Art.18(2)a of the UStG).
VAT returns do not need to be filed if the amount of annual VAT does not exceed EUR 512.
The relevant amount of VAT tax liability must be paid by the 10th day of the month following the tax period in which the VAT was incurred.
The refund of the tax may lead to an even more detailed investigation by the FC.
There are no deadlines (under the law) for processing tax returns and the refund of excess VAT deduction.
For the purpose of a timely refund, it is possible to offer to secure the amount to be recovered.
The basic principle is to process VAT returns and return the tax quickly.
The German VAT Act provides for the possibility to extend this period (Section 18(6) of the UStG).
Such an extension should be requested separately.
It makes it possible to submit a VAT return and pay the relevant VAT liability a month later, provided that a special advance is paid in the case of a monthly return.
This advance payment will be offset against the December VAT liability.
Whenever an error is found, the entrepreneur must file a corrective VAT return.
There is no additional VAT return.
Once the annual VAT return, which must be filed by 31 May of the following calendar year, is registered with the tax office, the entrepreneur cannot correct the erroneous preliminary tax return, but only the annual VAT tax return.
Correction of the annual VAT return to or against the payer is possible during the following 4 years after the year in which the first annual VAT return was filed.
After these four years, the annual VAT return can normally be corrected only in cases of tax fraud or evasion.
Payers are obliged to file preliminary VAT returns electronically.
Financial authorities may apply exemptions from this rule in order to avoid undue harshness.
Submission of an annual VAT return is possible in paper form or via the Internet, either with or without certification.
If it is carried out without certification, the payer must file a return once more on paper with personal signatures.
In the event that the payer does not file a VAT return, the tax administration is entitled to make a gross estimate of the taxpayer's turnover.
In the event of late submission, a penalty payment may be imposed on the payer (maximum of 10% of the tax to be paid or EUR 25 000).
BRH found during a previous check that tax authorities often do not measure this standard fine.
In other cases where the tax authorities imposed a fine, the amount was assessed inconsistently and arbitrarily.
Therefore, the standard fine does not meet its objective of shortening the average delay, especially when submitting an annual VAT return.
The VAT tax return contains separate lines relating to the values of intracomonant supplies/management of goods.
The values of the acquisition of services are reported on the special lines of the VAT return.
Non-taxable transactions must be recognised on a separate line of tax return/to VAT.
In the case of VAT returns presented in paper form, a copy must be made either by means of a scanner or by staff specifically authorised to do so.
The data from the VAT returns submitted electronically is immediately available to the IRS employee.
Once all the data is entered into the system, the RMS staff will pass them through and make a selection of cases that meet certain criteria.
The VAT return collected must be checked by a Financial Officer on the basis of a control report drawn up by the system.
(see section 5.2).
Although the tax administration must grossly estimate the amount of VAT that the taxpayer has to pay, the estimated tax must be as accurate as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, payers file VAT returns within 25 days after the end of the tax year.
The tax period, depending on the payer's turnover, is either a calendar quarter or a calendar month.
In Germany, payers file advance VAT returns, depending on the tax liability in the previous year, either within 10 days after the end of the calendar quarter or month.
Until 31 May of the following year, payers are required to file annual tax returns.
The obligation to file an annual VAT return has its pros and cons:
+ on the end of the calendar year, the payer is able to correct errors in (monthly preliminary) tax returns by filing a single annual VAT return;
– if the payer corrects the admitted intracomonality transactions, the correction cannot be related to the period for which the recapitulative statement is made;
– the federal states do not usually compare the VIES data on intracomonality acquisitions of German payers prior to the processing of the annual VAT return.
In accordance with the registration (see 4.1.3), German payers are obliged to file an annual VAT return irrespective of their turnover.
This obligation allows the German financial authority to examine the maximum turnover limit for small entrepreneurs.
In addition, the responsible tax office is able to compare the annual VAT return with direct tax returns and the final accounts.
In the Czech Republic, tax administrators are only able to determine the amount of the payer's turnover from the filed income tax returns.
Unlike the Czech Republic, payers in Germany are obliged to file VAT returns in electronic form.
The introduction of the obligation to file tax returns electronically in the Czech Republic would contribute to increasing the efficiency of the Czech tax administration.
Summary reports
Submission and processing of recapitulative statements in the Czech Republic
The summary report (hereinafter referred to as "SH") is filed under the provisions of Section 102 of Act No 235/2004 Coll. of the payer who made the supply of goods to another Member State to a taxable person in another Member State.
Data on the value of goods delivered are always shown in the Czech currency by individual tax entity, indicating their VAT ID, under which they are registered in their country.
Data on the services provided are not included in SH.
SH is served by payers with both monthly and quarterly tax periods for each calendar quarter within 25 days of its completion to the locally competent tax authority.
Correction of erroneous data is made in the subsequent SH within 15 days from the error detection date.
The erroneous data referred to in SH shall always be replaced by the data provided in the subsequent SH.
Like tax returns, the payers can file SH in electronic form.
In the event that the payer does not administer SH or the subsequent SH and should have filed them under Act No. 235/2004 Coll., the tax administrator will invite him to submit it and at the same time instructs him about the consequences in the event of the non-submission of SH or the subsequent SH, i.e. the fact that the tax administrator is entitled to repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) for failing to comply with the obligations of a non-monetary nature.
The SAO's audit found that the tax authorities mostly did not use the possibility of imposing a fine on payers for failing to comply with their legal obligations.
In the case of the administration of SHs in particular, tax entities are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their obligations because the non-submission of SH does not affect VAT liability.
According to Section 102(5) of Act No 235/2004 Coll., the tax administrator is obliged to examine the data in SH, or in the subsequent SH, to remove any ambiguities and use the data to determine the tax liability.
In the event of non-compliance with data in SH and data in the relevant (payers with the monthly tax period) or the relevant (substitutes with a quarterly tax period) VAT return, the tax administrator should verify the accuracy of the tax liability declared in the VAT return.
Incorrect data in SH will be removed by the tax entity by filing a subsequent SH itself, or may be invited to do so.
The tax administrator shall correct the details of the supply of goods to other Member States in the ADIS system where:
– the payer does not demonstrate the information given in SH (or subsequent SH), correcting it by administering a subsequent SH,
– the tax authority has demonstrated that the data provided by the payer in SH or the subsequent SH are not true.
By entering a correction without filing a subsequent SH by the payer, the tax administrator does not replace the filing of the taxpayer, only adjusting the data in the VIES database so that they are up to date, complete and accurate.
Data from SH shall be sent to the Member States concerned.
They can be sent and accepted only by the national authority of the financial administration, designed to cooperate with other Member States in the field of VAT; this is the CLO (in the Czech Republic, the International Cooperation in the Administration of VAT (CLO) fulfils this function.
O_MCTL is an automatic message that the CLO receives from other Member States.
It contains all the erroneous VAT ID specified in the SH lines sent.
If a faulty VAT ID is used in one of the transmitted common SH or subsequent SH rows, a record is made to the error VAT ID table.
The table contains so-called "Notice of doubt on VAT ID."
The tax administrator will examine the data and record the result of the verification into the system.
When acquiring goods from another Member State, the payer is obliged to declare VAT and state the value of the acquisition on separate lines of the VAT return.
Selected cases of irregularities in the value of goods procured declared by the Czech payer in their VAT return and in the value of the goods delivered, as stated by the payers of other Member States in their SH, are sent from the CLO to the tax office for verification.
Tax administrators are obliged to investigate the irregularities.
There can be three situations:
a) The value declared by the Czech payer in the relevant lines of VAT return tax returns is lower than the value of the supply declared by EU payers.
In this case, the tax administrator will check the accuracy of the data.
(b) The difference is 0.
This situation can occur either by changing the data in the EU (the foreign supplier corrects its SH) or by changing the data in the VAT return (the Czech tax entity itself submits an additional VAT return in the meantime).
In this case, it is at the discretion of the tax administrator whether, despite this fact, it will verify the accuracy of the data in the VAT return.
(c) The value of the acquisition of goods from other Member States declared by the Czech tax payer in the relevant lines of the VAT return tax return is higher than the value of the goods delivered declared to EU payers.
Here, too, it is at the discretion of the controller to verify the accuracy of the data.
After examining the difference and clarifying the causes of its creation, the tax administrator shall bring the result of the verification to ADIS.
The results of the screening are transmitted back to the CLO.
The number of cases sent from the CLO to the tax authorities for verification for individual quarter of 2005 is shown in Graph 1 (source note: MF).
The above-mentioned Graph 1 demonstrates that the number of cases transmitted from the CLO to the tax authorities fell for each quarter of 2005.
A significant decrease in the number occurred for the 4th quarter of 2005. The CLO has raised the minimum financial limit, including with regard to the possibility of sending requests for information to other EU Member States.
The discrepancy between VAT return data and EU data may not always be due to an error on the part of the domestic payer.
It may also be an error on the part of EU payers or an error resulting from the fact that in individual EU Member States some types of transactions can be reported to SH in a different way.
The most common reasons for irregularities in the values of the reported transactions found at the audited tax authorities are shown in Table 1.
Submission and processing of recapitulative statements in Germany
Entrepreneurs who make intracomonality deliveries from Germany to other EU Member States or participate in tripartite transactions shall be required to lodge once a quarter of the year to the SH, which indicate intracomonality delivery by beneficiary (section 18a(1) of the UStG).
SH must be submitted by the 10th day of the month following the relevant calendar quarter.
If an extension of this period is allowed in the case of provisional VAT returns, this also applies to SH.
SH must be supplied to the CLO.
As of 1 January 2007, they must be submitted electronically.
Exemptions may be granted by the competent tax authorities to certain taxpayers in order to avoid undue harshness.
In cases where taxpayers become aware that erroneous data are provided in SH, they are required to submit a corrective report within one month.
In the event that taxpayers do not lodge an SH, the CLO will initiate proceedings to enforce the submission of such a report.
Part of this procedure is: – the first reminder – the second reminder associated with the threat of a fine/penalty, and – the assessment of the penalty payment.
Although the German Tax Code allows a fine of up to EUR 25 000 (Section 329 AO), the CLO assesses fines in three steps, in amounts of EUR 125, 250 and EUR 500.
In addition, Paragraph 26a(1)(5) of the UStG provides that payers act illegally if they deliberately or negligently do not administer the SH properly, submit them incomplete, do not administer them on time or if they do not correct or correct at all late SH.
This offence can be punished with a fine of up to EUR 5 000.
Data on intracomonality deliveries cannot be entered into VIES by the Financial Conduct Authority because the processing of SH is the sole task of CLO.
The SH data is stored only in the CLO system.
Therefore, data from SH are visually available only after processing them to CLO.
The time limits for the processing of SH are set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
The data from SH must be stored within three months following the relevant calendar quarter.
In the event of incorrect VAT ID in SH German payers, CLO will receive O_MCTL codes from another Member State.
CLO contacts a particular entrepreneur and asks him for the correct information.
If the CLO fails to obtain the correct information, the case shall be referred to the relevant tax authorities.
It is then up to these tax authorities to request the correct data.
BRH discovered during the inspection that most entrepreneurs had corrected the VAT ID at CLO's request.
However, the challenge, the threat and the imposition of three additional fines takes up too much time in cases where the payer can be involved in a cross-border carousel fraud.
These cases, which were eventually reported to the relevant tax authorities, were usually completed within one or two months.
The IRS rejected the exemption of reported intracomonality deliveries in 73% of these cases.
When the payer provided the correct VAT ID, the IRS asked him to file a revised SH on the CLO, as the tax authorities cannot correct the VIES data themselves.
BRH found that neither the tax authorities nor the CLO checked the submission of the repaired SH, so payers often did not comply with the request.
In view of the fact that the CLO does not have access to the VAT return data, a comparison of the data on the supply of goods declared in the VAT return and in SH will not take place prior to the submission of these data by the CLO of the other Member States.
This check can only be carried out by the tax authorities and is usually applied in the preparation of VAT control.
Data obtained from other Member States are processed into the CLO.
The incorrect VAT ID is selected and are then submitted to the Member States concerned.
These data are used for the purpose of controlling the acquisition carried out by the tax authorities.
Once they are entered into the system, the CLO will check them on the basis of a comparison with data from previous calendar quarters.
Where they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control information is generated and sent to the relevant tax authorities.
This procedure is applied on a permanent basis, while the compilation of data on the acquisition of goods or services for all VAT payers is created at a later date and presented to the tax authorities.
RMS installed for the purpose of the assessment procedure will then check these data with data on intracomonality acquisitions.
This system completely covers those entrepreneurs who do not have full right to deduct VAT.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, payers who have made supplies of goods to another Member State to a person registered for tax in another Member State shall lodge SH within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter to the locally competent tax authority.
The tax authorities will process SH and transmit the data to the CLO.
The values of the supply of goods to another Member State, referred to by the payers in SH, shall be compared at the tax authorities with the values of the supply of goods to another Member State, those payers in VAT returns.
The results of the comparison are used in the assessment procedure.
In Germany, payers who made intracomonality delivery are required to be served quarterly by the SH by the 10th day of the following calendar quarter.
SHs are served on CLO, from 1 January 2007 in electronic form.
The tax authorities have information from SH only after they are processed at the CLO.
The payers from both the Czech Republic and Germany list only the supply of goods in SH, the provision of services is not mentioned in SH.
Unlike the Czech tax authorities, the German tax authorities are unable to correct the wrong lines filed by SH themselves.
As a result of this limited approach to the data of the German VIES system, the erroneous VAT ID was not corrected, even though the payer provided the FCA with the correct VAT ID.
The German tax authorities do not compare the data on intracomonality supplies contained in the VAT tax return of the German payer and his SH.
Differences between the data of these two statements are usually not found before the German CLO provides VIES data to other Member States.
In view of the BRH findings, it is clear that the comparison would increase the reliability of the transmitted data in VIES.
Data on the supply of goods to Czech payers, delivered from other Member States, are compared in the Czech Republic with data on the acquisition of goods from other Member States declared by Czech payers in their VAT tax returns.
The comparison is made by the CLO separately for each calendar quarter.
The most significant cases of irregularities are passed on to the tax authorities as a warning of possible errors in the payers' tax returns.
Unlike the Czech tax administration, the German tax administration does not usually control the taxation of intracomonarian acquisitions.
Such general control is processed only for payers who do not have full right to deduct VAT.
In addition, the German tax authorities control the taxation of intracomonant acquisitions of other payers only if RMS produces a control warning or if the payer is intended to be checked anyway.
This procedure relieves the tax authorities from the need to clarify the reasons for each difference.
On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of RMS.
Troubleshooting carousel fraud requires continuously updated information on intracomonality acquisitions as soon as possible.
The current SH system, specially VIES, provides information to the financial authorities that can be up to six months old.
This delay can be reduced by up to four months if the payers serve SH monthly.
Monthly filing would not be a significant increase in bureaucratic costs, as most payers in the Czech Republic and Germany are obliged to file VAT returns on a monthly basis - and SH does not require any further information compared to the tax return.
In order to avoid bureaucratic costs, the submission of SH may be linked to the submission of a VAT return.
However, the obligation to administer SH per month would cause more time disagreements between the reporting of intracomonality delivery and intracomonality acquisition and could increase the flow of data between individual CLOs.
In 2006, the German federal government considered the general provision of monthly SHs.
Its implementation failed because of the doubts of the federal states.
They feared that the monthly submission of VIES data to the CLO of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In fact, if the monthly reporting obligation to SH and monthly data transfer were to be effective, the monthly update of VIES would require a European standard of monthly SHs.
Statistics on the delivery and acquisition of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany
Within the framework of foreign trade, Germany represents the most important trading partner for the Czech Republic.
The total volumes of intracomonial transactions in goods made between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in Table 2.
Both SAI requested data on the number of erroneous VAT number or VAT ID, contained in O_MCTL reports transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany for each quarter of the audited period.
These data are contained in the following tables.
The data shows substantial differences.
The cause of these differences may be a different basis for determining the number of O_MCTL messages.
While the Czech CLO refers to their numbers to the calendar quarter for which SH was submitted, the German CLO refers to their numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O_MCTL report was adopted.
International exchange of information level 3
Implementation of international information exchange in the Czech Republic
The international exchange of information allows tax administrations to obtain information from other Member States regarding intracomonality trading transactions and payers who have made such transactions.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 218/92 distinguishes between two basic categories of information exchange, namely the exchange of information on request and the exchange of information without prior request.
The international exchange of information upon request is carried out in the form of a so-called request for information (hereinafter referred to as the "ŽOI"), using standardised SCAC forms.
Tax administrators from the Czech Republic send their ŽOI, respectively replies to delivered ŽOI through the financial directorates to CLO, which provides translation of the information given on standardized SCAC forms into a foreign language and their dispatch to other Member States.
The CLO also ensures the income of ŽOI from other Member States and replies to the dispatched ŽOI, their translation into Czech and distribution to the locally competent tax administrators for processing.
Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 sets a maximum time limit for processing a range of 3 months from receipt of the application.
The SAO's control was subjected to all ŽOI, transmitted during the audited period between the Czech Republic and Germany.
Of the total number of 94 ŽOI, received in the Czech Republic from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were dealt with within the prescribed three-month period, another 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) were dealt with after this deadline and the remaining 1 case was not sent to Germany by the time of the SAO's audit.
More detailed information about the deadlines in which responses to the ŽOI received from Germany were sent from the Czech Republic contains Figure 2.
Of the total number of 335 ŽOI sent from the Czech Republic to Germany, 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) received a reply within the specified three-month period, a further 179 (i.e. 53.4%) of the applications were answered after this deadline and 19 cases (i.e. 5.7%) had not been received by the time of the SAO's examination (in the remaining 1 case it was not possible to determine from the transmitted data when the response from Germany was delivered).
More detailed information about the deadlines in which the responses to the ŽOI sent to Germany were delivered to the Czech Republic contains Figure 3.
The percentage of the values of intracomonant transactions, presented in the ŽOI transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany, contains graph No. 4.
As can be seen from the above graph, the value of commercial transactions, examined through ŽOI, was most often in the range above EUR 60 000.
The international exchange of information without prior request takes place either in the form of automatic or structured automatic exchange of information, or in the form of spontaneous exchange of information.
Tax managers from other Member States are often transferred without prior request information that may be relevant to them in the management of VAT.
In the Czech Republic, all information is collected at the CLO.
Information is transmitted electronically between Member States.
‘Automatic exchange’ under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 means the systematic communication of predetermined information to other Member States, without prior request and at predetermined regular intervals.
"Structified by automatic exchange" means the systematic communication of predetermined information to other Member States, without prior request and as soon as the information is available.
The Czech Republic provides other Member States with information about the delivery of new means of transport in the form of automatic exchange.
This information is available for the tax administrator from the form of the Report on the delivery of a new means of transport pursuant to Section 19 of Act No 235/2004 Coll. and from a copy of the issued tax document.
When processing the aforementioned form, the tax administrator shall complete the necessary data into a specially created template and transmit it in turn to the contact worker at the Financial Directorate, where the data are collected and transmitted to the CLO for subsequent processing and transfer to other Member States within a specified period of time, i.e. no later than two months after the end of the quarter in which this information was available.
Furthermore, the Czech Republic provides other Member States with information on mail order sales that is exempt from VAT in the Member State of origin, information on intra-EU operations that appears to be unjustified and information on potential "missing traders".
This information is sent to other Member States in the form of spontaneous exchange using the SCAC form.
Implementation of international information exchange in Germany
In Germany, both requests for information and the processing of spontaneous information are initiated by the locally competent tax authority.
The tax authorities send the completed form SCAC 2004 by email directly to the German CLO, which transmits the SCAC forms to foreign CLO.
The tax authorities were instructed to write their requests for information or their own spontaneous information only in German; even the SCAC form used is not multilingual.
Half of the German requests for information checked by the BRH were sent in order to ensure taxation of intracomonality acquisitions in another Member State, or to prove the exemption of intra-Community supplies from Germany to another Member State.
If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it shall check the value of the supply of goods or services referred to in the application for a minimum limit of EUR 15 000.
Where there is no reasonable grounds for such request, the German CLO shall reject any application containing an amount lower than that fixed limit.
In addition, the German CLO translates the free texts of the SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)] if these texts are neither in German nor in English.
In order to answer the request for information, the CLO sends the request to the competent tax authority, pointing to the three-month deadline.
There are no additional deadlines for processing applications at specific organisational levels of the tax administration.
Although the German CLO has the technical conditions to monitor past time limits, it lacks sufficient staffing capacity to alert the tax authorities to reply to blank requests for information.
The tax authorities will obtain the necessary information by sending a letter to the taxpayer or by carrying out an audit.
Auditors usually choose between two different types of audits: a special VAT audit covering any taxable process over a period of several months or a so-called VAT inspection, which can only relate to one business operation that has recently been carried out.
This short and flexible audit type does not require any notification to the taxpayer and has demonstrated its usefulness in the investigation of individual taxable business operations.
As part of an automatic exchange without prior application, Germany provides information to other Member States - on the VAT ID allocated to payers resident in other Member States - on the refund of input tax to payers resident in other Member States.
In addition, Germany has committed itself to providing other Member States with the following information through structured automatic exchange:
a. Delivery of new means of transport to entrepreneurs without the use of their VAT ID, b. sending or catalogue sale in other Member States that is not taxable in Germany, c. significant differences between intracomonality acquisitions declared by the payer and VIES data provided by other Member States, d. intracomonality delivery of goods which the German payer did not show in SH because he treated the supplies as domestic transactions, e. potential "missing trader" which carried out intracomonarian transactions independently of the validity of their VAT ID, f. entrepreneurs who supplied goods to potential "writing traders" or to those recipients who misused their VAT.
Comparison and evaluation
The dispatch of ŽOI or spontaneous information is initiated both in the Czech Republic and in Germany by the locally competent tax authorities, which send the completed SCAC form to CLO.
While the Czech CLO uses the SCAC bilingual form (English - English) and translates the sent information into English or German, the German tax authorities follow the instruction according to which they are to write ŽOI or spontaneous information only in German on a single-language form.
The German CLO does not provide for the translation of German texts.
By examining the ŽOI transmitted between 1 May 2004 and 31 December 2005 between the Czech Republic and Germany, the SAO found that the Czech tax administration had handled 74.5% of the applications received within the prescribed three-month period, while the ŽOI sent to Germany was processed by the German tax administration within the deadline of only 40.6% of the cases.
Although the German CLO draws the attention of the tax authorities to a three-month deadline, it does not follow the past time limits.
The result of the missing notifications is a large number of delayed responses to the HOI.
Because of these problems, BRH recommended conducting regular notifications to the CLO.
The situation has already improved.
According to the latest information from the German CLO, it is now alerting the tax authorities to answer unfinished responses to the HOI.
Risk management in the area of VAT
Risk management in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, VAT risk management is dealt with by several departments at various organisational levels of the tax administration.
Under the I.M.F., risk management issues and the fight against VAT fraud are dealt with by the following services:
The Department of Methodology and the Performance of VAT and within it the VAT Risk Management report, which, among other things, manages the risk selection of possible tax evasion and evaluates the trends of these risks at both domestic and Community levels.
It coordinates nationwide the functioning of the role of the credibility of VAT tax returns and the use of data from the VIES system in terms of risks of tax evasion in the context of intracomonality transactions.
Based on data from the trade balance, the Czech Republic evaluates risky commodities, processes conceptually risk management in the field of VAT and cooperates with relevant EU institutions and other Member States in this area.
The International Cooperation in the Administration of VAT, which inter alia ensures the exchange of VAT information, participates in the creation and maintenance of information databases, analyses data from other Member States contained in the VIES system, ensures public awareness and ensures other forms of international cooperation within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
Both SAI requested data on the number of erroneous VAT number or VAT ID, contained in O_MCTL reports transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany for each quarter of the audited period.
These data are contained in the following tables.
The data shows substantial differences.
The cause of these differences may be a different basis for determining the number of O_MCTL messages.
While the Czech CLO refers to their numbers to the calendar quarter for which SH was submitted, the German CLO refers to their numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O_MCTL report was adopted.
The Tax Control and Search Methodology Department, which among other things carries out risk analysis under the methodological management of tax controls and, in line with the risk analysis, sets priorities for targeting tax controls in the plans of the Financial Directorate, processes risk analyses in the context of reducing tax evasion, including the collection of knowledge gained in tax management as well as other sources, and proposes measures to curb tax evasion.
Search departments are set up in financial directorates to carry out, among other things, searches for tax entities and areas that are risky in terms of the occurrence of tax fraud (e.g. online shops, gold, pharmaceutical industry), searches for unregistered tax entities in terms of risks of tax evasion (e.g. internet services, job mediation, radio and press services, etc.), analysis of links of chain fraud and the transfer of information to local tax authorities.
A specialised control unit is set up at the selected 12 tax offices.
They have regional competence, tax controls outside the territorial jurisdiction of the tax authorities are carried out on the basis of a mandate.
The need to establish a department of specialised tax inspections has emerged from the increasing findings of new and improved forms of tax evasion, which occur primarily in chain-linked entities.
These departments focus on controlling tax entities according to the requirements of search departments, tax entities with specific activities and multinational companies and large-scale tax entities in terms of turnover size.
The following mechanisms to limit VAT risks have been integrated into the ADIS system: – the role The credibility of VAT tax returns, used to assess the riskiness of the tax returns filed; – the role The selection of tax entities for control, which allows the payer to be selected for inspection on the basis of the chosen criteria, – the role of VIES through which tax administrations have access to data provided from other EU Member States.
The role of VIES allows, inter alia: – to verify the validity of VAT ID of payers from other Member States, – to obtain from other Member States the values of goods supplied to the Czech payer, declared in SH by all its suppliers from other Member States, – to generate a set of payers who did not do SH, – to carry out a formal check of the data provided by the payers of the Czech Republic before sending these data to other Member States, – to generate a set of payers for which the data on the supply of goods to other Member States mentioned in the VAT returns do not match the data in SH, – to generate a set of payers for which the value of the goods from other Member States mentioned in the VAT returns.
As part of the activity to limit the risks of tax evasion, tax administrators have access to registers of government bodies such as a business register, land register, motor vehicle register, trade licensing register, etc.
More detailed information is provided in chapter 4.4.1 Submission and processing of recapitulative statements in the Czech Republic.
Risk management in Germany
Due to the federal (federal) structure of Germany, the federal tax administration (especially the CLO) and the tax administration of the 16 federal states are involved in the development and operation of the RMS.
Although there are joint development working groups, neither the CLO nor the tax administrations of federal states share a fully consistent database.
At the CLO level, the ST I 2 unit (KUSS) collects the findings of the control relating to tax fraud in a separate database called the OPUS.
The KUSS, in cooperation with the tax authorities, has introduced a new database called ZAUBER designed to transfer the names of tax fraudsters' companies "missing traders."
The KUSS coordinates related cases of national and cross-border tax fraud.
KUSS experience is reflected in the development of RMS in working groups.
In addition, specialists in several other CLO and MF departments are entrusted with RMS-related duties and powers.
At CLO level, a formal check is in place for the composition of the VAT ID of other Member States in SH submitted by German payers.
This formal check is carried out prior to the provision of data from SH to other Member States, to improve the clarity and use of the VIES data provided (see 4.4.2).
The verification of the validity of the VAT ID referred to in SH is made on the basis of O_MCTL codes provided by other Member States (for the invalid VAT ID correction procedure, see also 4.4.2).
In addition, the CLO RMS is based on VIES data transmitted by other Member States and creates several types of control reports based on several characteristics, which usually feature in so-called carousel commercial operations, in order to identify potential "missing traders".
The financial authorities of the federal states have instructions to process these inspection reports and in some cases report on the results of their CLO findings.
The findings of the BRH audit confirmed the need to take into account all the characteristics available if the existence of a tax fraud case is to be presumed with sufficient probability (place of exclusive focus on the company's turnover).
BRH therefore proposed to the I.M.F. to take into account different characteristics when processing the reports.
RMS should also sanction other facts, such as the payment behaviour (morality) of the taxpayer, the field (economic activities) or the shareholder structure.
The second level of RMS is processed in the tax administrations of the federal states and aimed at processing VAT returns.
RMS, for example, generates a list of those payers who have declared intracomonality delivery in their tax returns.
This list is sent to CLO to monitor the full use of SH.
In addition, this type of RMS compares the intracomonality acquisition, reported in the payer's annual VAT return, with the VIES data.
The tax administrations of the Länder seek to avoid comparing quarterly data, as this comparison would reveal too much disapproving data attributed to reasons other than tax evasion or tax fraud; for example:
– a different period of implementation of the intracomonality transaction in the opinion of the supplier on the one hand and the beneficiary on the other;
– Different accounting for sales discounts and sales events (bids) and their different reporting in the tax return.
In addition to comparing data from VAT and VIES tax returns, many federal states have introduced elements of RMS, which are based on the data of VAT returns and certain other facts (such as the structure of the company's name, the age of shareholders, the number of employees and the payment behaviour/or morality of the taxpayer).
Bavaria has introduced a rule-based RMS that allows a team of tax fraud specialists (hereinafter referred to as risk managers) to program its own rules for singling out potential perpetrators of tax fraud.
This RMS is applied when the tax authorities process the monthly VAT return.
The competent tax authority will therefore receive the recommendation created by RMS before setting the VAT.
As this RMS is unable to translate current findings into its activities, risk managers must adjust the relevant rules based on the feedback of the tax authorities.
The administrative district of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania programmed an adaptive artificial neural network with tax file data in which the inspection revealed tax evasion.
Based on these data, RMS is able to identify the characteristics of tax evasion.
RMS creates a once-a-month list of tax files suspected of tax evasion.
The competent tax authorities use this list as a basis for audit decisions proposed by taxpayers.
After the audit, auditors must report on their findings so that the results of the list can be reflected in the RMS.
The administrative region of North Rhine-Westphalia uses an adaptive artificial neural network, which is combined with a rule-based fuzzy system.
Based on the large number of data assessed for VAT returns and certain other facts, this neural-fusion system or system of collecting potentially useful information (the so-called data-mining system) calculates the likelihood that a taxpayer has committed tax fraud.
It then compiles a monthly list of potential perpetrators of fraud.
Local tax authorities use this list as a basis for selecting the relevant taxpayers for inspection and report the findings of the data processing centre.
The implementation of one of these three RMSs in the other Länder is further ongoing.
Since none of these three RMS is based on the same approach, a combination of all systems seems useful for dealing with tax fraud.
The question remains whether this system will lead to the expected results.
Comparison and evaluation
Although specific RMS criteria in the Czech Republic and Germany cannot be discussed in this report, the SAO and BRH have found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.
As well as the different approaches in the three federal states of Germany, the RMS of each EU state has its strengths and weaknesses.
The tax authorities of EU Member States are currently discussing new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.
VAT fraud – especially carousel fraud – does not prove to be a national problem, but rather a European problem.
Payers in fraudulent activities act simultaneously not only in one Member State, but in multiple states.
An effective RMS cannot be developed by only one Member State.
Successful RMS criteria, components and approaches must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State, otherwise fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS.
VAT loss caused by fraud in the EU may not affect a Member State instigator of fraud.
Any Member State that is involved in fraudulent activities may be affected.
There should therefore be a European exchange and debate on RMS.
Selected control findings when verifying commercial transactions
As part of the cooperation on the implementation of parallel control actions, the SAO and BRH examined the quality and use of information about selected business transactions that were the subject of an international exchange of information between the tax administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.
Furthermore, the two audit institutions jointly examined the implementation of several commercial transactions where there were doubts about their implementation or irregularities in the way in which the payers from both countries declared these commercial transactions in their VAT and SH tax returns respectively.
At the request of BRH, the SAO examined a total of 8 cases involving commercial transactions carried out between 8 Czech and 8 German tax entities.
Furthermore, in 43 cases, the SAO examined the values of intracomonant transactions with Germany on the basis of warnings from BRH, which Czech payers reported in their tax returns and SH.
BRH examined a total of 23 cases at the request of the SAO relating to commercial transactions carried out between 23 German and 21 Czech tax entities.
Important information was exchanged on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 through official communication with the CLO.
By examining selected cases, it was found, among other things, that a different method of registration in EU Member States leads to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:
1.
According to data in VIES, the Czech payer was to acquire in the third quarter of 2004 from the German payer of goods worth EUR 60 500.
As the Czech payer ordered the acquisition of the goods only at a value equivalent to EUR 29 869, the Czech tax administrator sent an application to Germany to examine the value of the goods delivered.
In response to the ŽOI delivered from Germany, the German side stated that in the second quarter of 2004 the German payer had supplied the Czech payer of goods worth EUR 27 381, in the third quarter of EUR 31 997 and in the fourth quarter of 2004 worth EUR 10 276.
The reply further showed that the VAT ID of the German payer had only been in force since 28 September 2004, but the German CLO retroactively issued a VAT ID certificate from 1 May 2004 following an additional request from the German payer for the VAT ID certificate.
The German payer repaired SH.
The Czech payer, based on this information, was the acquisition of goods.
The SAO, asking the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic, found that the Czech payer, on the basis of an investigation by the tax administrator, filed additional VAT returns for individual tax periods in 2004, in which he increased the value of goods acquired from other Member States and at the same time exercised the right to deduct VAT when acquiring goods from other Member States.
However, from these additional VAT tax returns, the Czech tax administrator could not clearly determine whether the supply values from the aforementioned German supplier were also included.
BRH, based on the SAO's request, found that the German supplier was registered for VAT in September 2003.
However, since he did not apply for a VAT ID when registering, he was only assigned an identification number for transactions within Germany.
Although it is usually not possible to allocate VAT ID to the payer retroactively in Germany, in this case the German tax official assigned the aforementioned German VAT ID payer retroactively as of 1.5.2004.
The German CLO allocates the VAT ID retroactively if the German entrepreneur did not cause a delay in the assignment; for example, if the delay was caused by CLO after the payer's VAT ID application.
In this case, the CLO allocates the VAT ID retroactively, because the entrepreneur does not need his own valid VAT ID for intracomonality supplies under Section 6 of the German VAT Act.
Conversely, the German beneficiary does not need a valid VAT ID of its supplier in order to declare intracomonality acquisitions.
Because of these different procedures between Member States, the German CLO assigned a VAT ID retroactively in this particular case.
2.
The Czech tax administrator asked for information on the verification of the registration of the German VAT payer as part of the international exchange of information.
VIES indicated the date of registration of 5.3.2005, with the date of 1.10.2004 on the registration certificate of the German payer issued by the locally competent German tax authority.
In a reply delivered from Germany, the German side stated that the German tax entity had been registered since 1 October 2004, but VAT ID was granted to him in Germany for organisational reasons only on 16 February 2005.
The SAO, asking the locally competent tax administrator, found that the Czech tax administrator had carried out a VAT check on the Czech payer for the tax period of the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.
With this check, the tax authority found that the Czech payer included in the VAT tax return services worth CZK 9,897 (EUR 314), provided to the German payer in the period prior to its VAT registration (i.e. before 1 October 2004).
For the tax year III quarter of 2004, the tax office assessed the tax entity's VAT of CZK 1,880 (EUR 60).
BRH, at the request of the SAO, found that the German payer was not allocated VAT ID until 16.2.2005 when he informed the tax office about his business, which he started in 2004.
In addition, the tax office registered it retrospectively for VAT on 1 October 200415 in order to monitor the submission of the annual VAT return for 2004.
In this tax return, the payer reported intracomonality acquisitions from the Czech Republic worth EUR 160 (approx. CZK 5,000).
3. In the VAT return for September 2004 and SH for the third quarter of 2004, the Czech payer reported a supply of goods worth CZK 114 615 (EUR 3 642) to a German payer.
When verifying the registration of the German payer in the VIES system, the Czech tax administrator found that his registration was valid from 11 November 2004, i.e. after the delivery of goods by a Czech payer to Germany.
The Czech payer filed an additional DAP for VAT, in which he reported the tax base on transactions carried out in the Czech Republic worth CZK 114,615 (EUR 3 642) and VAT of CZK 21,777 (EUR 692), which he paid.
The SAO's inquiry with the locally competent tax authority in the Czech Republic found that the Czech payer subsequently filed a request for a retrial in respect of an additional VAT return and as evidence submitted a confirmation from the German tax administration that the German payer had been taxed since 1 January 2000.
Therefore, the Czech tax administrator verified the validity of the registration of the German payer as part of the international exchange of information.
The reply received from Germany showed that the German payer was not allocated VAT ID until 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods.
For this reason, the tax administrator in the Czech Republic rejected the request for a retrial.
BRH found that this case was not an intracomonality acquisition of goods, as the German payer obtained the VAT ID until 11.11.2004.
However, the German beneficiary ordered the acquisition as an intracomonality acquisition and declared VAT on that acquisition when it claimed a refund of input tax at the same amount.
However, since there would be no changes in the value of the VAT that the German payer was obliged to pay, the tax administrator in Germany did not correct the data in his VAT return.
BRH further found that the name of the German payer, mentioned in ŽOI, was changed during the processing of the reply in Germany, resulting in a mix-up of two German tax entities.
This change in the name of the German payer also confused the Czech tax administrator.
4.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax administrator verified the acquisition of goods by a Czech payer in the first quarter of 2005 worth EUR 22 686 from a German payer.
The SAO, asking the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic, found that this administrator carried out a local investigation with the Czech payer, during which he verified that the delivery of the goods had taken place and the Czech payer had booked and paid the invoice for the goods in question.
The Czech payer did not admit the acquisition of the goods in the VAT return because the German supplier did not state his VAT ID on the tax document, but only the tax number intended for domestic transactions in Germany.
In the VIES application, the Czech tax administrator found that the German payer was registered for VAT for intracomonality transactions only from 21.4.2005, i.e. after the delivery to the Czech payer.
At the same time, the Czech tax administrator asked the German tax administration to send a copy of the registration certificate to the German payer so that he could take steps to assess the tax if necessary.
The Czech Financial Conduct Authority assessed the transaction as the acquisition of goods from a non-payer from Germany, and therefore did not additionally measure the tax on the Czech payer from that commercial transaction.
BRH found that, under German law, a payer who supplies goods to other Member States did not have to have a VAT ID allocated to an intracomonality supply of goods.
The supplier must only have a VAT ID of the customer from another Member State and must be able to prove the transport of the goods in question to another Member State.
Under the German VAT Act, it was therefore an intracomonality transaction and VAT should be assessed in the Czech Republic.
In any case, it is important that the Czech tax administrator noticed this transaction, because the delivery of the machine at that value was not the basic business of the German supplier.
As described in Chapter 4.6.2, the German CLO refuses to respond to ŽOI relating to intracomonarian transactions worth less than EUR 15 000: 5.
According to VIES data in the third quarter of 2004, the Czech payer was to acquire goods worth EUR 12 561 from the German payer.
The Czech tax administrator carried out a tax inspection with the tax entity for this tax year.
As part of international administrative cooperation, he asked the German tax administration to verify the supply of these goods through the SCAC form.
The Czech payer denied the acquisition of the goods, claiming that he had never traded with the German company and the acquisition of these goods was not accounted for in his accounts.
The German tax authorities rejected the requirement to provide evidence – contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents on the ground that the turnover did not exceed EUR 15 000 and no other explanatory justification was given.
As the Czech tax administrator did not obtain evidence to obtain the tax on the acquired goods, he terminated the tax inspection without a finding and the tax liability remained assessed at the original amount.
BRH, based on the SAO's request, found that the German payer acted as a so-called "fiscal representative" (Sections 22 a – e UStG).
The German payer reported those deliveries in his annual VAT return and in SH.
Entitlement to the exemption of delivery was recognised.
Based on warnings from BRH, the German tax office will send documents needed to the Czech Republic to collect the tax on acquired goods in the Czech Republic.
As mentioned in chapter 4.6.1, the replies to the ŽOI sent from Germany to the Czech Republic exceeded the three-month deadline more often than the replies from the Czech Republic to Germany: 6.
The SAO's audit found that the Czech tax administration had sent a request for information to Germany on 5.10.2005 concerning the examination of the value of the delivered goods for the 4th quarter of 2004.
The German payer reported a supply of goods to a Czech payer worth EUR 86 307 in SH for this period, but the Czech payer stated in the same period in the VAT tax return the acquisition of goods only at a value equivalent to EUR 35 314.
In response to ŽOI, delivered to the Czech Republic on September 9, 2006, i.e. after the deadline for processing, provided for in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German party stated that the application could not have been processed because the operation of the German firm was terminated at the end of 2005.
By failing to meet the deadline for processing the ŽOI, the Czech tax administration did not have the documents needed for tax proceedings in the Czech Republic.
7. The Czech tax administrator applied in 2005 via the SCAC form to examine the delivery of cars worth EUR 1 265 554 to the German payer, carried out in the third and fourth quarters of 2004, which showed the hallmarks of carousel fraud.
The SAO found that a response had not been received from the FRG until the time of the inspection.
The SAO further found by asking the locally competent tax administrator that the Czech payer did not include in the VAT tax return the supply of new means of transport for the German payer worth CZK 11,816,103 (EUR 375 472).
The Czech tax administrator corrected the data in the tax return and the Czech tax entity filed a subsequent SH.
BRH, following a request from the SAO, found that the German CLO had not, for technical reasons, hand over the aforementioned ŽOI to the locally competent tax authority for verification.
Following warnings from BRH, a check was carried out in Germany by the German acquirer, which found that the acquisition of all cars had been properly taxed and that the respective cars had been sold to another payer in Germany.
8. According to VIES data, the Czech payer was to acquire a passenger car worth €48,500 from a German payer in the fourth quarter of 2004.
The purchase of these goods was not acknowledged by the Czech payer.
By asking the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that the Czech payer had not filed VAT returns since August 2004.
Tax returns were not filed by the Czech payer even after the tax administrator's calls, so the tax office sentenced him to VAT of CZK 0 for the period October to December 2004.
On 2 June 2005 the CLO drew attention to the aforementioned supply from the German payer.
As the Czech payer did not cooperate with the tax administrator, the tax administrator sent the ŽOI to Germany concerning the aforementioned supply.
As the response to the ŽOI was not delivered to the Czech Republic until 7 February 2007, it was not known until the end of the SAO's audit how the Czech tax administrator used the information obtained by international exchange.
The tax office revoked the Czech payer's VAT registration on 23 August 2005 due to non-compliance with VAT obligations.
In some cases, only a partial response was sent to the ROI, as the audit carried out by the tax authorities at the payers was not completed at the time of the SAO and BRH inspection:
9.
The Czech tax administrator applied in 2005 via the SCAC form to examine the delivery of a car worth EUR 16 991 to the German payer, made in the third quarter of 2004, which showed the hallmarks of carousel fraud.
In response to the ŽOI, the German tax administrator stated that he had only an invoice issued by the Czech payer for supplies worth EUR 16 335.
BRH, following the SAO's request, found that the control carried out by the German tax office with the acquirer from Germany had not yet been completed.
The German acquirer ordered the acquisition of goods worth EUR 16 335 twice in tax returns for the months of August and September 2004.
10. The Czech tax administrator applied in 2005 via the SCAC form to examine the delivery of cars to a German payer worth 198 167 euro, carried out in the fourth quarter of 2004 and I. quarter 2005, which showed the hallmarks of carousel fraud.
The German tax administration sent a partial response to the ŽOI to the Czech Republic, in which it confirmed the acquisition of some cars by a German payer and further stated that the investigation in Germany had not been completed.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The SAO found that several local investigations were carried out at the Czech supplier by the locally competent tax authority to verify the drawdown of excess VAT deductions, in which it did not detect their unauthorised use.
BRH found that the German payer had, in that period, in its VAT tax returns, ordered the acquisition of goods from other Member States for a total value of EUR 579 114 and that the control carried out by the German tax office from the acquirer of Germany had not yet been completed.
Chapter 4.4.1 describes the reasons for the differences between the intracomonality acquisition values indicated by the recipient in the tax return and the values indicated by the supplier in his SH.
Checked cases showed that the most common reasons for differences were not the time shift or indication of the incorrect value of the intracomonality delivery of goods in SH:
11.
The Czech payer was to acquire EUR 35 716 worth of goods from the German payer in the first quarter of 2005, according to data from the VIES system, but the Czech payer did not acknowledge this acquisition.
As the Czech payer did not cooperate with the tax administrator and did not carry out any activity at the company's headquarters, the Czech tax administrator asked as part of the international exchange of information to verify how the German payer communicated with the Czech payer.
The answer to the ŽOI delivered from Germany showed that according to the findings of the German tax administration, the Czech tax entity is unknown at the communicated address and that the goods were taken over by the agreed carrier.
The order was for a total amount of EUR 155 000, but the German payer only supplied the goods worth EUR 21 659.
The Czech payer sent the German payer a false confirmation of the payment of EUR 155 153 in favour of the German payer.
After discovering the fraudulent conduct on the part of the Czech acquirer, the German payer, with the help of his other Czech customers, managed to recover the supplied material, with the exception of one item worth EUR 7 916.
The SAO, asking the locally competent tax authority in the Czech Republic, found that the tax administrator, on the basis of the information obtained, assessed the Czech VAT payer for the acquisition of goods from other Member States amounting to CZK 388,522 (EUR 13,044).
BRH, based on the SAO's request, confirmed that the German supplier had ordered the supply of goods to the Czech payer only worth EUR 7 9116 after repairs.
According to the German legal situation, the German payer reported the repaired value of the goods and a decrease in the taxable amount in the quarter in which the correction took place.
Which included his SHs the following delivery values in relation to the Czech payer:
12.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax administrator requested, via the SCAC form, to verify the supply of goods and services made in the third quarter of 2005.
According to this ŽOI, the Czech payer was to deliver goods totalling EUR 396 126 to the German payer during this period and to provide services worth EUR 11 885.
The SAO found that the Czech tax administrator carried out a local investigation into the Czech payer for the purpose of examining this delivery.
In response to the ŽOI, the Czech tax administrator said that the Czech payer had supplied the German payer with a production line, including assembly.
Individual parts of the production line were supplied by the Czech payer before the Czech Republic joined the EU and after 1 May 2004 the line was assembled on the basis of the order.
The German payer did not take over the assembled line because he claimed to have defects.
In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech payer issued invoices to the German payer for EUR 107 100 for assembly and EUR 11 885 for services.
The German payer took the issued invoices but did not acknowledge them and did not pay them.
The SAO further found by asking the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic that all invoices are duly registered in the accounts of the Czech payer.
VAT returns for the third quarter of 2005 include only amounts that have been substantiated by the Czech payer and relating to invoicing after 1 May 2004.
BRH found that based on a response from the Czech tax administration, the locally competent tax authority in Germany concluded that the transaction involved the supply of goods from the Czech payer to the German payer, including the assembly services.
In this special case, the place of so-called performance of the work is where the production line was installed.
Under the German VAT Act, the German recipient of the service supplied is obliged to pay VAT.
At the same time, the beneficiary can claim the deduction of VAT on the same amount.
As there would be no changes in the value of the VAT that the German payer was obliged to pay, the corrections to the VAT tax return were neglected by the German tax authority.
13. According to VIES data, Czech payer A was to acquire a machine worth EUR 58 000 from the German payer C in February 2005.
The Czech tax administrator sent an application to Germany to examine this delivery.
In response to the ŽOI, the German side said that the machine had already been supplied by the German payer C to the Czech payer B in 2004, which, however, was to return the machine to the German payer C in October 2004.
According to information from the German tax administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but transported to the organizational unit of the German payer C in the Czech Republic.
Furthermore, a reply to a request for information showed that the German payer C had sold the machine to the Czech payer A in February 2005.
This payer took over the machine at the headquarters of the organizational unit of the German payer C in the Czech Republic.
Because the delivery took place only within the Czech Republic, it was not an intracomonant delivery of goods.
The SAO, asking the tax administrator of the locally competent payer B, found that according to VIES data, the German payer C supplied the Czech B goods (another machine) worth EUR 88 0227 in the third quarter of 2004.
Payer B denied this acquisition of the goods, so the locally competent tax administrator from the Czech Republic sent the ŽOI to Germany.
According to the reply to this request, the delivery of the machine took place.
Another investigation by the payer B found that the machine worth EUR 88 027 was not in the accounts of the payer B, and that it could be a machine of the same type as was delivered by the German payer C's organisational unit to the Czech payer A in February 2005.
The SAO further found that the Czech tax administrator of the locally competent payer A carried out a local investigation with this payer.
The tax administrator had at his disposal the invoice of the German payer C of 7.2.2005, on which the payer A was listed as a purchaser of the machine.
The Czech tax administrator found that the payer A did not have this invoice included in the accounts.
Payet A had a lease agreement with another Czech company, where the lease was a machine of the same type.
The transfer of the machine from the leasing company took place on 9.2.2, the transport of the machine was carried out by a leasing company.
The information contained in the reply to the request for information was not used by the Czech Tax Office to determine the tax liability of payer A.
BRH found that the German payer C had not supplied the machine worth EUR 88 027 to the Czech Republic, but to another German payer, D.
It was therefore not an intracomonant supply of goods, but a taxable supply in Germany.
For these reasons, the German tax administrator did not recognise the German VAT exemption and corrected the data in his tax return.
German payer D supplied the machine to the Czech payer B.
According to the German legislation, this supply was not taxable in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.
Furthermore, BRH found that the German payer C gave in his SH for the first quarter of 2005 the delivery of the machine worth EUR 58 000 to the Czech payer A.
This supply was not examined by the German tax authorities during the tax audit.
The following diagram shows the relationships between participants in the above-mentioned business transactions.
14.
When inspecting the ŽOI received, the SAO found that the Czech tax administration had received a request from Germany on 4.10.2005 from Germany asking the German tax administrator to verify the intracomonality delivery from a German payer worth 879 680 625 euro to the Czech payer.
According to the German tax administrator, there was a suspicion that this was a feigned intracomonarian supply of goods.
It was further stated at the ŽOI that the German payer had not carried out any active commercial activities since 1999.
The SAO found that the Czech tax administrator carried out a local investigation with the Czech taxpayer.
According to the statement of the manager of the Czech company, in the above case it appeared to be a claim by the German taxpayer against the German tax administration, which was claimed by the Czech payer as a partner of the German company to the German tax office.
According to the information provided by the SAO, the Czech tax administrator has no information until now that the German tax administration has dealt with the issue related to the Czech payer.
According to the available information, it was not a supply of goods, yet the stated value is still included in the VIES system as an intracomonality delivery of goods to a Czech payer from Germany.
The main reason for the following irregularities was that the beneficiaries did not report intracomonality acquisitions of goods in their tax returns (see also chapter 4.4.1):
15. According to VIES data, the German payer supplied the Czech payer with a total value of EUR 33 205 in the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005. The Czech payer did not admit this acquisition.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The Czech tax administrator asked for verification of the delivery of goods from Germany as part of the international exchange of information.
In response to this request, the German tax administration said that the German payer had sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech payer, the remaining goods were collected personally by the Czech payer.
By asking the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the SAO found that even before receiving a response to the ŽOI, the Czech payer filed additional VAT returns for those periods.
Despite this submission, differences in acquisition values have not been resolved, so the Czech tax administrator recommended carrying out a tax inspection with the Czech taxpayer.
The inspection has not yet been carried out.
16. According to VIES figures in the third quarter of 2004, the German payer delivered goods worth €46,854.
Over the same period, the Czech payer granted an intracomonality acquisition only equivalent to EUR 14 856.
The Czech tax administrator asked for verification in the framework of the international exchange of information the value of the deliveries made.
The reply to the ŽOI, received from Germany, was accompanied by 3 invoices with a total stated value of the supply of goods 31 999 euro, i.e. a value corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech payer and the VIES data.
The SAO, asking the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic, found that after receiving a response from Germany, the Czech tax administrator contacted the Czech payer and agreed with it that after examining these invoices with the owner of the company, he would discuss filing an additional VAT return for the third quarter of 2004.
An additional VAT return has not yet been filed.
The Czech tax administrator told the SAO that it would proceed in such a way as to meet the set deadlines for any additional VAT assessment for the relevant tax period.
17.
The German payer was to deliver €11,600 worth of goods to the Czech payer in the fourth quarter of 2004.
The German tax administrator asked for confirmation as part of an international exchange of information about whether the Czech payer actually existed, because an alleged partner of the German payer founded more fictitious companies in Germany.
When examining the business transaction, the Czech payer confirmed the acquisition of the goods to the tax authority.
According to the Czech payer, however, the goods were not transported from Germany to the Czech Republic and were further sold during 2005 in Germany.
The Czech payer presented documents for the sale of goods for January 2005.
The Czech payer was not registered as a VAT payer in Germany, he did not grant or pay the tax on the sale of the goods in question in the Czech Republic or in Germany.
All these facts suggested tax evasion in the territory of Germany and the Czech tax administrator communicated them to the German tax administration in response to the ŽOI.
The SAO, asking the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic, found that the Czech payer, on the basis of the investigations carried out, filed an additional VAT return for the fourth quarter of 2004, in which he included the value of the acquisition of goods, among other things, from the German payer and at the same time exercised the right to deduct the tax on the acquisition of goods from other Member States.
VAT on the sale of goods in Germany was not included in the Czech VAT return.
The Czech tax administrator assessed the additional VAT return after the local investigation was carried out unchanged.
According to the Czech legislation, this case did not involve the acquisition of goods from other Member States because the goods were not dispatched or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.
The Czech tax administrator therefore incorrectly concluded the local investigation.
BRH found that the German tax administrator had corrected the German payer's tax return immediately after receiving a reply to the ROI stating that the goods had not left Germany, had corrected the German payer's tax return and demanded VAT of EUR 1 600 from him.
In addition, the competent tax authority has sent a warning to the tax office of the actual recipient of the goods to ensure that the resale of these goods is correctly taxed.
In the following cases, the payers reported intracomonality transactions that were unlikely to actually take place:
18.
The Czech tax administrator received a request from the German tax administration for information on whether the Czech payer acquired a passenger car worth EUR 47 400 from the German payer in February 2005.
The application was accompanied by a copy of the Czech VAT registration certificate.
In addition, a copy of the passport of the person who, as has been said, had carried out the transport of that car was accompanied.
An investigation by the Czech tax administrator found that it was a stolen passport, the person in it did not bring any vehicle to the Czech Republic and denied all contacts with the German tax entity.
The VAT registration certificate, a copy of which was sent by the German side, was never issued by the Czech tax administrator.
This information was provided by the Czech tax administrator in response to the ŽOI along with the statement that it could not confirm the acquisition of the goods – the car in question.
The SAO's inquiry with the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic found that the Czech payer did not resettled at the address listed in the Commercial Register and the company's manager was uncontactable.
After the execution of the complaint procedure for the February 2005 tax year, the Czech tax administrator imposed a tax liability of CZK 0 on the Czech taxpayer.
Another investigation by the Czech tax administrator found that the car in question was sold to another Czech entity, which bought it through an advertisement on the internet.
BRH found that the locally competent German tax administrator, on the basis of the Czech response to the ŽOI, would not recognise the German taxpayer's right to exempt that supply from VAT.
19. During the audit, the German tax authority was unable to clarify the difference of EUR 3,000 between the value of the goods acquired in the payer's tax return and the value provided from another Member State.
It was reported that the Czech payer was to deliver goods worth €89,4224 to the German payer during the fourth quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005.
As the acquisition declared by the German payer did not correspond to the data in VIES, the German tax administrator asked for verification of deliveries and their remuneration in the international exchange of information.
The Czech tax administrator said in a reply to the ŽOI that the sole manager of the Czech company was removed from the Commercial Register on 8 July 2005 and the new manager was not registered.
The German recipient of the goods was apparently related to a partner of Czech society.
The Czech payer filed tax returns for both VAT and SH, which was signed by an unauthorized person - the company's partner, after deleting the manager from the Commercial Register.
The Czech payer's accountant confirmed to the tax administrator that the company's partner had deposited the cash paid for the invoiced goods in EUR into the company's account.
Cash papers were not issued.
The SAO in the Czech Republic, when asked by the locally competent tax authority, found that the tax administrator had recognised the Czech taxpayer for the fourth quarter of 2004 entitlement to an exemption from VAT on the supply of goods to another Member State worth CZK 1,326,307 (EUR 422,145) and for the 1st quarter of 2005 in the amount of CZK 1,416,180.
BRH found that the tax administrator in Germany had not repaired the German acquirer's VAT return because the German judge had in the meantime confirmed the insolvency of the German payer.
Since the earlier check revealed no signs of tax fraud, it will not be possible to enforce the tax liability imposed.
20. According to data in VIES, in 2005 the German payer acquired goods worth EUR 4 251 196 from the Czech Republic after acquiring goods worth EUR 43 274 in the previous year.
In the 2004 tax return and in the 2005 tax return, the German payer did not report an intracomonality acquisition.
Furthermore, it did not show adequate supplies either.
Due to these differences, the German tax office sent the ROI, relating to the fourth quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006.
The Czech supplier reported an intracomonality delivery of goods to a German payer totalling CZK 167,246,083 (EUR 5 615,299) in SH for these two quarters.
On 6 September 2006, the ŽOI was delivered, in which the German side asked to check whether the Czech payer of reported intracomonarian supplies had taken place.
In response to this ŽOI, the Czech tax administration said that the German party's request could not be met because the Czech payer had no manager.
As is apparent from the materials provided by the SAO by the relevant tax authority, on 30 March 2006 a report was drawn up with the managing director of the Czech payer for the start of the VAT inspection for the fourth quarter of 2004 and January to December 2005.
At the same time, the payer was asked by the tax administrator to submit all accounting and tax documents for the abovementioned periods, but did not provide any documents.
According to the Commercial Register, the only manager of the Czech payer ceased to function on 16.5.2006, a new agent was not appointed.
Since April 2006, the Czech payer has stopped filing VAT returns.
As part of the SAO's audit in cooperation with BRH, among other things, it examined several cases of intracomonality deliveries made between the Czech Republic and Germany, which were not the subject of a previous exchange of information between the tax administrations of both countries.
Information on the cases examined was transmitted by the two highest audit institutions through the CLO of both countries.
21. The Czech company (eCR), which is not resident in Germany informed the competent tax authority (Chemnitz-Süd) that it intends to carry out a taxable supply in Germany.
Because of this information, the company has been registered since June 2005, but has not received a German VAT ID.
(ECR) accepted an order from a Danish entrepreneur (eDK) for the production of several wind farms and for the delivery of these wind farms on behalf of, at risk and on behalf of a Danish customer to Austria.
Due to a lack of its own capacities, the Czech company handed over part of the order to the German payer (eD), which is based in Germany.
The following diagram shows contractual relations and how wind farms are transported:
According to the German legal situation, the place of execution of these transactions must be determined according to the following:
– A Danish entrepreneur (eDK) sent wind farms for assembly under his name, his risk and his account to Austria.
As the assembly of that supply took place in Austria, the supply of wind farms is taxable in Austria.
– Since the carrier was instructed by a Danish entrepreneur (eDK) and the transport took place under his name, at his risk and on his own account, the delivery of the German subcontractor (eD) took place where the shipment began, in Germany.
Although wind farms were dispatched to another Member State and the recipient is a registered payer from another Member State, the supply of the German subcontractor (eD) could not obtain an exemption because another Member State of destination differs from another Member State of the registered office of the Czech company.
This delivery is therefore correctly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (eCZ) deducted input tax in its tax returns.
The place of delivery of the Czech company (eCR) is also determined by the beginning of transport.
The transport of some wind farms started in the Czech Republic and others in Germany.
– Delivery of those wind power plants that are manufactured in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.
– The supply of other wind farms produced in Germany took place in Germany.
So the Czech company (eCR) made both intracomonality delivery from the Czech Republic to Austria and intracomonarian delivery from Germany to Austria.
BRH found that the Czech company (eCR) did not report any intracomonality acquisitions in its VAT return in Germany or injected SH to the German CLO.
So it is possible that the Czech company has reported all intracomonality deliveries uniformly as an intracomonality delivery from the Czech Republic.
The SAO found that (eCR) showed no intracomonality delivery to Austria, but intracomonality delivery to Denmark.
Examination of the taxation of intracomonality acquisitions in Austria would require the cooperation of at least four tax administrations (Austrian, Czech, Danish and German), even though this case shows no indication of tax fraud or evasion.
In addition, the SAO and BRH examined transactions to highlight the differences between the reporting in the tax return and the VIES data caused by the different VAT legislation in 2004.
Controlled cases also demonstrate that changes in the legislation need time to apply new legislation to practice by both payers and tax authorities:
22. In SH for the second to IV quarter of 2004, the Czech payer reported an intracomonality delivery to a German payer with a total value of CZK 792,977,452 (EUR 25 197 885).
Over the same period, another Czech payer in SH reported intracomonality delivery to another German payer with a total value of CZK 18,157,265 (EUR 576,970.
According to information provided by the SAO from BRH, both cases involved the supply of electricity.
Both Czech payers listed the above mentioned supplies in SH in accordance with the wording of Act No 235/2004 Coll., in force in 2004.
By further examining the above transactions, the SAO-controlling group found that in 2004 there were differences between the Czech Republic and Germany in the statutory regulation of the supply or acquisition of electricity.
While in the Czech Republic the payers reported the supply of electricity in accordance with the valid wording of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. as an intracommunity supply of goods, in terms of the German legal regulation in force in 2004 it was not an intracomonality acquisition, but a taxable performance with the place of implementation of the fulfilment in the territory of Germany.
The difference in statutory regulations in the Czech Republic was eliminated by the adoption of Act No. 635/2004 Coll., amending certain laws in connection with the adoption of the Act on Administrative Fees, effective from 1 January 2005.
23. Furthermore, when examining selected intracomonant transactions in cooperation with BRH, it was found that the Czech payer reported an intracomonial delivery to the German payer in the 1st to 4th quarter of 2005 with a total value of 240 411 163 CZK (EUR 871 823) and another Czech payer reported intracomonial delivery to the German payer for the same period with a total value of 263 470 776 CZK (EUR 846 050).
According to information provided by the SAO from BRH, both cases involved the supply of electricity.
According to the wording of Act No 235/2004 Coll., effective from 1 January 2005, in the case of electricity supply, the place where the acquirer has its registered office, place of business or where it has an establishment for which the goods are delivered.
Therefore, Czech payers should not have introduced electricity supplies to SH in 2005.
By showing the intracomonality of electricity supply in SH by the two above payers, the VIES data was distorted by a total of CZK 503,881,939 (EUR 16,917,873).
Conclusion
The cooperation met the objectives of BRH and the SAO.
Both SAI received a deeper knowledge of VAT management systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.
Cooperation has revealed the differences between the two systems and showed that VAT management legislation differs.
During parallel checks, suspicious cases of intracomonarian transactions were found.
Some of them make sense to subsequently check.
Based on the control findings, both SAIs developed recommendations on VAT management.
Monitoring these recommendations should also be part of the follow-up.
The new experience and knowledge gained through cooperation between the two audit institutions is the basis for the successful implementation of the following VAT administration controls.
Communications
The report was drawn up in Czech, English and German and signed by the President of the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and the President of the Bundesrechnungshof, the Federal Republic of Germany.
Report on the outcome of international cooperation in controls on excise duty management between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in 2006
Introductory word
The joint report submitted informs about the course and outcome of international cooperation during parallel inspections carried out by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic and Najvyšší Control Office of the Slovak Republic, focused on the administration of excise duties in the period after the two countries joined the European Union.
The cooperation was implemented on the basis of a cooperation agreement in control activities concluded in February 2006.
The topic of parallel checks was chosen in view of the fundamental change in the system of collection of excise duties, which took place in connection with the integration of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic into the internal market of the European Union from 1 May 2004.
The functioning of the internal market of the European Union requires the free movement of goods, including excise goods.
The basic principle is to allow non-taxable goods to circulate until the date of its final consumption delivery.
In accordance with that principle, the new legislation adopted in both countries allows the movement of goods under tax supervision under the suspensive exemption scheme.
The system places great demands on the tax authorities and foresees close interaction between the competent administrations of the Member States in the fight against tax fraud in this area.
Report on the outcome of international cooperation in controls on excise duty management for the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005 1.
Introduction
Control number: (Czech Republic) 05/34 (SR) 48/11
Subject of control: (Czech Republic) Administration of excise duties (SR) Procedure of colné organs in sprays of spotreb taxes
The Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as the SAO-ČR) and the Najvyšší Control Office of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as the SAO of the SR) concluded on 8 February 2006 the "Contract of Cooperation in Control Activities".
The subject of the contract was cooperation during parallel checks carried out by the "Interim Tax Administration", included in the auditing plan of the SAO-ČR for 2005 under No 05/34, and "Control of the procedure of colné organs in sprays of spotrebné taxes", included in the control activity plan of the SAO SR for 2006 under No 48/11.
Parallel checks were in the nature of coordinated control.
The cooperation consisted of exchanging information that the contracting parties could not obtain when checking the administration of excise duties on the territory of their State and in drawing up a joint final report on the outcome of controls within the meaning of the European implementing directives for the implementation of INTOSAI Audit Standards - Directive 31.
In the Czech Republic, the control (hereinafter referred to as the Czech Republic) was carried out by groups inspecting the state budget department and from the territorial unions of Central Bohemia, southern Bohemia, western Bohemia, northwestern Bohemia, northeastern Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and northern Moravia between 7 February and 2 June 2006.
The inspection involved 27 controllers.
The audited persons were the General Directorate of Customs (hereinafter referred to as the CD) and 11 tax authorities.
Within the DGC, 12 selected customs offices out of a total of 54.
The audit on the territory of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as the "SR") was carried out by the Section of the Financial and Tax Office of the Slovak Republic in cooperation with exposures of the SAO SR Banská Bystrica and Košice at 5 customs offices out of a total of 9 between 13 February and 2 June 2006.
The inspection involved 8 controllers.
The aim of the parallel checks was to examine the procedure of the customs authorities in the administration of excise duties and compliance with the relevant legislation in force in both countries and in the European Union.
International cooperation was focused on the procedure of tax administrators in the exercise of supervision of the transport of goods subject to excise duties, in particular the registration of initiated and completed traffic under the conditional exemption regime, and on the exchange of information within the framework of mutual administrative assistance between excise tax administrators of the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
2. Management of excise duties
The administration of excise duties in the Czech Republic was carried out by the financial authorities until 31 December 2003.
Since 1 January 2004, this agenda has been taken over by the customs authorities, which have so far levied excise duty only on importation.
In the Czech Republic, mineral oils, alcohol, beer, wine and intermediate products and tobacco products are subject to excise duty.
The state budget's revenue from excise duties in the Czech Republic amounted to a total of CZK 82.8 billion in 2004 and 19.5% of the state budget's revenues from taxes and fees.
In 2005, the state budget revenue from excise duties amounted to CZK 103.6 billion and the share of state budget revenues from taxes and fees amounting to CZK 460.4 billion was 22.5%.
In 2004, the income from excise duty on mineral oils to the State budget was 80% of the total revenue from this tax and in 2005 it was 90.9%.
The difference to 100% of CZK 13 billion in 2004 and CZK 6.9 billion in 2005 was the income of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure.
The administration of all excise duties in the SR shall be exercised by the customs authorities from 1 May 2004, with the exception of excise duty on mineral oil, which they have been administering since 1 January 2002.
Until then, the administration of excise duties was carried out by the tax authorities.
Excise duty in the SR is subject to mineral oil, alcohol, beer, wine and tobacco products.
The revenue of the state budget from excise duties in the SR totalled 43.4 billion Sk in 2004 and in total tax revenues of 209.5 billion Sk, excise duties accounted for 20.7%.
In 2005, the state budget revenue from excise duties was 50 billion Sk and total tax revenues of 222.6 billion Sk accounted for 22.5%.
Graph 1 — Comparison of revenues of the state budget of the Czech Republic from taxes and fees and tax revenues of the state budget of the Slovak Republic with revenues from excise duties
Legislation in both countries is based on European Union rules governing this area, in particular: - Council Directive 92/12/EEC on the general arrangements for the holding, movement and monitoring of products subject to excise duty (hereinafter referred to as "Directive 92/12/EEC), - Council Regulation (EC) No 2073/2004 on administrative cooperation in the field of excise duties (hereinafter referred to as ‘Regulation No 2073/2004’), - Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2719/92 on the accompanying official document for the transport of products subject to excise duty under the suspension of excise duty (hereinafter referred to as ‘Regulation No 2719/92’), - Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3649/92 on a simplified movement for excise duty (hereinafter referred to as Regulation No 2719/92), - Commission Regulation (EEC)
The basic legislation governing the issue of excise duties in the Czech Republic is Act No. 353/2003 Coll., on Excise Taxes, as amended, (hereinafter referred to as "Law No. 353/2003 Coll.").
When administering excise duties in the SR, customs authorities are bound, inter alia, by the following generally binding legislation: - Act No 98/2004 Z. z. o spotrebne oil tax in the knowledge of non-corporate predtoy (hereinafter referred to as Law No 98/2004 Z. z., - Act No 104/2004 Z. z. z. o spotrebalé tax on wine in the denial of non-corporate predpisov (hereinafter referred to as "Law No 104/2004 Z. z."), - Act No. 105/2004 Z.
2.1 Movement of excise goods under a suspensive tax exemption scheme between Member States of the European Union
The conditions for the movement of excise goods under the suspension exemption procedure are governed by Directive 92/12/EEC in Title III — Movement of goods from Article 15 to 20.
Under those provisions, the transport of those goods may be carried out only by an authorised warehousekeeper, which means a natural or legal person authorised by the competent authorities of a Member State to manufacture, process, store, receive and dispatch products subject to excise duty.
A consignee in another Member State may be an authorised warehousekeeper or an economic operator without the status of an authorised warehousekeeper, but who may not, under a suspensive exemption scheme, store or dispatch them further.
The authorised warehousekeeper in the Czech Republic and Slovakia means the operator of a tax warehouse, the economic operator is the beneficiary for the repeated or one-off acceptance of products subject to excise duty.
Under Directive 92/12/EEC, the transport of excise products subject to excise duty is only possible with an accompanying document.
The accompanying document shall be issued by the consignor before the commencement of the service in four copies, unless the competent authorities of the Member State of dispatch request a further copy.
2.2 Procedure for the start and termination of the transport of goods under the conditional exemption procedure between the Czech Republic and Slovakia
Transport from the Czech Republic
The procedure for the commencement of transport is governed by the provisions of Section 25(3) of Act No 353/2003 Coll., which states, among other things:
‘The operator of the tax warehouse shall, before commencing the transport of the selected products, inform the customs office which is the place competent for the tax warehouse from which transport is to be commenced;
transport of selected products can only be initiated with the consent of this customs office.
The customs office shall give its consent to the transport of the selected products without delay after the condition of securing the tax is met ..."
A freight forwarder in the Czech Republic may commence the transport of all types of products subject to excise duty only with the consent of the locally competent customs office.
The customs office shall give its consent to the commencement of transport only if the tax is provided for the amount of tax attributable to the products transported.
Before commencing the transport, the sender is obliged to prepare an accompanying document in five copies.
On the accompanying document, the customs office shall indicate its consent to the commencement of transport.
Production No 1 shall be retained by the consignor, copy Nos 2, 3, and 4 shall be surrendered by the consignor to the carrier and copy No 5 shall be retained by the customs office authorising the transport.
Under the Slovak legislation, the recipient in SR will keep copy No 2 of the accompanying document. On the copies Nos 3 and 4, they shall acknowledge receipt of the products and submit the two copies to the competent customs office locally.
Production No 3 confirmed by the customs office shall send to the consignor no later than the 15th day of the month following the calendar month in which he accepted the products.
Production No 4 shall be retained by the customs office of the consignee.
Transport is terminated by the acceptance of products by the recipient.
The release of the tax security will be decided by the customs office in the Czech Republic, which authorised the start of transport, within 5 working days of the submission of copy No 3 of the accompanying document, which is confirmed by the beneficiary and the Slovak customs office.
Chart No. 2 — Circulation of the accompanying transport document initiated in the Czech Republic and terminated in the Slovak Republic
Transport from SR
The procedure for transporting alcohol and tobacco products from the Slovak Republic to another Member State of the European Union has been amended by 31 December 2005 as follows:
Under Paragraph 26(4) of Law 105/2004 Z.
‘Pri preprave liehu from the tax warehouse into the tax warehouse of the territory to the tax warehouse but to the authorized referee, or to the tax splnomocnenc in inom memberskom is the odosielatel’ (supplier’) obligatory in the beginning of the preparation to send the kópiu of the first diel of the sprievodní document electronically or fax to the Colný úradu Poprad; túto kópiu is obligatory sowing and the colny mouth of the font into the piatich working days from the dauňa zaratia pre-treatment."
Under Paragraph 22(4) of Law No 106/2004 Z.
‘Pri preprave tabak manufactories from the tax warehouse into the tax warehouse of the territory to the tax warehouse but to the authorized prime minister, or to the tax splnomocnenc in the inom membership is the odosielatel' (supplier’) obligatory in the beginning of the preparation to send a cubicum of the first diel of the sprievodate document electronically or fax to Colný úrad; túto kópiu is obligatory sowing and the colny mouth of the song najneskor to the piatich working days from the dña beginatia pre-treatment."
In the transport of other products subject to excise duty (mineral oil, wine and beer) during the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘controlled period’), the taxpayer was under no obligation to notify the Customs Office of Poprad or the competent customs office of the commencement of services under the suspensive regime.
The tax administrator only became aware of the transport of these products during a local investigation or during a tax inspection from the accompanying documents and from the tax entity's accounting documents.
The consignor in SR is obliged to prepare an accompanying document in four copies before the start of the transport.
Production No 1 shall be retained by the consignor (when transporting alcohol and tobacco products, he shall send a copy of copy No 1 electronically or by fax to the Customs Office of Poprad and to the competent customs office).
Production Nos 2, 3 and 4 accompanies the goods transported.
According to the Czech legislation, the recipient in the Czech Republic will keep copy No 2 of the accompanying document issued by the consignor in the Slovak Republic and confirm the acceptance of the products on the copies No 3 and 4.
The confirmed copy Nos 3 and 4 will be sent no later than the first working day after the end of the transport to the locally competent customs office in the Czech Republic.
The customs office shall retain copy No 4 and copy No 3 to verify the correctness and validity shall be returned to the consignee.
The beneficiary shall send a certified copy No 3 no later than the following working day after receiving it to the Sender to SR.
Transport in the SR is considered to be completed on the day of receipt of the products by the beneficiary.
The end of the transport is demonstrated by the consignor by submitting copy No 3 of the accompanying document confirmed by the recipient and the tax administrator in the Czech Republic.
Graph No. 3 — Circulation of the accompanying document for transport (iron and tobacco products) initiated in Slovakia and terminated in the Czech Republic
In 2006, amendments to all laws on excise duties were gradually adopted in the Slovak Republic, according to which the consignor of goods under the suspension arrangement is obliged to send a copy of copy No 1 of the accompanying document electronically or by fax to the local competent consignor before the commencement of the transport.
A document proving the cessation of the transport of alcohol and tobacco products is the copy No 3 of the accompanying document confirmed by the beneficiary and its competent tax authority.
A document proving the cessation of transport of mineral oils, wine and beer is copy No 3 confirmed by the recipient.
Confirmation by the tax administrator of another Member State of receipt of those goods by the consignee shall be required if that controller is required, under the legislation of the competent Member State, to certify copy No 3 of the accompanying document.
2.3 Records of operations initiated and terminated by customs authorities in the Czech Republic and Slovakia
In order to monitor the transport of goods under a conditional exemption regime between Member States of the European Union, a single electronic system is not in place.
Decision 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 on the establishment of an electronic system for the transport and monitoring of products subject to excise duty requires Member States and the European Commission to establish an electronic system (Excise Movement and Control System) from 1 July 2009 allowing excise tax administrations in each Member State to obtain real-time information on the carriage of goods.
The system will allow the electronic transmission of accompanying documents, which are currently only used in paper form, and will contribute to simplifying the movement of goods under the conditional exemption regime and to ensuring a more effective control of the movement of untaxed products across all Member States.
This system will include national databases for each Member State's transport.
The Customs Administration of the Czech Republic records all transport initiated and terminated on the territory of the Czech Republic in the module Evidence of selected products (hereinafter referred to as "EVV").
All customs authorities in the Czech Republic have access to the system online.
In the case of transport carried out only on the territory of the Czech Republic, tax authorities may obtain information about the start or end of the service immediately after the registration of the accompanying document by the customs office to EVV.
The customs office shall release the security of the tax on the transported products provided by the consignor at the time of registration by the customs office of the competent beneficiary.
Customs authorities in the SR use a database based on SysNed's application software, which ensures the automation of their activities in the management of excise duties and communication with European Union systems.
By registering a tax warehouse, a tax warehouse operator or an authorised recipient in SysNed's application software, this figure is automatically transferred to the "System for Exchange of Excise Data" database (SEED).
3. Preparation and conduct of cooperation
The first coordination meeting of representatives of the SAO-ČR and representatives of the SAO SR, at which the specific cooperation procedure for the implementation of parallel controls in the field of excise duties was discussed, took place in January 2006.
The two sides became acquainted with the legislation on excise duties and the organisation of excise tax administrations in both states.
Particular attention was paid to the procedure of the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and the SR in authorising or in the initiation and termination of the transport of products subject to excise duty under the conditional exemption regime and the exchange of information between excise tax administrations of both countries.
At the meeting, it was agreed that the Czech and Slovak sides would: - process the total data on the quantities of products subject to excise duty transported from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic and vice versa, the transport of which started in the audited period, - compare the data on mineral oil transport - Combined Nomenclature code 2710 and 2711 and alcohol - the Combined Nomenclature code 2207 and 2208 under the conditional exemption scheme initiated in the Czech Republic and terminated in the Slovak Republic and vice versa in the months of November 2004 and September 2005.
During the inspections, the periods examined were extended by the months of October and November 2005 and the transport of tobacco products under the suspensive exemption scheme was also subject to scrutiny in these months.
Tables 1 and 2 show the total quantity of products subject to excise duty which were carried under the suspensive tax exemption scheme between Czech and Slovak tax entities during the audited period.
4. Comparison of registrations of goods under suspension of tax
The SAO-ČR handed over to the Slovak side a database of transport terminated in the Czech Republic, which contained a total of 5 876 items listed on the accompanying documents, of which 5,738 items related to mineral oils, 134 items of alcohol and 4 items of tobacco products.
The SAO handed over to the Czech side a database of transport terminated in Slovakia, which contained a total of 3,319 items listed on the accompanying documents, of which 696 related to mineral oil, 2 066 items of alcohol and 557 items of tobacco products.
The SAO-ČR compared the data on the traffic listed in the register of initiated traffic in the Czech Republic with data on completed traffic registered in the Slovak Republic.
The results of the comparison are presented in Table 3.
Data on transport in the months of November 2004 and September 2005 compared the SAO-ČR with the database of the Slovak customs administration, which the SAO handed over to him at the beginning of the audit.
The database did not contain data allowing reliable transport to be agreed and therefore only 63% of the commenced services were assigned.
Individual services were assigned according to multiple data, e.g. the consignor, the recipient, the date of transport, the quantity of products transported.
Data on traffic initiated in the Czech Republic and terminated in the Slovak Republic in the months of October and November 2005 compared the SAO-ČR with the database of the Slovak customs administration, which contained all data according to the accompanying documents, on the basis of which 93% of the commenced services were clearly assigned.
In the database of the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, data on the amount of mineral oils were given in litres or tonnes depending on the type of mineral oil.
The amount of alcohol was in most cases mentioned in litres, which, however, could be converted into litres of absolute alcohol based on the database of that percentage alcohol content.
The amount of tobacco products was shown in pieces, in thousands of pieces and kilograms depending on the type of tobacco products.
For traffic initiated in the Czech Republic, the termination of which could not be reliably verified in the Slovak database or where the information about the transported quantity of products was not met, the accompanying documents were checked.
The control was subjected to accompanying documents for 487 transport of alcohol, mineral oils and tobacco products.
The examination of these documents was carried out at the customs offices at which the SAO-ČR carried out checks.
For services authorised by other customs offices, the accompanying documents were requested through the DGC.
The Czech side asked the Slovak side to verify the implementation of 141 traffic, for which the customs authorities in the Czech Republic did not substantiate the confirmed copy No 3 of the accompanying document, or did not agree with the quantity of products listed in the database.
Furthermore, data on the services registered in the Slovak database were handed over to the Slovak side, which, however, did not contain the database of transport of the Czech customs administration.
The SAO SR found 95 traffic in the Slovak Customs Administration database.
The verification of the remaining 46 services was requested by the locally competent customs authorities, who proved their termination with copies of the accompanying documents.
The Slovak side forwarded to the Czech side copies of the accompanying documents, on the basis of which transport was also identified in the Czech database, with the exception of transport carried out by two Czech tax entities, which were not found in the Czech database of initiated traffic.
A check of these cases was found to be:
- 11 transport of alcohol was registered in the Slovak transport database in the total amount of 276.7 litres of alcohol carried out by the Czech tax entity in 2004 and 20 transport of alcohol in a total amount of 404.66 litres of alcohol carried out in 2005.
The SAO-ČR found that it was a transport of taxed products, the start of which the sender does not need the consent of the tax administrator.
The freight forwarder informed the tax administrator in writing about the start of the service. He carried out the transport on the basis of accompanying documents used for the transport of products under the suspensive exemption scheme;
- a total of 94 transport of mineral oils, Combined Nomenclature code 2710 11 21, totalling 173 thousand litres realized by the Czech tax entity between September 2004 and December 2005 were registered in the Slovak transport database.
The SAO-ČR found that between May 2004 and June 2005, the tax entity carried out transport of 102,000 litres of untaxed mineral oils without proper authorisation.
The tax entity held a special authorisation for the receipt and use of products exempt, on the basis of which it could supply untaxed products only to the holder of the same authorisation.
He did not notify the opening of the transport authority in the Czech Republic and did not provide a tax security of CZK 1,207,680.
Between July 2005 and December 2005, the tax entity delivered 71,000 litres of taxed mineral oils to the territory of the SR. Even in these cases, he did not comply with the legal obligation by not announcing the opening of the transport office to the customs office.
The transport of products put into free tax circulation on the tax territory of the Czech Republic to another Member State may be initiated by the consignor in the Czech Republic without the consent of the customs office, but he is obliged to inform the customs office in writing before the commencement of the transport.
A tax entity taking products put into free tax circulation in another Member State is obliged to report quantities and ensure tax before they are withdrawn.
Products may be transported only with a simplified accompanying document, the particulars of which are governed by Regulation No 3649/92.
This Regulation also accepts the use of the accompanying transport document under the suspensive exemption scheme, which must, however, clearly indicate that it is a ‘simplified accompanying document for the purposes of tax control (excise products)’.
The same rules on transport and acceptance of products put into free tax circulation in another Member State also apply in the Slovak Republic.
In those cases, the tax authorities transported the products put into free tax circulation with the accompanying transport document under the suspensive exemption scheme, the 3rd and 4th copy of which the recipient submitted to the tax administrator in the SR for verification.
The customs authorities in the SR registered these services in the transport database under the suspensive exemption scheme, as the accompanying documents did not state that it was a simplified accompanying document.
The SAO SR compared the database of transport of the Czech customs administration with the database of transport of the Slovak customs administration and found:
- in the databases the quantity of products transported was reported inconsistently, e.g. mineral oil was given in litres, in hectolitres or in kilograms; alcohol was given in litres or litres of alcohol, making it more difficult to compare the quantity of goods transported,
- the amount of alcohol transported in the invoices did not coincide with the amount recorded in the databases,
- not all related invoices listed in the databases,
- two transport of alcohol from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic were registered in the database of the Slovak customs administration carried out in November 2004 in a total volume of 47,237 litres of alcohol, which were not in the database of the Czech customs administration.
The Slovak side handed over copies of the accompanying documents to the Czech side.
5. International exchange of information between the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and Slovakia
The conditions for cooperation between the administrative authorities of the Member States responsible for excise duty management were governed by 30 June 2005 by Council Directive 77/799/EEC on mutual assistance between the competent authorities of the Member States in the field of direct taxation, certain excise duties and taxes on insurance premiums.
On 1 July 2005, Regulation No 2073/2004, which lays down rules and procedures allowing the competent authorities of the Member States of the European Union to cooperate and exchange information necessary for the correct assessment of excise duties, entered into force.
Each Member State shall designate a central liaison office which shall ensure contacts with other Member States in the field of excise duty management and is responsible for exchanging information on the movement of excise goods.
In the Czech Republic, for securing the exchange of information in the field of excise duties between the Member States of the European Union, a paper was set up at the DGC "Excise Liaison Office" (hereinafter referred to as "ELO ČR").
The safeguarding of tasks related to the management of systems for the control of the movement of excise goods (SEED, MVS, EWSE) and the exchange of information under mutual administrative assistance between the Member States of the European Union and the SR were carried out with effect from 1 May 2004 by the ELO at the Customs Office of Poprad.
With effect from 1 July 2005, the tasks of the ELO Office (based in Poprad) of the Excise Taxation Department of the Customs Directorate of the Slovak Republic (ELO SR) fulfil the tasks of the ELO.
Pursuant to the provisions of Article 3(3) of Regulation No 2073/2004, the central liaison office is responsible, inter alia, for - the exchange of data held in the SEED electronic register, - the Early Warning System Excise (EWSE), - requests for verification of the movement of excise goods sent to or received by the Movement Verification System (MVS).
The content, scope and functions of SEED, EWSE and MVS are governed by Articles 22, 23 and 24 of Regulation No 2073/2004.
SEED - a system for the exchange of information on tax entities trading in excise goods.
The system is made up of national registers of excise payers and allows tax administrations in the territory of the European Union to determine whether products subject to excise duty are traded by a person entitled to do so.
Each national register shall be made available to the competent authorities of the other Member States for excise purposes only.
The central liaison office of each Member State shall ensure that persons involved in the movement of excise goods within the territory of the European Union can obtain confirmation of the information stored in that database.
In accordance with Section 41 of Act No 98/2004 Z. z., § 39 of Act No 104/2004 Z. z., with Section 46 of Act No 105/2004 Z. z., § 40 of Act No 106/2004 Z. z. and with § 39 of Act No 107/2004 Z. ELO SR maintains an electronic database containing a register of tax warehouse operators, authorised beneficiaries and tax warehouses - SEED database.
The customs authorities in the SR contribute to the SEED database by registering a tax warehouse, a tax warehouse operator or an authorised recipient in the SysNed application software, which is automatically linked to the ELO SR.
For example, if a new tax warehouse operator, an authorised recipient or a tax warehouse is registered in the SysNed database, they automatically transfer the related data to the SEED database.
The SAO of the SR found that the exchange of SEED databases between the customs administration of the Slovak Republic and the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic took place in the audited period usually once a month, exceptionally several times a month.
SR Customs accepted 22 SEED files and sent 25 SEED files.
The data to the SEED database in the Czech Republic are transferred from the national register, in which all persons authorised to dispose of products subject to excise duty and issued authorizations to deal with these products are registered.
Individual customs offices in the Czech Republic do not have access to the international SEED database.
Applications by customs authorities to provide information from the SEED database of other member countries are obtained only through the ELO CR.
EWSE - an early warning system aimed at controlling the transport of excise goods through which the transport of risky consignments is announced.
A risk consignment is considered to be, on the one hand, the transport of certain products subject to excise duty in quantities exceeding the limits set by the European Commission Regulation and, on the other hand, to transport assessed as risky by the tax administrator.
The exchange of information is realized in two forms:
- information - is sent when the limits are exceeded,
- alert message - is sent if the transport of goods is assessed as risky.
When assessing the level of risk of an ELO SR consignment, it uses the SEED database to send a warning message, on the basis of which it checks the data contained in the accompanying document.
In the event that the SEED database does not agree with the data in the accompanying document (for example, it does not match the registration number of the recipient of the goods or the registered office of the consignee), the ELO SR shall draw up a warning report sent to the ELO of the Member State of the recipient of the goods.
In drawing up the reports, the ELO follows the regulations of the Tax and Customs Commission CED 317 and CED 457, which determine, among other things, the type and quantity of goods in the relevant units of measurement for the preparation of explanatory and warning reports.
In the audited period of ELO SR, the ELO sent one warning message to the Czech Republic.
In the Czech Republic, information about started transport of products in quantities exceeding set limits is generated automatically when entering data from the accompanying document into the database when approving transport.
If the tax administrator in the Czech Republic evaluates the consignment as risky on the basis of its own analysis, it will prepare a so-called warning message, which it will send through the ELO ČR to the relevant Member State.
In 2005, the ELO CR sent two warning messages to the ELO SR.
The MVS - the system for controlling the movement of goods - makes it possible, through MVS requests, to control individual transport services of products subject to excise duty as well as the control of a specified route of transport between the entities listed in the accompanying document.
The exchange of information shall take place on the basis of a request in which the ELO of the sending country specifies its requirements.
The system shall be used in particular in cases where the consignor takes receipt of the confirmed copy No 3 of the accompanying document and requires, for example, the refund of excise duty and in cases where the data contained in the accompanying document cannot be verified in the international SEED database.
In the audited period ELO SR sent 33 MVS applications to the Czech Republic.
ELO ČR sent ELO SR 25 MVS applications.
Customs authorities in the Czech Republic most often examined the data contained in the accompanying documents, in particular the quantities of products received or dispatched or whether the consignor of the products listed in the accompanying document is entitled to dispose of the products subject to excise duty, unless this fact could be verified in the international SEED database.
The accepted MVS applications were forwarded in both countries to the customs offices locally competent for the recipients or consignors of products subject to excise duty.
The customs authorities examined the required data and reported the outcome of the investigation through the ELO to the other member country.
6. Summary
The cooperation of the SAO-ČR and the SAO SR made it possible to compare the basic legislation governing the area of excise duties in both states, the procedure of the customs authorities of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in initiating and terminating the transport of products under the conditional exemption regime between the two states, the registration of these services and further compare the exchange of information between customs authorities within the framework of international cooperation.
6.1 Compared to the legislation governing excise duties in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, differences were found:
(a) in the procedure of tax entities and tax administrations in initiating the transport of products under the suspensive exemption scheme.
The transport of products under the suspensive exemption scheme can only be initiated by the taxpayer in the Czech Republic with the consent of the tax administrator, who authorises the commencement of transport on condition that the transported products were provided with a tax security equal to the tax attributable to them.
The start of the transport of products under the suspension exemption scheme in the SR is not subject to the authorisation of the tax administrator.
In the audited period, the taxpayer was obliged to notify the tax administrator of the start of the transport of alcohol and tobacco products.
He was able to commence the transport of mineral oils, beer and wine without informing the tax authorities of this fact.
In 2006, amendments to all laws on excise duties were gradually adopted in the Slovak Republic, according to which the consignor of goods under the conditional exemption procedure is obliged to send a copy of copy No 1 of the accompanying document electronically or by fax to the customs office, which is the locally competent consignor;
(b) within the time limits for dispatch of copy No 3 of the accompanying document.
The beneficiary in the Czech Republic is obliged to send copy 3 and 4 of the accompanying document to the tax administrator for verification at the latest on the following working day after the end of the transport.
The verified copy No 3 shall be sent to the consignor no later than the following working day after receiving it from the tax administrator.
The consignee in SR is obliged to send the consignor of the products copy No 3 confirmed by the tax authority and the recipient of the products no later than the 15th day of the month following the month in which he received the goods.
6.2. Customs authorities in both Slovakia and the Czech Republic keep electronic records of transport of products under the conditional exemption regime.
The content and method of keeping this register is not regulated by legislation in the Czech Republic or Slovakia.
Customs authorities in both countries shall enter into the register all data from the accompanying documents on the basis of which transport is carried out.
In order to monitor the transport of goods under a conditional tax exemption regime between Member States of the European Union, there is currently no single electronic system that allows excise tax administrations in individual Member States to obtain real-time information on the carriage of goods.
Pursuant to Decision 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003, an electronic system for monitoring the transport of products subject to excise duty is foreseen from 1 July 2009.
On the basis of the cooperation agreement in the control activities, the Czech side handed over to the Slovak side a database of transport of products under the conditional exemption regime initiated in Slovakia and terminated in the Czech Republic.
The database contained 5 876 items relating to transported mineral oils, alcohol and tobacco products.
The Slovak side forwarded to the Czech side a database of transport of products under the conditional exemption regime initiated in the Czech Republic and terminated in the Slovak Republic.
The database contained 3,319 items relating to transported mineral oils, alcohol and tobacco products.
The Czech side compared the data on the traffic listed in the register of initiated traffic in the Czech Republic with the registration of traffic terminated in the Slovak Republic.
The Slovak side compared the data on the transport of goods under the conditional exemption regime initiated in the Slovak Republic and terminated in the Czech Republic.
The comparison of the data was made more difficult by the fact that the quantity of goods transported was not stated uniformly in the databases.
In cases where it was not possible to clearly attribute the data on individual transports in the two registers, the accompanying documents was checked and the breach of the suspensive exemption scheme and cases of tax evasion were not found.
Based on the findings of parallel checks, it can be concluded that Member States can obtain valuable information from the register of transport to improve the management of excise duties.
The establishment of an electronic system for the transport and control of excise goods within the meaning of Decision No 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council shall allow electronic transmission of the accompanying document and more effective control of movements under the conditional exemption regime within the territory of the European Union.
Communications
This report was prepared in Czech, English and Slovak.
The report was signed by the chairman of Najýššie's Audit Office of the Slovak Republic and the President of the Supreme Audit Office, Czech Republic.
Value Added Tax Administration in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany
Report on the results of the follow-up
Introductory word
Taxes generally represent a key source of public revenue.
It is therefore self-evident that the supreme Audit Institutions (SAI) should concentrate their attention on this area.
Examples include value added tax fraud (VAT).
For their case, a loss of EUR 100 billion is estimated annually in the European Union (EU).
Already in 2005, the participants of the VI Congress of EUROSAI in Bonn agreed on the need for very close cooperation.
As part of this cooperation, SAI can exchange control procedures, find the best solutions, etc.
VAT is a very suitable area for control cooperation, as it is the only tax harmonised within the EU.
The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (hereinafter also the SAO) and the Federal Court of Auditors (Bundesrechnungshof, as well as theBRH) carried out the first parallel VAT control action in 2006.
The report was published in 2008.
As fraudulent VAT negotiations are not limited to a single country but is widespread across the EU, close cooperation between the SAI is needed to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the actions taken to address the problem.
The two SAI therefore decided to further develop cooperation in this area and carried out a subsequent parallel control.
1. Introduction
Control number: (CZ) 09/11 (D) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892
Subject of the audit: (CZ) Value Added Tax Administration (D) Bilateral audit with the SAO (follow-up)
Objective of control:
(CZ) The aim of the audit was to examine the procedure of the financial authorities in the VAT administration, in particular to verify the procedure for dealing with selected cases of commercial transactions between the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter referred to as "Germany") and to examine the procedures of the tax administrations of both countries in the framework of international cooperation.
(D) The audit action was proposed to evaluate the measures taken by the tax administration to implement the recommendations issued by the SAO and BRH.
The intention was also to cover other areas related to VAT.
The resulting control findings were intended to compare with the proven practice found (if any).
The audited period covered the years 2006 to 2008, in case of factual context as well as the preceding and following periods, until the end of the inspection.
2. Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions
The subsequent inspection of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two SAIs.
During previous parallel inspections, suspicious cases of intracomonarian transactions were detected.
Some of them required further screening.
On the basis of the control findings, the two SAI formulated a VAT administration recommendation.
The follow-up control action carried out was used to evaluate the measures taken in response to these recommendations and to examine selected suspicious cases.
The audit also focused, for example, on selected cases of high-risk intracomonality transactions, mutual assistance in debt recovery and the implementation of VAT controls for large tax entities.
When checking the VAT administration in selected areas in both countries, the auditors reached the following checks:
1. Recommendations from previous control
• Recommendation 1: Conditions for registering payers should be harmonised within the EU
In previous parallel checks, the comparison of VAT registration systems in both countries identified differences.
As different types of registration cause problems, both SAIs recommended harmonising the conditions for registering payers within the EU.
This recommendation was made at EU level.
The draft amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 218/92 (hereinafter referred to as "Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003) called for the extension of existing databases within the EU, including a database of tax identification numbers of VAT payers.
He also adjusted common standards for the registration and deregistration of tax payers.
The SAI expected EU Member States to agree on appropriate standards to support their decision to exclude unreliable traders from the VAT system as quickly as possible.
However, the latest version of that document, agreed by EU Member States under ECOFIN, does not already contain the issue.
Both SAI regret notes that the idea of common minimum standards has been abandoned.
However, they continue to see this intention as a relevant prevention tool in the fight against fraudulent VAT practices.
• Recommendation 2: Monthly submission of recapitulative statements
As part of international cooperation, the previous control action recommended that all EU countries introduce a monthly deadline for submitting recapitulative statements, allowing for a more timely examination of the values of intracomonality transactions.
Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax to combat intra-Community tax evasion limits to one month.
In the Czech Republic, this measure was implemented through the Value Added Tax Act with effect from 1 January 2010, implemented in Germany from 1 July 2010.
In Germany, the obligation to submit recapitulative statements was not introduced monthly within the deadline, in accordance with the EU regulations in force, while in the Czech Republic it was.
• Recommendation 3: Comparison of data in VAT returns and recapitulative statements in Germany to achieve greater reliability of VIES data and consideration of linking the two VAT return systems and for recapitulative statements
The German tax administration accepted the BRH recommendations and set up a working group to explore possible solutions.
Work is still ongoing and BRH will closely monitor further developments.
• Recommendation 4: Sharing successful criteria, components and approaches of a risk management system at EU level Based on the results of the previous control action, both SAI agreed that an effective risk management system could not be developed by just one Member State.
Successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system need to be exchanged and implemented in individual EU Member States.
If this is not the case, the perpetrators of fraudulent activity will be chosen by the Member State with the weakest risk management system.
The check found that our two Member States use different risk management systems that have their strengths and weaknesses.
In this area, the SAO audited the EUROCANET system, which allows the exchange of information within the EU, while BRH concentrated on German participation in the so-called risk management platform.
2. Follow-up of selected cases of intracomonality transactions
In the course of the previous audit, commercial transactions were jointly examined for which there were doubts about their execution or irregularities in the reporting of commercial transactions in tax returns or recapitulative statements by the tax payer from both countries.
Both SAI selected nine cases for subsequent inspection, which included the intracomonality movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany.
Checks by the tax authorities of the countries concerned were not concluded at the date of completion of our previous joint control operation.
The subsequent inspection operation verified that most of the tax proceedings in connection with the mentioned selected cases of commercial transactions between payers from the Czech Republic and Germany had been closed and that adequate measures had been taken by the tax administration of the Czech Republic or Germany (e.g. additional VAT collection or the avoidance of input tax refund).
3. Checking selected cases of risky intracomonant transactions
High risk cases of intracomonality transactions carried out by EU payers that have been included in EUROCANET have been selected for inspection.
EUROCANET is a tool for detecting risky tax payers within the EU.
The participation of Member States in this system is voluntary.
The Czech Republic is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has passive status.
It is unsatisfactory for an active participant in the scheme if some Member States refuse to participate actively.
Given the fact that the German tax authorities were not involved in the exchange of data in EUROCANET, it was not possible to obtain any information on which suppliers with German VAT ID were assessed as risky.
As part of the audit, the SAO found both cases of normal commercial transactions and cases suspected of involvement in carousel transactions or fraudulent VAT behaviour.
Tax administrators have limited opportunities to control risky transactions, especially as regards so-called missing traders, and mere physical examination of documents can hardly prove any fraudulent conduct to the taxpayer.
A similar situation for tax administrations occurs when imports and exports to third countries are linked to intracomonity carousel shops.
In such cases, it would be appropriate to ensure greater cooperation between customs and financial authorities in order to identify goods and irregularities in the transport documentation, as well as to monitor their physical movements within the EU towards the end consumer.
Germany, like some other countries, is hesitant to actively engage in EUROCANET due to the lack of a sufficient legal basis.
In Germany, other tools are being used to detect risky tax payers, which until now have worked well for the German tax administration.
In this area, experience between EU Member States needs to be communicated and exchanged.
The Council of the EU has reached political agreement on the draft regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
Its main innovation lies in the creation of the EUROFISC network.
The experience gained so far in the use of EUROCANET should be the basis for the creation of this new network to combat VAT fraud.
4. Mutual assistance in debt recovery
In the area of international debt recovery assistance, all EU Member States are governed by the same European legislation.
Therefore, the method of handling applications for international debt recovery assistance in the Czech Republic and Germany is the same.
The SAO and BRH have compiled a comparison of the statistics submitted by the two Member States to the European Commission for the years 2006-2008.
The data contained in these statistics did not coincide.
Both SAIs consider useful to renegotiate the statistics at EU level in order to find a way to avoid persistent mismatches.
Without this, the statistics will not be reliable and comparable.
In addition, the SAI agree that reliable statistics should contain more information on VAT.
It would probably be useful for the Commission, on the basis of more detailed statistics, to produce an analysis to help Member States strengthen the effectiveness of the fight against VAT fraud.
In the view of both SAIs, this means helping Member States with low recovery rates so that they can increase the recovery rate to at least the EU average.
If a Member State so wishes, the Commission should actively participate in this process.
5. Control of large tax entities
The SAI analysed the legal situation regarding VAT control for large tax entities (hereinafter also "VDS") in both countries.
In addition, they collected, in the form of a questionnaire, information from tax authorities on areas considered essential by the SAI to manage this issue.
The responses received clearly show that the situation in both countries is developing differently.
The Czech Republic has a system to guide the selection of cases prone to risk, relying on a large volume of relevant data (e.g. information from tax inspections carried out, balance sheet data and profit and loss statements, etc.).
This ensures effective management and analysis of VAT control in general.
The establishment of a specialised tax office for the management of the VDS is planned in 2012.
There is no similar system in Germany yet, which makes it difficult to manage and analyse VAT control in general.
So far, Germany has focused more on the choice of individual cases in question, mainly on the basis of VAT return data and recapitulative statements.
The analysis of these data is based on the different risk management components that will be strengthened.
3. The course of the inspection
3.1 The course of the control action in the Czech Republic
The audit was carried out between May 2009 and February 2010 by the Department II - the Department of State Budget Revenue and the Territorial Unions IX. Plzen, X. České Budějovice, XIII. Brno and XV. Ostrava.
The audited persons were: the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic (hereinafter also the "Czech Ministry of Finance") and 25 financial offices (hereinafter also "FÚ"): FÚ Brno II, FÚ Brno III, FÚ Brno IV, FÚ v Břeclav, FÚ v Domažlice, FÚ v Hodonín, FÚ v Hradec Králové, FÚ v Chebu, FÚ v Jablonec nad Nisou, FÚ v Karlovy Vary, FÚ in Kralupy nad Vltavou, FÚ v Kraslice, FÚ Ostrava I, FÚ Ostrava I, FÚ in Písku, FÚ in Písku, FÚ
The audit conclusion of this audit was approved by the College of the Supreme Audit Office on 27 April 2010.
3.2 Progress of the control action in Germany
The audit was carried out between February 2009 and February 2010 by the Audit Service for Indirect Taxation and Personnel Designated Regional Audit Offices in Berlin, Frankfurt am Main and Munich.
After selecting a sample of cases, a number of Länder were notified of the mission of the inspection.
In addition to interviews at the Federal Ministry of Finance, a control event took place in the following Länder: • Bavaria, • Hamburg, • Hesse, • North Rhine-Westphalia, • Saxony.
Included were the tax files of the following tax authorities: • Erlangen, Zentralfinanzamt München (Central Financial Office in Munich), Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Grafenau; • Hamburg-Nord (Hamburg-North), Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg für Großunternehmen (Hamburg-VDS);
In addition, negotiations were held with the tax authorities Mühlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-Süd (Halle-jih) and financial directorates in Frankfurt am Main, Chemnitz and Münster.
A report on the audit findings was submitted to the Federal Ministry of Finance in April 2010.
3.3 Cooperation between the two audit institutions
As part of the preparation of parallel control actions, a meeting of representatives of the two audit institutions to discuss and determine the control topics took place in September 2008.
Subsequently, in December 2008, the top officials of both SAI signed a cooperation agreement in the implementation of parallel controls.
At a meeting in Bonn in June 2009, the inspection teams informed each other of the initial results achieved during the preparation of the inspection, discussed possible audit approaches and agreed on the way forward.
The second meeting took place in Prague on December 2 - 4, 2009.
The control teams exchanged hitherto accumulated findings together and agreed a timetable for drawing up a joint report.
Both SAI decided to focus on: • follow-up checks on the implementation of the recommendations made in the previous report, • examining selected cases of intracomonality transactions between tax payers from the Czech Republic and Germany that were not solved during the previous parallel control, • examining selected cases of intracomonant transactions between tax payers from the Czech Republic and Germany that were classified as high-risk cases, • control of the process of tax administrations in the area of international VAT recovery assistance, • tax controls of large companies.
The report on the results of the parallel control actions was drawn up during the June 2010 working meeting.
4. Control of VAT administration in selected areas
4.1 Evaluation of recommendations from previous control
4.1.1 Evaluation of recommendations in the Czech Republic
Recommendation 1
Conditions for registering payers should be harmonised within the EU
Based on the results of the previous audit, the SAO recommended the modification of the VAT registration conditions and the introduction of a new rule for the abolition of registration in the Czech Republic.
Adjusted conditions should make it possible to reduce more effectively the risk of possible tax evasion on VAT collection.
In this context, it was found that the tax authorities in some cases did not use the authorisation to revoke the VAT registration on payers who did not comply with the obligations arising from Act No 235/2004 Coll., on Value Added Tax (hereinafter the VAT Act).
An amendment to the provision consisting in introducing an obligation for tax authorities to abolish VAT registration for VAT payers on repeated non-submission of VAT returns has not yet been proposed by the Czech Ministry of Finance.
Under the VAT Act, the tax administrator may cancel the registration of the tax payer ‘ex offo’ in cases where: (a) the payer did not perform without notice of reason to the tax administrator for 12 consecutive months of performance, (b) the payer fails to comply with his obligations under this Act; (c) the payer ceases to be a taxable person.
In the previous inspection, it was found that the legislation in force allowed the FC for Prague 1 to cancel the VAT registration on 31 January of the following calendar year to so-called non-established payers, who were not obliged to declare and pay the tax during the normal calendar year.
The FC for Prague 1 has often not abolished VAT registration for these payers, as the relevant provision has set an insufficient deadline for the deregistration.
This problem was removed by an amendment to the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2009.
The tax administrator is entitled to cancel the registration of the non-established tax payer if the taxpayer did not supply any goods or services subject to tax or exempt goods or services with a right to deduct VAT in the preceding calendar year.
Recommendation 2
Monthly submission of recapitulative reports
As part of international cooperation, the previous control action recommended that all EU countries introduce a monthly deadline for submitting recapitulative statements.
The Council Directive shortens the periods for which recapitulative statements on intra-EU transactions are submitted to one month. This measure was implemented in the Czech Republic through the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2010.
There is also a new obligation to submit recapitulative statements in electronic form.
A summary report must be made to the payer even if the services in respect of which the place of performance is determined pursuant to Paragraph 9(1) of the VAT Act are made available to another Member State to a taxable person in another Member State and if he is obliged to declare and pay the tax of the recipient of those services.
This obligation is based on Council Directive 2008/8/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC as regards the place of supply of services.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of data in VAT returns and recapitulative statements to achieve greater reliability of data in VIES This recommendation concerned the German tax administration.
The Czech administration compares data on intracomonality transactions reported in VAT returns and recapitulative reports of Czech payers automated in the ADIS system.
Recommendation 4
Sharing successful criteria, components and approaches of a risk management system at EU level
Proper VAT collection is one of the prerequisites for the proper functioning of the EU internal market.
The fight against VAT fraud is therefore among the areas of priority interest and has received considerable attention in recent years.
The importance of this fight is evidenced, among other things, by the findings of a study published by the European Commission in October 2009, in which an external evaluator attempted to determine the difference between a legitimate and actually collected amount of VAT in the 25 EU Member States (EU-25) during the period 2000-2006.
Based on the analysis of the available data, the author of the analysis concluded that the estimated amount of VAT loss for the period was between €90 and €113 billion, with an average of 12% of legitimate VAT not levied annually in the EU-25.
For the Czech Republic, the VAT loss for 2006 was even estimated at 18%.
In the context of international cooperation, the previous control action stated that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by only one Member State.
Successful criteria, components and approaches of this system must be shared and implemented in each EU Member State.
As regards the risk management system, the SAO audited the EUROCANET system used to exchange information in the EU.
For the inspection, cases of risky intracomonality transactions carried out by EU tax payers, included in the EUROCANET system have been selected (see chapter 4.3).
The objectives of improving administrative cooperation and increasing the effectiveness of the fight against VAT fraud should also be achieved through the establishment of the EUROFISC network, which should improve the cooperation of responsible authorities in a form enabling fraud to be detected in the bud.
This network should later become an important source of information in assessing risks for intra-Community transactions.
The ECOFIN Council approved the creation of the EUROFISC network on 7 October 200812 while setting out the basic principles governing the network.
The preview of EUROFISC is an already functioning system of rapid and selective exchange of information EUROCANET developed by the Belgian tax administration in cooperation with other Member States and with the support of the European Commission and OLAF.
The aim of this system is to detect risky commercial transactions and entities involved in organised VAT fraud.
4.1.2 Evaluation of recommendations in Germany
The evaluation of the recommendations from the first report provided the following findings:
Recommendation 1
Conditions for registering payers should be harmonised within the EU
The German tax administration has set up a well-functioning system for registering tax payers, which is based on a detailed questionnaire.
The Federal Ministry of Finance alerted the Commission to this system in October 2007.
Improvement of the system is carried out continuously.
Currently, data from the questionnaire are processed electronically and will then be used for exploration as part of risk management already during registration.
The Commission has presented a proposal to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, which included common standards for the registration and deregistration of tax payers.
Member States have requested further clarification and detailed elaboration of the issue.
BRH has asked the Federal Ministry of Finance to safeguard the level of standards already reached in this area in Germany.
Recommendation 2
Monthly submission of recapitulative reports
On 8 April 2010, a law was adopted on the transposition of EU directives into national law.
This Act contains provisions on the monthly submission of recapitulative statements on intracomonant supplies.
Those provisions entered into force on 1 July 2010.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of data in VAT returns and recapitulative reports to achieve greater reliability of data in VIES and consideration of linking the two VAT return systems and for recapitulative statements
A joint working group was set up, made up of workers from the Länder and the Federal Ministry of Finance.
The group developed a strategy for automatically comparing data from VAT returns and recapitulative statements.
This strategy has so far been discussed in the Länder.
Furthermore, the Task Force dealt with a tool designed to optimise the control procedure for transactions in the internal market.
Recommendation 4
Sharing successful criteria, components and approaches of a risk management system at EU level The exchange of relevant information takes place at EU level.
Germany is a party to this exchange under the so-called risk management platform.
The European Commission supported the idea of this platform and, following a written consultation of 18 October 2006, the establishment of a risk management platform was added to the Fiscalis 2006-2007 Action Plan.
Platform members are further divided into subgroups that deal with individual topics such as: • risk management tools, • influence negotiations, • evaluation, • updates to the Risk Management Guide.
In early 2010, reports on the results of these subgroups were published.
4.1.3 Evaluation
Registration
The issue of the conditions for VAT registration and the cancellation of such registration in different countries has been addressed at EU level.
The draft amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 included the extension of existing databases within the EU, including a database of tax identification numbers of VAT payers.
He also adjusted common minimum standards for the registration and deregistration of tax payers.
For the time being, the issue of registration and the cancellation of registration has been left to the national legislation of EU Member States.
Member States have requested further clarification and detailed elaboration of the issue.
BRH has asked the Federal Ministry of Finance to ensure that the level of standards already reached in Germany does not fall.
On 8 June 2010, the ECOFIN Council reached political agreement on that draft regulation.
The intention of common minimum standards has been abandoned.
Member States must implement national procedures and only have an obligation to inform the Administrative Cooperation Committee about these procedures.
Both SAI regret that the Commission has failed to convince Member States of the need for common standards for the registration and deregistration of payers, as both SAIs consider this measure to be an important element of prevention in the fight against VAT fraud.
They would therefore welcome the Commission to make further efforts in this direction.
Monthly submission of recapitulative reports
As part of international cooperation, the previous control action recommended that all EU countries introduce a monthly deadline for submitting recapitulative statements, allowing for a more timely examination of intracomonal transaction values.
Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax to combat intra-Community tax evasion limits to one month.
In the Czech Republic, this measure was implemented through the VAT Act with effect from 1 January 2010, and took effect in Germany on 1 July 2010.
Germany has not introduced an obligation to submit summary reports monthly according to the set calendar, while the Czech Republic has (in accordance with EU directives).
Comparison of data in VAT returns and recapitulative statements in Germany to achieve greater reliability of data in VIES and consideration of linking the two VAT return systems and for recapitulative statements
The German tax administration accepted the BRH recommendations and set up a working group to find possible solutions.
Work is still ongoing and BRH will closely monitor further developments.
Sharing successful criteria, components and approaches of a risk management system at EU level
Germany and the Czech Republic apply different approaches to the risk management system for the purpose of identifying risk-prone traders.
The SAO audited the EUROCANET system for the exchange of information in the EU (see cap. 4.3).
In this area, BRH concentrated on German participation in the so-called risk management platform.
4.2 Follow-up of selected cases of intracomonality transactions
In the previous audit, the implementation of commercial transactions for which there were doubts about their implementation or irregularities in the way in which payers from both countries declared these commercial transactions in their VAT or recapitulative statements were jointly examined.
The two audit institutions selected nine cases for follow-up, including the intracomonality movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany, the control of which carried out by the tax administrations of both countries was not completed during the previous joint control action.
1)
The Czech payer acquired goods worth EUR 22 686 from the German payer in the first quarter of 2005.
This acquisition of the goods was not awarded by the Czech payer in his VAT return because the German payer did not have a VAT ID allocated during that period, but only a tax number intended for domestic transactions in Germany.
On the basis of international administrative cooperation under Council Regulation (EC) No 798/2003, the Czech tax administrator received information that, under the German VAT Act, a payer who supplies goods to other Member States did not have to have a VAT ID allocated to the intracomonality supply of goods.
Subsequent inspection by the SAO found that, on the basis of an inspection carried out by the Czech tax administrator, the Czech taxpayer filed an additional VAT return in which he admitted the acquisition of the goods at that value and at the same time claimed the right to deduct VAT in the same amount in this tax return.
2)
The Czech payer was to acquire €12,561 worth of goods from a German payer in the fourth quarter of 2004.
The acquisition of these goods was denied by the Czech payer and did not state in his VAT return.
The German tax authorities refused to cooperate at the request under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 as the turnover of transactions did not exceed EUR 15 000.
As the Czech tax administrator did not obtain evidence, he terminated the check without a finding and the tax liability remained assessed in the original amount.
A subsequent audit by the SAO found that the Czech tax administrator had received two spontaneous information from Germany under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, which showed that the German payer had invoiced those goods to Slovakia.
The Czech payer acquired the goods from the Slovak payer and stated this acquisition in a proper VAT return for the month of October 2004.
3)
The Czech payer was to acquire a passenger car worth €48,500 from a German payer in the fourth quarter of 2004.
The acquisition of the goods in question did not award the Czech taxpayer.
This payer has not filed VAT returns since August 2004, so the tax administrator assessed the VAT amount of CZK 0 for that quarter.
On the basis of information obtained in the context of the international exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 from Germany, in March 2007 the tax administrator invited the payer to file an additional VAT return but not submitted to the payer.
Subsequent inspection found that the tax administrator carried out further acts in the tax proceedings in 2007, which showed that the passenger car in question had sold the Czech payer to a car dealership in the Czech Republic.
The Czech tax administrator issued a payment notice for the December 2004 tax year by which he additionally assessed VAT for the acquisition of goods from another Member State and its subsequent sale in the amount of CZK 295 379.
By order of the regional court, the Czech payer was abolished with liquidation and a liquidator was appointed.
In the absence of the execution of the liable assets of the tax debtor, this arrears appear to be irrecoverable.
4)
The Czech payer was to deliver new means of transport (personal cars) to Germany during the 4th quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005 with a total value of EUR 198 167.
The reply to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 showed that there was an unfinished tax-criminal procedure against the German entity in Germany.
Upon subsequent inspection, BRH obtained information that after the conclusion of the tax proceedings in Germany, it was demonstrably established that the German tax payer had been integrated into fraudulent activities.
Intracomonarian acquisitions of goods were taxed at EUR 182 424 (in 2004) and EUR 369 690 (year 2005).
The SAO's follow-up inspection found that the Czech payer was involved in carousel trades with new means of transport.
On the basis of information provided by the German tax administration regarding the examination of the supply of goods, a VAT check was initiated at the Czech taxpayer for the tax years April, May and June 2005.
On the basis of the control findings and information obtained in the context of the international exchange of information, the tax administrator additionally assessed VAT for the May 2005 period of CZK 703 031 and for the June 2005 period of CZK 726 551.
5)
In February 2005, Czech payer A was to acquire a machine worth a total of EUR 58 000 from a German payer.
This German payer was to deliver a machine worth EUR 88 027 to the Czech payer B in the 3rd quarter of 2004, but the payer B denied this acquisition of the goods.
Subsequent SAO inspection found that the payer B acquired the machine from a German company that had established an organizational unit in the Czech Republic.
Czech payer A did not show the acquisition of goods from a German payer in his VAT return.
The reply from the German tax administrator to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 showed that the German payer did not make an intracomonial delivery of the machine worth EUR 58 000, but the delivery of goods within the Czech Republic.
BRH's subsequent inspection found that after the tax inspection carried out, the intracomonality delivery of the machine was reclassified as the supply of the machine in the Czech Republic and the VAT exemption was abolished.
6)
The German tax payer was to deliver €11,600 worth of goods to the Czech taxpayer in the 3rd quarter of 2004.
The goods were purchased and subsequently sold in Germany in 2005.
The SAO's follow-up found that the Czech tax administrator had assessed the submitted additional VAT return, where the acquisition of goods from another EU Member State, including the acquisition of goods of that value, was improperly stated.
BRH found that after receiving a reply to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German tax administrator corrected the VAT return on the German payer and additionally charged VAT of EUR 1 600.
The further movement of goods in Germany and the application of VAT in Germany are subject to tax control.
The aggregate report of the German payer has not yet been corrected, as corrections to recapitulative statements in Germany can only be carried out by the payer who submitted the recapitulative statement.
7)
The Czech tax administrator received a request from the German tax administration for information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 whether the Czech tax payer acquired a passenger car worth EUR 47 400 from the German payer in February 2005.
The Czech tax administrator, after a tax procedure carried out for the February 2005 tax year, imposed a tax liability on the Czech taxpayer in the amount of CZK 0 and told the German tax administrator that he could not confirm the acquisition of the car by a Czech payer.
Subsequent SAO inspection found that the registration of the Czech VAT payer was abolished in 2007 for non-compliance and the Czech tax administrator sent documents to the Police of the Czech Republic.
Subsequent inspection by BRH found that the German payer had changed his seat and the new locally competent tax administrator had revoked the VAT exemption for the supply of the car to the Czech payer on the basis of the inspection carried out.
The German tax payer has not yet corrected the figures in the recapitulative statement and filed an appeal against the tax administrator's decision.
8)
According to data from the VIES system, the German payer supplied the Czech taxpayer with a total value of EUR 33 205 between the 3rd quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005.
Subsequent SAO audit found that the Czech tax administrator was attempting to determine the causes of the differences arising from the Czech tax payer in the purchase of goods between the 3rd quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005.
The Czech tax payer has repeatedly filed an additional VAT return for the first quarter of 2005.
The Czech tax administrator did not clarify the difference in the value of the acquired goods in the amount of 134 273 CZK for the period 3rd quarter 2004 to Q1 2005, because according to the Czech tax administrator it was not possible to accurately capture business transactions for individual quarters and therefore the tax administrator accepted the submitted additional tax returns.
9)
The German tax payer delivered €46,854 worth of goods to the Czech taxpayer in the 3rd quarter of 2004.
Over the same period, the Czech payer admitted the intracomonality acquisition of goods worth only EUR 14 856.
The Czech tax administrator verified the amount of supplies made in the framework of the international exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
The reply to the request for information received from Germany was accompanied by 3 invoices with a total stated value of the supply of goods EUR 31 998, a value corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech payer in the VAT return and the data contained in the VIES system.
Subsequent SAO audit found that the Czech payer filed an additional VAT return for the tax year July 2004 to January 2007 after many of the tax administrator's claims.
In that tax return, the taxpayer also exercised the right to deduct VAT, thereby remaining unchanged the tax liability for that tax period.
The follow-up verified that for selected cases of commercial transactions between payers from the Czech Republic and Germany, most of the tax proceedings were completed and that the tax authorities in the Czech Republic and Germany had taken an adequate measure (i.e. they additionally assessed VAT or prevented input tax refunds).
4.3 Control of selected cases of risky intracomonality transactions
4.3.1 Results of the control in the Czech Republic
EUROCANET may be an important source of information for the detection of risky entities within the Member State where the goods were acquired.
In the Czech Republic, signal information obtained from EUROCANET was compared by the relevant local tax authorities with data on purchasers.
Starting on 1st quarter of 2008, the Czech Republic is sending data to EUROCANET on risky transactions and tax entities acting as suppliers.
As part of international cooperation, nine Czech tax entities included in the EUROCANET system were selected for control.
These entities acted either as suppliers or as purchasers of goods.
EUROCANET recorded relevant data from tax authorities from other Member States.
As the German tax authorities did not participate in the exchange of data in EUROCANET, it was not possible to obtain any information to help determine whether suppliers with German VAT ID had been assessed by the German tax administration as risky entities.
The inspection revealed cases of normal commercial transactions as well as cases suspected of involvement in carousel transactions or fraudulent VAT behaviour.
Where applicable, the tax authorities used the exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
For example:
• Tax administrators did not reveal any suspicion of involvement in risky transactions when verifying the signal information.
The tax authorities shall continuously monitor such tax entities due to their inclusion in EUROCANET.
• During the verification of risky transactions, the tax authorities did not show deviations from the rules applicable to the calculation of the tax and VAT base in the submitted accounting, even though they found irregularities in the transport and storage of goods or revealed commercial relationships with suspected or non-contact companies from other Member States.
• The verification of commercial transactions was complicated, as some tax payers did not cooperate with tax administrators and could not be contacted.
Locally competent tax authorities have mostly examined risky tax entities and risky transactions listed in the EUROCANET signal information.
Tax administrators in examining risky transactions, particularly in relation to the examination of so-called missing traders , have limited options and only from physical examination of documents makes it difficult to prove fraudulent conduct to the taxpayer.
Stricter requirements for VAT registration and more flexible registration cancellations would help reduce missing trader fraud.
In the case of tax entities involved in carousel fraud and other fraudulent activities, VAT is registered in order to report fictitious supplies of goods within the EU or to issue formally correct tax documents to payers who improperly draw deductions of input VAT on their basis.
In cases where there is a suspicion of the involvement of tax entities in carousel transactions and other frauds and the import and export of goods from third countries, it would be appropriate to ensure greater cooperation between customs and financial authorities.
Closer cooperation between these authorities would help in identifying goods and irregularities in the transport documentation, as well as in monitoring the physical movement of goods within the EU towards the end consumer.
The participation of EU Member States in EUROCANET is voluntary.
The fact that the work of EUROCANET was not attended by three large Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) was assessed by the European Parliament at the end of 2008 as a weakness of this system, which should be removed by setting up the EUROFISC mandatory network.
4.3.2 The results of the inspection in Germany
BRH analysed the information available at the Federal Central Financial Office, which contained data from EUROCANET.
These figures were the criterion for collecting the six files of the German tax payers for inspection.
Germany, like some other countries, has refused to actively participate in EUROCANET.
Germany thus has a passive status, which means that it does not send data to Brussels, but is merely the recipient of the EUROCANET data.
The rationale for this position is contained in the following statement: according to the government's view, it is not legally permissible for state (public) institutions to provide data to EUROCANET.
There is currently no legal basis that would make it possible to violate the provisions in force on the secrecy of tax information.
In addition, the government has no reliable information on how such EUROCANET data is used by other Member States."17 Since October 2007, the Federal Central Tax Office has been carrying out analyses of data from EUROCANET and shall proceed with the Länder's tax authorities in accordance with the agreed procedure.
German tax authorities receive control information on the direct trade relations of payers (registered with specific tax authorities) with traders from other Member States who have been included in the EUROCANET system.
However, the German tax authorities do not receive any information as to whether such a trader from another Member State has any risky business relations with traders from other Member States who also maintain business with the German trader in question.
4.3.3 Evaluation
The Czech Republic is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has passive status.
It is unsatisfactory for an active participant if some Member States refuse to participate actively.
As a result, the control in the area had to be carried out in different ways.
However, the results did not reveal large differences in the detection of VAT fraud cases, as EUROCANET is not the only systemic risk management tool.
Tax administrations of both countries have a number of other tools to detect fraudulent transactions, but it is necessary to create a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.
The Council of the EU has reached a political consensus on a draft regulation, the main contribution of which lies in the establishment of the EUROFISC network.
The envisaged network to combat VAT fraud should also include the experience gained in the use of EUROCANET data.
Member States should therefore communicate their experiences at European level.
On the other hand, cases brought before courts at national and European level show that discussions between Member States and the Commission on the terms of tax exemptions in intracomonality transactions seem necessary.
4.4 Mutual assistance for debt recovery
4.4.1 International debt recovery assistance in the Czech Republic
The basic regulation of international cooperation in the recovery of certain financial claims within the EU is in particular the following directives:
• Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims arising from operations forming part of the system of financing of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as agricultural levies and customs duties;
• Council Directive 2001/44/EC amending Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims arising from transactions forming part of the system of financing of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, agricultural levies and duties, value added tax and certain excise duties;
• Commission Directive 2002/94/EC implementing certain provisions of Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to certain levies, duties, taxes and other measures.
In the Czech Republic, Council Directive No. 76/308/EEC was implemented by Act No. 252/2000 Coll., on International Assistance in the Recovery of Certain Financial Claims.
After the adoption of Council Directive 2001/44/EC, it was necessary to implement this directive into Czech law and at the same time to amend the mentioned Act No. 252/2000 Coll.
In this context, a new Act No.119/2004 Coll., on International Assistance in the Recovery of Certain Financial Claims, was adopted.
The new regulation in the system for regulating international cooperation in the recovery of certain financial claims within the EU is Commission Regulation (EC) No 1179/2008 of 28.11.2008.
The Annex to the Regulation sets out new templates of applications that apply from 1 January 2009, a new obligation for electronic communications and an obligation for the requesting authority to certify the conformity of the documents sent with the original document.
Guiding principles for the provision of international cooperation in the recovery of claims:
1. reciprocity;
2. assistance shall only be granted on the basis of an application containing the prescribed requirements;
3. the assistance shall not apply to financial claims which are in the nature of criminal penalties in the requested State;
4. the provision of international assistance in the recovery of claims shall be followed by the domestic legal order of the State that has been requested for assistance;
5. foreign claims do not take precedence in recovery;
6. assistance is granted only in the recovery of uncontested claims;
7. the principle of exhaustion (the requesting State, without success, used all applicable possibilities to recover the claim given by its legal order).
Act No. 191/2004 Coll. defines the three forms by which assistance is carried out, namely the provision of information, the service of documents and the actual recovery of claims.
Procedure for sending claims for debt recovery to other EU Member States
The competent tax authority shall electronically send a request for information, a request for service or a request for recovery of claims together with the relevant documents to the Czech Ministry of Finance through the Financial Directorate.
The Czech Ministry of Finance will provide translation of the application into the relevant language, scan it, including annexes, and send it through the CCN/CSI network to the competent tax authority of the designated state.
There are two basic requirements for enforcement: the claim must be more than EUR 1 500 and must not be more than 5 years old.
If those requirements are not met, the requested authority may refuse enforcement.
Procedure for receipt of claims recovery from other EU Member States
Upon receipt of a request from another Member State, the Czech Ministry of Finance must confirm receipt of the application as soon as possible within seven days at the latest.
If the Czech Ministry of Finance decides not to comply with the request, it shall inform the requesting authority of the reasons for the rejection of the request and specifying the specific provisions of the directive it relies on.
This communication must be sent no later than three months after the date of receipt of the request.
Upon receipt of the application, the Czech Ministry of Finance will verify that the application has all the formalities according to the law and should immediately forward the application through the Financial Directorate to the locally competent tax authority for processing.
If the request for recovery is accepted, the tax administrator ascertains, among other things, the debtor's assets, e.g. by acquiring land registry statements, by ascertaining accounts in banks, by verifying vehicle registration at the DMV, etc.
After a period of six months from the date on which the receipt of the application was confirmed, the Czech Ministry of Finance should communicate to the applicant authority the outcome of the investigation carried out in order to obtain the required information.
In the case of non-contact tax entities where it is not possible to recover the claim, the requesting authority should also be informed of this fact.
Each amount recovered from the tax authority shall be transferred to the requesting authority within CZK within one month of the date on which the claim was recovered.
It is not impossible for the Czech tax administrator enforcing foreign claims to allow a wait to pay it or pay it in instalments if the state that requested enforcement agrees to do so.
During the period of recovery, the debtor is prescribed interest or penalty payments under Act No. 337/1992 Coll., on the Administration of Taxes and Fees.
This interest or penalty payment belongs to the State that requested enforcement.
In the case of applications for recovery received, the Czech Ministry of Finance did not submit requests for processing to the locally competent tax authorities in a timely manner, especially in 2006 and 2007.
A similar situation was found in the context of international debt recovery assistance in the case of applications received from tax administrators from the Czech Republic.
The inspection operation revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance did not proceed in accordance with Act No 191/2004 Coll., because it did not inform the locally competent authority of the Member State about the progress made in recovery within six months from the date when the receipt of the application was confirmed.
This situation has been improving since 2008.
Statistical data
In accordance with the provisions of Section 13(4) of Act No 191/2004 Coll., the Czech Ministry of Finance processes statistical data for the European Commission by 15 March each year, indicating the number of requests for information, delivery or recovery, sent or received in the past year, specifying the amount of claims to which the applications relate.
On the basis of the evidence provided from all EU Member States, the European Commission is preparing a report on the state of recovery, submitted to the Council of the EU and the European Parliament.
The audit found that the Czech Ministry of Finance underestimated the statistical data due to an error in the receivables item in 2008 by EUR 5 250 thousand, by indicating the incorrect value of the claimed VAT claim (this was a shift of the decimal point after converting the claim from Czech crowns to the value in euros).
The error subsequently translated into the statistics of the European Commission.
Mutual assistance information, including the amounts recovered, is provided in the table below.
4.4.2 International debt recovery assistance in Germany
The legal authorisation for international administrative assistance in tax matters is derived from the law of the European Communities, Council Directive 2008/55/EC of 26 May 2008 (EC Directive on debt recovery) and Commission Regulation of 28 November 2008 (EC Implementing Directive).
In the interests of more accessible formulation and better clarity, the EC Directive on the recovery of claims codifies Council Directive No 76/308/EEC of 15 March 197621, the provisions of which have been substantially amended several times.
The provisions apply, inter alia, to the recovery of VAT, income tax and capital gains tax, including accessories.
The EC Recovery Directive was transposed into national German law by the Law (EC) on the collection of State taxes of 3 May 2003.
The enforcement procedure in Germany is governed by the German fiscal code.
Article 117.2 of the Code stresses that tax authorities may provide international judicial and administrative assistance on the basis of international agreements and legal instruments of the European Communities that are valid in national jurisdiction and under the EC Administrative Assistance Act.
Part of the Sixth German Fiscal Code (Articles 249-346) enshrines the statutory provisions governing the enforcement procedure.
The administrative acts of the tax authorities are governed in particular by enforcement instructions and enforcement instructions.
The Federal Ministry of Finance reached an agreement with representatives of the highest tax authorities of the Länder (Länder) on the principles of administrative assistance in tax assessment and transferred its own responsibility in this matter to the Federal Central Tax Office.
The general prerequisites for filing claims for recovery are as follows:
• The legal requirements must be fulfilled (Sections 251 and 254 of the German Fiscal Code [AO]).
• All available domestic means of recovery have already been exhausted.
• Claims that are the subject of requests for recovery assistance must be final.
• From the issue of the enforcement order or the date on which the claim becomes final (i.e. it is no longer the subject of an appeal), no more than 5 years must elapse by the date of submission of applications.
• The total amount of the claim must be more than EUR 1 500.
Procedure for sending claims for debt recovery to other EU Member States
German requests for recovery of outstanding tax liabilities are sent from the implementing departments of the tax authorities to the relevant foreign authority, for example the Czech CLO, through the intermediary office and the Federal Central Tax Office.
The closer procedure is governed by the Methodological Guideline on International Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (recovery of claims) of 19 January 2004.25 The working group of the Federal Government and the Land Government is currently reviewing this methodological guideline to adapt it to the Recovery Directive.
The request, including annexes, shall be submitted by the Financial Conduct Authority electronically to the intermediate authority.
This office shall check the accuracy of the application in terms of content and form.
If the application is not correct, it shall be returned to the relevant tax authority.
If it fulfils all the formalities, it shall be referred to the Federal Central Tax Office.
The Federal Central Tax Office will then ensure the necessary communication with the relevant foreign authority and also ensure the translation of the application.
Procedure for receipt of claims recovery from other EU Member States
Claims for the recovery of claims received from other Member States shall be registered by the Federal Central Tax Office and shall send a certificate of receipt within 10 days.
In addition, the Federal Central Tax Office will check that formal requirements have been met.
The Federal Central Tax Office shall submit these applications to the intermediate authority, which shall then proceed with the relevant tax authorities and monitor their handling.
The Federal Central Tax Office also sends preliminary or final reports.
Where an application takes more than 6 months to process, the intermediary office shall invite the competent authority to submit a preliminary report which must be made pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Directive 2002/94/DG.
Following an inspection of the formal and factual elements of the application, the implementing services shall notify the method of recovery.
Any amounts recovered must be transferred to the bank account referred to in the application within one month of receipt.
Statistical data
Information on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims between Germany and the Czech Republic in 2006-2008 (as at 31.12.2008) is contained in the table below.
4.4.3 Recovery control, case studies
As part of international cooperation, 21 requests for international debt recovery assistance were selected for inspection between the Czech Republic and Germany.
Examination of the ten selected cases found, among other things:
1.
On 20 October 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received an application from Germany to recover the VAT claim for the years 2004 and 2005 totalling EUR 3 883, i.e. CZK 109 820, for the Czech taxpayer.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the tax administrator an application for recovery only on 26 February 2008.
In order to secure the enforced claim, the Czech tax administrator established a lien on real estate owned by a Czech tax entity.
As it was not even possible to pay the entire recovered claim by stopping the properties, a payment plan with instalments of min. CZK 2,000 per month was agreed with the Czech tax entity.
On 31 August 2009, information on the state of recovery was sent to the German tax authorities, with the claim being partially recovered on 25 August 2009 in instalments amounting to CZK 49 600.
This amount was sent to Germany and on 28 August 2009 a further instalment of CZK 3 000 was sent to Germany.

On 7 January 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received an application to recover the tax arrears of the Czech tax entity, which owed EUR 180 869 in Germany, i.e. CZK 4 434 915, to VAT and income tax and accessories.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the application to the tax administrator only on 27 November 2008.
By checking account ownership of banks, securities, real estate, motor vehicles and movables, the tax administrator found that the debtor did not own any enforceable assets.
Furthermore, a local investigation found that the debtor had not been staying at his permanent address for almost a year.
His whereabouts in the Czech Republic are unknown.
This Communication was received by the Czech Ministry of Finance on 6 April 2009 and on 16 April 2009 the tax administrator's reply was sent to the German tax administration.
3.
On 21 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received an application from Germany for recovery in respect of tax arrears on turnover tax and accessories of the Czech taxpayer in the amount of EUR 3 139, i.e. CZK 84 846.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent a request for recovery of this claim to the tax administrator on 6.8.2008, although already on 18 February 2008 the Czech Ministry of Finance received information from Germany that the Czech tax entity had paid the claim in Germany.
On 9 December 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance notified the tax administrator that the application for recovery was settled by the payment of a claim by a Czech tax entity in Germany.
However, the claim in question was also paid in the context of enforcement in the Czech Republic and remitted to Germany on 27.10.2008.
Due to the long time limits in which the Czech Ministry of Finance informed the authorized tax administrator, the claim was paid twice in this case - by the entity itself in Germany and the recovery of the claim by the Czech tax administrator.
In cooperation with BRH, it was found that the amount recovered from the Czech Republic should have been set off against the claim from a further recovery application amounting to EUR 6 649, which was to be sent to the Czech Republic in September 2008.
The Czech Ministry of Finance records only an application for recovery of a claim of EUR 3 139 for this company, the request for recovery of a claim of EUR 6 649 does not appear in the records of the Czech Ministry of Finance at the company in question.
4.
On 15 September 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received an application from Germany to recover the tax arrears of the Czech tax entity, which owed EUR 39 957 in Germany in income tax and VAT and accessories, i.e. CZK 956 654.
On 19 December 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance sent a request to the Czech tax administrator.
On 1 June 2009, the recovery procedure was initiated, an execution was ordered to order a claim on accounts with banks in the Czech Republic and a deduction from wages (the deduction amounted to CZK 7,000).
At the hearing with the tax administrator, the debtor stated that he did not agree with the amount of the claim and considered it to be questionable.
The Czech tax administrator found that the tax entity had been willing to repay EUR 250 per month in the past, which was not accepted by the German tax administrator.
The tax entity promised to discuss the application with the German tax administrator in order to obtain a change in the amount of its claim.
Recovery of the claim continued during the SAO's audit.
5.
On 19 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a recovery application from Germany concerning the Czech tax entity, which owed in income tax for 2005 and turnover tax for the period 2003-2007 and accessories a total of EUR 113 444, i.e. CZK 3 116 304.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent an application to the FÚ for Prague 1, which is entrusted with the administration of the tax on non-established tax entities in the Czech Republic, until 14 November 2008, as it was not possible to determine the locally competent tax administrator on the basis of the said address of the tax entity.
In the investigation carried out, the FC obtained information that the debtor had an income of EUR 4 704 on 19 September 2008; however, the FC could no longer issue an execution order for this amount, as the Czech Ministry of Finance only forwarded the request for recovery of the claim after that date.
On 26 January 2009, the Czech tax administrator initiated the recovery of the claim and issued an enforcement order to order a claim on the debtor's funds in accounts held with banks and savings and credit unions.
Recovery of the claim continued during the SAO's audit.
6.
The Czech tax administrator applied for international cooperation in recovering the VAT claim and costs totalling CZK 146 223 742 on 3 October 2006.
The Czech Ministry of Finance did not send this request for enforcement to the German tax administration until 13.5.2008.
On 8 September 2008, the German tax administrator transferred to the Czech authorities, through the Federal Bank, the amount obtained from the execution of funds in the debtor's account of EUR 17 700, i.e. CZK 439,226.
When verifying the amount of claims recovered, an error was found in the conversion of the amount recovered.
The amount recovered CZK 146 223 742 was converted at EUR 1 = 25,065 CZK erroneously to EUR 583 378.
The correct conversion of the amount recovered is EUR 5 833 781.83.
A claim for recovery was therefore sent to Germany, which was lower by EUR 5 250 404.
7.
On 1 March 2007, the Czech tax administrator sent an application to the Czech Ministry of Finance to recover the tax arrears from the Czech tax entity, which owed CZK 1 970 632 for VAT and accessories, i.e. EUR 79 847.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the application to the German tax administration only on 10 November 2008.
On 4. 2. 2009, the German tax administrator asked the debtor to pay the arrears.
In view of the significant declines in the company's turnover in the 2nd half of 2008 and in particular in the 1st half of 2009 and the associated liquidation situation of the company, the following payments were made to cover the arrears: on 8.4.2009, EUR 4 600, on 6.5.2009, EUR 3 000 and on 16 June 2009 EUR 2 500.
These payments were sent to the tax administrator's account in the Czech Republic.
On 23 June 2009, the German tax authority agreed with the debtor to pay a further instalment of EUR 2 500 by 30 June 2009.
8.
The application for recovery of the claim totalling EUR 398 653, i.e. CZK 9 832 779, including the claim for real estate transfer tax, was received from the Czech Ministry of Finance on 22 May 2008.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent a request for enforcement to the German tax administration on 2 October 2008.
On 3 April 2009, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a communication from the German tax administration that the application had been returned by the German tax administration.
The German tax authorities justified the repayment on the ground that the real estate transfer tax is not a tax within the meaning of Article 2(e), (f), (g) or point (h) of Council Directive 2008/55/EC.
The German tax authorities further stated that Article 2(g) concerns claims relating to income tax and property taxes.
Similarly, Article 3 of Council Directive 2008/55/EC applies to income and property taxes listed in Article 1(3) in conjunction with paragraph 4 of Council Directive 77/799/EEC.
The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed to draw up and submit a new application for recovery, excluding the arrears of real estate transfer tax in the amount of CZK 61,759 and stating VAT arrears, corporate income tax and personal income tax, which will be again sent to the German tax administration.
The Czech Ministry of Finance received a new application by the Czech tax administrator for the recovery of tax arrears relating to the same tax entity, which owes CZK 7 079 735 in income and VAT tax.
9.
On 6 February 2006, the Czech tax administrator sent an application to the Czech Ministry of Finance concerning the recovery of the tax arrears of the Czech taxpayer, which owed in personal income tax and VAT amounting to CZK 3 445 782, i.e. EUR 123 328.
Of this amount, the VAT amounted to CZK 1 133 967.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the application to the German tax administration only on 18 April 2007.
The Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the German tax administration's response from the German tax administration dated 9 July 2007 to 11 November 2008.
The reply stated that the German tax administrator had issued an execution order for a bank account with the bank on 11 June 2007, which, however, stated that it had no commercial relations with the tax entity.
By doing so, the German tax administration considered the application to be settled.
10.
On 26 September 2005, the Czech tax administrator sent an application to the Czech Ministry of Finance concerning the recovery of VAT arrears totalling CZK 1 296 845, i.e. EUR 43 591.
The application from the Czech tax administrator was received from the Czech Ministry of Finance on 10 October 2005.
On 15 December 2005, the Czech Ministry of Finance sent the application to the German tax administration.
Before sending the request for enforcement, the Czech tax administrator carried out an execution on the debtor's funds in bank accounts and a deduction from wages and established a lien on immovable property.
The request for recovery was preceded by a request for information sent to the German tax authority on 16.3.2005.
The reply to a request for information received by the Czech tax administrator on 16 September 2005 showed that the Czech tax entity was staying in Germany and had an income of EUR 8 437 from the non-business activity.
The Czech Ministry of Finance received a reply to the request for recovery on 20. 4. 2006, but forwarded it to the Czech tax administrator only on 12.2.2008.
The reply stated that no enforcement proceedings could be initiated in Germany because of the insolvency of the debtor - no assets were found on him and his non-business income was already subject to other enforcement proceedings.
In doing so, the German tax administration considered the application for enforcement to be settled.
4.4.4 Comparison and evaluation
In the area of international debt recovery assistance, all EU Member States are governed by the same European legislation.
Therefore, the method of handling applications for international debt recovery assistance in the Czech Republic and Germany is the same.
The SAO and BRH have compiled a comparison of the statistics submitted by the two Member States to the European Commission for the period 2006-2008.
The data contained in these statistics did not coincide.
In a 2006 report, the European Commission recommended that Member States pay particular attention to keeping their statistics.
In the 2009 report, the Commission concluded that the incidence of non-compliance in the statistics had decreased even though the number of applications had increased.
Both SAIs consider it important that the issues of statistics are renegotiated at EU level.
This discussion should focus on how to avoid persistent mismatches, otherwise the data reported by individual EU states in the statistics will not be reliable and comparable.
In addition, the two SAIs agree that reliable statistics are intended to show an annual number of applications as well as the nature of the claims in question (i.e. whether the claims relate to VAT, income tax, etc.) as well as the amounts of claims recovered by individual Member States.
Both SAIs consider it important for the Commission to provide more detailed analyses of the statistics submitted by Member States, as this may help Member States to assess their own effectiveness in combating VAT fraud.
The fact that it is possible to calculate the rate of recovery of claims broken down into individual Member States is considered by both SAIs to be useful for Member States with a lower recovery rate to intensify their efforts and to try to improve the recovery rate at least to the level of the EU average.
If a Member State so wishes, the Commission should actively participate in this process.
Especially in 2006 and 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance did not submit requests for debt recovery to the locally competent tax authorities on time.
A similar situation was found in applications for international assistance received from tax administrators from the Czech Republic.
The inspection operation revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance did not proceed in accordance with Act No.119/2004 Coll., on international debt recovery assistance, because it did not inform the locally competent authority of the Member State of the progress made in recovery within six months of the date when the receipt of the request was confirmed.
4.5 Control of large tax entities
4.5.1 Control of large tax entities in the Czech Republic
General information
The VAT audit of large tax entities is governed by the same rules as that of other tax entities.
The procedural procedure for checking VDS is based on Act No. 337/1992 Coll., on the Administration of Taxes and Fees.
The Czech Ministry of Finance defined VDS as natural or legal persons who were established or set up for business purposes and whose net turnover for the tax year specified in the personal/legal income tax return amounted to CZK 2 billion or more.
The inclusion of the taxpayer among the VDS took place after the filing of the income tax return for the relevant tax year, for the first time for 2003.
The taxpayer ceased to be referred to as the VDS if, in three consecutive tax years, from the end of the period on which he filed the tax return on the basis of which he was included in the VDS, his net turnover for the tax year fell below that threshold.
The taxpayer was not allowed to be removed from the VDS register without carrying out a tax audit of at least one tax per tax period.
All VDS had been checked in at least five years of periodicity until the end of 2009.
From 2010 a written evaluation of the taxpayer must be carried out at least every 2 years and the chosen follow-up must eliminate the tax risks and their negative impact on the correct determination and collection of the tax.
The audit of the FC is focused on at least one type of tax; the tax administrator generally chooses several tax periods at once.
The VDS was audited by departments of specialised controls, which are set up in a total of 13 FCs, or by the staff of the control departments of locally competent FCs.
The Department of Specialised Controls carries out tax inspections within the scope set by the Director of the Financial Directorate.
In addition to large tax entity audits, it also examines
• Tax entities operating in unusual and specific fields of business;
• entities where carrying out tax control is technically and time-consuming;
• entities with a sprawling territorial and organisational structure;
• entities suspected of large-scale tax evasion;
• entities linked in chains and networks suspected of large-scale tax evasion and unauthorised avoidance of excess deductions.
The number of tax checks carried out by the departments of the FCA and the results of these checks are shown in Table 3.
The Czech Ministry of Finance has proposed an amendment to Act No. 531/1990 Coll., on Territorial Financial Authorities, which consists of establishing a dedicated FC with a nationwide competence for selected tax entities (i.a. for legal entities established for business purposes, which achieved a turnover of more than 2 billion CZK).
4.5.2 Control of large tax entities in Germany
General information
VAT controls for large companies are governed by the same rules as tax controls in general, i.e. the relevant provisions are enshrined in the following regulations: • the German fiscal code (AO), • the Fiscal Administration Act (FVG), • Tax Controls (BpO) regulations.
Other methodological documents are also in force.
German Fiscal Code
The statutory provisions on control are enshrined in Articles 193-203 of the German Fiscal Code in Section IV - Tax On-the-spot checks. In particular, those articles enshrine the rules on the admissibility of on-the-spot tax control (i.e. at the premises of the undertaking), their scope in terms of subject-matter, rules on the division of responsibilities, the form and content of the inspection notice, the principles of control, the obligations of the taxpayer to cooperate and the preconditions for the implementation of the final consultation and the communication of the inspection report.
On-the-spot tax inspections are carried out by the responsible tax authorities (Article 195 of the Code).
Fiscal Administration Act According to Article 5.1, point 1, in connection with Article 19 of the Act, participation in tax controls on the spot by the tax authorities is mandatory for the Federal Central Financial Office.
The participating authorities shall agree on the spot the nature and extent of the Federal Central Tax Office's participation in tax inspections.
In addition, the Federal Central Tax Office has the right to require that the specific undertakings it collects are subject to scrutiny at the time it determines.
In such a case, it may declare rules for the implementation and content of the inspection at the premises of these companies.
Tax control regulations According to Article 108.7 of the German Constitution, the regulations on tax inspections (German abbreviation BpO 2000) were agreed by the Federal Council (Bundesrat, the upper house of the German parliament, in which the governments of the Länder are represented).
These administrative rules apply to on-the-spot checks carried out by the tax authorities of the Länder as well as by the Federal Central Tax Office.
Businesses shall be classified by size at regular intervals, in accordance with Article 3 of the BpO 2000.
Large enterprises are subject to follow-up (Article 4.2 BpO).
Under Article 33.1 BpO 2000, each informed tax office must keep a register of groups of companies as defined in BpO 2000.
Methodological guidelines
In addition to the above, the additional methodology for tax administration sets out the following guidelines:
• Single manual for special VAT checks in Germany ;
• the USLO Manual, which sets out a methodology for the use of data on intracomonant trade relations conducted in VIES;
• ZAUBER manual setting out the methodology for using the ZAUBER database;
• work aids for various and special items.
The classification of tax entities is based on criteria such as turnover and net profit, with different limits according to the type of business.
The figures are published by the Federal Ministry of Finance.
They are evaluated every three years and fixed for the next three years.
The number of companies to control - not just large businesses - must be set at regular check intervals.
As a general rule, checks on large enterprises are carried out on an ongoing basis.
Checks are usually declared including VAT checks.
This means that during the course of the inspection, checks will be definitively carried out primarily on income tax, excise duty and VAT - i.e. checks on all types of relevant taxes.
VAT checks can be carried out either by tax inspectors or by VAT inspectors.
Implementation varies and depends on the organisational arrangements of the Länder.
The number of tax periods covered by controls is usually between three and five years.
BpO 2000 foresee a three-year control period.
The subject of the screening is all the taxes of the company.
4.5.3 Management of control of large tax entities
Both SAI decided not to examine individual cases of VDS controls carried out, but focused on management issues to get an overview of how tax administrations manage the issue of VAT controls at VDS.
In the form of a questionnaire, they gathered information from tax administrations about the areas they consider essential for the management of the issue.
• What statistical records and analyses relating to VAT control of VDS have at its disposal to the management of tax administrations?
In particular:
• Are there any statistics or records of rates in which there is a distinction between the fight against VAT fraud and, more generally, VAT control?
Czech Republic: No, the ADIS system at the current data version does not allow such a resolution.
Germany: The tax administration does not distinguish between the control proposed to combat VAT fraud and the general VAT control.
• Are there any statistics or records of the timeliness of VAT controls (in relation to the time period of transactions checked)?
Czech Republic: Registration of timeliness of questioning with relevance to intracomonality acquisition of goods for selected VAT payers is reported in the ADIS system.
In addition, data such as how long it took to inquire are part of the information recorded in the ADIS system.
Germany: No, the uniform statistics at the Federal level for tax inspectors contain only information on the average recent check (information on the year).
This figure does not provide an overview of selected control periods with respect to individual entrepreneurs.
VAT inspectors focus on the latest period of tax assessment; they also have the right to carry out VDS checks.
However, the statistics produced at the Federal level for the units of special VAT controls do not provide information regarding the classification of tax entities.
• There are some statistics or records of the nature of the additional tax revenue generated, broken down, for example, according to the following criteria:
i. net increase in tax liability (e.g. in cases where the taxpayer improperly applied a reduced VAT rate instead of the standard tax rate);
ii. only a nominal increase in tax liability (e.g. the transfer of a fully qualified VAT case to another tax year);
iii. additional collection of tax revenue (payment of additional tax due due).
Czech Republic:
The Czech tax administration monitors the number of tax verifications carried out, the amounts of the additional tax assessed by the type of tax, the number of tax entities audited and the number of tax years checked.
Other tax procedures (local investigations, complaint procedure) are monitored in the same way.
As a separate task, time figures and amounts of additional taxes are recorded.
Statistics of general debts broken down by type of tax are also kept, but not according to the declared tax or tax determined by the tax authorities.
Germany: No, the uniform statistics at the Federal level for tax inspectors and for the units of special VAT checks do not distinguish between the above criteria.
Moreover, these differences are not distinguished by the majority of tax administrations visited.
• Are control areas registered that generate high additional returns?
Czech Republic: Yes, the tax administrator has the right to collect the tax payer for verification on the basis of criteria that can be linked to selected indicators in the special ADIS sections.
Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.
It then follows that uniform statistics at the Federal level for tax inspectors and for specialised VAT control services do not provide such data.
Nevertheless, there is one coordinated approach by the finance ministers of the Länder and the Federal Government.
In the ZAUBER database, tax inspectors or tax investigators from the Länder must write down an obligation imposed by them on the increased tax (VAT) basis if they exceed a certain amount.
In such a case, they must specify, for example, the nature of the assessed increase in tax liability.
• What are the most common findings?
Czech Republic:
- VDS exercise an unjustified right to deduct input tax for supplies and services:
• which were not used to carry out any economic activity under Section 72(1) of the VAT Act;
• which have been used for representation pursuant to Section 75(3) of the VAT Act;
• on the basis of tax documents which did not meet the requirements set out in Section 73(1) of the VAT Act;
- VDS did not declare output VAT under Section 21(1) of the VAT Act.
Germany: It was said that there were no regulations at the federal level.
It then follows that uniform statistics at the Federal level for tax inspectors and for specialised VAT control services do not provide such data.
VAT findings are not separately registered by the Länder if they result from VDS tax inspections.
However, in the ZAUBER database, where tax inspectors or tax investigators from the Länder must write down their assessed increased tax (VAT) obligation if they exceed a certain amount, the Federal Central Tax Office is able to analyse this information.
• Does the tax administration carry out analyses of the areas of control from which there is a high "return" and draws the consequences for the management?
Czech Republic: Yes, for example, they are launching nationwide audits focused on risky commodities or the subject of economic activity.
Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.
Uniform statistics at the Federal level for tax inspectors and for special VAT control services do not provide data on audit areas that generate high "revenue".
There are different views on the analysis process, as well as on the management of cases in terms of relevance.
Some regional tax authorities provide special information, but their use is at the discretion of the tax authorities.
4.5.4 Comparison and evaluation
Differences in the replies of the two Member States show that the Czech Republic provides a system that collects the amount of data from the tax inspections carried out, as well as data from financial statements - balance sheets and profit and loss statements.
Based on a wide range of data, the Czech Republic is able to channel the selection of cases prone to risk.
The same is true of the analysis and management of VAT control in general.
In 2012, the establishment of a specialised tax office for the administration of VDS is planned in the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the tax administration does not collect this information.
It follows, then, that it is more difficult to carry out those tasks in a similar way.
However, Germany's philosophy places greater emphasis on the choice of individual cases based on data from submitted tax returns.
The risk management components will therefore be strengthened and improved.
On the basis of adequate reference notes, expert auditors must be able to assess the exact amount of VAT.
Both SAI agree that Member States should be able to provide adequate financial management as well as an adequate risk management system.
This will help reduce shortfalls in VAT revenues.
As a result, the return on VAT collection will increase and the level of risk detection for unreliable entrepreneurs will also improve.
5. Conclusion
The cooperation of the two SAI on parallel checks of the VAT administration met the objectives set by the SAO and BRH.
The two SAI have better recognised each other's applicable systems in the following areas: • intracomonality transactions, • VAT risk management, particularly in terms of risk collection of transactions, • assistance in the recovery of VAT receivables and • VAT control for large tax entities.
Thanks to mutual cooperation, differences in VAT fraud detection strategies as well as differences in the above mentioned areas of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany were revealed.
The control findings were compared and proven practices were identified on the basis of them.
In addition, both SAIs hope that the results achieved will provide an impetus for stakeholders to launch a debate on approaches and strategies within, including at European Commission level.
Extremely valuable experience and knowledge gained from the cooperation of the two SAIs can serve as an encouragement for the implementation of future control actions in the field of VAT administration.
6. Communications
The report was drawn up in the Czech, English and German languages and signed by the President of the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic and by the President of the Federal Court of Auditors (Bundesrechnungshof) of the Federal Republic of Germany.
