Subject control: (CZ) the Administration of value added tax, (SK) the Control procedure the tax authorities in the management, control and enforcement of value added tax and the fulfilment of tasks within the system VIES for the exchange of information between the member states of the EU

The result of the joint coordinated control was processed within the meaning of the European Enforcement Regulation No 31 for INTOSAI control standards.
Cooperation consisted in the exchange of information to the extent provided for in the concluded treaty and in the preparation of a joint final report on the outcome of parallel checks.
The purpose of the coordinated audit was the verification of selected cases of the supply and acquisition of goods at suspicious commercial transactions between the payer of value added tax from the Czech republic (hereinafter "CR") and the Slovak republic (hereinafter "SR").
Both the parties contractually committed themselves to mutually provide information from public sources, from the electronic system VIES (Value Added Tax Information Exchange System) and the data about the received and sent requests for verification of business transactions between the CZECH republic and SLOVAKIA.
Checks were carried out in parallel between June and December 2005.
On the territory of the CZECH republic the audit was carried out by the department of the state budget and territorial departments of central Bohemia, north-west Bohemia, south Bohemia, south Moravia, central Moravia and north Moravia.
The audited entities were the Ministry of finance and 12 financial authorities: Financial office in Mlada Boleslav Financial office in Cologne, the tax office in Teplice, the Financial office in Karlovy Vary, the Financial office in the Camp, the Financial office Brno III Financial office in Znojmo, the Financial office in Zlin, the Financial office in Šumperk, the Financial office in Ostrava as well, the Financial office for Prague 7 and the Financial office for Prague 9.

Objective of controls:
The aim of parallel monitoring of the actions was to review the procedure of the financial or tax authorities in the administration of value added tax (hereinafter "VAT") after the integration of the CZECH republic and SLOVAKIA into a single internal market of the European union (hereinafter "EU") and explore the use of the electronic information system of VIES, in particular in monitoring the application of the entitlement to exemption from VAT.
The controlled period of coordinated control was from 1. 5. 2004 to 30. 6. 2005.
A summary of the results and evaluation of parallel control actions In the member states, the EU has introduced an electronic system VIES, which allows the tax authorities to check whether the supplier was entitled to exempt the chargeable event of VAT, and in the country of destination allows to check, whether the purchaser acquired the goods properly admitted and taxed.
The VIEs system is not centralised within the EU, each member state is developing its own system.
The Control identified differences between national vies systems in the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic in the following areas:
In the summary reports shall indicate the value of supplies of goods to other EU member states, of the value of the services provided in the summary report not specified.
Data from summary reports submitted by the Czech payer in the CZECH republic are processed at the level of the financial authorities, where they are compared with data on supplies of goods to other EU member states referred to in the VAT returns.
The tax authorities transmit the data from the aggregate reports to the Ministry of Finance (Customs), which sends them to other EU member states.
In the SR data are from the summary report submitted by the Slovak payer of the tax authorities only transferred into electronic form and processed centrally in the Tax directorate SR (CUSTOMS).
In the CZECH republic the payer, show the value of the supply of goods and the value of the provision of services to other EU member states on separate lines of the VAT tax returns, which allows you to compare the values referred to in the summary reports with the values of the delivery of the goods according to the VAT tax returns and identify any differences.
In SR are the values of the goods and services supplied to other EU member states reported collectively on a common line of the VAT return.
As a result, in the SR system does not allow to automatically identify differences between the values of delivery of goods according to VAT tax returns and aggregate reports.
Separate reporting of the values of delivery of goods in VAT tax returns makes it possible to use the results of the comparison of data when checking the exemption of supplies of goods to the EU from VAT.
Data received from the summary report submitted to the payer in the other EU member states are treated on DUTY and compared with the value of the acquisition of goods specified payer from the CZECH republic or SLOVAKIA in the VAT returns.
In SR, these data are sent to the tax authorities and the tax authorities to decide which cases differences test.
In the CZECH republic designates the Ministry of finance (CUSTOMS), which quantified the differences between the values of the supply and acquisition of goods must tax check, and the locally competent financial authorities shall transmit the list of such cases.
This ensures that, for the most significant derogations, it will be checked whether VAT has been awarded in the correct amount when the goods are purchased.
Check further to draw attention to some problems in the system of VAT administration complications caused by the different reporting intrakomunitárních transactions (i.e., delivery and acquisition of goods made by the payer from different EU member states):
Recapitulative statements in the EU are served for each calendar quarter and the maximum time limit for processing and sending data to other EU member states is set at 3 months from the end of the relevant quarter.
The shortening of the period for which the summary report served, for one month together with the shortening of the time limits on their processing allowed early access to the data in VIES.
Thus, tax administrators could more effectively check whether VAT has been declared in the right amount in intracommunitary purchases.
At the same time, the submission of VAT tax returns and recapitulative statements for the same tax period (month) allowed faster verification of whether the payer reported in the recapitulative statement and VAT return the same value of the supply of goods to the EU.
The differences between the values of delivery of goods reported by EU payers and the values of acquisition of goods reported by Czech payers or SR were due, inter alia, to different reporting of intracommunitary delivery and acquisition data in each EU member state.
It was, for example, concerning the placing of advance payments received in the summary report, or reporting intrakomunitárních delivery in the recapitulative statement vendor in another quarter than intrakomunitárních acquisition in the VAT return of the maker.
Harmonising the conditions for reporting such data within the EU would lead to a streamlining of member states 'tax administrations' control activities.
Cooperation between the SAO, the Czech Republic and the Sao SR was also aimed at examining selected intracommunitary transactions between the two states.
Together, it was examined a total of 40 cases of commercial transactions carried out between 29 Czech and 32 Slovak tax subjects, for which there were doubts as to their realisation, or suspicion of tax evasion on VAT.
The SAO, the Czech Republic and the Sao SR have identified, among others, the following facts:
tax entities reported in their tax returns for VAT for the purpose of unlawful acquisition of an excessive deduction of VAT implementation intrakomunitárních of transactions whose execution, in fact, not;
tax entities reported intracommunitary deliveries in Carousel stores, where there was a deliberate multiple reduction in the value of supplies in order to draw excess VAT deductions;
suppliers reported in their VAT returns and recapitulative statements intracommunity supplies of goods exempt from VAT pořizovatelům, who were the so-called "lost companies" and the tax on acquired goods admit;
suppliers have made intracommunity supplies of goods exempt from VAT for tax entities not registered for VAT in another member state.
In such cases, the supply should not be exempt from VAT and should be subject to tax in the supplier's country;
suppliers reported in their tax returns for VAT intracommunity delivery in a higher value than what reported makers intracommunity acquisition, and in some cases VAT was granted in a wrong amount.
The findings of the control action show that the VIEs system provides tax authorities with the information necessary to check the correct application of VAT in intracommunity transactions.
Tax administrators should pay particular attention to the rigorous examination of the differences between the data reported by VAT payers and the data in the VIES system and the use of all information in tax proceedings.

The local tax office sent a request for information to the SR, which was aimed in particular at verifying whether Slovak payer No. 4 acquired goods worth CZK 1 025 thousand from Czech payer No. 3 in December 2004 and in 1. quarter 2005 worth CZK 21,935.
From the responses to this request for information is received from the SR showed that in the DAP for the month of 12/2004, the Slovak payer no 4 said zero value the acquisition of goods from another EU member state and in the DAP for the months of 1 and 2/2005 said the value of acquisition of goods from another EU member state only in the amount of 1 193 ths. Sk.
The Slovak payer No 4 did not respond to the call for tax documents for the tax period 10/2004 to 3/2005.
In a local investigation carried out in SR, it was found that the company was not located at the address listed in the commercial register.
In response it was further stated that the payer complies with all the characteristics of the so-called "lost company", and therefore there is a reasonable suspicion of karuselového fraud.
The SAO SR was informed that the Slovak tax administrator sent to the DR, the DUTY impetus to perform simultaneous checks with the tax administration of the CZECH republic, which will be carried out by the participating tax entities.
In the course of the coordinated inspection, the Czech tax administrator collected documents that would confirm or deny the existence of the goods.
VAT will be measured according to the outcome of the investigation.
The case is also dealt with by the police of the Czech Republic.
Course of control action
In the preparation of parallel control actions, a coordination meeting of representatives of the SAO, the Czech Republic with representatives of the Sao SR took place in the first half of July 2005.
Participants in this meeting were familiar with the VAT legislation in both states and the integration of the VIEs electronic system into national databases.
The outcome of the negotiations was to specify the scope of cooperation and to establish the conditions for the selection of control samples.
Both sides agreed that cooperation will focus on the following areas: a) verification of the validity and correctness of the VAT number of the persons registered for VAT in the CZECH republic or SLOVAKIA in the intrakomunitárních respect of the supply; b) screening data on intrakomunitárních pořízeních referred to in the DAP payers in the CZECH republic using information from the summary report (hereinafter referred to as "SH") payers of SR contained in the VIES, and vice versa; c) the exchange of information between tax administrations in the CZECH republic and in the SLOVAK republic on the underlying commercial transactions.
It was further agreed that the selection of taxpayers for inspection will be carried out in the following volume intrakomunitárních supplies between CR and SR and by the number of requests for international cooperation sent and received between the CR and SR through the form to SCAC.
5.1 Intracommunitary transactions
The procedure for processing information by the tax administrations of the Czech Republic and SR when intracommunitary delivery and acquisition of goods is shown in the following scheme.
5.1.1 Intracommunitary delivery
If the VAT payer makes an intracommunitary delivery, he is obliged to do 25. the day after the end of the calendar quarter submit SH.
The payer in the Czech Republic provides summary information on the delivery of goods to another EU member state exempt from VAT for the previous calendar quarter.
The payer in SR is obliged to indicate to SH the value of goods that have been exempt and delivered domestically to other EU member states for the calendar quarter period.
Data on the value of the goods delivered are presented in the Czech and Slovak currencies broken down by tax entity, indicating their tin under which they were registered in their country.
Service data is not included in the SH.
If the payer in the Czech Republic finds that he has indicated incorrect data in SH, he is obliged to submit subsequent SH.
If the payer in the SR finds that the information specified in SH was incomplete or incorrect, he shall submit a corrective SH before the expiry of the time limit for filing sh, after that time limit he shall submit an additional SH.
The VIES system allows for the exchange of information on the registration data of VAT-registered payers in EU member states.
Payers from the Czech Republic or the Czech Republic may verify that the tin of the respective purchaser is registered in that EU member state.
The data from the submitted SH are on MF DUTY, or DR. DUTY system VIES grouped by TIN purchasers.
The aggregate value of all deliveries is created for each tin of the purchaser and the code of the way of filling from all his Czech and Slovak suppliers, called l1qd files.
Data from l1qd files shall be sent to the relevant EU member states no later than three months after the end of the quarter to which the data relate.
The total value of intracommunitary fillings between the Czech Republic and SR (from l1qd files) is shown in the table below.
If the VIES system in another member state detects an erroneous tin in the sent l1qd files, it shall generate a so-called o_mctl report containing all the erroneous tin indicating the type of error.
This message is subsequently sent to MF customs or DR customs.
Report O_MCTL can contain 4 types of errors: formally incorrect TIN, TIN is not in the state registered or has never been allocated, the customer with a certain TIN was not a VAT payer in a given quarter, registration for VAT, the purchaser was terminated during the quarter.
In the Czech Republic, the MF transmits customs data from the received reports ON_MCTL to the tax authorities.
If an erroneous EU payer tin is used in one of the sent lines of sh or subsequent sh, the so-called "VAT ID notification"is generated at the relevant tax office by the ADIS system.
The tax office shall examine whether to implement the supply to the payer registered for VAT in another EU member state actually occurred and recorded into the system the result of the verification.
In SR processes the DR DUTY in VIES all messages O_MCTL and electronically is sent to the locally competent tax authorities together with the identification of tax payers, who in their SH said erroneous TIN.
The tax authorities subsequently invited the payer to submit additional SH and the indication of the applicable VAT number, or tax office when reporting an invalid TIN in the filed of SH examines the delivery of the goods at the appropriate payer.
Data on the number of erroneous tins relating to intracommunitary transactions between the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic are shown in the table below.
Of the 41,728 tins of Czech payers listed in the SH Slovak payers in the period from 2. quarter 2004 to 1. quarter 2005, there were 929 erroneous tin, i.e. 2.23%.
Of the 62,997 tin companies listed in the same period, 416 were wrong tins, or 0.66 per cent.
In reporting intracommunitary transactions between the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic, Czech VAT payers reported fewer erroneous tins in their SH on average than SR payers.
In examining the activities of the financial or tax authorities, it was found that the VIES system did not provide in all cases, current information on the validity of the registration of taxpayers for VAT.
Example.:
- although at the request of the tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the VIES system confirmed the validity of the registration of the tax entity in 4. quarter 2004, the o_mctl report was subsequently generated due to the termination of the payer's registration in this quarter.
The investigation found that the termination of the marketing authorisation did not take place until 1. 1. 2005;
- The Sao Sr also found that 6 tax entities had filed an SH indicating the wrong tin, but the o_mctl reports did not contain the tin.
In the SR, The filed SH is transferred to the tax authorities in electronic form and the data from it is sent to the DR duty.
After the subsequent processing of such data in VIES, DR Will send customs duties to the relevant tax authorities so-called breakdowns of errors in SH filed by tax entities for the relevant quarters.
Sao SR compared the data on the occurrence of erroneous data in SH to 26. 7. 2005 (i.e. data processed before the start of the inspection) and 2. 2. 2006 (i.e. data processed after the end of the exercise of the control).
The data comparison contains the following table.
From the above data it is evident that the control of the SAO SR had an effect not only on the reduction in the number of SH with a wrong VAT number (an average of 199 SH for the quarter), but also on reducing the number of unpatched bugs in SH (an average of 431 errors per quarter).
In the Czech Republic, the value of intracommunitary deliveries specified by the payer in the respective DAP lines is compared to the value of intracommunitary deliveries specified by that payer in the quarterly SH.
The ADIS system automatically indicates the differences between these values.
The tax administrator should examine the differences, remove any confusion and use the data obtained in determining the tax liability.
The Sao, CR found that the audited tax authorities had not verified these differences in 27 cases.
The total difference between the sh and DAP values was CZK 537,231.
From 3. quarter 2004, the ADIS system allowed the tax administrator in the Czech Republic to consider the difference between Sh and DAP values of up to 0,5% of the total value of intracommunitary deliveries according to SH as a match and set it up in the ADIS system.
For payers with a large volume of intrakomunitárních delivery for one quarter represents 0.5 % of the value of a substantial sum, therefore, the tax authorities in those cases did not set a match SH and DAP without the elucidation of the causes of the differences.
For example, the tax administrator, without checking, set a match for the difference in values of CZK 1,561 thousand.
Examining differences in the CZECH republic and SLOVAKIA was hampered by the fact that the SH for each calendar quarter submit to the payer within 25 days after the end of this quarter.
Tax administrators could not compare the intracommunitary delivery values given in these daps to those given in SH for the first two months of the calendar quarter for payers with the monthly tax period at the time of filing DAP.
In these cases, the tax administrators only became aware of any mismatches in DAP and SH when the tax liability or excess deduction of VAT was levied. rolled.
5.1.2 Intracommunitary acquisition
The VIEs system provides, inter alia, information on the values of intracommunitary transactions carried out within EU member states.
Acquisition of goods in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, the received data from SH submitted by payers from other EU member states (delivered L1QD) is processed by MF customs duties.
When the processing data are converted into minimum and maximum daily currency rates of the Czech national bank for the relevant period and are then compared with the value of the acquisition referred to by the Czech payer in the DAP for the relevant quarter.
The value of the acquisition of goods declared by the payers in DAP should be within the minimum and maximum converted values of L1QD (values L1min and L1max).
If the value reported in DAP is lower than L1min, a so-called verification command is generated for payers with the most significant irregularities.
Commands to verify acquisition of goods are warning of problematic tax bodies and are passed on to the locally competent financial authorities, which must be transmitted to the data investigated.
The number of verification orders relating to the audited tax authorities in the Czech Republic is shown in the table below.
The Sao, CR found that in 33 cases the audited tax authorities did not check irregularities in the intracommunitary acquisition values referred to in the sent verification orders.
The total difference between the sh values of payers from other EU member states and the DAP of Czech payers in these cases amounted to at least CZK 148,319 thousand.
The SAO, the Czech Republic collected 533 files of tax entities for which the audited tax authorities received an order for verification from the MF customs.
Control were identified following most frequent causes of the differences between the values referred to in the DAP maker and in SH supplier: on the side of the maker (the Czech payer) in 263 cases, the acquirer did not put the acquisition of goods in a proper DAP, in 93 cases the payer admitted the acquisition of goods in another tax period other than that in which he had the obligation to declare tax, in the 6 cases reported, the person acquiring the value of the purchased goods to the wrong line of DAP, on the side of the contractor (the payer of the EU) in 88 cases, the payers of the EU into their SH include the value of services provided to the Czech payer, of the 54 cases, it was the payer of the SR, in 39 cases suppliers include the SH of delivery of the goods in a different tax period than the makers from the CZECH republic to their DAP, in 22 cases, the suppliers stated in the PS incorrect TIN of the Czech payer, in 16 cases the contractors have stated in the SH the erroneous value of the supply of goods, in 12 cases suppliers include the SH value of the goods delivered to the CZECH republic before 1. 5. 2004, in 5 cases, suppliers included in the SH the value of the received advances.
On the part of SR payers, the most frequent errors were the inclusion in SH of the value of the services provided.
54 such cases have been identified in the audited tax authorities.
For example, when investigating the verification order, it was found that the difference in the value of CZK 10 974 thousand arose by putting the Slovak payer in SH for 1. quarter 2005 provision of services (construction work and delivery of goods including Assembly in the territory of the Czech Republic).
Another reason for the differences was the inclusion of the values of advance payments received in the SH, e.g. 2 Slovak payer indicated in SH advance payments received from Czech payers, with the result that was generated by the command to verify the difference in the amount of eur 3 580 thousand Czk.
Orders to verify the purchased goods are generated only once in one quarter.
In cases where there is subsequently in the EU member states to change the data from the SH, such as the change of consumer goods in the CZECH republic or the increased value of supplies of goods to the CZECH republic, with new commands to verify the do not generate.
Due to the fact that the VIES system to these changes automatically does not alert, it may not locally relevant tax administrator the purchaser of the goods, without any other complaint about the facts decisive for the correct determination of tax obligations of the acquired goods learn and there is a great probability of the occurrence of tax evasion on VAT.
The audit of the SAO, the Czech Republic found that this situation occurred, for example, in the following cases:
The Slovakian payer listed in SH for 2. quarter 2004 value of delivery of goods for Czech payer in the amount of 1 504 THS. Sk.
1. 2. 2005 the tax office sent a request for information to the local Czech payer to the SR, since the Czech payer granted the acquisition of the goods only in the amount of CZK 425 thousand.
On the basis of the tax procedure, the Slovak payer submitted on 1. 3. 2005 additional SH, in which he corrected the data on the delivery of goods to the Czech Republic, by reducing the value of the delivery for the originally mentioned Czech payer to 538 THS. Sk and increasing the value of the delivered goods for another Czech payer from 194 THS.Sk to 1 160 THS. Sk.
Four Slovakian payers listed in their SH for 2. quarter 2004 intracommunitary delivery to payers from the Czech Republic for a total amount of 10 240 THS. Sk (i.e. 8 183 THS.CZK).
However, Czech purchasers did not declare INTRACOMMUNITARY acquisition in DAP.
On the basis of the international exchange of information it was found that the goods have been delivered in all cases other Czech payer, which wasn't in the SH submitted by the Slovak payer listed.
During 1. in the 2005 quarter, Slovakian payers increased in additional SHARES2. quarter 2004 value of intracommunitary deliveries for this Czech payer a total of 10 240 THS. Sk.
In view of the above, the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic could not have doubts as to the correctness of the data in the DAP filed for 2. quarter 2004, although the actual acquirer did not fulfil the obligation to grant intracommunitary acquisition for this quarter.
NKU, the CZECH republic found that on the basis of the international exchange of information between tax administrations was above the Czech payer additionally assessed VAT for the tax period, 5 and 6/2004 eur 3 640 thousand Czk and for the 3. quarter 2004 in the amount of 3 305 thousand CZK of goods purchased during these periods.
From the above it is apparent that the tax authorities had to in the tax procedures examine not only the differences arising from the errors in the DAP of the maker, but also differences caused by different reporting of data on intrakomunitárním delivery and acquisition in the individual member states of the EU.
Harmonising the conditions for reporting such data would make the control activities of tax administrations more efficient.
Acquisition of goods in SR
In the SR, the APV DIS system allows you to compare data on the value of purchased goods obtained through the VIES system from other EU member states with the data in the DAP of Slovak purchasers.
The method by which the data are compared is called the "min-MAX" method.
Using this method takes place the conversion of the values of supplies of goods referred to in the SH payers from other EU member states the minimum and maximum exchange rate for the relevant quarter.
A MIN-MAX interval is created, which is used for comparison with the values of acquisition of goods specified in the DAP of Slovak payers.
DR duty will send tax authorities information on intracommunitary acquisition values specified in DAP and EU delivery values in VIES.
The Tax Administrator shall decide which persons registered for VAT will be screened for the difference, taking into account other risk analysis criteria.
The SAO SR on the basis of data provided by DR. DUTY chose to controlled tax offices to control 57 the writings of Slovak purchasers of goods, of which 25 payers prefer goods from the CZECH republic, which they found the highest differences between the values of acquisition obtained from the VIES and the values registered in the DAP.
Carried out by the control of the SAO SR has confirmed the fact that the tax authorities consistently neprověřovali differences obtained using the method of MIN-MAX and didn't check so the accuracy of the data referred to in the DAP Slovak acquirers.
As part of the audit, the Sao SR asked the tax authorities to conduct 47 local investigations with specific tax entities.
In the course of the audit of the Sao SR at the tax authorities, 31 local investigations were terminated.
For Slovak companies which saw significant differences in MIN-MAX values in the acquisition of goods from EU member states, the following facts were found, inter alia:
At DAP in 4. quarter 2004 Slovak payer did not specify the value of the acquisition of goods from the EU.
The Tax Office found that the company from the Czech Republic listed in SH for 4. quarter 2004 mistakenly tin of this payer, with goods worth CZK 19,184 in fact supplied to another Slovak payer.
According to the VIES system, the Slovak company had 4. quarter 2004 acquire goods from the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Austria worth mins 682 692 THS.Sk and MAX 715 105 THS. Sk.
This company filed a DAP for the period in which the reported value of acquisition of goods from EU in the amount of 480 599 ths. Sk.
The tax administrator performed a local investigation, while found that the taxpayer was purchasing electricity from the CZECH republic, Poland, Hungary and Austria.
Suppliers to SH and DAP did not specify the date of issue of the invoices but the date of delivery.
Due to other irregularities in the acquisition of goods from these EU states, the tax administrator will ask to check the value of the goods delivered through SCAC forms.
Acquisition of goods from EU member states in 4. quarter 2004 Slovak payer in DAP did not specify.
According to the VIES system, this payer was to acquire goods worth min 11 286 THS. Sk and MAX 11 845 THS. Sk.
The Tax Office conducted a local investigation, the inspection showed that the tax entity in 4. he did not procure any goods from EU member states in the 2004 quarter.
Sao SR advised the tax office to request a verification of the delivery of goods from EU member states through the SCAC form.
In the VIES system, the delivery of goods for the Slovak buyer was reported for mins 557 THS. Sk and MAX 565 THS. Sk.
In the DAP for the tax period of 10 to 12/2004, the payer did not report any acquisition of goods.
A local investigation by the tax administrator found that the tax entity received on 10. 12. 2004 from the supplier of the Czech Republic invoice for the material consumed in the repair of the hydraulic loader.
The Sao SR recommended that a tax inspection be carried out on the payer.
In the course of the Sao SR inspection, in 16 cases, the tax authorities did not end the local investigation.
In 10 cases, the Sao SR asked the tax administrator to carry out a tax inspection on tax entities.
Reports on the results of local investigations and tax inspections shall be submitted by the tax authorities after their implementation by the Sao SR.
For example, these cases:
The Slovak purchaser did not specify in DAP for 4. quarter 2004 acquisition of goods from EU member states and for the tax period of the months 10 to 12/2004 did not admit any tax and claimed the refund of excess VAT deduction totaling Sk 1 236 thousand.
The tax administrator performed a local investigation, which showed that the taxpayer got from the CZECH republic goods worth $ 683 thousand EUROS (about 27 080 thousand. Sk).
The goods were transported from the Czech Republic by a Czech supplier to the customs office in Čierný nad Tisa, from where the transport continued to the Russian Federation.
The Slovak payer for buyers in the Russian Federation issued an invoice for the amount of 683 thousand euros, which he did not specify in the filed DAP.
With the tax entity, the tax administrator conducts a tax inspection.
Difference between acquisition data given in DAP Slovak payer for 3. quarter 2004 to 1. quarter 2005 and delivery data reported by payers from EU member states in each quarter was a total of Sk 4 800 thousand.
The tax bureau found that the taxpayer was purchasing goods from suppliers from the CZECH republic and Belgium and such goods are subsequently sold to Ukraine.
The invoices were accompanied by an export single customs declaration.
The acquisition of goods in DAP, the tax body did not include, according to the observations of the agent of the company was goods under transit are transported directly from the CZECH republic to Ukraine.
The tax entity has not submitted any VAT records to local investigations.
A tax inspection has been launched for the payer.
5.2 international exchange of level L3 information
The exchange of information at the level of L3 is initiated by the locally competent tax administrator, that its request for information (hereinafter referred to as "RFIS") or spontaneous information (hereinafter referred to as "SPI"), relating to a fiscal entity or the transaction, sent through the ministry of finance, customs DUTY, respectively.
DR duty to another EU member state. The aim of the Joi is, for example, to demonstrate the execution of a given transaction in the framework of intracommunity transactions, to check a certain tin, etc.
In the case of SPI, it is a communication of information relevant to tax authorities in another EU country.
Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003 provides for cooperation in the field of information exchange.
The maximum time limit for reply to the Joi was set in art. 8 this regulation for 3 months.
The conditions for admissibility of applications are governed by a decision of the commission of the European Communities of 15. 11. 2004, which provides that if the participating states agree otherwise, it must RFIS concern the business transactions worth at least EUR 1 500 excluding VAT.
In the case of a business transaction worth less than EUR 15 000 excluding VAT, the requested authority may refuse to reply in view of its workload.
The procedure of handling incoming RFIS tax administration of the CZECH republic including the indication of the internal time limits laid down for processing at individual to organizational levels shows the following scheme.
In SR was internally established deadline for the processing of RFIS by the tax authorities on 2 months so that it can be adhered to the three-month time limit under Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003.
MF has accepted customs duties from SR since 1. 5. 2004 to 30. 6. 2005 total 29 ŽOI and 3 SPI.
Of the 29 recruits received, 26 (i.e. 89,7 %) were settled within a 3-month period and 3 (i.e. 10,3%) were settled after that period.
During the same period, Dr duties from the Czech Republic received a total of 71 ŽOI and 7 SPI.
Of the 71 enrollees received, 64 (i.e. 90,1 %) were settled within a 3-month period, 5 (i.e. 7,0%) were settled after that period (for the remaining 2 cases it was not possible to determine the time limit from the materials submitted).
The following chart provides more detailed information on the time of handling of MF duties and DR duties.
The reasons for sending the Joi, indicated on the SCAC forms, include the following table.
Conclusion
On the basis of international cooperation was examined compliance with the Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT and on the use of VIES to the exchange of information between the member states of the EU, in particular in monitoring the application of the entitlement to exemption from VAT.
International cooperation has made it possible to examine selected intracommunitary transactions between VAT payers from the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic.
By examining the selected transactions, it was found that on the basis of the international exchange of information have revealed the tax administration of both countries, the cases of companies that made the fictional intracommunity commercial transactions in order to obtain excessive deductions of VAT and also cases where the makers not paying the VAT from the received supply of the goods in the correct amounts.
Furthermore, the checks identified differences in the processing and use of VIES data by the tax administrations of both countries.
The inspection also highlighted the problems caused by the different reporting of intracommunitary supplies and purchases of goods in each EU member state.
Harmonising the conditions for reporting such data within the EU would lead to a streamlining of member states 'tax administrations' control activities.
Clearance procedure, financial, or tax authorities in the administration of VAT and the use of VIES, it was found that the financial or tax authorities have not been using enough all the system options VIES and the relevant statutory permissions.
Furthermore, it was found that the VIES system did not provide in all cases, current information on the supply of goods and the validity of the registration of tax subjects to VAT.
The Sao SR compared the data on the occurrence of erroneous data in the SH, processed before the start of the inspection, with the data processed after the end of the inspection.
From the comparison of these data it became clear that the Sao SR control had an effect not only on reducing the number of SH with incorrectly indicated tin but also on reducing the number of unrecovered errors in SH.
In the event of irregularities in the reported data, the Sao SR asked the tax authorities to conduct local investigations or, where appropriate, to carry out tax checks.
The SAO, the Czech Republic had no such possibility under the current legislation in the Czech Republic.
The findings of the control actions showed that the VIEs system provided the tax authorities with the basic information necessary to check the correct application of VAT in intracommunity transactions.
As there is still scope for tax evasion in this area, there is a need to pay increased attention to INTRACOMMUNITARY transactions when managing VAT.

This report has been prepared in Czech, English and Slovak language and signed by the president of the Supreme audit office, Czech republic and the president of the Najvyššieho kontrolného office of the Slovak republic.
Parallel control of the administration of Value Added Tax and excise duties between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic
Introductory word
This informational material provides an overview of the progress and results of the parallel control actions performed by the Supreme audit office and the Najvyšším kontrolným úradom S-skej of the republic, which were aimed at the area of the administration of the value-added and excise taxes.
Cooperation between the supreme audit offices of the two countries was implemented on the basis of a cooperation agreement in the control activities concluded in February 2004.
The theme of parallel control actions were selected with regard to the fact that indirect taxes are a significant contributor to the income of the state budgets of both countries.
The design of the value added tax, allowing the return of the excess deduction, provides room for tax fraud or evasion.
High excise tax rates, in particular for tobacco and tobacco products, ethyl alcohol and mineral oils, they mean a high profit for those who escape from taxation of the illegal sale of these goods.
Tax fraud is a problem not only in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, but also in other countries of the European Union.
Due to the need to address this issue comprehensively in the context of the whole of the European union the supreme audit institutions of the member countries of the European union created a working group of the VAT Working Group, to whose activities they are actively involved and miti-er control authorities of both countries.
The biggest benefit of control actions can be seen not only in the exchange of experience, but in particular in a joint effort to identify the problem areas of the administration of indirect taxes with the aim of reducing the space for tax evasion.
Obtained experience and knowledge will be utilized in the framework of planned inspections of indirect taxes, focusing primarily on the involvement of administrators of the taxes of the two states to the system VIES, allowing to control the movement of goods between member states of the European union.

Of the 5,883 selected JCD items from the Czech Customs database, a total of 43% of related JCD items were assigned.
Of the 12,343 selected JCD items from the SR Customs database, a total of 26% of related JCD items were assigned.
On the basis of the undistributed items JCD was on the financial or tax authorities carried out a selection of writings tax entities, which have been declared by the imports and exports subject to further verification, in cooperation with the customs administrations of the CZECH republic and SLOVAKIA.
On the basis of the exchange of information from the supporting documents to the customs administrations of the CZECH republic and SLOVAKIA and the financial or tax authorities was on the territory of the second state of the verified implementation reported imports and exports between the CZECH republic and SLOVAKIA.
The SAO and the SAO SR carried out a joint pilot control at the border customs crossing Starý Hrozenkov - Drietoma, in which both parties closely cooperate in the verification of the correctness of the data on the movement of goods between the CZECH republic and SLOVAKIA.
The inspection found deficiencies in the records of selected cases of imports and exports of goods realized in 2002.
International cooperation has allowed the examination of the business transactions between business partners from both states and pointed out the deficiencies in the registration of imports and exports.
2.2. Summary of control results
Check the SAO and the SAO SR in the field of international cooperation focused on the imports and exports of ethyl alcohol and spirits, tobacco and tobacco products, computers and computer components, mobile phones and their components, or even other types of goods.
On the basis of the writings of taxpayers to the selected financial, or tax offices, the SAO asked for verification of implementation of the exports of goods as reported on 40 JCD in the total statistical value 15 301 093 Czk and the SAO SR on the verification of the export, the statistical value of 56 989 Sk.
The SAO and Sao SR have identified, inter alia, the following facts:
- business transactions were on both sides declared the same way, which made it difficult the possibility of identifying appropriate imports and exports in the customs database of the CZECH republic and the customs database SR,
- errors in the entry of data into customs databases made it impossible to identify certain imports or exports,
- some exports from the Czech Republic have not been shown to produce adequate imports into the Czech Republic.
In these cases, there is a reasonable suspicion of fictitious exports of goods for the purpose of unauthorized application of deductions for Value Added Tax,
- tax entities did not comply with certain statutory obligations when reporting imports and exports in value added tax returns,
- in the activities of the financial or tax authorities in the administration of value added tax and excise taxes and their interaction with the customs authorities, deficiencies were identified.
In the field of value added tax and excise taxes will continue to need to pay attention to international trade in order to effectively minimize tax evasion.
In particular, it is important to improve the activity of tax administrators in the exercise of value added tax administration.
The basis of effective control of excise duties is the control of circulation of documents, a systematic physical inspection of the goods and the mutual exchange of information on import and export of goods.
3. Description of the state of Value Added Tax and excise duty
Value Added Tax
Value added tax (hereinafter "VAT") was levied by the financial or tax authorities of the taxable transactions carried out in the territory of the country and the customs authorities upon importation of the goods.
Tax revenues were due to the difference between the tax liability collected and the excess VAT deductions refunded.
VAT revenues at customs offices were determined by the amount of tax collected by them.
Tax collected by customs authorities, in accordance with the basic principles of the VAT mechanism, was reflected in the tax deductions applied to financial or tax authorities.
For most financial and tax authorities, excess deductions exceeded the tax liability.
The VAT is in terms of revenue of the state budget one of the flagship tax, since the tax revenues of the state budget of the CZECH republic in 2003, contributed about 31 % and the tax revenue of the state budget of the SR to approximately 42%.
The total VAT collection in the Czech Republic was CZK 162.9 billion in 2003.
The financial and customs authorities collected a total of CZK 394.3 billion in VAT in 2003 and the excess VAT deductions returned were CZK 231.4 billion in total.
The total VAT collection in SR amounted to SKK 83.8 billion in 2003.
In 2003, the tax and customs authorities levied CZK 187.0 billion in VAT and the excess VAT deductions refunded amounted to CZK 103.2 billion.
Excise duties
The collection of excise duties (hereinafter referred to as "SpD") was carried out by the relevant financial and / or tax authorities and on importation of products subject to SpD by customs authorities.
The SpD's share of the tax revenues of the state budget in the Czech Republic was approximately 16% in 2003 and about 19% in the Czech Republic.
Total collection of SpD selected in the CZECH republic, financial and customs authorities in the year 2003 amounted to 85,6 billion and SR achieve the above 38,0 billion Sk.
4. Course of control action
Cooperation between the SAO and the Sao SR took place in two stages.
In the first stage, a comparison was made between the imports and exports of selected commodities from customs databases in the CZECH republic and SLOVAKIA, in the second stage were the results of this comparison used in the mutual verification of the implementation of selected business transactions between the CZECH republic and SLOVAKIA and during the checks carried out on the territory of both states.
4.1.
Preparation of control action
The first proposal for cooperation in parallel checks on VAT and SpD was presented at the working meeting of representatives of the SAO and Sao SR in April 2003.
In November 2003, held a coordination meeting, at which it was inter alia agreed on the selection of commodities - goods, which accounted for a significant risk when compliance with customs and tax regulations: - alcohol and spirits, items of the customs tariff no. 2207 and 2208, - tobacco and tobacco products, items customs tariff heading no 2401, 2402 and 2403, - computers and computer components, items and sub-items of the customs tariff heading no 8471 and 8473 30, - mobile phones and their accessories, the subheading of the customs tariff no 8525 20 91, 8525 20 99, 8529 90 40.
Both parties agree that the selection of taxpayers for inspection will be carried out: a) from undistributed items identified by comparing the exports and imports of selected commodities between the CZECH and SLOVAK republics, b) of operators taking imports and exports regularly or once in a large volume, c) on the basis of the findings of checks carried out by the selected financial and tax authorities.
4.2. Comparison of Customs databases of the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic
In the first leg was on a sample of imports and exports of selected commodities for the month of October of the year 2002 tested the mechanism of mutual matching items JCD registered in the customs databases of the CZECH republic and SLOVAKIA.
Subsequently, the portion of exports from the Czech Republic was compared with imports into the SR for 2002 and vice versa for selected commodities according to the customs tariff:
- 2207 undenatured Ethyl Alcohol of an alcoholic strength by volume of 80% Vol. or more; ethyl alcohol and other spirits denatured, of any alcoholic strength,
- 2208 undenatured Ethyl Alcohol of an alcoholic strength by volume of less than 80% Vol. spirits, liqueurs and other spirit drinks,
- 2401 unprocessed tobacco; tobacco waste,
- 2402 cigars (whether or not with cut ends), cigarillos and cigarettes of tobacco or tobacco substitutes,
- 2403 other tobacco products and tobacco substitutes; homogenised or reconstituted tobacco; tobacco extracts and punishments (essences),
- 8525 20 91 transmitting apparatus containing receiving equipment: for cellular network (mobile phones),
- 8525 20 99 transmitting apparatus containing receiving equipment: other,
- 8529 90 40 parts suitable for use solely or principally with apparatus of headings 8525 to 8528.
Other: Parts of apparatus falling within subheadings 8525 10 50, 8525 20 91, 8525 20 99, 8525 40 11 and 8527 90 92.
Items JCD from tariff databases of the CZECH republic and SLOVAKIA were each other are on the basis of the conformity of the individual paragraphs of JCD (e.g. the invoiced price, quantity, weight, registration number of the vehicle carrying the cargo, the date of crossing the state border, the item of the customs tariff, etc.).
The results of the comparison are presented in the following tables and charts.
The mutual mapping of individual imports and exports has made it more difficult, inter alia, the fact that commercial transactions were on both sides declared the same way.
For example, exports from the CZECH republic, declared on the single export JCD was on the territory of the SR declared on more import JCD, or should export JCD different number of items from import JCD.
Other factors that had an impact on the success of the association, was the different mix of data in the customs databases of the CZECH republic and SLOVAKIA, and also the time shift between the records of exports in the customs database in one country and the records of the corresponding imports in the customs database of the other country.
The results of the comparison were used in the selection of control samples at the audited financial and / or tax authorities.
Preferably selected some of the tax entities that were imports or exports between the CZECH republic and SLOVAKIA, which failed to identify in both databases.
Furthermore, to verify the commercial transactions reported in the VAT returns selected some of the tax bodies, for which there were data on imports or exports between the CZECH republic and SLOVAKIA in both databases found.
4.3. Pilot control at the border customs crossing Starý Hrozenkov-Drietoma
Border customs crossing for the performance of the pilot control was selected on the basis of a joint analysis of undistributed items JCD in the tariff databases of the CZECH republic and SLOVAKIA.
On the basis of a bilateral agreement between the customs authorities of the CZECH republic and SLOVAKIA was from 1.6.1998 was introduced at the border customs crossing points between the CZECH republic and SLOVAKIA for use of the check sheets.
The aim of this measure was to eliminate customs and tax evasion, to ensure an overview of the movement of means of transport carrying the goods of a business nature in the customs area and to create conditions for the mutual comparison of customs records.
A joint pilot check was carried out on 8 days. 3. 2004 to 26. 3. 2004 and was aimed at examining this customs control system.
Procedure for using control sheets at the border customs crossing Starý Hrozenkov-Drietoma:
1) weighing the vehicle, issuing a control sheet and passing it on to the driver.
2) weaning of the vehicle in the marked sector in the parking lot.
Customs consideration in the check-in Hall of check-in by the police of the Czech Republic, the police of the Czech Republic, the customs administration of the Czech Republic, the customs administration of the Czech Republic.
The check-in process was confirmed by stamping each component in the check sheet.
3) the addition of the vehicle to the physical inspection area.
Presentation of a control sheet, JCD, or other documents to a customs officer, where appropriate - control of the execution of all prescribed acts and documents.
Physical inspection by the relevant components.
Discharge of the vehicle from the customs area.
Pozru: when the goods were imported into the Czech Republic, the weighing of the vehicle was carried out directly by the customs officials of the Czech Republic.
When importing goods into the SR, weighing vehicles were carried out by workers authorized by the legal entity.
The vehicles were registered in computer records after consideration.
4.3.1 Control sample
Exports from the Czech Republic to the Czech Republic
The control sample was selected on the basis of an analysis of records from the Customs database of exports of the Czech Republic in 2002.
The composition of the control sample for exports is shown in Table 4.
4.3.2. Control sheets and their records exports from the Czech Republic to the Czech Republic
When exporting from the Czech Republic to the Czech Republic, the inspection sheets were issued and registered by the customs administration of the Czech Republic.
The customs administration of the Czech Republic recorded the registration numbers of these control sheets in the electronic export database.
Of the 453 items of the JCD, Sao SR tracked 256 cases of imports into the SR according to data from the Customs database of the Czech Republic and SR. The remaining 197 JCD items were identified by the Sao SR in cooperation with Drietoma border crossing officers.
Exports from the SR to the Czech Republic
When exporting from the SR to the Czech Republic, the inspection sheets were issued and registered by the customs administration of the Czech Republic.
Of the total number of 339 items JCD of the selected control sample of the SAO in cooperation with the staff of the border customs crossing Starý Hrozenkov assigned to 295 items JCD matching the registration numbers of control sheets.
The remaining 44 cases identified in its records the personnel of border customs crossing Drietoma and exports of goods from SLOVAKIA to the CZECH republic confirmed.
Check the SAO and the SAO SR did not identify deficiencies in the records of selected cases of imports and exports of goods in 2002, at the border customs crossing Starý Hrozenkov-Drietoma.
4.4. Selected control findings in the verification of business transactions
In the framework of international cooperation was veried by the implementation of imports and exports between the CZECH republic and SLOVAKIA from the documents of the customs administrations and the financial or tax authorities on the territory of the other state.
The selected tax entities have been verified:
- whether the submitted JCDS were registered in the customs databases of the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic,
- compliance with the statutory conditions for the application of VAT deduction on importation, refund of excess VAT deduction and application of VAT exemption on export.
Verification of commercial transactions was found:
1. Sao SR requested verification of the implementation of the export of alcohol at a statistical value of 56 989 Sk.
The Sao identified in the Customs database of the Czech Republic the corresponding imports in a statistical value of 42 624 CZK.r
2. The company engaged in import and export of photographic equipment and accessories applied in the VAT return for the month of December 2002, the excess VAT in the amount of 3 740 664 Rubles.
In order to check the reported exports from the Czech Republic, the Sao selected 3 JCDS (16 items) with a statistical value of CZK 1 274 822.
The Sao SR identified 3 corresponding import JCDS (17 items) with a statistical value of 1 724 321 Sk.
VAT has been paid to the relevant customs office in the SR.
3. The company, whose business was mainly business in optical instruments, applied in 2002 a total excess VAT deduction of CZK 4,136,000 higher than the tax liability.
To verify the reported Business Activity, The SAO selected the export JCD (32 items) with a statistical value of CZK 7,154,124.
The Sao SR has established that this JCD corresponds to the import JCD (12 items) with a statistical value of Sk 9 653 827.
VAT has been paid to the relevant customs office in the SR.
4. The company engaged in, inter alia, the purchase of goods for resale and sale did not show in the submitted VAT returns in the years 2002 and 2003, no export of goods.
According to the Customs database of the Czech Republic, the statistical value of exports of goods in 2002 amounted to a total of 3 439 888 CZK.
Based on this, the SAO has selected 5 export JCDS (5 items) for verification of the total statistical value of CZK 669,839.
The Sao SR identified 5 corresponding import JCDS (5 items) with a statistical value of Sk 1 012 656.
The audit of the Sao SR at the relevant tax office showed the implementation of the declared imports and payment of VAT.
5. The company, whose business was, inter alia, the purchase of goods for resale and sale, production, installation and repair of electrical machinery and apparatus, reported in 2002 in the tax returns to the VAT export of goods worth 12 966 706 Czk.
According to the Czech Customs database, in 2002 the total value of exports was CZK 14,474,381.
The Sao submitted 17 export JCDS (59 items) with a total statistical value of CZK 2,975,122.
The Sao SR identified in the Customs database SR 13 JCD (50 items) with a statistical value of 3 621 370 Sk.
The SR Customs database failed to identify the corresponding import jcds to 4 export jcds (9 items) with a total statistical value of CZK 399,776.
The relevant tax office in SR has verified these imports with the tax entity.
The tax body, specified in the JCD as a importer in the SR, in the minutes of the local investigation expressed that the imports declared to the Czech export JCD not realized.
The Sao SR therefore requested the local competent tax authority to carry out a tax check on VAT and corporation tax for the tax years 2002 and 2003.
6. According to the Czech Customs database, the company involved in the import and sale of cigarettes exported tobacco stickers with a statistical value of CZK 7,338,199 in 2002 and a statistical value of CZK 12,228,545 in 2003.
In its VAT returns, the company did not report any exports in 2002 and 2003.
The SAO has selected 5 export JCDS (5 items) for verification, with a total statistical value of CZK 2,471,598.
To 4 export JCD (4 items) in the total statistical value of 2 246 860 Czk SAO SR identified in the customs tariff database SR 7 JCD (7 items) in the statistical value of 2 919 514 Sk.
The corresponding imports could not be attributed to the export JCD (1 item) at a statistical value of CZK 224,738 in the SR Customs database.
7. The software company did not declare exports of goods in its VAT returns for 2002 and 2003.
According to the Czech Customs database, the statistical value of exports of goods in 2002 and 2003 amounted to a total of CZK 1,630,198.
The Sao selected for verification in SR 9 JCD (9 items) for a total statistical value of 755 588 CZK.
In the Customs database SR Sao SR identified 8 JCD (8 items) in statistical value 915 601 Sk.
The corresponding imports could not be attributed to the export JCD (1 item) with a statistical value of CZK 68 286 in the SR Customs database.
In those cases, the corresponding imports to 6 JCDS with a statistical value of CZK 692 800 could not be identified in the SR Customs database.
Of which:
- 2 export JCD from tariff database of the CZECH republic in the statistical value of 293 024 Czk in the customs database, the SR failed to identify the corresponding import JCD (see points 6 and 7).
Due to a certain error rate in entering data in the customs database it was not possible to identify some of the registered imports, for example, in cases when we missed the name of the importer or it was a mistake in the tax identification number (hereinafter "TIN").
It is therefore not possible to conclude with certainty that those exports have not been implemented.
- imports corresponding to exports from the Czech Republic to the Czech Republic in a statistical value of CZK 399,776 have not been demonstrated to the 4 export JCDS from the Czech Customs database (see Section 5).
In these cases, there is reason to suspect fictitious export of goods for the purpose of unauthorized application of the VAT deduction.
5. Control of imports and exports of goods and services under the control of selected financial or tax authorities
5.1. Control sample
For the purpose of verifying the fulfilment of obligations of tax subjects in the imports and exports of goods and services and the evaluation of the level of cooperation between the financial and the customs authorities were on the audited financial, or tax offices selected writings of tax subjects according to the following criteria:
1. from the customs database of the CZECH republic and SLOVAKIA have been selected tax entities: a) with the highest volume of imports, b) with the highest amount of the assessed VAT, c) with the highest volume of exports,
2. tax entities were selected from the Register of financial and tax authorities according to the following: (a) VAT deductions applied on importation, (b) excess VAT deductions applied, (c) SpD refund entitlement, (d) VAT exemptions applied on export,
3. tax entities for which a tax inspection has been carried out.
Sampling was carried out regardless of the country of destination with a focus on risk commodities.
5.2. Control findings in the Czech Republic
An overview of imports into the Czech Republic and exports from the Czech Republic for risk commodities in 2002 and 2003 is presented in the table below:
5.2.1. Checking the selected sample at the tax authorities
The Sao focused mainly on the audited tax authorities:
- the procedure of the tax authorities for verifying the correctness of the VAT declared,
- cooperation between the tax authorities and the customs administration,
- comparison of data from the customs database with JCD in the financial offices focusing on the comparison of the declared value, the application of the correct VAT rates following the customs classification of goods or services, or. comparison of data on JCD and attached invoices with data in the Customs database,
- comparison of data from VAT returns on transactions effected and received from abroad with data in the JCD database at the tax authorities or in the Customs database,
- method of verification of the right to exemption from VAT when goods or services are exported abroad,
- comparison of the volume of exports of goods or services rendered in VAT returns with data from the Customs database.
Database JCD on tax offices contained records only of those imports and exports which create tax entities the obligation to indicate the import or export to tax returns.
The tax authorities audited examined the files of tax entities which reported imports totalling CZK 60,396,379 in VAT returns in 2002 and 2003 and corresponding VAT totalling CZK 12,644,052.
In addition, the files of tax entities reporting in the tax returns for the years 2002 and 2003 were checked for exports totaling 47 323 111 thousand rubles.
Tax entities for which imports and exports between the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic were examined carried out imports into the Czech Republic from the Czech Republic in 2002 and 2003 with a total VAT base of CZK 3,759,352, VAT of CZK 767,607 and exports from the Czech Republic to the Czech Republic with a total statistical value of CZK 1,989,090.
The differences found between the records in the JCD database at the tax authorities and in the Customs database of the Czech Republic were examined as follows:
- JCD items that were missing in the Customs database of the Czech Republic were requested directly at the Directorate-General of customs of the Czech Republic,
- for JCD items that were missing from the IRS database, it was verified that they were not cancelled documents,
- for items JCD, which they found to have different values between the customs databases of the CZECH republic and databases of tax offices, it was requested at the General directorate of customs of the CZECH republic the relevant JCD in written form, including accompanying invoices.
The examination found that the JCD database did not contain, for example, records of import JCDS with a total value of VAT of CZK 3,622 thousand and records of export jcds with a total statistical value of CZK 9,359 thousand.
5.2.1.1. Differences found
By comparing the database JCD on tax offices and the accumulated tax liability for the year 2002 and year 2003 in the VAT returns for the selected sample of tax entities were detected the following differences:
Differences in values were mainly due to:
- The time shift between the implementation of imports and the claim for deduction of VAT charged on importation of goods.
A tax entity can make a claim for deduction when goods are imported within 3 years from the end of the tax period, in which the release of the goods into the appropriate mode, or in the case of temporary importation, at the latest within 3 years from the end of the tax period in which the scheme was terminated.
- The time shift between the implementation of the export and the moment when the tax entity received the JCD.
The taxpayer was obliged to provide the data on realized exports exempt from the obligation to apply the output tax to the VAT tax return for the tax period in which goods withdrawn from the territory of the country, if at the same time a tax document, which was JCD.
- Failure to fulfil the obligations of tax entities in the reporting of imports and exports in VAT returns.
In some cases, tax entities did not provide the correct data on imports and exports in their VAT returns.
Since tax entities did not have to attach JCD lists to the VAT returns filed, the control of the right to deduct VAT or the exemption from VAT by the tax authorities was made more difficult.
5.2.2. Synergies between financial and customs authorities
During the period under review, the customs authorities decided to refund or waive import or export duties and VAT.
Tax bodies has a statutory duty to reduce the previously exercised the right to deduct VAT by the amount of tax returned by the customs office, and it in the tax return for the period in which the tax was refunded.
No legislation regulated the sending of information on changes in the amount of customs duties and VAT from customs offices to tax authorities.
Some controlled financial authorities, following information received, however irregularly or with a considerable time delay and only from certain customs offices.
One IRS supervisor did not receive this information at all.
If the irs has not received information about changes in the amount of customs duties and VAT directly from the customs office, did not have available the data necessary for checking the fulfilment of the legal obligations of tax subjects.
In 2002, the customs authorities returned VAT of more than £ 319m. CZK and in 2003 in excess of CZK 398 million. CZK.
Inspection results have pointed to persistent shortcomings in the activities of tax administrators, some of the system errors in the cooperation of tax authorities with the customs authorities, and the non-performance of certain obligations of payers making tax returns to VAT and SpD.
In the management of VAT and SpD, deficiencies have been identified in particular in the following areas:
a) when you cancel registration for VAT was the fulfilment of the obligations of the payers of the payment of VAT from the business property registered, or that should be registered to the date of cancellation of registration, for which the payer has applied tax deduction, examined only sporadically,
(B) the tax authorities have not consistently made use of the possibility of carrying out a tax inspection or a local investigation.
This resulted in in some cases inadequate verification of the legitimacy of the right to deduct VAT,
(c) the official records and the oral records did not contain all the necessary data showing the legitimacy of the excess VAT deductions applied,
(d) the tax authorities have not adequately verified imports and exports declared in VAT returns.
5.3. Control findings in SR
5.3.1. Checking the selected sample at the tax authorities
For the selected sample, the Sao SR verified or carried out a tax inspection for the tax years 2002 and 2003.
After analysis of the submitted tax returns and applications for refund of the tax for the selected tax subjects the SAO SR asked the tax office about ensuring the appropriate JCD, showing import and export invoices and documents on tax payment.
Subsequently, the SAO SR to check whether they are submitted by the JCD registered in the customs database of the imports and exports and the fulfilment of the decisive facts and the legal conditions for application of the deduction of input tax from the title imports, in the refund of excess VAT, in the application of the exemption from the title of the export and during the return of the SpD.
The SAO SR on the 10 controlled tax offices to verify the selected cases of imports and exports of goods between the SR and the CR, in the structure according to the tribute items JCD and the sum of the statistical values listed in the following table.
In total, imports of a statistical value of 856,2 million were checked. Sk, representing 5,11% of the total value of imports of selected commodities from the Czech Republic to the CF.
Exports of selected commodities were checked for a total statistical value of 176 million. Sk, which represents 6,87% of the total value of exports of selected commodities from the SR to the Czech Republic.
In addition, 618 cases of imports of other goods and services (mainly white equipment, packaging equipment and software) from the EU to the SR were checked, with a total statistical value of £ 532.8 m. Acts.
5.3.2. Synergies between tax and customs authorities
The Sao SR inspection at the tax authorities found irregularities between the data registered in the Customs database of the SR and the data reported in specific VAT returns, e.g.:
- 2 tax entities (physical persons) indicated in the tax returns, imports of goods in total value of 1 589 261 Sk, on the basis of which you apply entitled to a refund of excess VAT.
During local investigations carried out on the initiative of the SAO SR tax entities have failed to prove to the irs the legitimacy of the application of input tax relevant documents on the implementation of imports and payment of VAT,
- tax entity (s. r. o.) in the tax return for the tax period January 2003 declared adopted by the chargeable event, the value 77 of 167 576 Sk, exports of goods worth 18 006 041 Sk and applied to an excessive deduction of VAT in the amount of eur 17 157 101 Sk.
Of VAT tax returns filed for the year 2003 shows that the difference between the volume of purchase and export in the value of 59 161 535 Sk, which was created in January 2003, was during the year 2003 equalized.
In the abovementioned cases, the Sao SR asked the competent tax authorities to carry out a tax inspection of the excess VAT deductions applied.
- in another case, the tax entity (s.r. o.) for the Tax Period January to June 2002 indicated in the VAT tax returns the export of goods with a total value of CZK 87 199.
The verification in the Customs database of the SR found that the tax entity carried out exports in that period at a statistical value of Sk 296 747.
The tax office repeatedly carried out the local investigation at the headquarters of the company, and found that the company director (Uk citizen) traveled and the company abandoned the leased premises without termination of the lease in August 2002.
At the time of exercising the control of the Sao Sr, the tax administrator filed a notice to law enforcement agencies on suspicion of committing a crime of non-tax evasion.
Based on the results of the inspection at the selected tax authorities, the Sao SR notes that the biggest problems in the administration and control of VAT and the SpD occurred mainly in the following areas:
- use the options to conduct a tax audit of VAT on problematic tax bodies, in particular the application of high values of the excess VAT,
- the tax inspection protocols did not contain an inventory of the documents checked
- JCD on import and export of goods,
- inadequate screening of reported imports and exports of goods in tax returns,
- lengthy management support taxes when issuing the decision, in particular in the framework of the calculation procedure, even with the demise of the law on determining penalties,
- non-compliance with statutory conditions in the provision of deferral of payment of taxes,
- NONCOMPENSATION of VAT arrears within the time limit for reimbursement of excess VAT deduction,
- inadequate use of all forms of security and recovery of tax arrears.
On the basis of the examination of the identified shortcomings, the Sao SR asked the relevant tax authorities to carry out a VAT tax inspection, focusing on the legitimacy of the excess VAT deductions applied to 14 tax entities.
On all controlled tax offices have been taken measures to eliminate control deficiencies identified, the performance of which will be the SAO SR to monitor and control.
6. Conclusion
International cooperation has allowed the examination of the business transactions between business partners from both states and pointed out the deficiencies in the registration of imports and exports.
The result of the checks was further to identify persistent deficiencies in the performance of VAT and SpD obligations, in the activities of financial and tax authorities, in the system of cooperation and exchange of information between tax and customs authorities, which ultimately reduced the efficiency and effectiveness of tax controls.
The findings also revealed that the tax authorities in the Czech Republic have basic data on imports and exports from the Czech Customs database in the tax information system. In the SR there is no similar system of transmission of information on imports and exports of goods between the Customs and tax administrations.
The procedure for verifying the exercise of VAT management and the SPD was not identical in view of the different legislation and conditions in the territory of both states.
The Sao verified the necessary data from the information obtained with the customs administration of the Czech Republic and from the documents available at the audited tax authorities. The SAO SR verified the execution of business transactions from documents taxpayers requested by the tax authorities.
In case of detection of irregularities, he asked the tax authorities to carry out tax checks.
Made to a parallel control in the field of VAT and SpD assess the status of the administration of these taxes in the period prior to the entry into the European union and pointed out the necessity of further cooperation in this area.
Mutual cooperation will further deepen in controlling the activities of the financial or tax authorities in connection with the adoption of the new VAT law.
One of the new responsibilities associated with the delivery of goods to other member states of the European union's filing of a so-called recapitulative statement.
All VAT payers who have delivered goods to another member state to a person registered for VAT in another member state must submit this report.
Tax authorities are obliged to enter data from aggregate reports into the VIEs (VAT Information Exchange System) System, to which tax authorities from the member states of the European Union have access.
Financial, or tax authorities are then able to compare these data with the data specified in the submitted VAT returns.
This system is also used to verify the validity of VAT registrants, to verify the legitimacy of the VAT exemption applied when goods are delivered to another member state and to check the proper taxation of goods.
The implementation of parallel control actions has demonstrated the possibilities of cooperation between Sao and Sao SR.
The results of these control actions will be confronted with the outputs of the upcoming control actions, which inter alia will focus on the examination of the VIES, which is to prevent tax evasion in the so-called "intrakomunitárních supply".
Given the importance of VAT and SpD for the budget revenues is the need to control activities focus primarily on the monitoring and identification of risk areas in order to limit the scope for tax evasion on indirect taxes.

1. Introduction
Migration of the population belongs to phenomena that have a global character and became an integral part of the current development stage of the Czech republic and the Slovak republic.
Its cause is in particular the escape of the citizens from the country of origin or last permanent residence before persecution, in particular on grounds of racial, religious, ethnic, political, as well as from the consequences of military conflicts and ethnic cleansing.
Their goal is to obtain asylum and integration into society, especially in some of Europe's advanced democratic countries.
A large group is also formed by foreigners, whose reason for Migration is unfavorable economic and living conditions.
Migration is not a new phenomenon.
The determination of specific principles to help the refugees brought the adoption of the Geneva agreement of 1951 and new york protocol of 1967 relating to the status of refugees, whose acceptance of the governments of the signatory countries committed themselves to apply them in their foreign-policy orientation.
The Czech and Slovak Federative Republics ratified the New York protocol in 1991 and the Geneva Agreement in 1992.
The Czech republic and the Slovak republic after the split in 1993, declared its position on the refugee issue of the continuation in the implementation of adopted international documents and their binding force in the framework of the national legislation is confirmed by the legal act.
Both republics have enshrined asylum in their constitutional laws.
On the asylum process and related questions were aimed parallel checks by the Supreme audit office, Czech republic and Najvyšším kontrolným úradom of the Slovak republic, the results of which contains a common final report.
Cooperation between the supreme audit authorities of the two countries was implemented on the basis of the "Agreement on cooperation in inspection work" (hereinafter referred to as the "Agreement") closed in April 2004.
Both parties in the Treaty have undertaken to each other to provide information about the legislation governing asylum procedures in the state of the other contracting party, selected statistical data relating to the number of asylum seekers and the results of the asylum process, as well as information about the asylum facilities.
Trying to parallel control action was vytypovat identical problem areas and point out the consequences that this entails for the migration of the population.
Cooperation consisted in the unification of the programme of control actions, the exchange of information to the extent provided for in the Treaty and the drawing up of a joint final report on the outcome of the checks.
At the first joint meeting on 5.4. until 7.4.2004, the same headings of controlled issues and control procedures have been established in the preparation of control actions.
At the second meeting, which took place on 28.6. up to 30.6. 2004, the common points for the Control Action Programme have been specified.
At the third joint meeting held during the control action on 8.11. until 10.11.2004, there was an exchange of experience from ongoing checks.
Specify the forms of outputs from the controls and pre-determined structure and content of the joint final report, which was drawn up in the days of 14.2. up to 17.2. 2005 at the last joint meeting.
Checks were carried out in parallel between September 2004 and January 2005.
In the Czech Republic the inspections were carried out by the inspectors of the Department of Defense and security and selected territorial unions.
The persons controlled were the Ministry of Interior (hereinafter referred to as "MV") and the administration of refugee facilities of the Ministry of Interior (hereinafter referred to as "SUZ").
In the Slovak Republic, the Department of Defense, vnútra and štátnych úradov carried out inspections.
The audited body was the migration office of the Ministry of vnútra SR (hereinafter referred to as "MÚ").
The period under review was 2001, 2002 ,2003 (the period under review).

2. Recap of control results
2.1. Evaluation of control activities
The subject of parallel checks was: - asylum process, - asylum facilities, - management of state funds and property, - internal control system.
Mutual exchange of gained experience among the Supreme audit office, Czech republic and Najvyšším kontrolným úradom of the Slovak republic took place at the stage of preparation and implementation of the control actions.
This exchange has enabled more thoroughly evaluate the submitted documents, analyze the causes of the differences detected quality of the asylum process.
Thus, it was possible to focus on the decisive problems affecting the activity of asylum facilities.
Ultimately, this positively affected the quality of the performance of the control activity.
2.2. summary of control results
Harmonisation of asylum law in the Czech republic and the Slovak republic with documents of the European union (hereinafter "EU") was the subject of the evaluation reports of the European commission to the preparedness of both countries for accession to the EU.
The adoption of legislation governing this area continues after the entry of the two countries into the EU with a view to further harmonisation with EU law.
The number of asylum seekers in the Czech Republic increased significantly in 2001.
In the Slovak Republic, the number of applicants has a steadily increasing trend, with a significant increase in applicants in 2001.
The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic provide financial and material security for asylum seekers within the meaning of international agreements.
The state budget of both countries allocates the necessary funds for this purpose.
The amount of expenditure drawn from the state budget of both countries is affected especially by the number of applicants, duration of the asylum procedure the granting or refusal of asylum, and also the state of health of the applicants.
The amount of some levies collected is comparable in both countries.
The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic set up asylum facilities in which they gradually created suitable conditions for the stay of the parties to the asylum procedure.
Accommodation, meals, healthcare and basic material equipment and sanitary supplies are provided to asylum seekers during their stay.
At the same time, courses are organized in the framework of leisure activities, and applicants are created conditions for cultural and sports activities.
Asylum facilities include reception centres and residential centres, in the Czech Republic and integration centres.
The cost of one day of stay depends on the occupancy and amenities of the resort and is comparable in both countries.
In the Czech Republic, the capacity of asylum facilities is essentially stabilized.
In the Slovak Republic, it is expected to increase by almost 1,000 seats in the next two years.
The goal is to create conditions for the applicant, whose growing number is expected in subsequent years to continue in connection with the application of the Dublin convention.
In the Czech Republic, the highest part of the approved budget expenditure was spent on the provision of services. The crucial expenditure of this item, expenditure on accommodation and food of applicants in the asylum facilities operated on a contract basis, expenditure on health care provided to asylum seekers and the cost of a permanent security service providing protection of refuge facilities.
Salaries, payments for the work carried out and premiums also contributed significantly to the total expenditure.
In the Slovak republic were of budget management quality of migration policy and asylum process marked by the many budgetary measures that address the legitimate demands related to the increase in the number of asylum seekers.
Expenditure on Wages, Salaries and premiums, material and service expenses and expenditure on security services contributed decisively to the drawdown of current expenditure.
The results of the inspection in the Czech republic and in the Slovak republic have drawn attention to some of the similar weaknesses that had a major impact on financial management and management of state property.
It was about the shortcomings especially in the area of use of state budget funds contrary to the purpose for which they have been specified by the law on the state budget, when they were of the common expenses borne by the event having the character of technical improvements of tangible fixed assets.
The Inventory Accounting Act and the non-compliance with the accounting curriculum were also violated.
In the Czech Republic, minor deficiencies were found in the management of state property when it was left for use by another person without a contract.
Failure to comply with the deadline for reporting changes in the cadastre data violated the Land Registry Act, and leaving waste for disposal to a person who was not authorized for waste management, the Waste Act was violated.
In the Slovak republic were further identified shortcomings in the granting of disproportionately large advances on the collection of electricity and natural gas, weaknesses in procurement procedures and in the management of state property, when not sufficiently assured of his records and have not been shown the way of disposal of surplus assets.
The internal control system was ensured in the Czech republic and in the Slovak republic within the meaning of applicable generally binding legal regulations, which govern the method of implementation of financial control.
There were no deficiencies in the written documentation submitted.
The supreme audit office, Czech republic and Najvyšší kontrolný úrad Slovak republic despite some identified weaknesses, evaluates positively the procedure of RFA and MOO in the delivery of services to asylum seekers.
On the basis of the knowledge obtained in the course of inspection, the Supreme audit office, Czech republic and Najvyšší kontrolný úrad of the Slovak republic state that despite the significant increase in the number of asylum seekers in recent years the relevant departments of the two countries made the tasks associated with the care of asylum seekers at an appropriate level.
The evaluation shows that the system is functional and stable.
The results of the inspection were discussed with the interested statutory representatives of the relevant organizational bodies of the state on the Czech and Slovak sides.
Based on the results of the inspection, we recommend that positive methodological control experience be used in other joint control actions within the framework of international cooperation of the Supreme Audit Institutions.
3. Legislative framework
In the Czech republic and the Slovak republic is based on asylum law from the 1951 Geneva convention (Convention relating to the status of refugees and the associated new york protocol of 1967).
The first legislation was implemented by Act No. 498/1990 Coll. refugees.
In the Czech Republic it is from 1. 1. 2000 effective act no 325/1999 Coll. on asylum and Amending Act No. 83/1991 Coll., about the police of the Czech Republic.
This law has been amended five times in total (Act No. 2/2002 Coll., Act No. 217/2002 Coll., Act No. 320/2002 Coll., Act No. 519/2002 Coll. and act no 222/2003 Coll.).
Two more amendments to Act No. 325/1999 Coll are currently in the legislative process. asylum, and the adoption of other amendments will be bound to European legislation.
At the time of the formation of Law No. 325/1999 Coll. for asylum, the asylum area was part 3. EU pillars and asylum documents were political documents in terms of binding force.
Already in the framework of the adoption of this law, efforts have been made to make it as compatible as possible with EU law.
A significant change for asylum policy within the EU was the transfer of the asylum issue from 3. 1. pillars where asylum law has become part of community law since 1.5. 1999 under the Treaty of Amsterdam.
This shift caused the need to create appropriate legislation, i.e. to create legal instruments in the corresponding legal commitment.
The compatibility of Czech asylum law with EU documents has been the subject of regular European Commission evaluation reports.
Key community rules on asylum were adopted shortly before or after the Czech Republic's entry into the EU and their transposition period at the time of control of the Supreme Audit Office has not yet expired.
Once they are implemented into the Czech legal order, the Czech Republic will be obliged to notify the European Commission of the transposition.
In the Slovak republic the procedure of state bodies in the proceedings for refugee status and determine the duties of aliens who applied for refugee status or who was granted temporary asylum in the territory of the Slovak republic, established with effect from 1.1.1996, the law of the National council of the Slovak republic no. 283/1995 Of. z. the refugee.
Since 2003, the Refugee Act has been replaced by Law No. 480/2002 Z. of " asylum and amending and supplementing certain laws incorporating the harmonisation of the legislation of the Slovak Republic with council of Europe directive 2001/55 / EC of 20. 7. 2001 on minimum standards for giving temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons and on measures to promote a balance of efforts between member states in receiving such persons and endure the resulting consequences.
After two amendments to Law No. 480/2002 of the z., asylum, in 2003 and 2004, a third amendment was approved at the beginning of 2005, which entails further harmonisation of the law of the Slovak Republic with EU legislation on migration and asylum.
Its major elements are, for example, the determination of responsibilities for asylum seekers to attend for the duration of the stay in the integration centre course on the basics of the Slovak language, appointment of guardian courts for underage foreigners, if present on the territory of the Slovak republic without a legal representative, allowing applicants to enter into an employment relationship under certain circumstances, referred to in the amendment to the act.
Harmonisation of the law of the Slovak republic with EU law in the area of migration and asylum process was evaluated in regular reports to the European commission on the preparedness for the entry of the Slovak republic into the EU.
In 2002, the report highlighted the MU's lack of personnel capacity, which did not correspond to the increased number of asylum seekers.
4. Asylum process
In the Czech Republic since 1990, matters relating to refugees fall under the competence of the MV.
Effective from 1. 1. 1996 established the MV organizational branch of the state of SUZ. The reason was the separation of the performance of state administration in the field of asylum procedures, which is exercised through the department of asylum and migration policies MV, from the delivery of services to applicants for asylum.
SUZ's task is to provide accommodation, catering, health and other services to asylum seekers and asylum seekers for the MV.
In the Slovak republic performs the critical tasks in the field of asylum process of the MOO, and in particular in terms of financial and material-technical security of the asylum process to the extent defined by special regulations.
Priority tasks are issues related to the decision-making of asylum applications by foreigners in I. degree of administrative management and comprehensive operation of refuges in the field of accommodation, catering, health, financial and material security of applicants for asylum.
In addition, it prepares concepts for the migration policy of the state.
The results achieved in the area of the creation of the asylum system in the Slovak republic in recent years, significantly affected the cooperation and support from the Office of the UN High commissioner for refugees (hereinafter "UNHCR").
A particular benefit was his financial contribution to the reconstruction of the housing fund for asylum seekers.
The UNHCR has also co-financed social, cultural and sporting activities for applicants.
4.1. evolution of the number of asylum seekers and the results of the asylum process
The development of the number of asylum seekers in the Czech Republic is shown in the graph.
A significant increase occurred in 2001 due to the kosovo crisis and in 2003 reected the increased number of refugees from Chechnya.
An overview of the results of the asylum procedure in the Czech Republic is given in Table 1.
A total of 394 cases were granted asylum during the period under review, including 83 in 2001, 103 in 2002 and 208 in 2003.
A total of 22,731 cases were not granted asylum during the period under review and 22,636 cases were terminated.
Number of parties at 1.1. includes how a person, whom has not yet issued a decision, so you, which decision was not passed.
Furthermore there are included persons who have been excused from the missed period for appeal, or which was the previous decision is revoked and has not yet been exposed to the new.
In the Slovak Republic, the number of asylum seekers has a steadily growing trend.
If 96 applicants were registered in 1993, in 2003 it was already 10 358 people.
There was a significant increase in the number of applicants in 2001, when 8,131 applicants were registered, an increase of 423% compared to 2000, in which 1,556 people applied for asylum.
Data on the results of the asylum procedure in the Slovak Republic during the period under review are given in Table 2.
A total of 49 asylum seekers were granted during the period under review and their number did not exceed 0,22% of the registered number of applicants in each year.
Asylum was not granted in 860 cases.
The asylum procedure was halted in a total of 23,088 cases.
The bulk of the applicants, by staying outside the asylum facility without permission, voluntarily left the asylum procedure before its termination.
In 2002 it was more than 82% of the total number of registered applicants and in 2003, about more than 94% of persons.
The length of residence of one applicant in one of the asylum facility based on the average number of days was 13 days in 2001, 18 days in 2002, and 19 days in 2003.
From the findings WE also show that for the majority of applicants entering into the asylum procedure in the Slovak republic regards the search for better living conditions, i.e. the so-called economic migration, which is not reflected in the documents adopted by the international community, to which they applied and the Slovak republic.
In these cases, the asylum system is used for the purpose of the applicant.
An application for asylum based on economic reasons, such as finding employment or better living conditions, is not a reason for granting asylum.
Such an application should be under the provisions of § 12 ods. Point 1 (a) Act no 480/2002 Z. z. asylum seekers are assessed as manifestly unfounded and should be decided within 30 days.
Not yet formed the internationally recognized principles to identify the economic migrants, which would distinguish them from the applicants persecuted in their country of origin and which would allow to speed up the asylum process.
In view of the above it can be concluded that the Slovak republic is in terms of international migration, transit countries and target countries of migration were and remain the western european states.
The Czech republic and the Slovak republic after accession to the EU acceded to the Agreement determining the state responsible for examining applications for asylum lodged in one of the member states of the European communities (the Dublin convention).
The convention prevents multiple special-purpose applications for asylum in multiple EU states.
Applicants return to the country of first registration after positive identification in EURODAC.
The Slovak republic is a part of the exterior border of the EU countries, therefore, the application of the Dublin convention may have in the next period resulted in an increase in the number of applicants, which will be needed to create the conditions for residence in the Slovak republic until the decision of granting or not granting asylum.
4.2 drawdown of funds
The Czech republic and the Slovak republic are obliged in terms of international agreements and resulting national legislation to provide financial and material security of applicants for asylum.
The state budget of both countries allocates the necessary funds for this purpose.
The amount of expenditure drawn from the state budget is affected primarily by the number of applicants, duration of the asylum procedure until the final decision on the granting of asylum and also their state of health.
A growing number of people entering the asylum process has a direct impact on the higher drawdown the statutory allowances for the applicant, such as living expenses, pocket money, spending on the basic material, equipment, other material equipment and other social contributions.
The amount of some levies collected is comparable in both countries.
In the Czech Republic, during the controlled period, meals were CZK 58 per person per day, pocket money CZK 12 per person per day and CZK 6 per child under 15 years of age.
The cost of one asylum seeker per day of stay was on average CZK 351 in 2001, CZK 383 in 2002 and CZK 345 in 2003.
Outside allowances, asylum seekers staying in self-cooking resorts and those staying privately outside asylum facilities may be granted a contribution up to the subsistence minimum.
Act no 325/1999 Coll., on asylum, as amended, inter alia, admits in section 84 of the municipalities entitled to a contribution to cover the costs incurred in connection with the asylum facility in its territory.
The amount of the contribution was determined annually by the government's resolutions and during the period under review was CZK 7 per person and stay Day.
At the same time, municipalities are granted the right to a contribution to cover the non-investment costs of primary schools attended by asylum seekers.
The amount of the contribution was in a controlled period of 120 Czk per student and month, provided, that in any given month the attended the school for at least 10 days.
In the Slovak republic was in a controlled period of subsistence 70 Sk per person per day, an allowance of 12 Sk per person per day and 8 Sk on a child under 15 years of age.
The cost of one asylum seeker for one residential day were on average 442 Sk in 2001, 447 Sk in 2002 and 445 Sk in 2003.
The municipalities on whose territory the asylum facility is located comply with law no 480/2002 Z. z. about azyle, a contribution to partially cover the expenses that the village incurs in connection with the establishment and operation of the asylum facility.
So far, municipalities have only partially benefited from the possibility of applying for a contribution, which is set at Sk 1 500 per bed and calendar year.
National legislation in both countries for the issue of a decision on the asylum sets 90-day deadline from the start of the asylum proceedings, and at the same time admits, in justified cases, extend this period.
The most common reason for the extension of the asylum proceedings, which affects the amount of state budget expenditures, filing legal remedies against decisions on refusal of asylum.
In the Czech Republic, the highest number of final decisions were issued between 90 and 180 days (31.54%).
The second highest number was within 90 days of the date of application for asylum (17,61%).
In total, 73% of asylum procedures launched in 2001-2003 were finally decided within one year of their initiation.
Within two years of the opening of the procedure for granting asylum, 92% of asylum applications were final.
In the Slovak Republic, up to 90% of applicants who have not been granted asylum use the legal option of extending the period by bringing an appeal to court, according to MÚ data.
In some cases, extend for more than a year and the time of the power control were not proceedings in the court ended.
Some benefit in shortening the asylum procedure is expected from the establishment of joint departments of the MUNICIPAL and the Office of the hraničnej and cudzineckej police Policajného zboru in reception centres in Adam's-Gbeloch, Opatovskej New Village and in the Liptov Vlachoch, to which it acceded at the time of the exercise of control from 1.10.2004.
This is intended to simplify procedures and reduce the time limits for procedures between the two elements of the asylum process.
5. Asylum facilities
The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic set up asylum facilities in which they gradually created appropriate conditions for the provision of services to asylum seekers.
Accommodation, meals, healthcare, pocket money and basic material equipment and sanitary supplies are provided to asylum seekers during their stay.
At the same time, there are courses organized in the framework of leisure activities and applicants are created conditions for cultural and sports activities.
5.1 asylum facilities in the Czech Republic
The RFA manages and operates asylum facilities and is competent to manage state property in the grounds of the reception centre Vyšní Lhota, the admissions and residential centre Červený Újezd, residential centres Bělá-Jezová detention centre, a Stop at Brno, Kostelec nad Orlicí, Havířov, and in the objects of the integration asylum centres Jaroměř and Stop at Brno.
In early 2002, a reception centre was set up in transit prostom Prague-Ruzyne airport.
The RFA further ensures the operation of the asylum facility in Guard pod Ralskem, Patch, Bruntál, Zbysov and Kašavě, which are operated by a legal person on the basis of § 80 para. 3 of Act No. 325/1999 Coll., on asylum.
The total accommodation capacity of reception centres is 747 sites and the total accommodation capacity of residential centers is 1 of 977 seats.
Reception centres are closed facilities, which allowed asylum seekers to leave the pending implementation of the prescribed medical examination and basic receiving operations referred to in the act no. 325/1999 Sb. asylum seekers.
Violation of the obligation to reside in the reception center is assessed as an offense.
The residential centres to which asylum seekers come from reception centres are used to accommodate asylum seekers until the decision on their application for or not to grant asylum becomes legal.
Under certain conditions, asylum seekers are allowed to leave the resorts or reside in private.
Applicants for asylum are in reception and accommodation centres in which they are residing, the right to free accommodation, providing meals, other services and pocket money provided that the bore acts necessary to determine their financial and property ratios, and these ratios are such that from them can not be fair to ask for or partial payment of the listed services.
Integration asylum centres are used for temporary accommodation of persons who have been granted asylum.
Clients are at the centre accommodated on the basis of the accommodation contract, which is normally closed for 6 months with possibility of extension until is for them to manage to ensure adequate housing, or to ensure themselves in the framework of the state integration programme.
At the Integration Center, clients pay all the costs of accommodation and eat individually.
Persons with recognised refugee status have the same rights and obligations as Czech citizens, and have the same access to social security.
5.1.1. costs of asylum facilities
For comparison of asylum facilities, it was chosen as the best indicator of the amount of the cost of one physical stay Day.
It is based on the de facto number of persons who have actually been provided with services provided by asylum facilities on a daily basis.
In Table 3 and in the chart, Suz-operated facilities are designated as own and those operated by legal entities pursuant to Section 80 of Act No. 325/1999 Coll. asylum, as contractual.
The cost of a one-day stay at its own asylum facility operated by SUZ is falling as these facilities become increasingly crowded. The reason is that the fixed cost of running the premises is budgeted for more asylum seekers.
The amount of total costs incurred to provide services for asylum seekers is directly proportional to their increasing number.
In 2001 and 2003, asylum seekers were accommodated in crisis capacity in their own asylum facilities.
In the year 2003 was even to address the capacity crisis refuges, caused by the mass arrival of asylum seekers of chechen nationality of Poland, used the emergency accommodation capacity in residential containers (total 320 beds).
This capacity was provided by renting 80 residential and 6 sanitary containers.
The expenditure per applicant per day of stay was then lower in those years.
However, long-term maintenance of high fulfillment of these devices is not possible.
Account should be taken of the risks of an unexpected influx of refugees and The Associated requirement for the need for higher accommodation capacity.
At the same time, it is not possible to carry out some repairs, maintenance and investments with fully occupied accommodation capacity.
Form of shelter facilities operated by contracted allows, if necessary, the adoption of operational solutions in the field of capacities of refuges.
5.2 asylum facilities in the Slovak Republic
Asylum facilities are reception centers and residence centers.
The MÚ has in its administration reception centers Adamov-Gbely, Cornovce, Opatovská Nová Ves and the residence Center Brezová under Bradlom.
The total capacity of the reception centers is 470 seats, and the Residential Center is 100 seats.
A growing number of asylum seekers dealt with MOO the establishment of the residential centre in Gabčíkově in the leased premises of the Slovak technical university in Bratislava with a flexible disposable capacity from 250 to 940 jobs.
According to the concluded contract, the lease also provides for the provision of services related to the operation of the center.
In this form, the MU addressed the lack of its own staff.
The residential centre was also temporarily established in 2002 and 2003 in rented premises in Jazierciach with a capacity of 160 seats.
Reception centres had occupancy between 57% and 62% on average during the controlled period, while residential centres were between 33% and 50% on average.
Occupancy varied by season and was highest in the last months of the year, when he applied for asylum on the much larger number of applicants compared with other months of the year.
Further increase of accommodation capacity of about 450 seats will be possible after reconstruction of resorts in Opatovský nový Vsi and Vlachoch.
After the construction of the resort in Humennom in 2006, the number of seats will increase by another 550 people.
5.2.1. costs of asylum facilities
Data on the amount of the cost of operating asylum facilities are given in Table 4.
From their analysis it follows that the operation of the asylum facility by another entity, which will provide premises and ensure operation of the equipment, including related activities, is one of the options, how to secure a reasonable cost basis tasks resulting from the stay of applicants for asylum in the Slovak republic.
6. Management of state funds and assets
6.1 management analysis
In the Czech Republic, the approved budget expenditure of SUZ was increased by CZK 103,077 by 13 budget measures in 2001.
Of which 89 979 thousand rubles (87,29%) were assigned funds. The bulk was intended to address the consequences of the Kosovo crisis (CZK 44,538) and to provide healthcare to asylum seekers (CZK 38,870).
In 2002, SUZ's expenditure was increased by CZK 88,362.
Of these, CZK 62,282 (70,48%) were assigned funds, the bulk of which (CZK 53,200) was intended for healthcare provided to asylum seekers.
In 2003, SUZ expenditure was increased by a total of CZK 88,078 by fourteen budget measures.
Of which CZK 82,000 (93.09%) was assigned funds released from the general treasury.
The amount of CZK 51,000 was allocated to the health care provided to asylum seekers, CZK 24,000 to deal with the influx of Chechen refugees and CZK 7,000 to the humanitarian evacuation programme for the disabled people of the Republic of Iraq.
An overview of the drawdown of Suz expenditure collected during the audited period is given in Table 5.
From the above review it becomes clear that the highest part of the expenditure was spent on providing services.
The amount of expenditure spent on the purchase of services ranged from 37.07% to 38.23% of total expenditure.
Rozhorlujícími expenditure in this item, expenditure for accommodation and food of applicants in the asylum facilities operated on a contract basis, expenses for the medical care provided to asylum seekers and the cost of a permanent security service to ensuring security in the various asylum centres.
Salaries, payments for work done and insurance premiums (23.99% - 24.97%) contributed significantly to SUZ's total expenditure.
Last but not least, purchases of material (around 14%) contributed significantly to SUZ's total expenditure, with food purchases (7.61 % ? 9,83% of total expenditure).
In the Slovak republic was the budgetary management of the MUNICIPAL security migration policy and asylum process marked more by the budgetary measures that address the legitimate demands related to the increase in the number of asylum seekers.
For the proposal and a breakdown of the budget in the expenditure section was especially in the years 2001 and 2002 characterised by an imbalance between the demands of the MOO, which were based on the increase in the number of applicants for asylum and of the financing needs of their statutory claims, and provided resources primarily in the main category of current expenditure.
The manager of the budget chapter addressed disproportion over the course of the year with multiple budgetary measures, increasing the current expenditure limit by 41,8% in 2001 and up to 71,7% in 2002.
An overview of the drawdown of the expenditure collected by the MOA during the audited period is given in Table 6.
Expenditure on Wages, Salaries and premiums ranged from 24.47% to 30.51% and expenditure on materials and services ranged from 21.04% to 38.82% of total expenditure.
Spending on security services accounted for more than 10 per cent, and from 3.92 per cent to 7.20 per cent, spending on food purchases.
Spending on accommodation and catering services accounted for another significant proportion, ranging from 10.82% to 26.96%.
Capital expenditure accounted for a relatively low share in the range from 1.03% to 6.25%.
6.2 deficiencies identified
The results of the inspection in the Czech republic and the Slovak republic have pointed to some similar deficiencies, which did not have a major impact on the management of funds and property of the state.
It was about the shortcomings in particular in the following areas: a) the use of state budget funds in contravention with the purpose for which they were intended by the law on the state budget, when they were of the common expenses borne by the event having the character of technical improvements of tangible fixed assets; b) violation of the act on accounting in the field of inventories and in non-indicative chart of accounts.
In the Czech Republic, minor deficiencies were found in the management of state property, when it was left for use by another person without a proper contract; failure to comply with the deadline for reporting changes in cadastre data violated the Land Registry Act; leaving waste for disposal to a person who was not authorized to waste was violated the Waste Act.
In the Slovak republic were further identified shortcomings in the granting of disproportionately large advances on the collection of electricity and natural gas, weaknesses in procurement procedures and in the management of state property, when not sufficiently assured of his records and have not been shown the way of disposal of surplus assets.
7. Internal control system
In the Czech Republic he was at SUZ on 1.7. 2002 introduced an internal control system within the meaning of law no 320/2001 Coll., financial control, defining the competences of the individual employees responsible for conducting preliminary, interim and subsequent checks.
At the same time, an internal audit system was introduced and an internal Suz auditor was appointed.
Each year the RFA published the plan of financial, social and operational and technical controls aimed at comprehensive verification of finances and the property of the state in the various asylum centres managed by the RFA.
In 2002, 42 management checks were carried out and 54 were carried out in 2003.
In the Slovak republic direct the performance of audit work in departments and organizations of the Ministry of interior of the Slovak republic from the point of view of compliance with the generally binding legal regulations and internal regulations ensures the Office of the control of the minister.
During the period under scrutiny, the performance of tasks in the asylum policy section was not checked.
The internal control system of the MU is mainly aimed at carrying out preliminary and ongoing financial control under law no 502/2001 Z. z. about financial control and vnutornom audite.
The exercise of financial control is also regulated by the internal rules of the director of the MOA.
The substantive focus of the control activities as part of the management of the various departments was established under the annual mo plan.
Responsible for the performance of control in this area were appointed directors of unions.
According to the written documentation submitted, there were no deficiencies.
Since the period of application of the Order of the Ministry of internal affairs of the Slovak Republic No. 28 of 23. 4. 2004 is obliged to handle and investigate complaints under the complaints act.
Organizational security of this task will need to be resolved in the near term.
Communique
This report has been prepared in Czech, English and Slovak language and signed by the vice president of the Supreme audit office and the chairman of the Najvyššieho kontrolného office of the Slovak republic.
Joint report on parallel checks on expenditure on the construction of the Prague – Dresden motorway
Introductory word
Without the existence of trans-European transport networks, a modern, dynamic and, above all, united Europe would be hard to imagine.
Quality transport networks are a necessary condition for maintaining and increasing the standard of living of Europeans.
Creating the conditions for rapid, secure, reliable and cheap transportation of persons and costs is an important task for the state administration.
It is a very demanding task, both organizational and technical, and financially.
European efforts for sustainable mobility often and hardly seek compromises with Europe's interest in maintaining a healthy and Human Environment.
Construction of transport infrastructure, even through the necessary measures for the benefit of the environment, is financially demanding.
Considered the procedures and decisions of the state administration in the preparation and acquisition of the road construction may bring significant savings of public financial resources, which can be for the benefit of citizens to use otherwise.
One of the tasks of audit institutions is to actively search for flaws, which led to a lower than achievable economy, efficiency and effectiveness of expenditure on the construction of transport infrastructure.
Audit institutions should not only highlight the identified shortcomings, but recommend measures that will lead to improvements in the state, for the benefit of the Citizens, for the benefit of Europe.
Short summary
Two of the supreme audit institution of the Federal republic of Germany and the Czech republic (hereinafter referred to as GERMANY and the CZECH republic) Bundesrechnungshof (hereinafter referred to as "BRH") and the Supreme audit office (hereinafter "SAO") carried out in 2005 and 2006, parallel control of expenditure on the construction of the motorway Prague – Dresden (highway D 8 in the CZECH republic and the highway And 17 in GERMANY).
The highways are connected by a border bridge, which is co-financed by both countries.
Thanks to cooperation with the Sao, BRH was able to conduct a thorough check on the effectiveness of the funds spent on the construction of the border bridge.
On the basis of close cooperation with the BRH, the Sao obtained the necessary data on the amount of German costs for bridges and tunnels for comparative purposes.
The Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany concluded a contract for the construction of the border bridge in 2000.
According to the construction process, the completion date was finally scheduled for the end of 2006.
However, during the award of the contract, the Directorate of roads and motorways of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as "RSD") made errors that led to an extension of the competition period and a shortening of the construction time.
Thus, the contract with the contractor was signed later than expected.
The contractor agreed to build the bridge in a shorter time and ensure its completion in 2006.
As a result, however, the RSD had to accept a significant increase in the price of the bridge.
In the context of joint inspection of the work compared the prices of bridges on the highways D 8 and 17, and on the basis of per m2 area of bridge construction.
Statistical analysis of prices made it possible to identify bridges with high cost per m2 of area.
Analysis revealed that the border bridge was the most expensive bridge in a group of large bridges with a length of over 100 meters.
The price increase could also be attributed to the delay that occurred during the procurement procedure.
When analyzing the cost of building tunnels, inspectors found that the prices of tunnels on Highway D 8 are significantly higher than those of comparable tunnels in Germany.
The BRH and the Sao now have a database of prices for bridges and tunnels on which they will be able to rely in future efficiency checks of the means used for transport infrastructure purposes.
To the construction of bridges the two control institutions recommend: the standardization of the construction of bridges and the use of composite steel-concrete and special structures only in cases when they are not prestressed reinforced concrete bridges adequate.
Among the main signs of cooperation was her team spirit and informality.
In the course of parallel control, the controllers participated in their specific knowledge and skills.
Introduction
This report informs on the progress and results of the parallel controls of the funds spent on the construction of the highway connecting Dresden and Prague (D 8 in the CZECH republic and 17 in GERMANY).
The checks were aimed at the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the expenditure incurred.
Parallel checks were carried out by the BRH in Germany and the SAO in the Czech Republic.
Parallel checks took place in 2005 and 2006.
NKU controlled the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of expenditure in the amount of approximately 20 billion Rubles including VAT (approximately € 690 million €) on the border section of the highway D 8, which has a number 0807.
Of this amount, € 64 million from European funds (ISPA) was to be used as planned.
In addition to the parallel inspection carried out together with the Sao, BRH checked the preparation and construction of the highway a 17 in 2003 and 2005.
The funds spent on the construction of all three sections of the highway and 17 amounted to around € 670 million, of which € 277 million will be co-financed by European funds (EFRE).
The highway from Prague to Dresden is part of the Trans-European Transport Corridor IV. Dresden – central and southern part of Eastern Europe-Istanbul.
Highway D 8 runs from Prague through the mouth above the Elbe at the state border.
Highway a 17 runs from the state border of the Czech Republic/Germany to Dresden.
At the time of the inspection, the border sections of both highways were under construction.
These sections were put into operation 21. December 2006.
On the German side is so of the highway completed to Dresden, while on the Czech side of the highway D 8 finished not, because of section no. 0805 in the length of 16,4 km through the Czech central mountains between Řehlovicemi and Lovosicemi is still in the preparatory stage.
Under the plan section no. 0805 between Prague and Ústí nad Labem browse the protected landscape area České středohoří.
According to the projections made in the CZECH republic in 2001 should be in 2008 at the border section no. 0807 highway D 8 the intensity of the operation 22 940 vehicles per day.
According to German forecasts, in 2010 the intensity of traffic at the Czech border will be about 25 000 vehicles per day.
GERMANY and the CZECH republic have concluded in the year 2000, the Treaty between the Federal republic of Germany and the Czech republic, linking the German highway And 17 and the Czech motorway D 8 on the common state border through the construction of the frontier bridge.
On the construction of the bridge involved in both states, therefore, was to control the construction of this bridge, an important aspect of parallel controls carried out by the two audit institutions.
Cooperation between the BRH and the Sao
Since mid-2005, the two Supreme Audit Institutions have negotiated close cooperation in the control of the construction of the motorway connecting Prague and Dresden.
Both sides had serious reasons for such cooperation:
1.
Germany is financially involved in the construction of the border bridge.
Its planning and construction rests on HSD.
Therefore, the BRH itself did not have the opportunity to conduct a check on this construction project.
2.
The Sao did not have the comparative database needed to assess whether the funds were used economically in relation to the overall cost level of bridges and tunnels on D 8.
3.
NKU needed to make sure about the effectiveness of the expenditure, taking into account the main technical parameters of the highway, in particular the arrangement of the bridges and tunnels that would be on both sides of the border should allow the same ride quality.
After the preparatory negotiations was on 4. January 2006 signed by the presidents of both supreme audit institutions agreement on coordinated inspection of Highway D 8 / a 17.
The joint working meetings of the BRH and Sao controllers took place throughout 2006 at an interval of approximately six to eight weeks.
The negotiations will address the current problems and challenges, in particular the preparation of a uniform methodology to control prices of bridges and tunnels, exchange findings from the inspections of the construction of the frontier bridge and the preparation of joint reports.
An important feature of cooperation was the ongoing exchange of information.
While BRH was doing most of the work on the comparison of the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels and the procurement procedure, the SAO for the most part prepared a methodology to control prices of bridges and tunnels.
The applicable legal standards for control in the state administration differ in the way in which control actions are concluded in both countries.
For these reasons, both the supreme audit institutions draw up their own inspection conclusions about their findings obtained during their inspections.
This report reflects the results achieved in parallel controls.
The cooperation will be completed by signing the final communiqué in the first half of 2007.
Construction of the border bridge
The Czech republic and the Federal republic of Germany in the treaty of 2000, agreed on the date of completion of the construction of the frontier bridge referred to options in 2005.
The two sides then agreed to postpone that deadline until the end of 2006.
As an investor, HSD worked.
Germany is financially involved in the construction of the bridge from 42.13 %.
In the period up to 1999, the RSD proposed that the border bridge should have a pre-tensioned reinforced concrete structure.
In 1999, in agreement with its partners in Germany, the CSD agreed to a coupled steel-concrete structure.
This decision was justified by a reduction in the number of double pillars from seven to five and the subsequent environmental benefit of such a solution for the valley.
In addition, the comparative calculations made by HSD indicated that the coupled steel-concrete structure should be a less expensive option.
But there was a mistake in the calculations.
It said The New coupled steel-concrete structure would be only 397 m long.
In fact, it is 5% longer.
During the award of the border bridge contract, RSD made serious errors.
Prepared custom documentation that would adequately describe the assessment criteria and sub-criteria for comparing tenders.
This error led to the assessment and Evaluation Commission and the director-general evaluating tenders in a subjectively and problematic manner.
The unsuccessful bidder challenged the results of the procurement procedure.
The subsequent investigation by the competition authority led to the conclusion that the contract for the award of the construction contract was signed later than initially calculated.
This meant that the summer construction season 2004 after the evaluation of the offers was wasted and the time reserved for construction was shortened.
The construction company agreed to build the bridge in less time, but at the cost of a substantial increase in costs.
The offered procedure included a double installation of the bridge upper, a change in the design of the pillars and the establishment and equipment of the mounting premises.
In addition, the construction company was not able to acquire the originally designed type of steel within the necessary deadline.
A new type of steel – for a higher price by about 4 million €, that had to fully pay the RMD – enabled shortening the period for execution of corrosion protection, which subsequently reduced the total time of the construction of the frontier bridge.
Compared to the net price of € 18,3 million offered in the tender, the total cost of the construction of the border bridge as a result of the accelerated procedure and other financing adjustments will increase considerably.
The reduced time reserved for construction work led to a price increase of about €5.9 million.
At present, the net cost is around € 25.9 million, without taking into account automatic price increases (as of October 2006).
Comparison of bridge and tunnel prices
Both the supreme audit institutions carry out an analysis of the prices of bridges on the highways D 8 and 17 in order to identify bridges whose price was too high, and compare prices of bridges on the German and Czech side.
The analysis was based on methods of Mathematical Statistics.
In addition, tunnels on D 8 were compared with similar tunnels on highways in Germany (a 71, a 38 and a 4).
There are no similar tunnels on the highway and 17.
In preparing this part of the inspection, it was important to accurately identify the relevant prices.
Both the supreme audit institution for a comparison of the prices of bridges have laid down the following principles: be based on the actual price paid for the bridge without the value added tax (VAT rates in the CZECH republic and the SNR varies and is subject to change); not to take into account the prices for the special foundations of the bridge; converted at the prices in Czk into € according to the rates of the European central bank in force on 30. 12. 2005 (CZK 29 = € 1).
On D 8 And 17 occur bridges of various structures (steel-concrete, prestressed reinforced concrete, composite steel-concrete and steel) and different sizes.
In order to ensure the homogeneity of the structures examined, bridges were divided into groups according to the type of construction.
Within these groups, the size of the bridge was also taken into account in the analyses.
By far the most common type of construction were concrete bridges on both sides of the border (20 bridges on D 8, 36 bridges on and 17).
The analysis focused mainly on this group of bridges, since the numeracy of the set made it possible to use mathematical-statistical methods with a high degree of reliability of results.
Checks revealed that the prices for m 2 concrete bridges on the D 8 And 17 depends on the size of the bridge (its length, area): the bigger the bridge, the lower the price per m2 of bridge construction.
For German bridges, the price dependence on size was stronger than for Czech ones (see charts below).
Two concrete bridges on a 17 and four on D 8 were identified, the price of which is significantly higher.
To find these bridges was used both method enabling the detection of atypical values in the file numbers, the first regression analysis, taking into account the dependence of the price of the bridge on its size (to determine the atypically expensive bridges is the standard distance from regression curves upwards).
Information about the atypically high price of those bridges should, however, be regarded only as an indicator that bridges need to focus.
In order to draw a generally applicable conclusion, the causes of the high price in each identified case should be analyzed.
One such cause may be inefficient administrative measures or environmental requirements or other acceptable reasons.
With regard to the Czech concrete bridges are on average longer than German (see table below), demonstrated a negative dependence of the price of the bridge to its length could lead to the assumption that the Czech bridges should be cheaper.
The hypothesis of lower prices for Czech concrete bridges is also supported by lower labor costs in the construction industry in the Czech Republic compared to Germany.
However, the results of the analysis, on the contrary, show that the prices for concrete bridges on D 8 are higher than on a 17.
In the course of joint negotiations, two possible causes of this condition were identified:
1.
In Germany, most bridges are awarded as separate contracts.
Such an award allows small and medium-sized regional companies to participate in the competition for the contract.
In the Czech Republic, many bridges are awarded as part of the contract for the part of the highway route, which is several kilometers long.
Small and medium-sized companies do not participate in such a competition, because the contract is too large for them.
2.
In the Czech Republic there is more variability in the construction of bridges than in Germany.
In this connection, the Sao found that the type of construction of the bridge is decided long before its construction.
The decision shall be taken at the time when the RSD translates the application for a territorial decision.
RSD at this time selects bridge types from multiple variants, but economy plays a smaller role in decision making.
A general conclusion on the prices of bridges in the Czech Republic and Germany could only be reached on the basis of a thorough analysis of the construction market in both countries, but would go beyond this control action.
The border bridge is the most expensive coupled steel-concrete bridge on D 8 A and 17.
In the case of tunnels, it was found that the prices of tunnels on D 8 are twice that of tunnels in Germany.
However, the comparison of the main construction-technical parameters of tunnels on D 8 with tunnels in Germany showed no significant difference.
Significant price differences could be attributed to the fact that there is no real competition in the field of tunnel construction in the Czech Republic.
However, a small number of tunnels did not allow to draw generally applicable conclusions.
Efficiency and efficiency of Dresden motorway construction-Prague
A separate Czech Republic was created in 1993.
The government in the same year approved the concept of development of the highway network.
The D 8 motorway was to be gradually extended from Prague to the state border with Germany.
Section no 0805 via české městohoří was to be acquired earlier than Section no 0807.
The Czech Republic procures Highway D 8 as part of programming financing.
In programme no. 327 220 "Construction of highway D 8 Prague – Ústí nad Labem – state border CR/FRG" were identified as two objectives of the construction of highway D 8:
1.
improve the connection of Prague and the mouth above the Elbe-national objective;
2.
improve the connection between Prague and Berlin within IV. the Trans – European Transport Corridor Berlin – Istanbul-an international destination.
According to the programme, the construction of the section leading through the Czech central mountains was to be completed in June 2008 and the construction of the border section no 0807 in June 2007.
Here it is necessary to add that the term of completion is not identical to the date of commissioning.
The Sao found that the preparation of the construction of the section leading through the Czech central mountains is now at the stage of an official territorial decision.
Environmental activists have challenged the decision with lawsuits.
There is no final decision on the actions.
Therefore it cannot be excluded that the stretch leading through the Czech central mountains will be completed several years later than stated in the program documentation.
In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed to postpone the completion date of Section no 0805 for 2010.
As a result of these facts, the construction of the border section did not achieve the national objective – improving the connection between Prague and the outhouse above the Elbe.
RSD carried out an estimate of capital expenditure for border Section D 8 no 0807 and Section 0805 through the Czech central mountains between 1999 and 2001.
The estimate for these capital expenditure included in the investment costs is around € 639 million combined for both sections no 0805 and no 0807.
Table 2: Economic Assessment results (EIRR = internal rate of return)
All motorways and speedways under consideration opened, both sections D 8 opened in 2007.
On the northern part of the border section traffic intensity 18 000 vehicles a day in 2010
All motorways and speedways under consideration opened, both sections D 8 opened in 2007.
On the northern part of the border section traffic intensity 22,000 vehicles a day in 2010
All motorways and speedways under consideration opened, both sections D 8 opened in 2007.
On the northern part of the border section traffic intensity 25 000 vehicles a day in 2010
Economic analysis carried out in 2001 was based on the assumption that the border stretch and stretch through the Czech central mountains will be completed in a timely manner.
However, at the time of the inspection it is clear that the section through the Czech central mountains will not be opened at the original date.
This will reduce the above EIRR values.
Cost of both sections excluding VAT, calculated at 31. 12. 2005, there were 897 million €, i.e. higher by 27.4% than the level of costs, which worked economic analysis in 2001.
But there is a risk that section 0805 will be run on another, more expensive route, which would affect the aforementioned boundary of economic viability.
Economic analysis showed that the construction of both sections of the highway is economically viable at an intensity of at least 18,000 vehicles per day in 2010.
The forecast for 2008 was 22,940 vehicles, but the study addressing the issue of roundtrips for the missing section across the Czech central mountains foresees an intensity of 12,600 to 13,750 vehicles per day, which pushes the investment below the limit of economic viability.
At higher load detour routes for the missing stretch through the Czech central mountains there is a high probability of congestion, and thus increase the external costs, which was not foreseen when the original economic analysis.
The abovementioned reduction in revenues and cost increases means that the already low EIRR that the construction of border section D 8 should have had will not be achieved.
Construction of the D 8 border section is therefore inefficient.
There were also similar cost overruns in the construction of Highway a 17 as in the case of these two sections on D 8.
As part of the overall economic assessment of the Federal Road Development Plan for long-distance transport for 1992, the Federal Ministry of transport of Germany calculated the cost of about €320 million.
The resulting cost-income ratio was then 4.6.
In the meantime, however, costs have soared to around € 670 million and the cost-income ratio has more than halved.
In addition to the parallel inspection carried out together with the SAO, the BRH checked in 2003 and 2005 the preparation and construction of Highway a 17.
BRH while found that the approval of the state authority demanded for the third section 17-terrain tunnel, which was not needed.
During the inspection, the BRH managed to convince the Federal Ministry and the German administration for the construction of roads that the tunnel was not necessary.
The result was savings of around € 10 million on construction costs alone and € 0.15 million on annual operating costs.
When assessing the first section a 17 BRH, he found that the construction project was not properly prepared.
This is evidenced by the following example:
In the pre-trial stage did not carry out management for the construction of roads, survey conditions, the bedrock in the rocks Dölzschen, because the site was difficult to access.
The latter was carried out only after the tunnel stamping machine hit the rock.
Tests showed the rocks were more weathered inside than expected during the tender process.
Therefore, had to be taken costly measures such as anchoring, grouting and protective nets against falling rocks, which claimed about 3.3 million €.
The road and motorway directorate had to bear the costs not only to other emergency operations such as security measures in the rocks Dölzschen, but also measures that would not have been necessary, if he was a construction project is first properly prepared.
Expenses of this kind include the costs associated with the interruption of construction operations (3.2 million €), additional training of personnel for drilling (0.5 million €) and rising wages and spending on goods as a result of exceeding the duration of the project (7 million €).
The cost overruns thus amounted to around € 10.7 million, which was not matched by any added value.
On the basis of lessons learned from this and other projects audited have asked BRH federal ministry, to apply more strict guidance in his supervision of the works on the construction of roads.
In doing so, the Federal Ministry should give the roads and motorways directorates the necessary incentive to implement quality assurance systems.
The benefits of cooperation for the BRH and Sao cooperation fulfilled the intention of the two audit institutions.
BRH has acquired control knowledge of the preparation, assignment and course of the construction of the border bridge.
The two Supreme Audit Institutions have built a database of prices for bridges and tunnels on which future checks will be based.
The Sao found that the main building-technical parameters of bridges, tunnels and the route of the D 8 motorway do not differ from the parameters and 17.
Officers of both institutions involved in the cooperation gained new experience, which they can use in other controls.

Coordinated control of funding for projects implemented under the Operational Programme of cross-border cooperation Czech Republic-Poland 2007-2013
INTRODUCTION
Europe's emerging community is a driving force for cross-border cooperation as an integral part of the broader territorial cooperation that has been a part of our lives for the past 20 years.
So let this community give an introductory statement to this joint report by the two Supreme Audit Institutions of neighbouring countries:
"185 million EU citizens (that is, 37% of the population) live in border areas.
These areas are usually underdeveloped and marginal territories, often a relic of darker parts of Europe's history.
The main objective of cross-border cooperation is helping to alleviate the existence of borders as administrative, legal and physical barriers and to further help the development of the slumbering potential of the border regions.
The programmes cover different border regions: some cover coastal areas, other inland borders within the EU or borders shared with candidate countries.
Most programs are bilateral, but some include more than two neighboring countries.“
The programmes last seven years and are allocated a total of EUR 5.7 billion from the EU budget.
"Programs include the following activities: repair and reconstruction of cross-border roads, bike paths and bridges, investment in cross-border waste systems, medical facilities, research centres, anti-flood measures, etc., joint management of natural sites or the development of tourist destinations, development of joint services for the local population, advising on matters of employment, the creation of thematic networks and clusters for innovation.
Support from the programme shall be granted on condition that organisations from both sides of the border (such as regional authorities, universities or SMEs) join together to implement projects based on the needs of the border region.
Representatives of the cooperating regions, the relevant ministries and other local partners to meet regularly and decide, which projects will be supported.
This system should lead to a sustainable form of cooperation even after the programme itself ends.
Funds are granted with the condition that the project partners from both sides of the border cooperate in a way that fulfills at least two of the following four characters: joint development, joint implementation, joint personnel, joint financing.“
In the framework of the partnership are the tasks and the responsibility for the preparation, implementation, financing and control of the activities of the project clearly defined and distributed to relevant partners.
Among the main attributes of partnership include: the common choice of a leading partner, joint project preparation and application, the conclusion of the joint partnership agreement signed by all the partners, taking overall responsibility for the implementation of the project the lead partner, the total payment of the support receives the head of the partner and implementing their transfer to the competent partners of the project.
Eligible projects carried out in the territory of the regions and the Voivodeship adjacent to the common border may be supported.
OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE OF CONTROL
11. December 2007 approved by the European commission (EC) Operational programme of cross border cooperation Czech republic – republic of Poland 2007-2013 (op cbc CR–POL).
€258,187,467 were earmarked for the implementation of the Operational Programme.
The total included a contribution from the European funds (ERDF) totalling € 219,459,344 (85 %), which must be exhausted by the end of 2015.
Financial data on the use of EU funds from the Operational Programme of cross – border cooperation Czech Republic-Poland 2007-2013 at the end of 2013 are presented in the table below:
The cooperation agreement between the Supreme Audit Institutions of the Czech Republic (Sao) and the Republic of Poland (NIK) was concluded by the presidents of both offices on 27. February 2013 after the previous mutual negotiations at the meeting of the heads of the supreme audit institutions of the Visegrad four, Austria and Slovenia, which took place in September 2012 in Lovasberény, Hungary.
The aim of cooperation was to examine whether the implementation of the operational programme takes place in accordance with the legislation and with the binding programming documents or agreements, whether management and control system works reliably, whether they are achieved the objectives of the operational programme and whether the selected projects are implemented in accordance with the terms of the support provided.
This cooperation took the form of a parallel control in which the control authorities on the basis of its legal mandate to independently examine the topics, the content of which was in advance jointly discussed.

The audit carried out also contained elements of the performance audit.
The selected topics were examined on a sample of projects by project partners on both sides of the border.
As a result of the checks carried out, the control conclusions published in the usual way by both authorities were published.
On the basis of the two control conclusions set out in the annex, this joint report was established.
The joint control sample selected included six projects (Annex 1) which fall under aid area 1.1 – strengthening transport accessibility and aid area 2.2 – promoting tourism development.
Before starting the checks represented a disbursement of funds from these two areas of support more than 60% of the funds reimbursed to the beneficiaries by the end of 2012 from the ERDF for all projects implemented in the framework of the entire op cbc CR–POL.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In addition to checking the joint sample of six projects, the SAO has checked 13 more projects and two more (all from support 1.1 and 2.2).
The funds paid to the beneficiaries of the ERDF, which were controlled by the SAO and NIK, amounted to a total of € 25,362,174 (Sao) and € 8,450,784 (NIK).
The controlled volume of appropriations represented 41% of all appropriations paid to aid beneficiaries in the aid areas 1.1 and 2.2.
MAIN CONTROL CONCLUSIONS
The two checks, independently carried out by the SAO on the Czech side, and NIK on the Polish side showed that the level of identified irregularities did not exceed the level of significance.
The implementation of the OPPS CR-POL, involving the operation of the management and control system and the implementation of selected projects, was successful.
Controlled entities, which were part of the management and control system, take steps to limit the risk of improper use of funds and underutilization of the resources granted from the ERDF.
Evidence of the effectiveness of the implemented projects in the framework of the operational programme is the high level objectives set, which has been supported by the results of the survey of social assessment of the implementation of projects.
SUMMARY OF CONTROL RESULTS
And. Evaluation of the management and control system
The coordinated approach allowed to perform the control of the management and control system applicable to the op cbc CR–POL embedded in the following institutions in both countries: the managing authority (the Ministry for regional development of the CZECH republic), national coordinator (Ministry for regional development POL) and supervisors (Center for regional development and the voivodship).
At the same time, a coordinated audit made it possible to evaluate the tasks and functions carried out by the Joint Technical Secretariat and the monitoring committee.
During the evaluation of the control system to the inspection focused on the activities carried out in connection with the setup and performance of the functions of the managing authority and the national coordinator, in particular in connection with the setting of programme objectives and monitoring of progress, evaluation of activities and annual reports, assessment, evaluation, selection and approval of project applications, the uptake of the programme and fulfilment of obligations to publish accurate, complete and current information about subsidies, further with the control activities of the managing authority, setting the performance of the activities and outputs of the audits of the designated audit body and the system for reporting and monitoring irregularities and his compliance with, at the same time was investigated the coordination of tasks and cooperation between institutions involved in the op cbc CR–POL.
Furthermore, it was investigated the activity of the competent authorities in the field of risk analysis and drawing up control plans in place implementation of the projects and reviewed the evaluation of project applications carried out by independent evaluators.
Examination of the control system included a review of the administrative checks and inspections carried out on the spot, which allowed for the approval of e.g. the supply of goods and co-funded services, the eligibility of expenses submitted for payment and at the same time, the compliance of the disbursement of these funds, and related activities (or their parts) with the national legislation and EU legislation.
Significant shortcomings were identified by the Sao's control in the field of publishing correct, complete and up-to-date information on the subsidies provided.
The risk of non-transparency of this process has been identified in the field of Project Evaluation and approval.
Other deficiencies have been identified in the monitoring indicator settings and in the irregularity Reporting System Settings.
Based on these findings, assessed, the Supreme audit office control and the control system implemented by the managing authority as partially effective.
Discrepancies identified NICHES, which were related to the functioning of the management and control system in Poland in relation to violations of the applicable laws and rules, have not been assessed as significant.
The said irregularities had an impact only on individual projects and has not had a significant impact on the implementation of the op cbc CR–POL.
Despite the discrepancies identified, NIK evaluated the functioning of the system positively.
B. Evaluation of project results
The control did not show a discrepancy between the indicators and objectives set for each project and those defined by the Operational Programme.
In all the projects examined have achieved the expected results, the funded activities have been implemented and have been met indicators (measurable parameters) set out in the project applications operational programme.
The control conclusions are in line with the result of the social evaluation survey of project implementation described in the text below.
An important aspect, which the SAO and NIK pay attention to in its conclusions, is the limited possibility of an objective evaluation of the performance of the predicted results of individual projects with regard to the objectives of individual projects and at the same time, the objectives of the operational programme.
On the initiative of the Supreme Audit Chamber, an opinion poll was conducted in the summer of 2013 at the place of implementation of projects selected for the joint audit sample.
The survey and its evaluation were carried out by the School of higher vocational education in the NYSE (Poland).
After agreement with the Supreme audit office, the investigation was carried out on both sides of the border between the 2 820 respondents, both among the public in Poland in relation to the part of the project implemented by the Polish project partners in the Czech public in relation to the part of the project implemented in the Czech republic.
The survey mainly concerned the appropriateness, quality, information exchange, resource usage, social functions and projects including investments.
The number of respondents for each project is set out in Annex 2.
The assessment of responses from the survey indicated that the overall social evaluation of projects was good and reached the value of 4.8 points (on a scale with a maximum of 8 points), which means that the results of the projects were positively perceived by most respondents as having regard to the objectives, so according to the other parameters listed in the project applications.
According to the respondents, the projects examined met the criteria expressed in the Operational Programme.
Respondents also noted the positive impact of investments on improving the quality of transport and tourism infrastructure, transport accessibility, tourist attractiveness, business conditions, the quality of life of citizens and the resumption of contacts between the inhabitants of the border region.
On the other hand, the overall response assessment indicated a certain difference between the actual level of achievement of objectives/parameters (actual impact rate) and the level expected by the respondents.
This difference applies to the evaluation of the results of individual projects, where in some cases there is a significant difference.
The results of the survey were in accordance with the views of the participants of the panel discussions (focus groups) carried out under the control of NIK on the Polish side, who have pointed out the need for the implementation of projects and confirmed their positive public acceptance and fulfilment of expected results.
No. Evaluation of the legality of controlled projects
The beneficiaries examined the compliance of the project's factual and timing with the timetable and content of the project application, the implementation of the objectives and purpose of the project, the fulfilment of binding monitoring indicators, the management of changes in projects, the management of any revenues of the project, the fulfilment of the obligation of separate accounting of project transactions, compliance with the ban on eligibility of project expenditure, selection of suppliers and verification of delivered transactions on the basis of procurement contracts.
The total financial value of the shortfalls of qualified Sao and NIK as non-EU financing expenditure was found to be € 85,094.
However, this amount did not exceed the established level of materiality relating to the total controlled volume of funds for the sample of projects.
Despite the irregularities identified, the SAO and NIK evaluated the implementation of the selected projects positively by the beneficiaries.
In most cases, the obligations arising from the conditions of the aid were duly fulfilled by the beneficiary.
Funds for the implementation of controlled projects were spent in accordance with EU regulations and national law.
Nevertheless, seven of the eight beneficiaries of the aid controlled by NIK found irregularities in the fulfilment of material and financial obligations.
It was about individual cases of non-systemic nature and were especially inconsistent preparation of project documentation and violation of rules for public procurement, which, however, should not impact on the selection of the supplier or the delivery of the contractually agreed work.
Only in one of all projects controlled NICHES can be identified by the irregularity, which concerned failure to comply with obligations in the area of reporting, evaluated as ineligible expenditure in the amount of 43 003 PLN (8 of 231 € to be financed from the ERDF).
On the other hand, the Sao identified ineligible expenditure of CZK 2,098,053 in three of the 19 projects audited (of which € 76,863 financed by the ERDF).
Irregularities included the non-delivery of paid material and work or of the expenditure for upgrading of property owned by a person who didn't have feedback on the project either as recipient, or as a project partner.
RECOMMENDATION
The joint recommendations of the SAO and NIK refers to the improvement of the monitoring system, especially with regard to a consistent definition of the proper monitoring indicators for all specific objectives of the priority axis of the operational programme.
Generally it is also necessary to strive for the establishment of such indicators at the program level and projects, which will allow a more reliable verification of compliance impacts.
Notes and recommendations arising from the inspections carried out on both sides of the border are included in the separate audit conclusions of the SAO and NIK on the CD.
COMMUNIQUE

Public works procurement and Prevention of corruption
Joint report on the parallel audit by the Czech Supreme audit office (SAO) and the German Federal court of auditors (BRH)
Introduction and overview
Procurement of goods and services by contracting authorities is very important for both the state and the private sphere.
The role of the state is to use public resources as effectively and efficiently and to ensure fair and regulated free competition.
In the European Union (EU), public procurement is a key factor in the success of the Single Economic Area.
The EU in its legislation has set limits above which the ca must meet certain requirements to guarantee the wide and limitless competitive environment across the EU.
EU member states must therefore transpose the European tender right into their national legislation and put it into practice.
Both the Czech Republic and Germany have already done so.
For public contracts that are below EU limits, the regulation of their procurement remains within the competence of individual countries.
In addition, public procurement is vulnerable to corruption with a consequent high potential for damage.
Therefore, contracting entities are obliged to adopt in their procurement procedures reasonable measures to prevent corruption and improper favoritism (prevention of corruption).
In January 2011 the Supreme audit office of the Czech republic (Czech SAI – SAO) and the Federal accounting court of Germany (the German SAI – BRH) agree to perform parallel inspections in the field of procurement management and prevention of corruption in land and road construction.
Cooperation was also focused on the area of european procurement law as transposed into national legislation.
The controls also included procurement under European limits with a view to affecting the area of corruption prevention.
The audit findings of both the supreme audit institutions are summarised in the joint report, which is inter alia determined by the international organisations, such as the International organisation of supreme audit institutions (INTOSAI).
Control areas and controlled institutions
Evaluation BRH comes from the circuit controls the above-mentioned areas, which have been carried out by the German building administrations responsible for the federal transport and building construction in the years 2011 to 2012.
For example, highway construction and large-scale construction projects were evaluated.
The BRH included findings from past inspections in the evaluation.
Evaluation of the SAO comes from the checks carried out during the years 2008 to 2012, which were focused on construction of roads, railway lines, hydropower projects, large buildings (hospitals, cultural facilities, universities) and some other buildings in the Czech republic.
In Germany, federal public procurement is mostly carried out by land-based construction administrations.
In the Czech Republic, state institutions for road and rail construction are responsible for public procurement in the field of transport infrastructure.
In the field of building construction, public procurement is realized by entities which are recipients of budgetary funds.
In both countries, the services of external experts are also used at each stage of the procurement procedure.
The evaluation shall take into account the differences in public procurement legislation and the peculiarities of the construction market in both countries.
Structure of the Public Procurement Act in both countries
In Germany, the course of European procurement procedures is governed by laws and under-law standards.
The procurement procedures limited to Germany shall be governed by budgetary law and the relevant administrative acts .
Internal administrative rules contain numerous additional provisions for both European and national procurement procedures.
Further details regarding the requirements of the european procurement law and prevention of corruption are embedded in the so-called procurement manuals of the federal government, in which the requirements are developed or formulated into greater detail with regard to the legal precedents in the area of procurement law.
In the Czech republic public procurement regulated by the law on public procurement and other laws and regulations that relate to contracts with a value above and below the european limits.
The procurement law made significant changes in 2012.
The new rules enhance transparency of procurement procedures, opened the space for more competition and reducing opportunities for corruption during the procurement procedure.
Basic aspects of the tendering law in both countries
As regards European procurement procedures, in particular open and closer procedures must be applied in both countries.
In Germany the contracts are below the european limit awarded in accordance with national legislation (public call to participation in the contest, limited the invitation to participate, the rules of procedure), you are however practically identical with the above mentioned terms for the european procurement procedure.
Public procurement in Germany is characterized by the principle of preference of open procedures (where they are invited by the candidates in the european scale) and public calls for participation (only in the case of national procedure).
In open procedures and in a call for competition, any candidate may submit an offer.
Another important feature of German procurement law is the support of small and medium-sized companies.
This is mainly achieved by dividing the total public contract into commercially specific parts and dividing it into sub-contracts.
The award of contracts divided into these parts gives the chance to participate in the procedure as many candidates as possible.
The two characteristics of German procurement law are time-tested instruments for obtaining good value for money.
In Germany, more than 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees are registered.
In the Czech Republic, the conditions of European procedures must be applied even in cases of public procurement with a value below the EU limit.
The exception is a simplified sub-minimal procedure where the sponsor can apply less demanding procedures.
In accordance with European law, Czech procurement law includes the conditions under which the contract must be awarded in order to ensure competition and to obtain a favourable price.
The current Czech legislation allows contracting entities to choose between open and narrower proceedings.
In the Czech Republic, 85 000 construction companies are registered, of which about 1,900 have 20 or more employees.
Total volume of public works contracts by contracting authorities and share of each type of Management in both countries
In 2011, the total volume of construction works in Germany amounted to EUR 7 675 billion.
Czk, of which 1 138 billion (15 %) accounted for the proportion of public procurement, which in addition to the contracts awarded by the federal government include a contract awarded by the länder and municipalities.
The total volume of projects of Federal Road and land construction (without the construction of Railways and water structures) amounted to CZK 212.5 billion.
In 2011, the composition of the federal procurement of road construction works and road construction as follows: of 80.7 % open procedures and public calls; 12,7 % closer management and greater challenges;
6,6% negotiated procedures and direct procurement; 33,2% is the share of European procurement procedures.
The volume of public construction contracts in the Czech republic in 2011 amounted to 118,6 billion Rubles , which was about 25 % of the total volume of all construction works.
In 2009 it amounted to CZK 194.0 billion, which was 37 % of the total volume.
Structure of types of procurement procedures in 2011: 65,1% open procedures; 14,3% closer procedures; 9,5% negotiated procedures; 8,4% simplified procedures for sub-minimal contracts; 2,7% other procedures.
That information shall cover all supply, service and works contracts awarded by contracting authorities in 2011.
These figures reveal that: parallel control in both countries were aimed at a substantial part of public procurement procedures; prevention of corruption, which is a must-have in the conduct of procurement proceedings still in mind, has a significant financial impact; open meaning. procurement procedures are of key importance.
Summary of the main results
The SAO and BRH carried out parallel control of european orders for construction work with an emphasis on the prevention of corruption in their countries.
The checks were aimed at comparing legislation in both countries and the EU and implementing public procurement in the field of land and transport buildings.
Key findings are also given:
The EU public procurement directive has been transposed into the national rights of both countries (Points 1). and 3.1).
Prevention of corruption is not the only purpose of the EU directive, but the national procurement rules of both countries, which partly differ in focus and in detail.
In both countries, is an essential requirement that the procurement documents comply with, the inclusion of all information necessary for the preparation of the tenders.
The specifications shall be neutral and shall not contain any requirements restricting competition.
The tender documents in Germany generally meet these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, the problem is the lack of definition of the subject of the contract.
In Germany, procurement is required to be divided into parts where possible in order to promote a competitive environment.
According to the findings of the BRH, this requirement is complied with in Germany.
The SAO audit showed that in the Czech republic are awarded a significantly voluminous public works in the area of road constructions, without being divided into parts or divided they are, but only on the volume of the very significant parts. This method can distort competition and lead to restrictions on only a few large companies.
These limitations on market potential can result in significant cost increases and create the risk of unserious price negotiations and inadmissible conventions.
The legislation in both countries allows authorities, under certain conditions, additionally enter other construction work,if such a need arises only after the conclusion of the contract (section 4.1).
In both countries, the requirements for correctly determining the type of Procurement Procedure are met.
In the Czech republic according to the applicable legislation, contracting authorities can freely determine the one of the open tendering procedures, the open procedure or the restricted procedure.
German rules in the procurement and budgetary law enshrine the preference of open procedures for both European tender and national, known as public calls for competition.
Open tender procedures in both countries allow a larger number of candidates to submit a bid, and also reduce the risk of corruption, because they make it difficult unlawful negotiation of prices between the candidates.
At the same time, the best results in value for money are achieved.
In the case of large contracts, with an estimated total price reaches or exceeds the limits set by the EU, writing controlled entities always european procurement procedure.
In determining the type of Procurement Procedure, the correct determination of the estimated value of the contract plays a very important role.
In Germany, databases are used for objective pricing of Public Works, in which values are based on completed construction projects.
This is a sufficiently objective tool.
In the Czech republic databases are used only in the field of road construction, but not yet an effective tool (section 4.2).
When the award of the contract for construction work according to european public procurement procedures is necessary to publish a prior information and contract notices, and due to the increased competition by the candidates to prepare in time for the submission of tenders.
As a rule, the construction authorities audited complied with this requirement.
In isolated cases, errors in the information released, incorrect application of provisions and/or a lack of controls may have impaired competition (item 4.3).
There is a greater risk of manipulation when choosing candidates to participate in a shortlist.
Under EU law, the number of candidates invited must be high enough to guarantee genuine competition.
The selection criteria shall be objective, non-discriminatory and published well in advance.
In addition to EU requirements, contracting authorities in both countries should as often as possible alternate candidates who call for participation in the procedure when selecting suppliers.
In Germany, there are, in part, very detailed requirements for preventing the risks of manipulation.
In some cases, controlled contracting entities did not comply with these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, selection decisions were not always credible (section 4.4).
In both countries, contracting authorities during the procurement procedure to ensure that all candidates who wish to submit a bid, received the same information.
Any agreements between these candidates and between them and third persons, which participated in the preparation of the specifications, must be to the greatest possible extent prevented, to avoid restriction of competition in the form of illegal agreements.
In Germany, the measures in question are more thorough than in the Czech Republic.
However, the German contracting authorities under scrutiny did not comply with that requirement in several cases (point 4.5).
In both countries, the principle of cross-checking and transparency must be applied when opening envelopes.
The requirements for labelling, documentation, protection and confidentiality of the offers have a limited space for manipulation and in Germany are particularly detailed.
Checks in both countries found only a few cases of irregularities (section 4.6).
The assessment and evaluation of bids is procedurally regulated in both countries.
The relevant German measures are more comprehensive, but have not always been respected by the contracting authorities under scrutiny.
Authorities, for example, transferred their supply to third parties for inspection without their prior assessment, without that we can document any suspicious circumstances.
Thus, tenders were insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulations (point 4.7).
For reasons of legal protection, participants must be informed about the intended contract award before the latter is finalised.
This legal protection rule also is designed to prevent corrupt action.
The law of the Czech Republic provides for judicial review of contract award procedures also for national tenders.
Only in few cases, the notification of the enterprises was not appropriately ensured (item 4.8).
The tender documentation was not always complete or completely credible for the contracting authorities controlled in both countries.
In the case of several procurement procedures were not always in the minutes of proceedings duly complied with the transparency requirements applicable at european level.
In addition, some of the deficiencies identified reduced the preventive anti-corruption function of the dossier.
Contracting entities in both countries have mostly complied with their reporting obligations (clause 4.9).
Summary of the main principles of European tendering law and Prevention of corruption
European Procurement Law
The european parliament and the Council of the European union take to ensure free competition in the EU, inter alia, the directive on the coordination of procedures for the award of public contracts for public works, supplies and services with the aim of ensuring the free movement of goods and services and the directive on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to review procedures concerning the award of public supply contracts and public works contracts (directive on review procedures), with these two directives should be transposed into national law.
General procurement principles of the EU include in particular: the requirement for a competitive environment; the requirement for equal treatment or prohibition of discrimination; transparency requirement.
the procurement principles of the EU include the Directive on the coordination of procedures for the award of public contracts includes provisions relating to construction projects whose total estimated value equal to or greater than 5 miles. €.
These provisions have an impact on: the content of the tender documentation; the used type of the procurement procedure; the publication of certain information before, during and after the termination of the proceedings; the deadline for the receipt of tenders; the qualification requirements which may be after the applicants are required; the criteria for selecting the most suitable deals.
The legal protection of tenderers is governed by the review directive.
In the event of a potential breach of the tendering law, tenderers may have the decision of the contracting authority reviewed in accordance with the review procedures.
Both countries transposed EU requirements into national legislation.
Prevention of corruption
Importance of preventing corruption
There is no legal definition of what corruption actually means in either country.
In general, corruption is understood as an abuse of a personal (confidential) position for one's own benefit.
As a rule, this means that such abuse is encouraged by those who benefit from it.
Corruption can be a barrier to competition and can cause serious economic losses.
According to estimates, total corruption-related damage accounts for 5% of the world's economic output.
For the EU region, these costs are estimated at 1% of the EU's economic output.
If it is in the contract involved, the contracting authority, of the convention restricting competition, or allowing dishonest conduct may weaken confidence in the integrity, ability and overall work of the public administration.
Therefore, the Prevention of corruption is an essential task of the contracting authorities.
Practice and procedures shall be checked in particular in areas particularly susceptible to corruption, in order to adopt adequate measures for its avoidance.
Taking preventive measures and carrying out effective controls can significantly reduce the susceptibility of the decision-making process to corruption.
As a rule, the award of works contracts is considered an area particularly susceptible to corruption.
Measures to prevent corruption
In Germany corruption is stíhatelná under criminal and labour law, which especially refers to active and passive bribery, accepting and offering significant advantages.
The German federal government issued a manual with recommendations, which relate to the prevention of corruption in the federal administration and according to which they are applied throughout the procurement process outside the risk analysis following principles: priority to the open input; the principle of multiple control and transparent decision-making; separation of planning, award and accounting phase; accurate and complete documentation of the procurement procedure.
In addition, other measures having a preventive effect against corruption have become part of the procurement law.
In 2011, introduced the relevant federal ministry of information technology supporting system for monitoring the award of contracts for the construction of federal roads.
Using this system can be information such as the estimated cost, the total value of the contract and the involvement of the private design offices fully recorded and analysed in order to ascertain eventual irregularities.
In the Czech Republic corruption is prosecuted under criminal law, the level of labour or civil law is also taken into account.
The legal requirement for transparency, equal treatment and the prohibition of any discrimination during the entire procurement process (preparation and implementation) is the most important part of the prevention of corruption.
Anti-corruption measures in this field was established by the government in the "Strategy of the government in the fight against korupcím for the period 2011-2012", which was updated for the years 2013 and 2014.
Part of those measures has been incorporated into the Public Procurement Act and subsequent implementing regulations.
The new legislation contains the following basic provisions: lowering the limits for small-scale contracts; the obligation to provide prior notification of the contracting authority, including the justification of the contract; the prohibition to limit the number of candidates in a restricted procedure and the abolition of the general possibilities to limit the number of candidates by drawing lots; the obligation to publish contracts, including annexes; the obligation to disclose actual and lists of subcontractors.
Results of checks relating to the subsequent stages of the procurement procedure
Tender documentation
The tender documentation must contain all information necessary to enable tenderers to prepare their bids due form.
In particular, the documentation must enable the tender price to be processed.
In order to do so, candidates must not be exposed to risks they could not count on.
Tender documents mainly contains the specifications, then the requirements to demonstrate the qualifications of the candidates and criteria for the selection of the most advantageous tender.
Requirements for European law and Prevention of corruption
In particular, European law contains requirements relating to technical specifications.
Specifications must restrict competition as little as possible and all candidates must have equal access.
The specifications shall be neutral.
Requirements for specific specific products are admissible on a very limited scale in the tender documentation.
The basic principle of preventing corruption is that the tender documents do not contain requirements that could restrict competition.
Documentation should also avoid confusion or inaccurate data, which create a space for speculation and for handling during the evaluation of tenders.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
Both countries have transposed EU legal provisions into their national legislation.
The basic principle is that the specifications are given in general without reference to a particular product or brand.
Specifications must precisely define the required supplies and services and detail the number of units of work and supply.
In normal cases, the prices should be quoted according to units of works or supply (e.g. in € /m or € /item).
To define the required works in terms of their functionality is permissible only in exceptional cases.
In principle, as a rule, the specifications need to be drawn up completely and unambiguously.
They must contain precise quantities and must not include works and supplies, the necessity of which is not entirely obvious.
Reimbursement in the form of lump sums or according to time worked should be avoided where possible.
These parts of the tender documents shall exclude speculation and manipulation, based on ambiguous specifications.
The specifications must enable each tenderer to prepare their tender with certainty and without excessive preparatory work.
The invitation to tender shall not be published until the tender documentation is complete.
Different provisions
In the Czech Republic there is no obligation for contracting authorities to award construction contracts in parts.
The contracting authority can divide the contract into several separate parts, if it admits the nature of the subject of such contracts.
In Germany it is required the application of the rule to divide the construction work on the section, either quantitatively (partial deliveries), or according to specific criteria (a specialized part of the contract).
This allows participation in the competition even to small and medium-sized entities, increases the number of potential bidders and makes it difficult to fix prices.
This type of award is usually considered the most appropriate in terms of providing value for money.
In the Czech Republic, the tender documents must contain evaluation criteria for national and European procurement procedures.
Thus, the tenderer should be informed comprehensively and exhaustively of the criteria by which his tender will be evaluated.
In Germany, the requirement to include evaluation criteria in the notice apply only to european invitation to tender.
In national procurement procedures, it is necessary to include Evaluation Criteria Only in the contract record, which is an internal administrative document.
If the tender documentation prepared by independent experts, the German regulations require to exclude from it any information which would assist in the identification of specific interested companies, architects or designers.
This is to prevent individual construction companies from obtaining any additional information or other inadmissible competitive advantages without the knowledge of the sponsor through contacts with these independent experts.
It is also why independent experts shall not disclose documents relating to tenders and facilitate their accessibility for examination.
The contracting authority is the only point of contact for construction companies.
The Czech Republic does not currently have a similar provision.
In the case of large construction projects arises after the conclusion of the original contract almost always a need for additional works or modification of existing work.
The legislation of both countries allows the award of a multi-work contract within a certain limit to the same supplier without the need to publish and implement a new procurement procedure.
The volume of multiplication under both European and German legislation shall not exceed 50% of the original value of the contract.
Moreover, multi-work must be necessary and must have the nature of a specific component of the main contract.
In the Czech Republic, a more stringent limit of 20% is applied for the entry of multipractice.
It can bring the risk of greater delays in the implementation of the contract and the possible integration of new entity into the already running project.
Where a multi-work contract is awarded to the supplier of the original contract, German law contains a provision which prevents suppliers from arbitrarily increasing the price of modified works or multi-work.
Calculations must be made taking into account the prices agreed in the original contract.
In addition to more work, fewer work can occur during construction, that is, work that was not needed.
In the Czech Republic, lesswork and morework can not compensate each other.
Main control findings
BHR
Technical specifications and product-neutral invitation to tender
In isolated cases, the specifications referred to national technical requirements or standards, but were replaced by EU standards in the meantime.
In some cases, the specifications include the data requesting a certain brand, e.g. for system resilience of public inscriptions to prevent water penetration or for acoustic tiles, although it wasn't needed.
In some cases, the specifications were so detailed that only one product met the requirements.
Quantitative specifications broken down into items
In no case has the BRH observed a non-compliance with the general requirements for inviting tenders for supplies and services in accordance with the quantitative specifications broken down into items.
Completeness of specifications
In most controlled cases, tender documents were drawn up without a trace before the invitation to tender was announced.
However, in different cases, the documents had to be modified during the procurement procedure when changes in the items or in the timetable had to be taken into account.
In isolated cases, the tender documents contained work and supplies, the need for which was uncertain.
One tender documentation for demolition works contained almost exclusively such items.
Subdivision of the contract and award criteria
In many cases, the desired justification for not dividing supplies into parts has not been demonstrated.
The BRH did not find any deficiencies in the criteria for evaluating tenders prior to the award of the contract.
Inclusion of the names of authorized independent experts
Many of the documents cited interested authorized experts.
The names were indicated on the opening pages of the documents or on the plans or attached opinions.
In one case, the sponsor invited the applicant to its questions to the procurement management contact explicitly appointed by the architect.
For projects of road construction were these cases detected mainly in the tender documentation, where they were processing the specifications of the entrusted self-employed experts.
Authorities said they do not have sufficient staffing capacity for detailed vetting of tender dossiers.
Sao
Technical specifications and product-neutral invitation to tender
In the case of public contracts for the construction of a house with 12 apartments was a link directly to the specific manufacturer and brand products.
The contracting authority did not authorise the use of other similar product types or justify why it requires the supply of specific products.
For the construction of facilities of the University, the tender documentation included references to specific trading firms and specific product designations.
General overview of specifications and sub-specifications
In the construction of some industrial zones of the contracting authority in the tender documentation failed to identify clearly the amount and type of the requested works, supplies or services in the bill of quantities and the set for each building as a unit of measurement only enclosed space in cubic metres.
Completeness of specifications
During the procurement procedure for the construction of the road circuit, the tender documentation for the narrower procedure was amended four times between August and September 2009.
This was due to changes in the project documentation caused by the expansion of the scope of the contract and the change in technical conditions.
In the construction of social objects should tender documentation defects, which necessitated the creation of additional works (missed the exact focus, was not carried out sufficient structural and technical survey, missing drawings).
In the tender documentation for the construction of the great library were listed elements of the interior only descriptively, without specifying the quality requirements on the products.
Supply equipment to the interior of the building provided the subcontractors, who got some extra and very expensive equipment.
Parts and award criteria
In the Czech Republic there is no obligation to award the contract in parts.
From the analysis of the three major road constructions during the construction of the ring road showed that, at the time of their entering in an open procedure in parts (separately for selected objects) it was possible to achieve savings of up to eur 790 million. CZK 15,508 million of the public procurement price achieved. CZK.
For example, a saving of £ 62.5 M could be achieved when six building buildings were awarded as a separate part of the contract.
CZK, i.e. 25% of the contracted price and the award of 20 bridges as a separate part of the contract could have been achieved by saving £ 287.8 m. CZK, i.e. also 25%.
The contracting authority during the construction of the road in the tender documents the qualification criteria, which limited the participation of small suppliers in the procurement process.
In the tender specifications open procedure for suppliers in one construction highway construction contracting entity demanded, inter alia, the practice of a supplier consisting in the implementation of at least three road construction projects on the financial volume of each of more than 700 miles. CZK, completed or operational over the last five years.
In the Czech Republic there are only nine companies that meet the condition of completion of construction above 700 miles. In the last five years.
Public contract for the supply of other highway construction projects in an open procedure included six separate buildings, for which the contracting authority required a minimum annual volume of construction work in last three years 12 billion.
Two thirds of financial volume of road construction works (I.email. € 2.5 billion out of € 3.7 billion) in the period of 2008-2009 were realized would be 5 suppliers or individually either in form of consortium.
There were only two or even one bidder for 46 contracts worth a total of £ 13.2 bn.
The Sao pointed out that limiting market potential can lead to a large increase in costs.
Area of multiplication
In two cases, the contracting authority did not conclude a written contract for the delivery of multi-works during the construction of the road circuit and did not provide for multi-work in any of the procedures specified in the law.
The value of unapproved multiplications in one case was 1,591,4 million. CZK excluding VAT (21% increase) and in the second case 4,135,8 million. CZK excluding VAT (increase of 91 %).
The cause of the multiplication was, first of all, an ambiguous definition of the quantity and type of work required.
For the construction of a higher education institution, the contracting authority did not include in the procurement documents certain works and supplies, the necessity of which he knew when the contract was awarded for the completion and housebuilding of the building.
These labor and delivery making amendments to the contract for work with the construction contractor with an increase in prices, in negotiated procedure without publication, although the volume of extra works exceeded the national limit of 20 % of the value of the original contract.
In connection with the construction of the judicial Palace, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional works without a procurement procedure.
During construction, the contracting authority increased the scope of the contract by £ 50.5 m. CZK.
Unit prices for additional works established without competition were significantly higher than comparable works performed by the same supplier.
Other findings
SAO on a selected sample of buildings found that the average construction cost for the construction of one mile of four-lane highway in the Czech republic are 355,0 million. CZK.
According to long-term data obtained from the German Ministry of construction, the average cost in Germany per kilometer of a four-lane highway is 260.0 miles. CZK.
This comparison suggests that the acquisition of a motorway in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.
Summary
The legal provisions relating to the contract documents are in both countries almost identical, and are in accordance with the requirements of european law.
The aim is to ensure complete and equal competition and Prevention of corruption.
The specifications must be sufficiently precise to allow candidates to calculate costs and prepare their tenders.
In addition, this requirement limits the scope for speculation, and the sponsor is protected against the need to enter multiwork.
In Germany, the basic legal provisions about tender documents supplemented by other rules, which have even more reduce the options for limiting the competition and for the implementation of the manipulation.
Although there are no detailed requirements of this kind in the Czech Republic, greater transparency is achieved by publishing the award criteria.
In both countries, the requirements for specifications are mostly met.
However, in some cases, deficiencies have been identified that could lead to a restriction of competition.
At the same time a valid rule in Germany calling for dividing large construction projects into parts seems to be suitable for strengthening the competitive environment and achieving cost-effective results.
The SAO found that the Czech republic may award contracts on the volume large-scale projects without entering in parts, or division on a volume large parts restrict the range of applicants to a small number of large suppliers.
The result of the strict requirement for the reference of candidates, which is implemented in the Czech republic for the selection of applicants for road construction work, is the fact that they are public contracts awarded to only a small circle of candidates, and small and medium-sized companies do not have a chance to compete.
A limited number of bidders also increases the risk of price fixation and other illegal conventions.
As regards the award of additional multi-work or modified work and their reimbursement, regulatory approaches in both countries are different.
If the value of additional works under european and German law does not exceed 50% of the value of the original contract, may be additional works awarded without a procurement procedure and its notification.
In the Czech Republic, a stricter limit of 20% applies.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
This limit is often exceeded by the sponsor.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
If the limit of 20 % is exceeded, morework must be entered on the basis of a new procurement procedure.
By dividing the works into parts, competition can be avoided, as well as the consequent unfortunate consequences.
Determining the type of procurement procedure with regard to EU limits
By determining the type of Procurement Procedure, the sponsor defines the circle of potential suppliers who will be admitted to the competition.
The Sponsor may leave the range of potential suppliers Unlimited or may limit the range according to the criteria specified.
In the case of large-scale project works, the value of which reaches or exceeds the limits set by the EU, a European Procurement Procedure must be conducted.
Requirements for European law and Prevention of corruption
When choosing the type of procedure the contracting authority must in particular meet the requirements of european law concerning the competitive environment and transparency.
If the estimate of the total cost of the contract for the required works reaches or exceeds the current EU threshold of 5.0 million. € (125 million Open or restricted procurement procedures at European level are always required.
In exceptional cases, a negotiated procedure or a competitive dialogue shall be admissible.
If the construction project reaches the EU limit, the contracting authority may deviate to a limited extent from the European Procurement Procedure by issuing a national procedure if the total value of the relevant part is below 1.0 million. € (£25m) And the total value of all parts does not exceed 20% of the value of the entire contract estimate.
Share construction project or intentionally to estimate its cost too low, with the intention to avoid the fundamental obligation to write out a european tender procedure is not permitted.
The choice of the type of management is very important for the Prevention of corruption, since the restriction of competition significantly increases the risk of manipulation.
Therefore, an important part of the procurement documentation is the detailed justification of the type of procedure chosen, in particular in relation to the obligation to apply European tendering law.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
Both countries fully implement EU legal requirements for procurement procedures and limits into their national laws.
Different provisions
The Czech Republic has established the principle of equal validity of open and narrower procedures, as well as for procurement procedures at national level.
Open and narrower procedures can be chosen at all times, while other types of proceedings are allowed only when the statutory conditions are met.
In contrast to the Czech regulation, the relevant German regulation of budgetary law and the principles of prevention of corruption prefers open proceedings or a public invitation to participate in proceedings.
Other types of management, including limited management, shall only be admissible exceptionally if permitted by legislation.
Such exceptions shall be justified and documented.
The principle preference of the open procedure has a guarantee, that is, to the maximum extent prevented the restriction of competition and that there is limited opportunity for manipulation (pre-selected specific candidates).
In Germany, this principle of public procurement is central to the Prevention of corruption.
The correct estimation of the expected price of the contract is an important basis for the decision on the corresponding type of Procurement Procedure.
When estimating the cost of projects of road construction authorities in Germany can rely on the budget and cost databases of public administrations and other organizations.
These have been compiled on the basis of the analysis of completed construction projects and include, inter alia, standard cost values for the types of buildings, building units, building parts and sub-construction work.
Based on such standard cost values, it is possible to estimate the value of the contract of the planned project or construction work.
Only a few construction administrations in Germany already have a similar database for road construction.
However, the database is expected to be expanded nationally.
Contracting entities in the Czech Republic do not use any central database or average prices of comparable objects to determine the expected cost of public procurement for construction.
In many cases, the cost determination is based on an estimate of the body financing the project or on the value of the resources available to that body.
Meanwhile, standardization measures are at an early stage.
On the basis of the Anti-Corruption Programme for the period 2011 to 2012, the relevant ministries are to draw up a database of the usual prices for standardised commodities.
The application of the pricing system to determine the expected price of the contract is determined by a new regulation ordering the establishment in detail of the subject-matter of the contract.
The pricing system should serve as a set of information on construction and assembly works, materials and products and other data in order to calculate the necessary costs and to determine unit prices.
The Ministry of Transport issued normative prices for transport structures in order to check them, which are regularly updated.
The database is intended for determining the price of the project (investment) plan and should play a bridging function in other stages of the preparation of the construction work.
Main BRH control findings
Selection of the procurement procedure
Controlled entities generally have not entered the contract in an open procedure or in the form of a public call for participation and were in accordance with the requirements of budgetary and procurement legislation.
In 2011, the share of public competitions in the total volume of federal construction projects in the field of land construction was 59.5 %.
In road construction, this proportion was 94.8%.
The BRH found that in some cases there was insufficient justification for the use of non-public competition.
In the case of printed checks BRH found on the basis of information collected from more than 16 000 management limited management has a clear disadvantage in comparison with the public management and public challenge and the limited control also increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
According to the BRH study, tender prices were 6% to 10% higher in restricted procedures and negotiated procedures than in public procedures.
Parallel studies of the Ministry of construction and the provincial control Court confirmed differences in value for money received in public and limited management.
A study by the Ministry of construction even found that prices in limited proceedings were twice as high as those in public proceedings.
Compliance with EU limits
For projects whose total contract value was estimated at more than 5 million. € (125 million As a rule, the contracting authorities under scrutiny have drawn up tender plans indicating which works will be awarded in the European Procurement Procedure and which in the National procedure.
According to the tender plans, the proportion of works awarded under European rules always exceeded 80% of the total work.
There was no case of circumvention of the European Management requirement by way of an exorbitantly low cost estimate.
However, in some cases the minimum share for the pan-European procedure was not achieved as a result of the calculation error.
In the course of carrying out the work, some contracting entities unlawfully changed the allocation plan of contracts.
They did not justify these changes and did not demonstrate that the minimum share of the European procedure would subsequently be respected.
As a rule, the share of European management by project accounts was lower than that provided for in the procurement plan.
Where the expected values of construction project contracts exceeded European limits, contracting entities did not apply the European procedure to all individual sub-parts of a value exceeding 1 million. € (£25m) CZK).
Instead, they awarded the relevant contracts on the basis of a national procedure, without giving any valid reasons for the need to deviate from the requirement.
Sao
Selection of the type of Procurement Procedure
In the case of several large construction projects (e.g. the construction of a road section, the equipment for a big sporting event, and construction of housing) the contracting authority has divided one project into several parts, although these sub-contracts were of the same or of a similar nature.
The division reduced the expected value of the contract, and the contracts were awarded in a less demanding mode or even out of the law mode.
Methods of calculating the estimated price
The price normatives applicable to road construction projects have not yet been an effective tool for determining the expected price.
They were based on the prices indicated in the completed procedures, which were, however, burdened by wastefulness and excessive profits of suppliers.
The Sao found that the actual prices for three parts of the road circuit were about 37% lower than these price normatives.
The ministry of transport has to update directives in relation not only to prices of the past, but also in comparison with other comparable markets and the price developments.
For terrestrial buildings, the estimated price was based on the budget of the project carried out by architects or the investor's estimate.
The actual price then differed significantly from the expected price.
The projected cost of building a large library was twice as high as the contract price, but increased by £ 54m over the course of implementation. CZK, i.e. 27 %.
Similarly, for the construction of the depository of this library, the contractual price was 33% lower than the expected price.
In other cases, the price of the successful applicant was higher than the estimated price and increased even more during the implementation.
For the construction of a large library, it was about 400 miles. CZK, i.e. 22 %. For the construction of the palace of justice, the actual price during the implementation of the construction increased disproportionately (by 139 %) compared with an increase in functional areas (by only 12 %).
Summary
Both countries have implemented the european provisions on the choice of the type of the procurement procedure and the respect for european limits into their national laws, so the relevant national legislation of both countries are almost identical.
The principle of public management in Germany is however stricter than the european regulation and the current national treatment in the Czech republic.
Compared with the strict procurement procedures gives the public tender or public invitation to participate the possibilities of a greater number of competitors to participate in a procurement procedure.
These types of procurement generate a large number of offers that guarantee the best effect of value for money.
Prevention of corruption is significantly strengthened, as the circle of candidates is not limited by the decisions of advance adopted by the contracting authority, which thus gives room for manipulation and fixation of prices between the candidates.
Studies have confirmed the benefits of the German preference clause for open procedures or public calls for participation.
Czech legislation allows contracting authorities to award contracts in open or restricted procedures.
However, the latest legislation in the Public Procurement Act imposes a prohibition on contracting authorities to limit the number of tenderers in shortlisted procedures.
The narrower proceedings have now come very close to open proceedings.
In Germany, the contracting authority is largely complied with the requirement of preference for open proceedings or public calls for competition, while in the Czech Republic some projects were divided in violation of the law, in order to circumvent the requirement for the selection of the relevant type of Procurement Procedure.
However, for some projects implemented in Germany, European limits were not respected, which resulted in a lack of a minimum share in pan-European proceedings.
In the Czech republic has not yet established a satisfactory system to facilitate the correct calculation of the expected costs of construction works and projects.
In cases where this is in place, should the contracting entities through extenzivnějších checks to ensure that the requirements for the selection of the type of the procurement procedure and the volume of contracts awarded in the european proceedings have been met, or should create such conditions which are necessary to enable the correct calculation of expected costs.
Preliminary information and notice of initiation
Where contracts are awarded under the European procedure, the contracting authority shall publish a procurement report.
Preliminary information and award notices are an important basis for European competition.
Requirements for European law and Prevention of corruption
By means of preliminary notifications, the contracting authority must indicate the basic specifications of the projects envisaged.
Pre-notifications are required in the case of projects, which is an estimate of the total cost equal to or greater than the european limit, and if the contracting authority wishes to shorten the deadline for the submission of tenders in individual procurement procedures.
The contracting authority is obliged to publish a procurement notice with detailed information for all public contracts requiring European procedures.
The information shall be binding on the contracting authority after publication.
Among other things, the notification shall include specifications, deadlines for the procedure and for the completion of the contract, specific requirements and selection criteria and their weights.
A common public procurement dictionary must be used to describe the subject-matter of the contract.
Preliminary information and contract notices are published in the EU in the Official Journal of the EU and on the profile of the contracting authority.
In order to prevent discrimination against foreign bidders do not have the notification at the national level contain no additional information and is not to be published before sending the text of the notice to the publications Office of the EU.
Incomplete or inaccurate information in the preliminary notification can violate competition or even facilitate manipulation.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
Both countries have fully implemented EU provisions on preliminary information and procurement notices in their national legislation.
Different provisions
In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and notifications must also be published in the case of contracts for which a European procedure is not required.
The procurement procedure shall not commence until one month after the submission of the prior notification.
Prior information may be waived only in exceptional cases.
In Germany, preliminary information is not required in cases where European proceedings are not necessary.
In the case of national proceedings, the public call must be published on the federal government's website, and, if appropriate, in the press.
In the case of restricted procedures without competition participants the notice must be published in the case where the estimated contract price is equal to or higher than 25 000 € (625 ths. Czk).
Preliminary notifications must explain all planned parts of the project.
This is an important requirement given the number of small contracts in Germany.
Dividing projects into smaller parts is not in the Czech republic so frequent and this measure is considered less important.
Main control findings
BRH
Prior notification
The contracting authorities published a preliminary notice on the projects, which included the work to be commissioned in the European procedure.
In certain open procedures, shortened time period, although the number of days between sending a pre-notification and sending the notification of the contract was less than 52 days.
In the case of other shortened procedures, the annual time limits applicable to the preliminary information have expired and should be renewed.
In many cases, the preliminary notification did not indicate the expected division of construction works into multiple parts.
Contract notice
Some notifications contained the codes from a common dictionary, which deviate from the content of the advance notification or did not provide specifications of the work to be implemented.
In rare cases, the notification at the national level include more information, e.g. regarding the deadlines, or were published before publication of a notice in the Official journal of the EU.
Ex-ante transparency
One sponsor hired an outside company to publish the national notice.
It posted a notice on its platform, the use of which was charged.
Sponsor but didn't check if this company must comply with the requirement to send a further notification to free online government portal.
The sample found that only a third of the notices were actually published on the government portal.
Sao
Contract notice
In the construction of the sewage treatment plant, the contracting authority did not set out the criteria for the contractor to reduce a large number of tenders for the evaluation procedure in the notice of a shortlist for the contractor.
The method of selection (reduction) of offers for evaluation has not been able to prove by the contracting authority.
The reduction in the number of offers was made possible by previous legislation.
During the construction of the ring road, the sponsor for one of the buildings failed to identify in the notice of initiation of the restricted procedure or in the qualification documentation the value by which it will assess the degree of compliance with the qualification criteria or the number of candidates who will be invited.
The sponsor assessed the compliance with the qualification requirements so that all six candidates under the restricted procedure it come true, but one of them ruled out with the fact that he fulfilled up to the last sixth place.
Procedure the contracting authority has not been transparent, as in advance, disclose information about what data on qualifications will be evaluated and how.
Publication of calls
In the case of construction modifications in the former military ujezdas, the contracting authority, contrary to the law, did not publish a written invitation to tender.
Conclusions and recommendations / summary
A two-stage information process with advance information and the publication of the notice of initiation is an important tool to meet the requirements of the transparency and the strengthening of the competitive environment, applicable in the european proceedings.
By extending the obligation to publish preliminary information in the Czech Republic also for national procurement procedures and by strengthening this obligation in Germany in cases of limited procedures, both countries have increased the transparency of procurement procedures and improved the competitive environment.
Selection of candidates in limited procurement procedures
Compared to the open procedure does not allow restricted tender participation of all potential bidders, who would be interested.
In restricted procedures, the contracting authority shall first select potential suppliers who will be asked to submit a tender.
Requirements for European law and Prevention of corruption
EU provisions allow limiting the number of candidates in European restricted procedures.
The restricted procedure, however, requires at least five candidates who will be invited to submit a tender, and in the case of negotiated procedure with publication must be asked at least three potential candidates.
In any case, the number of tenderers invited must be broad enough to guarantee genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective and non-discriminatory and must be published in advance.
Selection of potential candidates who will be invited, it is very prone to manipulation, e.g. the preferences of some of them.
Reducing competition to several bidders may ease their collusion.
This has a negative impact on the outcome of the proceedings.
Therefore, the contracting authority must take measures to prevent manipulation and to make sure that it has effective control, that such a procedure was transparent and credible.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
The provisions for the selection of candidates are similar in both countries.
In addition to the requirements of the European directive, contracting entities should replace the tenderers which are invited to submit tenders.
It is also not permissible to limit competition from a regional point of view.
Contracting entities shall document and justify the selection of tenderers and the selection process.
Different provisions
In Germany, at least three tenderers are required to be invited in the case of a restricted procedure and several suitable tenderers in the case of a negotiated procedure.
Except in two cases, the new Czech rules do not allow limiting the number of contenders addressed in the case of a closer and negotiated procedure.
In Germany, when choosing candidates, it is necessary to respect the"principle of four eyes".
While one worker proposes a list of them, another must substantially modify the proposal, e.g. by deleting the proposed tenderer or placing another.
This is intended to prevent a situation where an individual can definitively determine the circle of candidates who take part in the procedure.
If such a provision is not introduced, a far-reaching unlawful agreement between the participants is allowed.
The list of tenderers to be invited to submit a tender shall be confidential and shall not be divulged.
Authorized independent experts are also obliged to do so.
There is no similar or confidential treatment of the list of candidates in the Czech Republic.
According to German provisions, they may not designate candidates from outside companies, but may make proposals to the contracting authority.
There is no similar requirement in the Czech Republic.
Main control findings
BRH
Number of candidates
Except in a few cases, the requirement to reach a minimum number of candidates has been met.
Analysis of nearly 7 000 enter the building with a value to the national limit showed that in the case of restricted procedures, the contracting authorities have called on an average of 6.6 potential candidates and in the case of direct negotiated procedure in an average of 4.4 candidates.
Change of suppliers and regional restrictions
In particular, contracting entities did not change the scope of the contenders addressed in the area of building construction because they had good experience with those with whom they had worked so far.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Authorities argued that in case of non-public proceedings have the guarantee that the appeal applicant, the suitability of which is already pre-assured.
Although there was no evidence of unlawful regional restrictions, the number of candidates in non-public proceedings included a greater proportion of regional candidates than in the case of public proceedings.
Contracting entities explained this by the low contract amount compared to public procurement and the high cost of travel for potential bidders.
Principle of cross-checking and proposals of self-employed professionals
Contracting entities mostly ignored the obligation to change the list of candidates proposed by self-employed professionals.
They argued, in particular, lack of staff, time pressure or inadequate knowledge of a suitable candidate.
In many cases, the records did not reveal who proposed the candidate who was asked to participate in the proceedings.
Check some of the samples showed that the list of potential candidates was created by self-employed experts and the contracting entity was adopted without changes.
Thus, contracting entities did not protect themselves sufficiently from potential manipulation.
Confidentiality of treatment of lists of potential tenderers
In one sponsor was guided by a list of candidates for invitation to tender in the database, which should all employees anytime access.
It allowed the manipulation or unauthorized disclosure of the names of envisaged or adopted candidates, who could then agree on a price.
Documentation
The dossier cited the reasons for the selection of candidates in only a few cases.
Sao
Criteria for selection of candidates
During the construction of the ring road shouldn't the candidates information about what the data about their qualifications will be evaluated and how.
For actions related to the development and modernisation of waterways and ports, the award procedure notice for participation in the shortlist did not set criteria for limiting the number of tenderers.
All eight bidders met the qualification requirements, but this exceeded the number to which the contracting authority restricted participation in the procurement procedure.
The commission then conducted the selection of candidates by random selection – by drawing lots, which was at that time legal.
This procedure should have been mentioned as a criterion already in the contract notice.
Summary
With regard to the high risk of manipulation in the selection of the winning bidder in the restricted procurement procedures to introduce both countries, special measures for preventing the illicit restriction of competition.
The German rules restrict such opportunities to the manipulations using the so-called cross-checking (principle of four eyes) by respecting the confidentiality of the list of candidates and using prohibition to make proposals for the selection of candidates to external companies.
The Czech rules aim to prevent potential restrictions with the aim of manipulation mainly by an unlimited number of applicants.
Control however found that part of the said rules has not been sufficiently applied and that undue restriction of the set of candidates was in some cases prevented.
Contracting entities are obliged to completely eliminate the deficiencies mentioned.
Submission of tenders
Phase of the procurement procedure, in which potential bidders to develop a bid based on the tender documentation received, starts with the publication of information about the procurement procedure and/or challenge applicants.
By the date of opening of the envelopes, prospective tenderers may submit their tenders to the contracting authority in order to apply for the award of the contract.
Requirements for European law and Prevention of corruption
EU law does not prescribe specific requirements at this stage of the procurement procedure.
The sponsor must follow the national rules governing this stage of the procedure and prevent potential manipulation.
Those provisions shall apply in particular to the organisation and control.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
The principle applies that tender documents on the basis of which potential suppliers make their offers must always be sent by the contracting authority.
Design offices that are interested in management should not perform this role.
The contracting authority shall ensure that all candidates have received the same information during this stage of the procurement procedure.
In the case of ambiguities in the specification or raises further questions, information tenderers may add only the sponsor.
The design offices responsible for drawing up the procurement documents may not provide any information.
Any contact between the design office and the tenderers must be avoided throughout this phase.
They must remain anonymous throughout the course because allowing contact with them can adversely affect the competition.
Tenders sent by post or submitted directly must be submitted in a closed envelope.
Electronically submitted offers must be encoded.
Different provisions
In Germany, the sponsor may instruct the insured to a supplier of external services print and distribution documentation, and their employees shall be bound to comply with the confidentiality agreement.
In Germany it must be received tenders marked with an indication of the date of receipt and directly and immediately handed over in original condition (sealed) official, who is entrusted with their safekeeping.
This worker may not be involved in the procurement procedure.
The received offers must be locked until the date of opening of the envelopes.
In the Czech Republic, the offers received are marked with a serial number.
The sponsor exposes a message with details about the competition including numbers, deals and information on developing bids and receipt.
There are no special regulations on the safekeeping of offers.
Main control findings
BRH
BRH controlled the assignment of the administrative building.
Sending of procurement documents
Controlled entities building management sent the tender documentation, either directly or commissioned the printing and distribution of the external company.
Self-employed persons did not send any documentation.
Information provided to tenderers
For the part of the procurement documents relating to questioning and obtaining information, the contracting authority did not follow the rule of separate planning from the procurement procedure.
In violation of relevant regulations often in the documentation did it state the names of their contact workers, but rather employees of the department of project management.
Some of the tender notices even included the names of the companies or self-employed persons involved in the preparation of the tender documentation.
In isolated cases, candidates who asked questions during the procurement procedure did not receive identical information.
Labelling of tenders
For contracting entities, all received tenders have been stamped and confirmation of receipt.
However, in some cases, the negotiated procedure tenders were accepted by self-employed professionals, in violation of rule one of the construction prevention of corruption.
Custody of the tenders
Once marked, not all tenders were passed on directly and without delay to the official assigned to keep them in custody locked the tenders in a steel cabinet.
For one contracting authority, bids were temporarily placed in the open glove compartment of the mailroom, to which all employees had access.
Another sponsor placed the mailbox in the hallway without constant supervision, and part of the offers thrown into the mailbox remained there overnight.
The opening of the box was wide and unsecured, so it was accessible not only to employees.
Sao
The SAO has not identified deficiencies in this area.
Summary
In both countries there are established rules to prevent the contacts, in particular between the interested companies and design offices, which collaborate in the procurement process, and throughout the process.
Equal treatment is ensured by sending the same information to all tenderers.
For the receipt, storage and confidentiality of offers, rules are suitable for preventing manipulation and corruption.
In Germany, the relevant requirements are somewhat more developed than in the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the accumulated control records showed violations of the rules in some areas.
These irregularities can be easily corrected.

During the opening of envelopes, bids that have not yet been closed are opened, their content is read and published.
The period for which the applicant is his bound, starting at the moment of the expiry of the deadline for the submission of the envelopes or their opening and ends with the date designated by the sponsor.
Requirements for European law and Prevention of corruption
European legislation does not contain any specific provisions concerning the opening of envelopes.
However, national laws and regulations contain extensive requirements for the protection of tenders and competition during this sensitive phase of the entire procurement procedure.
The principles of" more eyes", transparency and credibility of the envelope opening process are intended to prevent manipulations and modifications of already submitted offers.

Same or similar provisions
The opening of envelopes must be carried out by several persons appointed by the sponsor.
Compliance with the principle of "more eyes" is intended to prevent individuals from hidden manipulation of offers.
Candidates may be present when opening envelopes.
When opening, all envelopes must be placed before the president of the commission and opened one by one.
Late bids received must not be taken into account.
In order to ensure transparency in the opening of envelopes, this stage, including the conclusions (results), must be recorded in writing. The record shall include, inter alia, the names of the tenderers and the prizes offered.
The minutes must be read and signed by the head of the group.
Registration may also be signed by the candidates present.
Different provisions
In the Czech Republic, a commission is established for the opening of envelopes.
The participation of independent experts shall be permitted.
Members of the commission may also be entrusted with deliberations at subsequent stages of the procedure, i.e. evaluation of tenders.
In Germany, the opening of envelopes takes place in the presence of the head and the writer.
The manager must be an employee of the sponsor.
The head and in the case of civil engineering and registrar shall not be participants in the preparatory phase (creation of the tender documentation), shall decide on the award of the contract and shall not be members in the subsequent processing (procedure) of the contract.
German regulations require that the minutes of the opening of the envelopes contained not only bid prices, but also any information about discounts and special (unusual) symptoms, e.g., damaged envelope, upon receipt of or late received bids.
In the Czech Republic, in addition to the tender prices, the registration must include an indication of the language of the tender and the tenderer's signature.
German regulations require that all parts of the opened envelopes were marked so as to avoid subsequent changes.
Deals, as a rule, marked in the form of a perforation indicating the date, must be held after the end of the opening of the envelopes as confidential (secret) and may be disclosed only to persons, which is further processed.
Similar measures do not exist in the Czech Republic.
If a single offer is received in the Czech Republic, the envelope must not be opened and the tenderer must be notified immediately.
In Germany, they do not have this adjustment, and if a single offer is accepted, it is opened and evaluated.
Main control findings
BRH
Principle of cross-checking
During the opening of envelopes, the sponsors adhered to the principle of four eyes.
Always there was a leader and a writer, to whom no other role was assigned.
However, in isolated cases, for small proceedings, natural persons opened tenders sent to them, without the participation of the contracting authority.
The course of opening envelopes
opening envelopes has not always documented progress.
In some cases, bids filed late were not marked, and in some cases signatures were missing.
Labelling of tenders received
Contracting entities marked offers of perforations with a date, which was in accordance with the requirements.
Some have flagged bids incorrectly in the past,but have changed practice after the BRH warning.

Time limit for receipt of tenders
At one event, the bidder's offer was handed over to the contracting authority with a monthly delay, and he nevertheless accepted it.
Summary
The essential parts of the envelope opening provisions are identical in both countries with regard to the principle of "more eyes" and the principle of transparency, and thus allow to substantially reduce the risk of corruption and manipulation.
The German rules are more complex compared to the Czech Republic, especially the requirements for accurate documentation of the procedure.
Marking, safe storage and respect for the confidentiality of tenders significantly limit the possibility of subsequent changes in the tenders submitted.
In addition, the workers responsible for opening envelopes may not carry out any other activities related to the contract to be awarded.
The findings, despite the detection of some irregularities, confirm that the rules for opening envelopes are largely applied.
Assessment and evaluation of tenders
The contracting authority must review and evaluate the tenders received within the specified time limit.
At the same time, they must award the contract to the tenderer who best meets the award criteria in the tender.
Requirements for European law and Prevention of corruption
EU law sets out the process of assessing and evaluating bids in several steps:
The first step is to check the suitability of candidates.
They must have a good economic and financial position and the required professional and technical knowledge and skills.
Tenderers who have sometimes been convicted of bribery or defraud must always be excluded from the procurement procedures.
Deals nevyloučených candidates must be evaluated in terms of numerical accuracy, technical suitability and value for money on the basis of previously published award criteria.
The contracting authority must determine the most economically favourable offer and, in particular, examine all significantly low price offers.
Review and evaluation is particularly sensitive and prone to manipulation.
For example, candidates may be excluded without a legitimate reason, or bids that do not meet the requirements may be left in the competition.
The outcome of the evaluation may be improperly influenced by the prioritisation or disadvantage of a tenderer, thereby preventing the selection of the most economically advantageous tender.
The contracting authority must therefore adopt special measures in choosing the persons included in the process and must make sure that they meet the requirements for integrity and technical knowledge.
They also need to make sure that the whole process and decisions taken are transparent and credible.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
In line with EU requirements, the relevant provisions in both countries require the review and evaluation of tenders in step-by-step.
During the evaluation must not be changed the requirements for proof of suitability of tenderers, evaluation criteria and their weights specified in the notice or in the tender documentation.
The criteria laid down for assessing the suitability of tenderers may not be further applied.
Further evaluation can be carried out only on the basis of evaluation criteria.
The tenders submitted shall first be investigated from a formal point of view, whether they are complete or do not include if the suspicious elements that could encourage the manipulation.
If there are candidates from further review and evaluation by them of the submitted tenders excluded, must be informed without delay.
If it is the result of the evaluation of tenders, the findings of abnormally low tender prices, must be given to the candidates the opportunity to comment on the situation before the eventual decommissioning of its menu.
The reasons for the decision must be documented in a transparent manner.
Different provisions
In Germany, candidates must maintain confidentiality and only authorised persons may participate in the evaluation of tenders.
The mathematical accuracy of bids can only be reviewed by the sponsor.
A rating may be assigned only to employees who are not integrated into the decision-making phase of choosing a supplier or the implementation phase of the project.
There are no precise provisions on who can carry out further reviews and evaluations.
If external companies are entrusted with reviewing and evaluating bids, they must be aware that the bids are confidential and respectfully respect this fact.
They may only make proposals for decisions to the sponsor.
In the Czech republic tenders must be reviewed and evaluated by the commission, appointed by the contracting authority, which shall draw up a report with a proposal for the conclusion of the contract.
However, in both countries, the final decision depends on the sponsor.
If you are in Germany, the documents and statements required in connection with the submission of the tenders incomplete, the applicants concerned must then submit the required documents within six days.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
If the tenderers fail to fulfil this obligation, their tenders shall be excluded.
In the Czech Republic, the contracting authority may decide whether to give the tenderer the opportunity to supplement the missing documents.
If the candidate does not submit them, he must be expelled.
In Germany, it is necessary to review not only the total price, but also the unit price.
If the pricing structure of the menu shows that prices for a part of the overall project were estimated to disproportionately high or low, applicants must be asked for an explanation.
If they do not provide an explanation and if the contracting authority can demonstrate that the tender contains compensatory prices, such tenders must be excluded.
It is intended to prevent bidders submission of price calculations based on the assumption that for each part of the overall project will be made in substantial quantitative changes, which can lead to a significant increase in the cost of the project.
In the Czech Republic, the total price of the work is evaluated, and the prices of individual parts are not examined in detail.
Valuation compensation is not a reason to exclude the offer.
In Germany, a contract cannot be awarded to a tenderer who offers a disproportionately high or low price.
If one or several offers budget differ by 10 % or more compared to the price estimated by the contracting entity, or compared to other bids, the tenderers must demonstrate that their offer was plausible and convincing zkalkulována.
If they are unable to do so, the sponsor should exclude them.
In the Czech republic may be tender after the price review is revoked, unless they have been received only bids with unreasonably low prices and bidders, these prices nezdůvodnili.
If the tender price is substantially higher than the estimate of the contracting authority, is not a reason for refusing to specify to the tenderers the contract (unlike the German procurement law).
If there is a suspicion in Germany of conduct intended to restrict competition, the Sponsor shall report this to the competent superior authority without delay.
The latter must decide on the next procedure and if it is appropriate to inform the antitrust office or law enforcement authorities.
Furthermore, it must approve (e.g., when a contract exceeds 50 000 € and the contract has been awarded to the bidder with the lowest bid), whether the contract will be awarded during the discussion of the contract or whether the tender procedure shall be cancelled.
The Czech rules do not regulate this area.
Main control findings
BRH
Verification of suitability and award criteria
Most of the procurement procedures examined were in compliance with the relevant requirements.
In the case of certain recommendations of potential suppliers, made by self-employed persons, not themselves contracting authorities the suitability of the applicants.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In some cases, the procurement procedures has not been submitted sufficient documentation about it, whether in the choice of taking the sponsor shall consider all of the published assessment criteria or whether the selection decision was based only on the criterion of price.
Selection of stakeholders and confidentiality of offers
Some contracting authorities use the services of unauthorised persons, for example, self-employed workers or employees of construction authorities.
You have been included in the planning or implementation process of construction projects, to perform the functions which should be held exclusively by the sponsor.
Authorities tried to justify this fact, your lack of human resources in the sector.
In some cases, the use of self-employed professionals to review offers the services of persons who were not formally bound to respect the confidentiality of tenders and to perform with due care the performance of its obligations resulting from the contract.
As for the contracting authorities, as a rule, the absence of conclusive evidence on whether the menu in the custody of self-employed experts were available only to the designated persons.
Review and mathematical check of tenders
Some contracting authorities handed the open envelope to further examination of self-employed professionals, without having first conducted the prescribed examination of the tenders and math review and without documented results of these checks.
In the event of any intent to manipulate, third parties may have made changes to tenders which could not have been identified by the contracting authority.
The examination of documents revealed a number of cases where unusual elements in the tenders were not adequately marked or where price and product data were missing.
Performance audits
Model checking one sponsor revealed that in 75 % of cases of procurement procedures is advantageous tender deviated by more than 10 % from the pre-estimated cost.
One of the twenty tendering procedures was cancelled due to inadequate tender prices.
In many cases, there was a lack of evidence or sufficient documentation to verify bids or negotiate with bidders for further clarification.
In many cases, detailed information such as unit prices of the most important invoiced items was also missing.
Changes in market prices or increases in material costs were often cited as the reason for the derogations.
Contracting entities have argued that identifying and demonstrating countervailing prices is difficult.
In the case of one invitation to tender made by an entity outside the scope of normal contracting authorities, a 66% lower price was offered compared to the original cost estimate.
No data were recorded on the closer examination of the cost or on the identification of the reasons for the deviations.
When clarifying this question, find sponsor no hint of price-dumping by the applicant, which contract was eventually awarded.
It was therefore not clarified whether the initial cost estimate was exorbitant or whether the price offered was too low.
Later, the sponsor classified this bidder as a" low-cost company " that was unable to meet either qualitative requirements or terms.
In another procurement procedure, the contracting authority awarded the contract to a tenderer whose price was 35% higher than the original cost estimate.
The sponsor did not cancel the tender procedure and featured the unfounded argument that the said candidate would be expected that the determination of their prices set at a disproportionately high cost.
Suspected irregularities
Two cases of irregularities were found with one contracting authority and they were reported to the firm responsible for technical supervision.
In one Procurement Procedure, two bidders submitted bids containing an identical price calculation, which prompted the contracting authority to exclude both bids.
The checks have not shown any significant deficiencies in the application of other provisions.
Sao
Verification of suitability
In many construction events, such as university buildings, roads and railways, contracting entities shall exclude the tenderer from participation in a procurement procedure, although they did not meet the requirements of the contracting entity indicated in tender conditions, or they did not substantiate qualifications to the extent required, or, conversely, one submitter failed to substantiate or explain the reason for delisting candidate, which requirements it meets.
Evaluation
For the construction of the wastewater treatment plant, the individual award criteria for the contractor were established, but the contracting authority did not respect them during the procedure.
For the action in the field of railway infrastructure development, the weighting of the award criteria was not established at the start of the procedure, but only at the beginning of the evaluation.
For the road repair project, the evaluation of the "shortening of construction time" criterion was not done correctly.
Bidders in second and third place were incorrectly assessed for a greater reduction in the construction time than indicated in their bids.
Documentation of the reasons for choosing a candidate
The contracting authority did not establish, on the basis of what criteria it assessed the tenders received and how it selected the most suitable of them.
Correctness of selection of contractors of small-scale contracts associated with the construction of a road circuit with an estimated price of up to 500 thousand.
Czk was not possible to verify, as the suppliers were selected only on the basis of telephone consultation about the price and date of performance, evidence of these negotiations, however, were not provided.
Summary
In both countries, the rules for validating and evaluating offers correspond to EU requirements.
However, they differ with regard to the specific steps of management and the selection of individuals in the management included.
Unlike the Czech republic, in Germany, these steps of the procurement process governed by stricter and more detailed requirements, especially with regard to the application of the universal principle and the protection of the tenders.
The same applies to the rules for verifying the appropriateness of the prices offered.
In both countries, in some cases, the inspections found that the essential process steps in the verification and evaluation of tenders were not at all documented, and if yes, then only partially.
The Absence of control instruments and transparency in decision-making during the examination and evaluation of tenders allows manipulation.
Checks have shown serious defects, such as the transmission of tenders to third parties without prior due verification and documenting of tenders by the contracting authority.
If the authorities delegated to a third party the performance of functions associated with the screening and evaluation of tenders, are necessary corresponding measures and enhanced control measures against the increased possibility of manipulation.
In checking the validity of prices, the German contracting authorities controlled did not use in all cases a complete set of available instruments and did not deal with their own pricing structure.
In the Czech Republic, deficiencies were identified in the assessment of the suitability of tenders and the application of evaluation criteria.
Completion of the procurement procedure
After examination and evaluation of tenders, the procurement process is completed by award of the contract or cancellation of the procedure.
Requirements for European law and Prevention of corruption
In the case of the European procedure, all tenderers must be informed in advance of the award decision.
Suppliers shall have the opportunity to review the decision taken within a limited period of 10 or 15 days and to request its review, where appropriate.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The period of 10 days shall apply to electronic submissions and 15 days to other submissions.
The contract shall not be concluded before the expiry of that period or before the decision of the review procedure.
If the review body rejects the complaint and confirms the decision, candidates and tenderers must be given the opportunity to have the application of the tendering law reviewed by an independent court.
This measure ensures that no contracting authority will be able to circumvent the legal protection of suppliers by promptly implementing the decision of the procurement procedure.
The procuring entity shall duly document the conduct of the procedure.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
Both countries have implemented information obligations management.
In both countries, the final decision on the outcome of the procurement procedure rests with the contracting authority.
However, the latter cannot arbitrarily deviate from the results of a properly conducted examination and evaluation.
The contracting authority is to conclude a contract within the specified time.
This is due to the fact that the tenderer is not bound by his tender after the expiry of this period.
The content of the contract must not deviate from the winning offer.
Unsuccessful bidders should be informed of the outcome in a timely manner, stating the reason why their bid was not accepted.
Cancellation of the procurement procedure is permissible only if certain conditions are met, e.g. if the prices in the bids do not meet specifications.
Different provisions
In the Czech Republic, the mandatory waiting period before the conclusion of the contract 10 or 15 days applies to both European and national procedures.
In Germany, the equivalent provision applies only to European procedures.
In all other procedures in Germany, tenderers may not be informed of the award of the contract before deciding on its EU provisions and the Review Award.
In the Czech republic shall be the procurement procedure shall be cancelled in the case that received only one bid or only one offer meets the requirements for consideration and evaluation.
In Germany shall be awarded the contract, even if it was received only one bid, and provided that the offer meets the conditions set out in the tender documentation and is cost effective.
Main control findings
BRH
The inspections found few irregularities in the completion of the audited procurement processes.
In some cases, companies have received letters of authorisation before the notification period expires, which may invalidate the contract.
In several open procedures, authorising letters also contained modifications incompatible with the content of the tender, such as new deadlines.
In some cases, contracting authorities did not meet the deadlines for awarding the contract.
In one open procedure chosen by the contracting entity a second most advantageous bid, because the bidder offers a price of more than 50 % lower already declined to fulfil the contract for the originally offered price.
Sao
In the reconstruction of and construction of a high school sponsor in one case has not concluded with the contractor of the contract in accordance with the draft agreement contained in the offer to the selected candidate.
For some actions the repair and maintenance of roads, construction of motorways and the ring road contracts have been concluded later than provided by law.
The construction work in the former military újezdech the contracting authority has sent notification about the selection of the most suitable tenders to all tenderers after expiry of the statutory period.
Summary
Both countries have implemented EU rules on the termination of the procurement procedure.
Legal protection of unsuccessful candidates contributes to the reduction of corruption.
The Czech Public Procurement Act includes the Institute of legal protection even in cases of contracts below EU limits.
In both countries, it was found that a limited time limit for the conclusion of the contract was exceeded.
This can cause adverse economic consequences and increase the risk of manipulation.
In the future, contracting entities should eliminate such shortcomings in the conclusion of the procurement procedure.
Documentation, notifications, information obligations
Tender process with all its individual phases, relevant findings and decisions, including the appropriate justification must be transparently documented.
The completion of the procurement procedure at European level must be published.
Data on procurement procedures are summarised in EU statistics.
Requirements for European law and Prevention of corruption
The obligation to document the procurement procedure is in line with the fundamental requirement of the principle of transparency, applied at EU-wide level.
Only the good and time-relevant documentation of choices and reasoning gives a guarantee of transparency in the process of the procurement procedure, and, above all, guarantees an effective legal protection of the interests of each applicant in cases where the value of the contract exceeds the european thresholds.
Appropriate documentation is also an essential part of anti-corruption measures, because the obligation of the detailed justification of individual decisions and their justification significantly reduces the scope for manipulation.
In the case of European procurement procedures, the contracting authority must notify their completion of the EU's Office of Official Publications within 48 days of the date of award of the contract.
The authority publishes the notification in the Official Journal of the EU and thus fulfils the transparency requirement.
The sponsor must summarize the essential information about their procurement procedures and communicate them to the European commission via the competent national ministries.
On this basis, the European Commission publishes annual statistics, which allow to get an overview of the development of the single market in the field of construction.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar provisions
Both countries fully transpose into their national laws the provisions of european law on the documentation and notification obligations.
The provisions relating to documentation and notification for the purposes of European statistics are almost identical in both countries.
Different provisions
In the Czech Republic, the obligation to notify the award of the contract applies not only to European procedures, but also to national procurement procedures.
The deadline for notification is only 15 days from the conclusion of the contract.
In Germany, the obligation of notification of procurement management, in addition to those which are compulsory under european law, applies only to the limited management in excess of the limit of 25 thousand. € (625 ths. Czk) and direct management in excess of the limit of 15 thousand € (375 thous. Rubles) including VAT.
Only interested parties shall be informed below this limit.
Main control findings
BRH
Documentation
A large number of assignments have not been fully documented.
The notification did not contain all the necessary information, such as the reasons for the supply specifications and national rules.
In the case of one management sponsor did not explain why he closed a contract with the bidder whose offer did not contain the mandatory particulars.
In several cases, some of the required records were also missing.
Publication of the award of the contract
In the case of certain European procedures, the contracting authority erred in the publication of the notice.
In the case of several assignments, there was no evidence of publication of the notice.
Notification obligation
Statistically verified files included the required minimum of information and were created and sent on time.
Preliminary transparency
In most cases, the sponsor disclosed information about the outcome of the contract.
In the case of one contracting authority, contract information was not disclosed due to a communication error.
It took the sponsor six months to notice the error.
As a result, the outcome of the proceeding was not disclosed during this time.
Sao
Documentation
For actions relating to the organisation of large sports events have been identified considerable shortcomings in documentation during the procurement procedure, such as incorrect information about the bid prices in the protocols of the meetings of the evaluation commission.
In addition, some documents on the opening of envelopes were not signed.
Publication of the award of the contract
In the preparation of the repair and maintenance of roads, construction of motorways and the ring road was the notice of contract award sent after the deadline, or has not been published.
Summary
The provisions on documentation and reporting and notification obligations include the european requirements and are in both countries almost identical.
This generally ensures transparency of procurement procedures and final selection.
Czech notification obligations are somewhat stricter compared to German ones.
The inspections revealed weaknesses substantially reducing the value of documentation as a means of preventing corruption.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Authorities should continue to strengthen the transparency of its procurement procedures and to fully meet reporting and notification requirements.
Summary evaluation and recommendations
Parallel control of the SAO and BRH were focused on two areas, which are for the procurement process, substantial as in the Czech republic and in Germany, and that the application of the procurement law of the EU and the prevention of corruption.
EU legislation gives an opportunity to international competition within the EU with a view to creating a single European market.
The aim of measures to prevent corruption is not only to avoid it or at least limit it, but also to prevent financial damage and possible losses of confidence in the integrity of government.
Held control of the findings of the two audit institutions – SAO and BRH – having regard to the application of the procurement law of both countries and the comparison of its relevant provisions give an inside look at the common and different elements that can be both countries to assist in the further development and application of the law.
Application of EU procurement law
Both countries transposed EU public procurement law into their national legislation.
In both countries there are important common base for public procurement and fulfillment of fundamental requirements in the areas of: competition; equal treatment of candidates; transparency of procurement procedures.
Contracting entities reinforce these requirements in part by very large measures.
The Czech Republic has laid down provisions on public procurement requiring European procedures as well as those which are below EU limits and are therefore governed by national legislation.
However, checks have shown that contracting entities are not always fully compliant with all relevant provisions of EU requirements.
The German authorities should continue to improve the quality of its procurement procedures, to eliminate the mentioned discrepancies with regard to the implementation of EU requirements.
In the Czech Republic, the checks identified risks affecting economy and achieving value for money.
In particular, the incomplete definition of the object of public procurement, which resulted in additional work, which were often awarded in violation of the law, inadequate definition of the expected prices and further about the required qualifications of narrowing the possible range of applicants and thus decreasing competition, in particular in the field of traffic engineering.
Prevention of corruption
Joint controls were not intended to detect corruption cases.
The reason was that both the BRH and the Sao did not have sufficient tools to do so.
May, however, review whether the competent authorities of both countries shall take measures to limit corruption and manipulation in public procurement and how are these measures applied.
As for the Prevention of corruption, both countries focused on different aspects.
In particular, German provisions give scope for wide and unlimited competition, transparency and controls as a central element of preventing corruption.
In particular, Czech regulations aim at strengthening the transparency of procurement procedures.
BRH
In Germany, there are general principles of prevention of corruption that apply to the entire federal administration.
These principles have also been integrated into public procurement requirements and have been adopted to meet the specific needs of such procurement.
The relevant provisions specify, at times and very accurately, ways to comply with the requirements for the Prevention of corruption during the procurement procedure and the choice of persons incorporated therein.
In the opinion of the BRH is the principle preference of open procurement procedures and calls for the participation of a particularly suitable instrument significantly reducing the risk of corruption in public procurement, while the reduction in competition increases the risk of manipulation.
Analysis of risks and adequate controls (in particular the principle of cross-checks), transparency requirements, documentation of the procurement procedure and various organizational measures are also an effective mechanism for prevention of corruption and manipulation.
Therefore, the BRH does not feel the need for substantial changes to the current provisions that public institutions must comply with in public procurement.
Anti-corruption measures are widely applied in practice.
The irregularities found in some areas highlighted weaknesses in compliance with some requirements.
Therefore, contracting entities should provide their employees with further education, and the relaying is so with anti-corruption requirements and further increase their awareness in this area.
A significant part of the exposed weaknesses relate to activities that the construction administration has delegated to private entrepreneurs.
However, the Absence of adequate controls in delegating powers increases the risk of abuse.
Activities prone to manipulation and corruption should therefore be transmitted to third parties only if the administration has to guarantee a sufficient degree of protection against tampering.
Sao
In the Czech Republic, anti-corruption strategies have been adopted at the government level, which also significantly affect public procurement.
Audit SAO take place in the period, when there was a realisation of one of the most important parts of this strategy, and that significant amendments to the law on public procurement and the adoption of subsequent implementing legislation.
The strategy adopted and the new legislation can be effective steps to improve the state.
Under the new regulations, the sponsor, for example, must justify the effectiveness of the public procurement, determination of the expected value of the contract, the adequacy of the requirements on the qualifications, the determination of the basic evaluation criteria and method of evaluation of tenders and all duly zdokladovat and publish.
Recommendation
Overall, both the SAO and the BRH have favourable views on the ways in which EU requirements are implemented.
Their wide application in practice has confirmed that the EU requirements on competition, equal treatment and transparency form an appropriate basis for public procurement within the EU.
The transnational model, established in the EU, can also serve as a base for similar projects aimed at facilitating and promoting international competition.
Taking into account the large potential of material and intangible damages incurred as a result of manipulation and corruption in connection to public procurement insist BRH and NKU on the fact that it is the duty of contracting authorities to continue the measures against corruption and manipulation and improve them where possible.
Particularly the organizational structure and processes, procurement procedures should be continuously monitored in terms of weaknesses and risks, in order to identify the need for corrective actions and respond appropriately to the.
In comparison with the practice in Germany showed that in the Czech republic should increase the share of open procurement procedures that give the space competition and substantially reduce the possibility of corrupt behaviour.
Procurement may also have a positive impact on the price achieved in parts where it is permissible and appropriate for the contracting authority. A higher number of applicants puts pressure on the price achieved.
The provision of its organisation also affects the procurement process.
In Germany her provide a special state organization, while in the Czech republic it with the exception of the transport structures, organised by the central authorities themselves or through contracting organizations.
Both the SAO and the BRH want to further develop knowledge in their work where it is appropriate and address it with their parliament and government beyond their joint project.
In addition, they are convinced that the principles of the procurement law and their implementation, as described in this report, will be subject to interest even at the level of the International organisation of supreme audit institutions (INTOSAI), as the mentioned principles and findings are of general importance for effective fight against corruption and to guarantee that public contracts are awarded in the mode of a well-functioning and fair competition and that it achieved value for money.

Joint final report on the results of parallel inspections of the excise administration in the SR and the Czech Republic
Joint final report
May 2017
Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic
Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic
Introductory word
Presented to the joint report informs of the progress and outcome of international cooperation in the parallel controls, which implement the Supreme audit office of the Slovak republic and the Supreme audit office of the Czech republic, focusing on the administration of excise taxes in the years 2012-2015.
Cooperation between the supreme audit institutions of the two countries was implemented on the basis of the treaty on cooperation among the SAO SR and SAO of the CZECH republic in the performance of parallel audits on the management of excise duties, which was concluded in August 2015.
The theme of the parallel controls were selected on the basis of the fact that both the member states of the EU are based on common european legislation with the aim to find out how it is applied at the national level, how the system is set up the administration of excise duties and what are systems in SLOVAKIA and in the CZECH republic different.
The greatest benefit of the control actions carried out was the exchange of experience, the identification of differences and the detection of good practice.
Last but not least, the benefit was the finding that the international comparability of data on the performance and efficiency of Excise Management is very limited without the implementation of parallel controls.

on the results of parallel controls of the SPD administration in the SR and the Czech Republic
Summary and evaluation
The legislation on excise duties in the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic and their administration is in line with EU legislation and significantly exceeds EU requirements.
Between the adjustment of excise taxes in the SR and CR differences were found in the CZECH republic contributes to the effective administration of excise taxes verification of the economic stability of applicants for the issue of permits and the mandatory marking and coloring selected mineral oils and some other oils; IN the SR is the distribution of control marks easier than in the CZECH republic and less burden on the tax administrator.
In the fight against the evasion of excise taxes as a good practice in both countries proved supervision over the movement of raw tobacco or tobacco raw materials, the implementation of the institute's distributor of motor fuel and registration of dealers of consumer packaging of alcohol.
Excise income in the SR and the Czech Republic is growing more slowly than other tax revenues.
The EU's objectives of reducing labour taxation, introducing eco-austerity measures and reducing dependence on tobacco and alcohol have not yet been met in the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic, including because there is no indexation of excise rates in both countries.
This has resulted in reducing the significance of excise taxes in total tax revenues and as a result of the growing purchasing power of the real reduction of the tax burden on consumption taxes.
The introduction of environmental measures become long-term financially supports, however, these measures have a negative impact on revenue from excise taxes, which in the future will need to be replaced by other revenues or by reducing expenditure of the state.
Administrative expenses incurred for the administration of excise taxes in the CZECH republic and SLOVAKIA in the long term grow, in particular due to wage growth, and their efficiency decreases.
In SR this efficiency negatively affecting also expenditure on the computerisation of the administration of excise duties (IT expenditure) and the expenditure incurred on wage of employees performing the permanent tax supervision of tax warehouses for alcohol.
The electronisation of excise duty management in the SR did not significantly reduce the number of tax managers.
The Czech Sao and Sao SR recommend that the Sao SR reconsider the merits of the exercise of permanent tax supervision in alcohol tax warehouses.
In the CZECH republic the efficiency of administrative expenditure influenced by the fact that the Customs administration of the CZECH republic has not applied in the audited period, the procedures which would lead to a reduction in personnel performance management excise taxes.
The number of comparable administrative tasks of tax administrators was in the SR and the CZECH republic in the individual years of the period audited similar, yet the number of comparable tax entities is in SR by about one-third lower than in the CZECH republic.
Tax administrators in the Czech Republic perform administrative tasks mainly in the form of physical exercise of tax supervision, while tax administrators in the Czech Republic emphasise remote supervision and risk analysis.
The administration of excise duties in the SR is more administratively demanding than in the Czech Republic and, given the ratio of the number of tax acts to the number of entities, more costly.
The electronization of excise tax administration in the SR and the Czech Republic took place in different areas.
In the SR is fully elektronizována administration of tax declarations for excise taxes, in the CZECH republic are electronically transmitted documents proving the taxation of selected products in free tax circulation.
Both methods of electronization promote effective management of excise taxes, and therefore the Czech Sao and Sao SR recommend applying them not only in both countries.
The total expenditure on the implementation of the EMCS could not be compared, since the FDC provided data on expenditure only for the upgrade of the system in the period 2011-2015, but expenditure was also spent before that period.
Expenditure incurred in that period only for the upgrade EMCS have been in SR for about 20 % higher than the expenditure incurred in the CZECH republic as on the introduction of EMCS, so to upgrade this system for more than ten years.
Excise managers in the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic did not achieve comparable values of qualitative indicators when spending comparable expenses.
The level of supervision is comparable in both countries, but in SR excise management is significantly more resource intensive.
The introduction of an electronic system for monitoring the movement of excisable products (EMCS) occurred to streamline the administration of excise taxes, however, in the SR in a lower extent, since the introduction of the system and its modernization have been incurred significantly higher expenses than in the CZECH republic.
Basic information
Cooperation between the two audit institutions took place on the basis of the Agreement on cooperation in the implementation of parallel checks aimed at the administration of the excise tax of 18. 8. 2015.
The Czech Sao and Sao SR agreed to carry out parallel checks, which will primarily focus on the issue of Excise Management and the results of which will allow analysis, comparison and evaluation of the facts identified.
Common audit issues were agreed on which parallel controls were based.
Characteristics of the subject and objectives of parallel control:
The aim of the parallel controls was to compare the performance of excise managers, taking into account qualitative and quantitative indicators, and to identify weaknesses in the Excise Management Process.
In particular, the following main audit questions should have been answered:
Did the excise administrators in the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic achieve comparable qualitative indicators when spending comparable expenses?
Has the introduction of the excise Movement and Control System (EMCS) made excise management more efficient and the expenditure incurred in implementing it effectively?
Carried out parallel controls should be identified the causes of the significant differences affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of tax administration in the CZECH republic and SLOVAKIA, in particular in the field of legislation and in the adjustment of the organizational structure.

Tobacco products
Restrictions on the sale of tobacco products with an old tax rate
In response to the long-term underachievement of budgeted excise revenue from tobacco products, the Czech Republic introduced effective from 1. 12. 2014 restrictions on the sale of tobacco products with the old tax rate in the event of a change in the tax rate.
Excise tax on tobacco products is paid by using tobacco stickers.
The use of a tobacco sticker means its placement on a unit package (section 116 of the excise duty act).
For the use of the rates of excise taxes shall manufacture a tobacco product in the state intended for the final consumer, which may not occur to its removal from storage, delivery, dispatch or sale of, or sale to the ultimate consumer.
Letter of the alphabet characterizing the rate of excise duty is indicated on the tobacco label along with the price for the final consumer of cigarettes, on the sticker it states the number of pieces in the package, or quantity of smoking tobacco in kilograms.
The tobacco sticker has no identifier.
The length of the transitional period for the sale of unit packets of cigarettes, intended for direct consumption and bearing a tobacco label, with the previous (old) tax rate was established until the expiry of the last day of the second calendar month after the effectiveness of the new rates of excise duty.
From the development of the harvesting of tobacco stamps in 2014 and the comparison with developments in previous years shows that manufacturers of tobacco products each year significantly předzásobili tobacco products with the "old" rate of tax, thereby causing an effective shift of the efficiency of the "new" tax rates by approximately one year.
Raw tobacco tax
Because of the abuse of raw tobacco to manufacturing tobacco products without a warrant, the tax administrator and the non-payment of the excise tax was as a measure against tax fraud introduced a tax on raw tobacco and monitoring the handling of raw tobacco.
Effective from 1. 7. 2015 shall be subject to the excise tax raw tobacco that has not been used or supplied for the manufacture of tobacco products, supplied to another member state or third country, or which had not been shown the origin, the purpose of the use or person that has been or is to be raw tobacco delivered.
Restrictions on the handling of raw tobacco
Measures, such as supervision and control of shipments and production of tobacco products, marking of unit packing tape and restrictions on the sale of the designated places, has been supplemented by restrictions to dispose of the raw tobacco.
Production facilities for the processing of tobacco raw materials and the production of tobacco products shall not be subject to the supervision of the customs authorities.
Store raw tobacco for any purpose other than for the manufacture of tobacco products may only a registered person, such tobacco shall not be further processed or edited.
The registered person can only be a person fulfilling the personal conditions of the applicant, the statutory body and the responsible representative, which applies throughout the registration period.
The terms and conditions of registration are: a) permission to operate a business allowing the performance of the activities of the person storing the raw tobacco, b) reliability, c) bezdlužnost, d) the fact that the person storing the raw tobacco was not specifically forbidden to the activities preventing the performance of its activities, e) the fact that the person storing the raw tobacco is not in liquidation or in bankruptcy, f) the granting of bail in the amount of 20 000 000 Czk (i.e. about 740 000 €).

Excise tax legislation in SR
The legal framework governing the area of consumption taxes in SLOVAKIA comes from EU legislation, and thus helps create a uniform tax system.
Individual types of excise taxes are determined by the legislation of the SR, which is similar to the legislation of surrounding countries.
Definition of legislation in the SR
The legislative regulation of excise duties is provided by four laws according to individual subjects of taxation.
Harmonisation was achieved through the adoption of the following excise tax laws: act no 98/2004 Z. z., on excise duty on mineral oils, law no 106/2004 Z. z., on excise duty on tobacco products, law no 530/2011 Z. z., on excise duty on alcoholic beverages, law no 609/2007 Z. z., on excise duty on electricity, coal and natural gas.
All excise laws are the regulations of substantive law and deal with the taxation of the object of excise duties in the tax territory.
Law no 563/2009 Z. z. tax administration (tax code) is the precept of procedural law, governs the administration of taxes, the rights and obligations of taxpayers and other persons.
This legal framework transposed the various provisions of Council Directive 2008/118/EC of 16. December 2008 concerning the general arrangements for excise duty and repealing directive 92/12/EEC, and transposed the provisions of other directives and legislation of the European community.
Structure of amendments to the legislation for individual types of excise duties in relation to the subject of control in the SR
Since 2011, passed legislation relating to the management of excise taxes several fundamental changes according to the structure of excise taxes.
In the EMCS system was the monitoring of the transport of selected products subject to excise duties in the regime of conditional exemption from the tax changed from the paper of the accompanying administrative document to a solely electronic system, where are these transport tracked in real-time.
Under the EMCS electronic system, a suspension of access to the EMCS was introduced in 2015.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The customs office has the possibility to suspend the access right in justified fear of an unpaid or undetermined tax from previous tax period and its unenforceability.
This applies to the maturity of the tax, since the excise goods are required for the composition of collateral, which, however, is released by the termination of transport.
Excise duty on mineral oils
A major change in the administration of the excise duty on mineral oils occurred in 2011, when the possibility of using so-called red diesel was abolished.
The marked gas oil, also commonly called red diesel, was among the mineral oils.
In the past red diesel used on specific statutorily defined purposes, e.g. in agriculture, and its use was discounted at a lower rate of excise duty.
This change had a positive impact on the revenue part of the state budget.
The aim of the abolition of red diesel was an effort to reduce the public deficit, simplify the system of taxation of mineral oils and reduce the administrative burden of the concerned business entities.
In 2012, a new type of tax entity was created, namely a fuel seller.
The purpose of this statutory change was to introduce a registration obligation for all service stations.
Clarification of the movement of taxed petrol and diesel is linked to the obligation to purchase petrol and diesel from a fuel distributor.
In 2014 there were introduced new concepts of tax entities, and distributor of fuel and the consumer of fuel.
That change contributed to the elimination of tax evasion on petrol and diesel and made the movement of these fuels clear (see Annex 4, diagram a).
As part of the fight against tax evasion, statutory provisions on the registration of tax entities trading in lubricating and base oils were extended.
However, in the SR, these mineral oils are not subject to the obligation of marking by an indicator.
Excise duty on tobacco products
In the framework of combating tax evasion and monitoring of tobacco raw material, the scope of the tobacco raw material Act was expanded and a new tax entity was introduced – the tobacco raw material trader.
Tobacco raw material is not a harmonised tobacco product and its movement is not monitored within the EU.
In addition, an obligation was introduced to register technological equipment for the production of tobacco products.
The legislation has brought a new system of ordering, assessing, printing, distribution, and use of control stamps intended for labeling of consumer packaging of tobacco products.
Cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos and tobacco are marked with a checkmark.
Under the new system the customer must check marks to request the customs office to issue control marks electronically, through the information system on collection of check marks.
This step introduced electronic communication between the tax entity and the tax administrator.
One state stamp printer was established-in the Kremnice Mint.
The exercise of tax oversight over the printing of stamps has also been introduced.
The changes contributed significantly to the elimination of tax evasion.
A new system of printing control marks strengthens the system of control of the goods, because of the control mark is generated, a unique identification number, through which it is possible to simply verify, whether the goods originated from legitimate sources.
Unique twelve-digit identification number (1.–2. the site forms a checksum; 3. the location determines whether the code belongs to the control mark or to a group of packages; 4. the site is a series identifier; 5.–8. the site is the alphanumeric part of the sequence; 9.–12. the place is the decimal part of the sequence) can also be applied in the form of a two-dimensional barcode.
The check mark intended for labeling of cigarettes shall be further listed the price of cigarettes, the sign for the validity of the rates of excise duty, number of pieces of cigarettes in the consumer package and length of cigarettes.
Excise duty on alcoholic beverages
The biggest legislative change has touched alcohol, wine and beer, because the original three rules of substantive law have been abolished and there was one common law on excise duty on alcoholic beverages.
The law was drafted, in particular because of the need of the general solution to the issue of the taxation of alcoholic beverages, the solution of their production, monitoring of movement, securing taxes, as well as the need to improve the business environment in the region, streamline the performance of the tax administration, reduce the administrative burden for small and medium-sized entrepreneurs.
A new way of addressing the issue of the taxation of individual types of alcoholic beverages has introduced the use of a single rate of excise tax on alcoholic beverage and to take into account the volumetric percentage of the actual alcohol content.
For non-sparkling wine, sparkling wine and fermented beverages is taken into account, the volumetric percentage of the actual alcohol content in the final product.
The concentration of beer is also expressed in the percentage by volume of the actual alcoholic strength of the finished product.
Was introduced the category of small producers of fermented beverages, whose essence lies in the exemption from excise tax for natural person, which makes a fizzy fermented beverage for their own consumption and for the consumption of his household not exceeding in amount 1 000 gallons for the marketing year.
The legislation brought a new system of ordering, assessing, printing, distribution and use of stamps intended for labelling consumer packages of alcohol.
Under the new system the customer must check marks to request the customs office to issue control marks electronically, through the information system on collection of check marks.
This step introduced electronic communication between the tax entity and the tax administrator.
One state stamp printer was established-in the Kremnice Mint.
The exercise of tax oversight over the printing of stamps has also been introduced.
The changes contributed significantly to the elimination of tax evasion (see Annex 4, diagram B) and the elimination of counterfeiting of control marks.
A new system of printing control marks strengthens the system of control of the goods, because of the control mark is generated, a unique identification number, through which it is possible to simply verify, whether the goods originated from legitimate sources.
Unique twelve-digit identification number (1.–2. the site forms a checksum; 3. the location determines whether the code belongs to the control mark or to a group of packages; 4. the site is a series identifier; 5.–8. the site is the alphanumeric part of the sequence; 9.–12. the place is the decimal part of the sequence) can also be applied in the form of a two-dimensional barcode.

In order to strengthen the fight against tax fraud, a bail of 20 million was introduced in the Czech Republic for fuel distributors. CZK (i.e. € 740 thousand).
As a result of the introduction of this measure, the number of fuel distributors decreased from 1,891 entities in 2013 to 174 in 2014 (i.e. a decrease of 1,717 tax entities).
In SR, a similar Institute of a fuel distributor is introduced, but without the composition of the bail required to secure excise duty on mineral oils.
Sr registered 303 distributors in 2014 and 407 distributors in 2015.
In SR is introduced the institute of a retailer of fuel and consumer of fuel, which, permits are issued by the locally competent customs office.
There is no such Institute in the Czech Republic.
In the Czech Republic, selected mineral oils are labelled, and some other mineral oils are also labelled, in the SR after the abolition of the so-called red diesel, the marking of mineral oils is not applied.
In the CZECH republic the control tape for marking of alcohol contains eight-digit individual code that is used to verify the origin of ethyl alcohol and dvanáctimístný registration code with an indication of lihovitosti spirits, according to which a record is kept of the inspection belt.
Destruction, loss and return of the control tape are entered in the registry the following working day.

In the SR, in the production of alcohol not only in consumer packaging, the constant presence of the tax administrator is required.
In the CZECH republic is in the manufacture of ethyl alcohol in a consumer packaging required a special form of registration of persons required to mark the alcohol with a condition of bail in favour of the tax administrator in the amount of 100 000 Czk (i.e. 3 700 €) up to 5 000 000 Czk (i.e. 185 000 €) according to the quantity taken control of the tapes and the installation of tracking devices with constant access of the tax administrator.
Evaluation
The legislation of the CZECH republic and SLOVAKIA highly exceeds the minimum requirements of the EU on the subject, and the administration of excise duties and responds to identified risks from other member states as well as the risks identified in the tax territories.
Legislative changes adopted during the period under review allow tax authorities to prevent possible tax evasion more extensively.
In the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic in the fight against tax evasion in the form of misuse of tobacco raw materials (e.g. sheets), excise duty on raw tobacco or tobacco raw materials was introduced in addition to EU legislation.
Although the raw tobacco or tobacco material are not harmonised tobacco product, monitor the CR and SR of their movement.
The Czech Sao and Sao SR may recommend that that measure be applied in other EU member states.
In the CZECH republic good practice has shown that examining the economic stability of applicants for the issue of permits according to the law on excise taxes has proved successful, because it reduces the risk of tax arrears.
For this reason, both audit institutions recommend applying such checks also in SR conditions.
Distribution of control marks is in the SR more efficient than in the CZECH republic, because the burden of the customs authorities of the costs associated with transport between the printer and the customer control of the tapes and patches.
The financial administration of the SR has a better overview of the existence and location of technological equipment for the production of tobacco products.
However, in the Czech Republic it is more effective to collect tax on tobacco products, since the order of the tobacco sticker itself is a tax return with subsequent payment of tax.
The financial administration of SR has a better overview of the points of sale of propellants thanks to the introduction of the institutes "fuel seller" and "consumer of propellants".
The introduction of mandatory marking of mineral oils in the Czech Republic makes it easier to control the misuse of mineral oils at a reduced rate of tax or exempt.
In the CZECH republic (2013) and in SR (2014) introduced a new control tape, or mark containing the identification code.
The control tape in the Czech Republic also contains the registration code, while in the SR the new legislation has refrained from introducing it.
It is not yet possible to evaluate the effects due to the short effectiveness of legislative changes.
Introduction effective labeling of consumer packaging of alcohol control mark, or tape is an effective measure in the fight against tax evasion.
The SAO and the SAO of the Czech Republic may also recommend the introduction of this control measure in other member states.
The SR's attitude to the conditions for the distribution of alcohol characterizes the clientele approach, which does not block the funds of tax entities.
In contrast, the approach of the CZECH republic is rather restrictive, since it introduces a bail burdensome cash flow tax entities, but more reduces the risk of tax arrears.
Evolution of excise revenue
The excise tax is an indirect tax introduced by the state in order to increase the revenues of the state budget and also regulate the amount of sold goods, whose consumption is deemed harmful for the individual and/or company (regulatory function of taxes).
According to the commission communication: Europe 2020 – strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth of 3. 3. 2010 under the flagship resource-intensive Europe initiative, the European Commission intends to improve the framework for the use of market-based instruments, including in the form of a revision of energy taxation with a focus on reducing energy and resource consumption.
To the fulfillment of the intent of the EC member states should endeavour, in the framework of a "greening" of tax systems to shift the tax burden from labour, inter alia, on energy and environmental taxation.
Collection of tax revenue from excise taxes in the CZECH republic and SLOVAKIA involves the collection of excise taxes on mineral oils, tobacco products, alcohol, beer, wine and intermediate products, on natural gas, solid fuels and electricity.
The share of excise taxes in total tax revenue and the share in GDP of monitors including the Organization for economic cooperation and development (OECD).
The two supreme audit institutions used the following selection criteria to enter a query on the OECD website.
Collection of excise duties in connection with macroeconomic indicators in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, the share of excise taxes on total tax revenues and the share of GDP decreased slightly, according to OECD data.
For the conversion of amounts in CZK to € to 31. 12. the rate of the European Central Bank of the ECB was used for the year in question.
The nominal rate of CZK against € in 2013 decreased by 9.1% year-on-year against 2012 (from 25,140 to 27,425).
This was mainly due to the monetary policy decision of the CNB Banking Board of 7. November 20136.
The resulting values of collection of excise duties, rates of excise duties and income per capita in € decreased significantly due to the exchange rate difference.
A significant reduction in the share of excise taxes in 2014 was due to one-off shortfall of revenue from the excise tax on tobacco products due to the impact of new legislation restricting the sale of tobacco products with old tax rate.
The share of excise taxes is also influenced by the growth of the collection of taxes on income as a result of improved general economic situation of the Czech republic significantly increased.
The total collection of excise taxes has the largest share of excise tax on mineral oils (in 2015 approximately 55,7 %), the however, despite the significant growth of the economy against the year 2012 fell.
Collection of excise duty on mineral oils in 2013 and 2014 was significantly lower than in 2012 and 2015, although in 2013 as a measure against tax fraud introduced the registration of distributors of motor fuel.
The trend in eco-friendly vehicles and biofuel support is negatively reflected in the tax return.
A negligible proportion they have tax on gas, tax on solid fuels and tax on electricity, which in comparison with the surrounding states due to the low tax rate, which is close to the minimum rates set by the EU.
If there is no rate hike, will be in the future, their share with regard to the ever decreasing energy performance of buildings and manufacturing processes fall.
Collection of excise duty from ethyl alcohol in 2013 and 2014 was negatively affected by the aftermath of large-scale case of tax fraud relating to the marketing of tax-free ethyl alcohol, alcohol containing methanol or insufficiently denatured alcohol into the bloodstream in the form of spirits.
In 2015, following the adoption of a number of measures against such action and the recovery of the spirits market, the collection of excise duty on alcohol excised by £ 4m in 2012. €.
The share of the tax on tobacco products increased as a result of rising rates.
Basic rates of excise taxes between the years 2012-2015 change in the tax on tobacco products, where there was an increase in rates, in particular due to compliance with the Council directive 2011/64/EU on the structure and rates of excise duty on tobacco products.
Due to monetary intervention of ČNB, the real rate of excise duties in €, excluding the tax on tobacco products, decreased significantly. Tobacco products have risen only slightly.
In relation to the price growth, GDP or the level is not set indexation of rates of excise taxes, may not then be filled with the feature of excise taxes consisting in the regulation of socially problematic activities.
With the economic growth of the Czech Republic and the growth of living standards, real excise rates are reduced.
7 Indexation – automatic adjustment of certain economic variables of inflation, this adjustment occurs on the basis of law or contract (for pensions paid by the state is called indexation).
Excise collection linked to macroeconomic indicators in the SR
In the current legislation on excise duties in the SR, the indexation of the amount of excise rates on the development of consumer prices is not addressed, since they are fixed.

From all excise taxes imposed on Slovakia has the largest proportion of the full-year tax incomes of the state budget is the excise tax on mineral oils, while throughout the audited period, its share has not fallen below 52 %.
The second largest share is the excise duty on tobacco products.
On average, this tax accounts for about 32% of the total excise collection.
Between 2012 and 2015, the collection of excise duty per capita of SR was increased.
This development is due to the increase in excise duty rates on tobacco products, higher purchases and higher consumption of the population in a given year.
The growth of the collection of excise taxes per capita SR is constant and corresponds to the development of the rates of excise duties on tobacco products, higher purchasing power and higher consumption of the population in a given year.
In the Czech Republic, the decrease in income in € per capita is influenced by the intervention of ČNB in the matter of the exchange rate of the crown against the euro.
The difference between the CZECH republic and SLOVAKIA in the overall recovery of the SPD is mainly due to the collection of excise taxes on mineral oils and tobacco products which is in the CZECH republic approximately 2.7-fold, respectively 2.8 times higher, per capita the CZECH republic is however a direct debit for these selected products higher only by about 1/3.
The cause is the lower price of these selected products in the Czech Republic due to lower rates of excise duties in the Czech Republic and the rate of CZK vis-à-vis € for foreign consumers.
Mineral oil tax also causes more transit through the Czech Republic and cross-border purchases.
In the case of a tax on tobacco products, increasing foreign tourism to the Czech Republic and cross-border purchases have a significant impact.
Assessments of the real rate of excise duties in the Czech Republic have decreased as a result of Czech National Bank interventions.
The share of energy taxes in the CZECH republic and SLOVAKIA on total tax revenue does not rise and does not shift away from taxation of labour to taxation of consumption of selected products subject to consumption taxes, which is not in accordance with EU strategies.
However, the excise share achieved is consistently above the OECD average.
Total collection of excise duties is influenced in particular by changing the rates of excise taxes, development of economic condition and behavior of the population.
Future excise duty collection outages due to environmental measures subsidised by the state in various forms will need to be replaced by other revenues or by a reduction in state expenditure.
The fact that in the CZECH republic and SLOVAKIA is not introduced indexation of rates of excise duties, reduces their regulatory function and are inadequately supported by the EU objectives of the Europe less dependent on environmentally intrusive sources and in reducing dependence on alcohol and tobacco.
In the higher collection of excise taxes per capita in the CZECH republic manifests higher consumption of the selected products to foreign consumers, which is influenced by the lower total price of selected products in euros.
Administrative expenditure of excise duties
The effectiveness of administrative costs reflects the correlation between expenditure and revenue related to the administration of excise duties, i.e. expresses the amount of expenditure per 100 units of income (CZK, €).
The higher the resulting value, the worse the efficiency of administrative costs.
The efficiency of the tax administrator in the administration of tax affects the scope and organisational structure of the tax administrator, the management of the organization, the legal environment and the level of computerization of individual activities.
The determination of the effectiveness of the administrative costs of tax administration by the conversion rate method is based on the number of employees involved in excise management in the line-managed structure.
In the Czech Republic excise duty management is carried out in addition to other activities by the customs administration of the Czech Republic, which is a separate organizational component of the state and an entity.
In the Slovak republic tax administration provides Financial administration of the Slovak republic, with the authorities of the customs administration are the internal organizational unit, costs and returns are included collectively, for the entire organizational unit.
Therefore with regard to the possibility of comparing the efficiency of the administration of excise taxes in the calculation of the efficiency of the administrative costs included expenditure and revenue Financial administration of the CZECH republic.
Administrative costs of excise tax administration in the Czech Republic
Excise administration is a complex of administrative acts, which is carried out mainly by the customs administration of the Czech Republic.
Some partial control acts are carried out by other public authorities, but their importance is negligible.
In particular, excise management is carried out by the following departments:
Directorate-General Customs

Administrative costs of excise tax administration in SR
Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic from 1. 1. 2012 has undergone a challenging transformation process in accordance with the approved UNITAS programme.
The emergence of the FDC was also reflected in the composition of employees of the newly formed departments of the merged Customs and tax administration.
In connection with the exercise of excise management, activities related to excise management within the organisational structure of the FD SR have been incorporated into a number of different sections and related trade unions.
Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic section Customs and Taxation Department SR excise duty department (statewide scope):
the department of excise duties – directs and coordinates activities in the field of the administration of excise taxes; drawing up expert opinions; making proposals and comments to legislative changes; makes decisions about the delegation of territorial jurisdiction to tax entities; allocates and deleted the registration sample numbers;
Department of Tax Oversight-directs and coordinates activities in the field of Tax Oversight and tax control; exercises Tax Oversight;

department of control marks – directs the activities in the field of printing and management with the control signs; shall exercise the tax supervision of the handling and disposal of print sheets and the check marks in the printer.
Department of the vice-president of the financial administration
Department of Appeals for excise duties and customs duties):
department remedies for excise taxes – review the decisions of customs authorities on the basis of the applied ordinary and extraordinary remedies; appeals procedure at the second stage of the decision-making process.
The section of the customs authorities was established during the year 2012; under it were directly incorporated individual customs offices (9 offices), which have a territorial scope determined by the higher territorial units, with the exception of one customs office, which was established, inter alia, for the purpose of carrying out tasks in connection with the external border of the Community.
Customs offices:
Department of excise duties – the exercise of methodological activity in relation to the branches of customs offices and to the Stations of customs offices; for selected entities performs direct acts of the tax administrator, and it decides on registration (tax warehouse, authorized recipient repeated, registered consignor), on the amount of collateral tax, determines and returns the tax, exercises tax supervision and tax control; decides on alcohol warehouse;
the department of legal – decision-making activity in the matter of violation of tax legislation; activities related to ordinary and extraordinary remedies; tax enforcement procedures;
branch of the customs office – shall decide on the registration (with the exception of the tax warehouse, authorized recipient for repeated receiving, the registered consignor), on the amount of the tax; prescribes and returns the tax; shall exercise the tax supervision and tax control; decide on security and on confiscation of goods;
stations of the customs office – the performance of tax supervision over the possession and movement of goods subject to excise duties; ensures performance of the permanent tax surveillance in a tax warehouse for alcohol; decide on security and on confiscation of goods.
SR financial management expenditure on excise duty management is constantly increasing as investment in efficient tax management and the electronisation of financial management, with the exception of wage growth, increases.
Although excise revenue grew, spending grew faster as a result of Unitas-related it adjustments.
Wage expenditure is significantly affected in the SR by the performance of permanent tax supervision in alcohol tax warehouses, which the Czech Republic does not apply.
Expenditures of the Customs administration of the CZECH republic on the administration of excise taxes between 2012 and 2015, significantly increased in 2015, this growth was mainly due to the growth of wage expenditure and expenditure on technical support.
In the Czech Republic, excise revenue grew at about the same rate.
Wage expenditure in the Czech Republic is positively influenced by the broader competences of the customs administration, e.g. weighing trucks, checking the performance of duties in connection with the myth.
The efficiency of administrative costs in SR shows a slightly worsening trend year on year.
The number of employees did not change significantly, but spending per employee grew.
The number of employees did not change significantly in the Czech Republic, but spending per employee grew more slowly compared to the Czech Republic.
Evaluation
In the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic, wage growth is an important factor in the impaired efficiency of administrative expenditure, which can be assessed as a natural development.
In both countries, maintaining considerable administrative difficulty in the management of excise duties appears to be a negative factor, which is confirmed by the reduced number of employees in the excise management sector.
In the SR, however, the administration of excise duties on lower incomes is significantly more demanding on personnel capacity.
Performance indicators of Excise Management
The administration of excise duties is a set of activities aimed at correctly identifying, determining and securing the payment of tax.
The main processes in the administration of excise taxes are tax assessment, permitting and registration activities, traffic surveillance, inspection and search of the tax bodies.
The number of administrative acts and managed entities is an indicator of the performance of the tax administrator.
The correlation between the reference indicator and the number of tax administrators expresses the effectiveness of the work of the tax administrator and defines the cost of particular activities.
Authorisation and registration activities are a fundamental prerequisite for dealing with selected products for business purposes and their transport in the regime of conditional exemption from tax.
The tax administrator is required in subjects with the permission of or registration to perform the continuous management with a focus on supervision on the implementation of legislation and the conditions laid down by the tax administrator, which must be allocated adequate personnel resources.
The endpoint was the number of authorisations or registrations in force at 31. Dec.
The number of authorisations or registrations issued is not identical to the number of tax entities.
Administrative acts are specific administrative acts in the case.
Pursued administrative acts are the frequency of the most significant acts of the tax administrator (tax assertion, the administration of transport in the EMCS), or activities that are a sequence of actions ending in the report or decision.
Performance indicators in the Czech Republic
Authorization and registration for activities in the Czech Republic
Tax warehouse:
To produce, process, store, send or receive the selected products can be based on authorization of the tax administrator to operate a tax warehouse.
If the tax warehouse operator has multiple warehouses, a permit is issued for each separately, including the provision of tax.
Ensure tax is not required in the case of distilleries under a permanent tax supervision of the tax administrator (i.e., the physical presence of official persons, and ensuring the equipment packages, the tax administrator).
In the Czech Republic, permanent tax oversight is not applied.
The tax warehouse operator is also registered for tax under Section 125 of Act No. 280/2009 Coll.
Authorisation to operate a tax warehouse is a prerequisite for the transport of selected products exempt from tax from the place of importation to a tax warehouse, authorized recipient in another member state, to the point of export in another member state or a recipient in another member state (replaced by the status of authorised consignor as referred to in article. Article 4 (4) 10 council directive 2008/118 / EC).
Tax warehouse statistics do not include permits for the acquisition of electricity, natural gas and solid fuels, excluding tax, which are analogues of the tax warehouse permit.
Cultivation Brandy produces alcohol with a reduced 50% tax rate (14 300 CZK/hl of ethanol) – fruit spirits for growers. It is not a tax warehouse, and the permit for operation is issued by the Ministry of Agriculture.
A reduced rate of tax can be applied to 30 liters of pure alcohol per household grower intended for personal consumption for the production period (July–June).
Evidence of the burning, which lead operators of distilleries, and made available to the tax authorities, must contain information about the growers, the basic raw material, issued by the distillate, the origin of the fruit and the production of distillate.
The authorized recipient for repeated receiving the selected products and the authorized recipient for one-time adoption of selected products is on the basis of the authorization of the tax administrator and the specified conditions is entitled to a lump sum to accept or repeatedly receive selected products under the suspension system transported from another member state.
The beneficiary is not the operator of the tax warehouse and may not store or dispatch the selected products under the conditional exemption scheme.
User-selected products exempt from tax is a legal or natural person that receives and uses, where applicable, pursuant to section 52a or section 53 of act no. 353/2003 Coll. sells to the next user selected tax-exempt products; users have the status of tax entities without the obligation to register for tax.
To receive and use selected products exempt from tax can be only on the basis of a final permit, and only from the supplier referred to in the permit.
On the basis of an authorisation, exempt mineral oils may be sold to another holder of a licence for use or to a user who is authorised to use mineral oils without authorisation.
Without permission, mineral oils exempt from tax can be sold in legally established cases, for example.:
waste oil in quantities of less than 10 000 litres per calendar year, if the user himself made or incurred in its activities,
exempt selected mineral oils in unit packages of a capacity not exceeding 20 litres intended for purposes other than motor propulsion or heat production and intended for sale to the final consumer at the same time.

The subscriber control marks is required separately in the breakdown for cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos and tobacco keep a register of control marks in the electronic system of control marks.
Administrative cooperation between EU member states (ELO)
Within the meaning of Council regulation (EU) no 389/2012 department ELO and systems of the SPD of the department of excise AND SR is responsible for the security of information exchange on the basis of the application for administrative cooperation between the member states of the EU and the competent authorities of financial management.
These are, in particular, requests for vetting of excise management entities, requests for information relating to excise management, as well as requests for confirmation of information from the SEED database.
The exchange of applications shall take place in electronic form under the EMCS system.
The administrative cooperation between the member states of the EU are included the following acts: requests for administrative cooperation (a request for examination, request for information on the administration of excise taxes, a request for confirmation of the registration in the SEED); the response to the request of the administrative cooperation-spontaneous information; report on event; report of inspection.
Comparison and evaluation

Authorisation and registration
In SR, the tax warehouse for alcohol is subject to permanent tax supervision, in the Czech Republic this supervision is replaced by continuous supervision of the tax administrator through a tracking device.
In the Czech Republic, small independent breweries are a tax warehouse, in the SR they are only registered by the tax administrator.
The Institute of registered consignor is established in the SR, which is included in the tax warehouses in the Czech Republic.
In SR it is possible to burn 43 litres of alcohol at a reduced rate of excise duty in case of cultivation burning.
In contrast, in the Czech Republic, the reduced alcohol tax rate can only be applied for 30 litres.
Cultivation fennel in SR must have permission not only from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development SR, but also from the tax administrator.
In the Czech Republic, only the Ministry of Agriculture authorizes cultivation of moonshine.
In the SR, the import of consumer packages of alcohol is realized in addition to the operator of the tax warehouse also by the importer of consumer packages of alcohol.
The authorization of the importer is conditional on the registration of the applicant with the excise duty administrator.
In the Czech Republic, no special authorization of the tax administrator is required to import consumer packages of alcohol.
In SR, the sale of consumer packages of alcohol is conditional on the issuance of a permit of the tax administrator for the seller.
The retailer of consumer packages of alcohol has a statutory obligation to keep records of, inter alia, purchases and sales.
In the CZECH republic, the tax administrator no permission for the final seller for the consumer packaging of alcohol does not issue, it is sufficient to issue a concession for the sale of alcohol, the trade licensing office; the ultimate seller of any special register does not.
In sr the seller of propellants must have permission from the tax administrator to sell them.
National legislation in the SR does not provide any special regulation of the gas station, all the activities regarding gas stations are regulated only in the law on excise tax from mineral oils.
In the CZECH republic pumping station regulates the special act on fuels, the tax administrator, however, does not issue any permits to sell fuel.
Gas stations are registered and their list is published by the Ministry of industry and trade.
In SR, it is technically not possible to obtain a list of service stations from the financial management system.
In the SR there has been a significant increase in the number of selected permits or registrations of tax entities since 2012.
That increase was due to a legislative change in that period.
In the Czech Republic, on the contrary, the number of selected permits decreased significantly in 2013 due to the introduction of bail for fuel distributors.
Administrative acts
In the SR substantive legislation provides for the obligation to exercise tax control for selected tax entities.
This issue describes the internal control act, which issued the OOTP SR due to the application of a single procedure of tax administrators on the territory of the SR.
In the CZECH republic, the substantive laws of the obligation to the performance of tax audit provision, procedural regulation provides only for the possibility of inspection at the latest by the deadline for the tax assessment.
The reason for the large differences in the number of tax inspections and local investigations in the SR and CZECH republic is the fact that the internal control act of the OOTP SR provides, in what cases and in what time limits must of the tax administrator to perform tax inspection, while in the CZECH republic is the correctness of the declared amount of the excise or of the return to be verified in particular on the local investigation.
The number of comparable administrative operations in the Czech Republic has increased since 2012 due to an increase in traffic in the EMCS system and at the same time due to an increase in the number of tax returns filed.
In the SR had a number of administrative tasks between 2012 and 2015, a slightly increasing trend, which was affected by the increasing number of transport in the EMCS system and at the same time a decrease in the number of tax returns.
Evaluation
The large differences between the numbers of comparable authorisation and registration of tax subjects showed different legislation.
The number of comparable administrative acts of tax administrators was similar in the SR and the Czech Republic in each year of the period under review.
In the SR the total number of comparative tax subjects, which is about two thirds compared with the number of tax entities in the CZECH republic, accounting for approximately the same amount of administrative tasks.
From this it can be concluded that the SR is more focused on the implementation of administrative acts by the tax administrator, for example, the exercise of physical tax supervision.
In the Czech Republic, the emphasis is more on remote surveillance, such as tracking devices, imminent sending of data via the web interface and risk analysis.
Electronisation of Administrative Operations
Electronisation of administrative operations in the Czech Republic
The tax return can be filed through the Data Box.
The customs administration of the Czech Republic has introduced so-called interactive forms of tax returns, which, however, can no longer be processed automatically.
Further, the data must be rewritten into the personal tax account of the tax entity.
Benefit is the limitation of error filed tax returns (DAP), which set aside acts of the tax administrator relating to the management of corrections erroneously filed by the DAP.
DGC is working on a new DAP electronic processing app.
Through the intelligent forms can be further: given an application to the tax or registration to the activity and notification of changes to data, to assert claims for tax refund comply with the reporting obligations in the management of specific mineral oils, the handling of raw tobacco and the fulfilment of obligations in the field of biofuels.
Treatment with the control tapes is tax entities recorded in the information system ORO WebKlient, which is for registered entities available for registration with the tax administrator set of data.
Transport of selected products in the Czech republic in the regime of conditional exemption from the tax must be implemented in the CZECH republic on the basis of the electronic accompanying document, which is implemented in the CR as a national functionality to the electronic system for monitoring the transport of selected products (EMCS).
Transport of selected products in free tax circulation after the tax territory of the CZECH republic can be carried out always with the document evidencing their taxation, proof of exemption from excise duty, by decision of the customs office for the release of selected products into the customs regime, by a simplified accompanying document or any other decision on assessment of the excise tax.
The required content of data is determined by law.
Czech republic to facilitate the fulfillment of these obligations has introduced a voluntary electronic system for the issuing of alternative proofs (§ 5 and § 6 of act no. 353/2003 Coll.).
This allows the physical form of the documents to replace or supplement the electronically posted documents, which are through the web interface of the Customs administration of the CZECH republic sent to the data storage, where each such document is assigned a unique dvanáctimístný identification code (JIK).
JIK serves for the purpose of customs control on the way and makes it impossible to re-transport to the same document.
The largest operator of the tax warehouse of fuel in the CZECH republic, which states, roughly half the volume of PHM into free tax circulation, has a CS CR on-line access to the electronic filing system, to which the body automatically stores the issued tax documents.
EN the CZECH republic is considering the introduction of e-VDO, i.e. the electronic system for registration and monitoring of the transport of selected products carried out in free tax circulation.
This system should benefit from 70% of the existing EMCS functional specification.
The advantage will be a familiar environment for declarers and customs officers.
It will also be linked to the global guarantee system, the tax entities register or the risk analysis system.
The system should allow an overview of the dopravách in free circulation between the member states, which so far works on the basis of written documents without the recording and sharing of meeting numbers through simplified accompanying documents.
The risks of the current procedure of registration of transport of selected products in free tax circulation can be seen mainly in the abuse of the simplified accompanying document, repeated use of a single document or illegal materials without any document.
Electronisation of administrative operations in the SR
In the administration of excise taxation Financial management SR uses electronic communication in monitoring the movement of goods in the EMCS system in the regime of conditional exemption from tax, check marks, submission of tax returns and also in the registration and registration of tax entities.
In 2014 has also introduced a one-way electronic communication of tax bodies with the tax administrator, which was in 2016 extended to two-way communication.
In the context of electronic communication, the tax body after entering the access data zpřístupněnu a personal internet zone, the so-called electronic personal mailbox, which is intended for communication with the financial administration.
Within this zone has a tax entity access to the electronic registry through which the served application, notice, tax returns and other documents relating to the administration of excise taxes.
Electronic communication through the personal internet zone does not apply to all tax entities.
National legislation defines tax entities that are obliged to communicate with the tax administrator electronically.
These are mainly Value Added Tax Payers, tax advisors representing the tax entity and lawyers representing the tax entity.
The Sao SR also addressed the issue of the scope of the electronisation of Excise Management during the inspection.
These were only fully electronic acts, namely tax returns and electronic communications within ELO.
In the case of EMCs transport, there has been an increase in the electronisation of comparable administrative tasks selected, which is also a requirement for modern tax administration.
Comparison and evaluation
Comparison
In the SR have been introduced fully computerized processing of tax returns, from its filing to register the tax obligations.
In the Czech Republic electronic processing of the tax return is not set.
In the Czech Republic, the possibility to insert mandatory documents for individual transport in free tax circulation is set up for tax entities on the website.
In the future, the announcement of transport in free tax circulation in the form and on the basis of the EMCS system is being prepared.
Evaluation
Reporting system of transport in free tax circulation in the CZECH republic contributes to the tax supervision, thereby eliminating the transport of selected products, where in conflict with the legislation had not been paid the excise tax.
Listed can be recommended as a good practice.

For the sake of good practice in the SR in the field of electronization of tax returns, Sao SR and Sao CR recommend to complete in the Czech Republic electronization of processing of tax returns.
Analysis of changes in organizational structure and personnel security in the field of excise duties
The organizational arrangement of the customs administration of the Czech Republic and the financial administration of the SR has undergone major changes.
Organization of Customs Administration of the Czech Republic
Customs administration of the Czech Republic from 1. 1. 2013 form the General directorate of customs and customs offices, which are administrative offices and departments of the state.
DGC is an entity for the entire customs administration.
The customs administration of the Czech Republic has exercised comprehensive excise management since 2004 as one of the many competences it provides.
EN the Czech Republic further exercises:
(a) control:
ശശ in the field of road transport (weighing of trucks, payment of road charges, fulfilment of conditions for the transport of dangerous goods, professional supervision of the work of vehicle settlements in international road freight and in matters of international passenger transport),
ശശ waste management and packaging material,
ശശ safety of imported food,
ശശ in the field of consumer protection and protection of intellectual property rights,
ശശ employing foreigners,
b) management duties – this is a comprehensive application of the customs legislation, commercial policy measures and formalities in import and export of goods,
(c) the collection and recovery of pecuniary transactions imposed by other public authorities within the framework of split administration,
d) the activities of the police authority (the authorised customs bodies) in proceedings on criminal offences committed by violation of customs and related legislation and tax legislation, where the Customs administration of the CZECH republic by the tax administrator.
Range of competencies (overlapping of control activities), while increases the overall cost of the Customs administration of the CZECH republic, however, there is a cost savings of scale, since the public administration does not have to incur expenses on the status of the control group for each subject of the control separately.
At the same time, the administrative burden of the checked persons is reduced by repeated control.
10 the customs administration of the Czech Republic shall continue to operate from 1. 12. 2016 scope for the verification of compliance with obligations in the registration of sales (§ 2 para. 2 of Act No. 112/2016 Coll. and from 1. 1. 2017 supervision of compliance with the law and conditions of operation of gambling, including the imposition of penalties (section 116 of Act No. 186/2016 Coll., about gambling).
As part of the Czech Customs Administration modernisation project, the Czech Customs Administration has changed with effect from 1. 1. 2013 three-tiered structure to a two-tier, with the middle of the article management (customs directorate).
DGC spent about £ 51 million on the project. CZK (i.e. about € 2 031 000).
CS cr from 1. 1. 2013 consists of DGC and regional customs offices, which are administrative offices and organizational components of the state.
Customs offices and their competences are established by law, the administration of excise duties is carried out by all customs offices through departments and territorial departments.
Territorial workplaces are internal organizational units of customs offices.
To establish and abolish territorial workplaces and determine their substantive competence is authorized by the Ministry of finance by decree.
There is no statutory competence for territorial workplace does not provide; territorial workplace exercise the competences of the customs office on his behalf.
Organizational structure up to 31. 12. 2012
Organizational structure from 1. 1. 2013
Excise management until 31. 12. 2012 was carried out by DGC, eight CJ and 58 CJ departments (including branches), i.e. a total of 67 unions and departments.
1. 1. 2016 excise duty management was carried out by DGC and 51 departments at CÚ and their territorial workplaces, eight departments of the legal department of DGC and the Departments of CÚ providing mobile supervision, i.e. about 60 Posts.
The costs of the CS CR most significantly affect wage expenditure.
As a result of the reorganization of the customs administration of the Czech Republic, there were no savings in personnel resources.
The performance of key processes provide the customs officers in service under the act on service relationship of members of security forces.
The possibility of reducing the number of such nationals is very limited in the Czech Republic, since according to the provisions of § 42 Para. 1 of Act no 361/2003 Coll. they may be dismissed from service only in cases defined in detail.
Reduction of business losses as a result of organizational changes in the security corps of the reason for the release not and the employer is obliged to provide nationals of the allocation of appropriate business sites within the ward, where appropriate, to ensure the business places in the other security body (e.g. the Police of the CR, Prison service of the CZECH republic), otherwise it is shifted to the advance for temporary unclassified, in which members of the security forces belong to according to the law, 80% of the average staff income.

Organizational arrangement of Excise Management in SR
The Government of the Slovak Republic has set itself as one of the priorities of completing tax administration reform through the UNITAS programme, which will provide additional budgetary resources by combining tax collection, duties and levies and by suppressing tax evasion.
In this context, there has been the implementation of tax reforms at the central level, which brought about the merger of the Tax directorate of the SR and the Customs directorate of the SR into the Financial directorate of the SR and the emergence of financial administration.
FD SR was established on 1. 1. 2012 by law no 333/2011 Z. z. on bodies of state administration in the field of taxes, fees and customs, as amended, as a budgetary organisation, which has its registered office in Banska Bystrica and is connected to the state budget through the budgetary chapter of the Ministry of finance of the Slovak republic.
FD SR, CÚ and the Criminal Office of the financial administration within the meaning of law no 199/2004 Z. z. the Customs Act and amending and supplementing certain laws, as amended, are customs authorities, if they perform tasks according to customs regulations.
Within the meaning of law no 333/2011 Z. z. on bodies of state administration in the field of taxes, fees and customs, as amended, together with the tax authorities, consists of financial management.
New organisational structure of financial management on 1. January 2012 consists of the Financial directorate of the SLOVAK republic, Criminal office of financial administration, Competence center financial operations, tax authorities, Tax office for selected tax entities, branch offices of the tax authorities, contact points of the tax authorities, customs authorities, branch offices (branch of the CA tax, the branch of the CA combined, the branch of the CA customs) and station offices.
The main mission of the FD Sr is to effectively collect and manage taxes and customs duties, i.e. also excise taxes, to fulfill the income portion of the state budget and to protect the economic interests of the state.
The statutory body of the FD SR is the president of the financial administration, appointed and dismissed by the Minister of Finance of the Slovak Republic.
The president of the financial administration is responsible to him for the activities of the entire financial administration, and hence for the activities of the FD SR, which he directs and represents in full.
Organizational structure of FD SR from 1. 1. 2012 in abbreviated form
In addition to the branches of the customs offices (38 branches) and the Stations of the customs offices (18 stations), the Excise departments (9 departments) and the legal departments (9 departments) also provide for all customs offices in the territory of the SR.

Comparison
As part of the organisational structure of the financial administration of the SR, in 2015, in addition to the FR SR, there were 74 organizational departments with a total number of 1,300 employees; these departments manage almost 48,000 tax entities.
Within the organisational structure of the Customs administration of the CZECH republic in the 2015 administration of the excise taxes addressed in about 60 organizational departments with a total population of 1 011 employees that manage approximately 114 000 tax subjects.
In the Czech Republic, the performance of individual excise management activities is divided between several staffly independent departments.
Their mutual coordination and cooperation is addressed through middle and top management.
In SR is the performance of individual activities (registration, tax return, tax inspection) in the field of administration of excise duties divided between the department of excise tax and branch of the customs office, in which the mentioned agenda dealing with often the same employees of the tax administrator.
Evaluation
In the SR, approximately one-third of the number of tax entities is on the total number of employees in the field of excise management compared to the state in the Czech Republic; the effect of a higher number of employees on the effectiveness of Excise Management is not obvious.
EMCS system
According to the preamble to decision no 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16. June 2003, on the introduction of an electronic system for the movement and surveillance of excisable products, the goal was to introduce an electronic system for monitoring the transport of selected products to allow the obtaining on the transport of information in real time and carry out the prescribed checks, simplify the movement of goods within the Community under suspension of excise duty.
In implementing the system, member states should have allowed economic operators, in particular SMEs active in the sector, to exploit these national elements at the lowest possible cost.
Article 3 of the said decision of the EP and of the Council admits that the EMCS included in national specifications, the national databases forming part of the system and any software or equipment which a member state considers necessary to ensure the full use of the system throughout its administration.
EMCS in the Czech Republic
Development and functionality of the EMCS system
In the Czech republic the EMCS system was preceded by a system of registration of selected products (EVV), which was operated from may 2004 until the end of march 2010.
EMCS is fully operational in the Czech Republic from 1. 4. 2010 and continuously supplemented by European and national functionalities (see Annex 5).
The so-called customs module and declarant module were introduced in the Czech Republic.
The customs module contains a number of national functionalities.
In addition to the Community System, carriage under the conditional exemption scheme initiated and completed in the Czech Republic is monitored in the EMCS system in the Czech Republic.
The system provides after the approval of the notification of acceptance of the consignment to the authorised recipient for one-time adoption of automatic sending the information to the registry of tax subjects, with a consequent zneplatněním permission.
Fully is through a system of ensured administration of received and sent requests for international cooperation and spontaneous information from ELO including sending a response with an attachment in any format and ensuring the translations.
It is also possible to receive a report on the manual cessation of exports in the ECS (only the referral of the automatically created message is implemented in the EU).
Risk profiles for outgoing or incoming shipments are set according to the currently required criteria.
The EMCS will not allow e-AD or notification of admission without the competent customs authority's response to the risk profile (the risk profile cannot be ignored).
Deklarantský module is for tax entities available for free, has the form of a web application to which a user logs in the username and password (coordinates) that are assigned to it after registration at the EN of the CZECH republic.
Any act vis-à-vis the EMCS customs module shall bear a valid electronic signature in the EMCs declarant module.
Deklarantský module allows you to tax subjects direct entry of data on initiated and completed dopravách in the regime of conditional exemption from tax, and the tax bodies may not expend funds for the acquisition system.
The national functionality deklarantského module allow you to retrieve and store the data off-line (saves time for frequently used data), filling out the details of the beneficiaries on the basis of the SEED ID, and require mandatory filling in the data that are at the EU level optional (maximum data for risk analysis).
The system also allows to block in real time the provision of excise duty in the corresponding amount of taxable transactions for each consignment sent from the Czech Republic until the termination of transport.
The amount of collateral is calculated by the EMCS system automatically.
Without a sufficient amount of collateral, the EMCs declaration module is not allowed to send a draft e-AD for approval to the CU of dispatch.
Each warranty has a unique number and contains the arc of transport (including the amount of blocked collateral) for which it was used.
The tax entity can manage its guarantees directly in the declarant EMCs module, where it sees the current amount of the blocked and unblocked excise guarantee.
Expenditure on the implementation and use of the EMCS system
The development of EMCS was carried out on the basis of eight fulfilment contracts from 2006 to 2017 totalling CZK 46 791 924.60 (i.e. € 1,761 412.56) excluding VAT.
In accordance with the contracts concluded, the contractor issued invoices for a total amount of CZK 43,577,255,19 (i.e. € 1,640,401,10) excluding VAT from 2006 to the end of 2015.
During the period under review, expenditure of CZK 14,545,454 excluding VAT (i.e. €547,438,99) was spent on the EMCS upgrade.
The amount spent on the upgrade of EMCS in the audited period and converted on one transport inserted into the EMCS is on average 16,49 € (i.e. 0,62 €), without a national transport makes these expenses in recalculation on one transport between the CZECH republic and the EU member states 24,40 € (i.e. 0,92 €).
EMCs technical support was implemented on the basis of four fulfilment contracts from 2011 to 2017.
By the end of 2015, the total amount of technical support of CZK 7,499,675 (i.e. € 281,389,77) including Value Added Tax was invoiced.
The average amount of technical support spent since 2011 per transport entered into the EMCS since 2010 is CZK 6.18 (i.e. €0.23).
The invoices for development and technical support concerned the national solution and the development of the EVV application already operated by DGC before the EMCS system itself.
The invoices were paid in the framework of programming funding from national sources.
Technical support is invoiced as part of the supply services also to other applications that the Customs administration of the CZECH republic, the supplier provides.
EMCS in SR
The EMCS is an electronic system operated by EU member states to monitor the movement of excise goods between member states under a conditional exemption scheme.
Replace the accompanying administrative document – SAD, which was used before the effectiveness of this system, and thus ensure better control and management of transport.
In SR is introduced from 1. 4. 2010 and is continuously supplemented by requirements arising from EU legislation.
A unique reference code is generated for each transport, the so-called Transport.
Arc code under which the traffic can be tracked online, i.e. in real time.
Development and functionality of the EMCS system
System EMCS ensures the receiving and sending of goods subject to excise taxes only those tax entities which are entitled to use the system, EMCS, thereby largely reduces the risk of tax evasion.
The greatest development of functionalities occurred in 2011, when the EMCS system was fully put into operation (see annex 6).
Expenditure on the implementation and use of the EMCS system
The introduction of the EMCS system was implemented as another module of the application equipment SysNeD, and therefore it is not possible on the Slovak side, to accurately determine the amount of the cost of its initial application.
Comparison and evaluation
Comparison
The aim of the EMCS was to replace the system based on the administration of transport in paper form.
Benefits of the system EMCS is a comprehensive overview of transport between member states within the EU since the announcement of the launch of transport only after its termination – a significant is the reduction of administrative costs for tax authorities and tax bodies in the processing, transmission and archiving of documents.
In the Czech Republic and in the Czech Republic, National functionality was introduced into the EMCS system allowing traffic monitoring in a conditional system between two locations in the Czech Republic or in the Czech Republic.
In addition, the automated functionality of online monitoring and guarantee of excise duty is applied in the Czech Republic.
National functionality is also established, which monitors the risk of the tax entity or transport, with the subsequent compulsory response of the tax administrator.
The SR and the Czech Republic register a comparable number of intra-EU traffic in the EMCS.
However, the expenditure incurred in the SR to upgrade this system was € 744 310.01 higher between 2012 and 2015 than in the Czech Republic.
The Sao SR received data from the Sao Sr on the upgrade of the EMCS only for the period from 2011, although this system was introduced and operated earlier.
Yet the expenditure incurred to upgrade the EMCS system in the SR were about 188 134,44 € higher than the expenses for the establishment and upgrade the EMCS system for about ten years of its operation in the CZECH republic.
Evaluation
For the checked period the volume of expenditure related to upgrading the EMCS system in the SR in terms of one carriage 2.3 times exceeds the expenses of the same type in the CZECH republic.
Conclusion
Cooperation between the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic has achieved its objectives.
Both audit institutions have acquired a deeper knowledge of the excise tax management system in the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic.
It was found that, despite a common basic legal framework exist in both tax systems, significant differences, which affect the efficiency of the administration of excise taxes.
During the parallel controls have been identified examples of good practice, which could contribute to curbing tax fraud, their meaning with the rising rates of taxes will grow.
Procedures reducing the cost of Excise Management have also been identified.
Mutual cooperation revealed differences, which significantly affect the efficiency of the tax administration and limit the international comparison, if they are not carried out mutually coordinated due diligence for the tax administrator.
In this, the role of the Supreme Audit Institutions is irreplaceable.
Report on the results of the parallel control of the administration of Value Added Tax carried out in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany
Introductory word
The Lima Declaration of 1977 stresses that the Supreme Audit Institutions (Sai) have the power to audit all public financial operations.
The declaration calls for tax revenues to be checked as far as possible.
The Organisation considers the European Organisation of supreme audit institutions (EUROSAI) to be one of the most important components of Public income tax.
GOI. the EUROSAI Congress, organized in Bonn in 2005, was engaged in auditing public revenues carried out by the SAI.
An important step on the way to optimizing the SAI control activity is the development of a specific strategy for auditing public revenues.
This applies in particular to taxes as the most expensive source of Public income, which is most susceptible to large losses.
Due to the fact that national economies are becoming more interconnected and dependent, may be SAI to some extent unable to perform inspection activities without the cooperation with the SAI of another state.
An example is the audit of internationally organized fraud, which causes substantial losses in the income of many countries.
In order to combat this crime, responsible authorities need to cooperate with each other.
SAI, which carry out inspections in this area, must be willing to establish closer cooperation with each other.
Just on VI. EUROSAI congress in Bonn, the idea arose to perform control of the administration of value added tax (hereinafter "VAT") and VIES in the framework of cooperation of the Supreme audit office and of the Federal court of auditors Bundesrechnungshof.
Careful preparation followed, with both parties first having to familiarise themselves with the legal environment and VAT management procedures in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.
On the basis of the analysis of this information, a selection of control topics was made, which was included in the control program.
Achieving effective and efficient VAT management is a long-term problem and individual states (in particular member states of the European Union) are looking for solutions to improve, simplify and make the collection of this tax more transparent.
We believe that the results of our review may serve not only for improving the work of the controllers of taxes, but also as a basis for a proposal to improve the system of international exchange of information.
Report on the results of parallel controls of the administration of Value Added Tax carried out in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany
Introduction
Control number: (CZ) 06/27 (d) VIII 2 – 2005 – 1215
Subject of inspection:
(CZ) administration of Value Added Tax after the Czech Republic joins the European Union
(D) Examination of administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax under Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003 and the Commission Regulation (EC) no 1925/2004
Objective of control:
(CZ) the Aim of the control action in the Czech republic was to examine the procedure of the financial authorities in the administration of value added tax after the integration of the Czech republic to the single internal market of the European union (hereinafter "EU") united with the free movement of goods and services, and explore the use of VIES, in particular in monitoring the application of the right to exemption from value added tax in intrakomunitárního delivery.
(D) the Objective of the audit was to review the system of control of intracommunity value-added tax with a particular focus on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax according to the above-mentioned regulation.
The result should be a report on weaknesses and recommendations for their elimination.
System of exchange of information on value added tax Control actions implement the Supreme audit office, Czech republic (hereinafter the "SAO") and the German Bundesrechnungshof (hereinafter referred to as "BRH"), in mutual cooperation on the basis of the contract concluded between the two audit institutions on 8. June 2006.
Cooperation focused mainly on the examination of selected commercial transactions between payers from the Czech republic (hereinafter "CR") and the Federal republic of Germany (hereinafter "GERMANY"), the use of information obtained in the form of international cooperation between tax administrations and comparison of the systems of VAT administration in both countries.
The joint final report on the results of the control actions was prepared within the meaning of European Directive No 31 for the implementation of INTOSAI audit standards.
The period under review was from 1. 5. 2004 to 31. 12. 2005.
Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions
Parallel control in the area of VAT management in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of a contract between the two SAI.
Outside of the main point – the exchange of information on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003 and the Commission Regulation (EC) no 1925/2004 – cover inspection of other topics, such as, for example, registration of payers, VAT returns and recapitulative statements, which are the main point of the closely associated.
In addition, the control included the legal situation in the area of international bus passenger transport and the comparison of certain statistical data.
Comparing the VAT management systems of both countries, differences were found in the following areas:
1) registration for VAT.
While in GERMANY entrepreneurs are registered regardless of their turnover, in the CZECH republic is the primary criterion (among others) for registration of exceeding the limit laid down in the law on VAT.
In the Czech Republic, payers are assigned only one tax identification number, which they also use in intracommunitary transactions.
In SRN, payers are assigned a tax number when registering for VAT, serving only for commercial transactions in the territory of SRN.
If a German payer intends to carry out intracommunity transactions, must request the allocation of a specific identification number, the so-called VAT ID.
As different registration methods cause problems, conditions should be balanced across the EU (see. 4.1).
2) international passenger bus service.
In the Czech Republic, international passenger bus service is exempt from VAT with the right to deduct VAT.
In Germany, part of the transport carried out on German territory is subject to VAT.
At EU level, efforts should be made to harmonise the situation within the meaning of article 393 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of VAT (see. 4.2)
3) VAT returns.
While in the CZECH republic, payers submitted VAT returns, only a single tax period (month or quarter), in GERMANY they have the payer the obligation to file so-called preliminary VAT returns (monthly or quarterly) and after the end of the calendar year must file an annual tax return to the VAT.
In contrast to the Czech Republic payers in Germany are required to file preliminary tax returns electronically.
The introduction of the obligation to file VAT returns electronically in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech Tax Administration (see. 4.3).
4) summary reports.
While in the Czech Republic payers file aggregated reports at the tax authorities, in Germany payers file aggregated reports on customs duties.
Therefore, the tax authorities in the Czech Republic have data from the aggregate reports available immediately after filing them.
The German tax authorities have information from the aggregate reports only after processing them into customs duties.
Combating VAT fraud requires that updated information on intracommunity transactions be made available as soon as possible.
A monthly summary reporting would shorten the time shift between the transaction date and the update of the VIES data.
This would subsequently allow for a timely examination of taxation in the member state of the acquirer (see. 4.4).
Which would, but would require all member states to adopt the same deadline for submitting a summary report.
5) international exchange of information in the field of VAT.
The Czech duty monitors compliance with the three-month period for requests for information received.
German tariffs do not follow.
As a result, the German tax administration handled a significantly lower percentage of applications received within the deadline.
Because of these problems, BRH recommended a permanent warning to the German customs (see. 4.6).
6) Risk Management System.
Each of the two member states is developing its own risk management system (risk management system, hereinafter referred to as "RMS"), which has its strengths and weaknesses.
The SAO and the BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by just one member state.
Successful RMS criteria, components and approaches must be exchanged and implemented in each EU member state, otherwise fraudsters will choose the member state with the weakest RMS (see 5.).
As part of the cooperation, both SAI examined selected cases of intracommunitary transactions between tax entities from the Czech Republic and Germany.
Together with the use of the legislation for CUSTOMS examined thirty-one cases of commercial transactions, for which there were doubts as to their realization or suspicion of tax evasion on VAT.
It was found that:
In some cases, the tax authorities used information obtained in the form of international cooperation and imposed VAT on payers.
In these cases, the payers either unjustifiably claimed the exemption from VAT or did not admit the acquisition of the goods in the VAT return.
In some cases, the tax authorities could not use the information obtained because the information was either incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, could not be used because of the different legal provisions in both member states.
In some cases, the tax administration of another member state refused to respond to a request for information.
There have been cases where payers erroneously reported business transactions in aggregate reports.
As a result, the data in VIES were incorrect and the tax authorities had to examine these cases (see. 6.).
Course of control action
The course of the control action in the Czech Republic
The inspection was carried out in the period from June 2006 to march 2007 by the Department II – department of revenue of the state budget and territorial departments of central Bohemia, north-west Bohemia, south Bohemia, south Moravia, central Moravia and north Moravia.

The control was part of the control plan for 2006 and was therefore notified to the Federal MF in 2006.
After the testing phase, the inspection was started in the fourth quarter of 2006.
According to the cases selected by the BRH and later elected by the SAO, the BRH had to notify the control of a number of federal states.
In addition to interviews on the Federal MF and on tariffs, the inspection was carried out in the following federal states:
Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine -Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.
The tax files of the following tax authorities were included:
Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, Munich tax office for corporations/ legal persons (München-Körperschaften), Munich II, IV and Munich, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-center (Hamburg-Mitte), Hamburg-nord (Hamburg-Nord), and Hamburg for large enterprises (Hamburg für Großunternehmen), Hannover-Nord (Hannover north), Winsen-Luhe, Bonn center (Bonn-Innenstadt), Cologne center (Köln-Mitte), Cologne-Porz (Köln-Porz), Cologne south (Köln-Süd), Sankt Augustin, Pirmasens, Budyšín (Bautzen), Chemnitz south (Chemnitz-Süd), Neustadt II (Dresden II), Freiberg, Leipzig, I (Leipzig I) and Zschopau.
In addition, negotiations with the tax office Augsburg-city (Augsburg-Stadt), Aurich, Düsseldorf-old town (Düsseldorf-Cologne), Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.
The report on the control findings was submitted to the MF in May 2007.
Cooperation between the two control institutions
In the preparation of parallel control actions in the period prior to their commencement took place several meetings of the representatives of the two audit institutions.
The participants in these meetings became acquainted with the organization of tax administrations, with the legislative regulation of the issue of VAT and with the system of VAT management in both countries.
At the meeting, which took place in May 2006, the topics of the test phase were agreed.
The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.
In the framework of this negotiation, a timetable for the further progress of the work was agreed and the following themes of parallel checks were established:
1. Registration of VAT payers.
2.
International bus transport of persons-legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.
3. The international exchange of information, in particular, the procedure of tax administrators in dealing with requests for information and examination of selected problem cases referred to in requests for information and spontaneous information, transferred between the CZECH republic and GERMANY.
4. VAT returns.
5.
Summary reports.
6.
Statistics on the delivery and acquisition of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany.
7. VAT risk management.
On a common inspection day, the SAO and BRH, which took place in December 2006, the two sides mutually acquainted with the course of the inspection in the CZECH republic and GERMANY and to discuss the existing results of parallel control actions.
The report on the results of parallel checks of the VAT administration between the Czech Republic and Germany was prepared at a working meeting in July 2007.
4. Administration of Value Added Tax in the Czech Republic and Germany
Registration of payers in the Czech Republic
(A) payers having their registered office, place of business or establishment in the Czech Republic
The tax entity shall Act No. 337/1992 Coll., on the administration of taxes and fees (hereinafter referred to as "Act No. 337/1992 Coll.“ ) means the taxpayer, the taxpayer and the legal successor of a natural or legal person, which as a tax entity is defined by law.
31. 12. 2004 a total of 421 865 tax entities were registered for VAT in the Czech Republic.
1. 12. 2005 there was an increase in the number of tax entities registered for VAT to 457 590.
Taxable person, which has its registered office, place of business or establishment in the CZECH republic whose turnover exceeds for at least 12 preceding consecutive calendar months the sum of 1 000 000 Czk (33 575 EUR), becomes the payer of 1. on the third month following the month in which it exceeded the registration limit (§ 94 para. 1 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., on value added tax; hereinafter referred to as "Act No. 235/2004 Coll.“).
The application for registration the person shall submit, within 15 days after the end of the month in which exceeded the registration limit.
The current legislation does not allow to register a taxable person the so-called backward, in cases when the reason for registration is exceeding the legal limit for registration.
A taxable person with registered office, place of business or establishment in the CZECH republic, which carries out taxable transactions or of transactions exempt from VAT with a right to deduct can become a tax payer, even though do not exceed a turnover of 1 000 000 Czk (33 575 EUR), if they meet any of the other conditions referred to in act no. 235/2004 Coll.
A taxable person with registered office, place of business or establishment in the CZECH republic, which fails to comply with any of the conditions provided for by law, may apply for VAT registration voluntarily.
The registration procedure under Act No. 337/1992 Coll is initiated by the application for registration to the local tax administrator.
The voluntary VAT payer shall also indicate on the VAT registration application the date on which he applies for registration as a VAT payer.
The Tax Administrator shall verify the information communicated by the tax entity, i.e. the completed application for registration with all annexes.
If it has doubts about the data, it shall invite the tax entity to explain, supplement or document the data.
After the tax administrator has verified that the taxpayer meets the conditions for registration, it shall issue a decision in the form of a certificate stating that it is a tax entity registered and was assigned a tax identification number (hereinafter "TIN").
On the certificate, the Tax Administrator shall indicate the effective date of the VAT registration and the periodicity of the VAT tax period.
The tax period is a calendar quarter, if the turnover of the payer for the previous calendar year did not reach 10 000 000 CZK (335 750 euros).
If the turnover of the payer for the previous calendar year amounted to CZK 10,000,000 (EUR 335,750), the tax period is the calendar month.
The payer whose turnover in the previous calendar year reached 2 000 000 Czk (67 EUR 150), is entitled to elect for the tax period of the calendar month and such change shall notify the tax administrator.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The allocation of the VAT number in the registration certificate always has a constitutive character and the tax body is obliged to indicate in all cases of communication (including payments) with the tax administrator and in the cases stipulated by a special law (e.g. act no. 235/2004 Coll. when issuing tax documents).
The tin contains the code " CZ " and the tribal part forming the general identifier.
The general identifier is for natural persons the birth number, or other general identifier, if provided for by special law, and in legal person identification number (the provisions of § 33 paragraph. 12 of Act No. 337/1992 Coll.).
If the tax entity has not fulfilled their registration obligation or to challenge the tax administrator, register it locally competent tax administrator from official duties without delay.
The result of the registration procedure is the issuance of an ex officio Registration Certificate, which is served on the tax entity.
In the CZECH republic is the tax entity that received permission to business activity, allocated a TIN at the time of his first registration to any tax.
The same tin is used by the tax entity even if it is registered as a VAT payer.
According to the text of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. which is effective from 1. 1. 2005, can the tax administrator in case of failure to fulfil the registration obligations for VAT, save to the taxable person a refund of up to 10% of total revenues or income for taxable transactions, which this person was held illegally without tax, for the period from the date on which should be legally registered by the payer, the date on which the basis of the decision of the tax administrator to the registered payer has become a (the provisions of § 98 paragraph. 1 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.).
The payment of the amount thus determined shall be considered as a levy (§ 98 para. 3 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.), that is, it is not a sanction.
Cancellation of the registration of the VAT payer when the conditions laid down by law are met is possible for two reasons:
1)
Cancellation of registration on request of the payer, mainly arising from the above turnover is below the registration limit (§ 106 par. 1 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.).
The payer shall be entitled to apply for the cancellation of the registration no earlier than 1 year after the effective date indicated on the registration certificate.
2) cancellation of the registration "ex officio" (§ 106 Para. 7 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.) if: (a) the payer has not carried out without notice the tax administrator for 12 consecutive months of performance, (b) the payer does not fulfil its obligations under Act No. 235/2004 Coll.(C) the payer shall cease to be a taxable person.
B) Payers who do not have a registered office, place of business or establishment in the CZECH republic, a Person registered for tax in another member state, which has no seat, place of business or establishment in the CZECH republic, or a foreign taxable person, which will take place performance with place of performance in the territory of the country and is the person liable to pay tax from this performance pursuant to § 108 of the act no 235/2004 Sb. (the so-called "non-established payer") becomes the payer on the date of implementation of this performance.
This person is obliged to submit an application for registration to the IRS for Threshold 1 no later than the date of implementation of the transaction.
In the application for registration, it is obliged to indicate all the tin assigned to it in other member states or in a third country.
If "non-established" a payer submits an application for registration later than the date of first taxable supply in the CZECH republic, the Financial authority for Prague 1, it registers retroactively, because according to act no. 235/2004 Coll. the tax entity became a VAT payer on the date of first taxable supply in the CZECH republic.
When registering retroactively, the Tax Office for Threshold 1 requires proof from tax entities that the fulfillment was carried out (invoices, or explanatory letters).
If "non-established" tax entity applies for registration in the CZECH republic before the first taxable supply, then the Financial office for Prague 1 calls for the submission of agreements, that the performance take place.
The Tax Office for Threshold 1 was at 31. 12. 2004 registered 473" non-established " payers, of which 124 payers from Germany, and at 31. 12. In 2005, 951" non-established " payers were registered, of which 233 were from Germany.
According to the provisions of § 106 Para. 9 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. the tax administrator is entitled to cancel the registration of the "non-established" payer at 31. January of the following calendar year, provided that the payer has no obligation to grant and pay the tax during the current calendar year.
The Sao's inspection found that if the" non-established " payer submits a tax return abroad for postal transport 25. January, i.e., in accordance with the statutory adjustment in the deadline for filing tax returns, doesn't have it the irs is still 31. January available.
In cases where the facts applicable to the possibility of revocation of the registration are known to the IRS at a later date than 31. in January, in the Czech Republic it is no longer possible to cancel VAT registration for an "unoccupied" payer in a given calendar year.
Registration of payers in Germany
Due to the legal provisions of the German tax code (§§ 137, 138 Abgabenordnung, hereinafter referred to as "AO"), anyone who develops a business activity, is obliged to inform the city/municipal authority or the competent financial authority.
The deadline for submitting information is one month after the start of the business.
This information is processed by the municipal/municipal authority for the tax office.
If the IRS detects an undertaking that has started but has not registered, the competent IRS may register that payer ex officio-even retroactively.
Taxpayers who are in the federal republic of GERMANY tax residents and tax non-residents, are required by law to register for VAT if they meet the criteria set out in § 2 of the German VAT law ('the UStG').
This obligation does not depend on the volume of turnover that they implement.
In Germany there is no voluntary registration for VAT.
For entrepreneurs permanently living abroad, there are special tax authorities.
For example, for those who are based in the Czech Republic, the competent tax office is Chemnitz-Süd.
30. in April 2004, a total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered at the Chemnitz-Süd Tax Office; at 1. a total of 1050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered in March 2006.
BRH found that these specific financial authorities often refuse to register so-called polozávislých independent workers established in the new eastern member states of the EU.
Because of the work permit of employees from the ten new EU member states after their accession into the EU is limited, they tried to these independent workers to avoid these limitations, business start-ups.
These businesses do not meet the criteria for the entrepreneur provided for in section 2 of the UStG, because they are usually dependent on a single employer, which determines their working hours and the way they work.
For the purpose of registration, the entrepreneur must fill out a questionnaire of the competent financial authority, which must submit information about the company and about the activities that are carried out.
The questionnaire constitutes a standard form that is binding on all tax authorities in Germany.
It is processed either by special departments of the tax authorities or by general-purpose departments responsible for assessing taxpayers.
Through this form is the risk assessment on individual taxpayers before the irs issues a tax number.
The structure of the tax number for domestic transactions is governed by certain rules:
The first three digits provide information about the relevant financial office, the following three (or four) provide information about the appropriate department at the tax office, the other five (or four) are to the resolution of the payers, while the last is always a check digit.
If an entrepreneur intends to participate in the intrakomunitárním trade, he needs a VAT registration number (VAT ID), to receive the intracommunity delivery to the tax-exempt.
The duty allocates a VAT ID at the request of the entrepreneur, if the entrepreneur is registered in the German federation and if he has a tax number for VAT purposes.
Customs allocates VAT ID to entrepreneurs automatically when payers indicate intracommunitary delivery in their VAT return.
The VAT ID structure is the country code (DE) followed by a series of nine digits.
Registration of an entrepreneur can be canceled: 1. at his request (for example, if ceased its business activities), after the execution of all administrative work (assessment of all the economic years) and 2. in the event that the tax administration realizes that it is no longer engaged in business activity.
The validity of the VAT identification number is usually linked to the validity of the VAT tax number.
The financial authorities are in such cases obliged to inform the CUSTOMS about the cancellation of the tax number, that the DUTY may terminate the validity of identification numbers for VAT purposes.
According to the German VAT Act (§19 (1) UStG) tax residents in Germany are not obliged to pay VAT in case 1. that the turnover plus the relevant VAT of the previous calendar year does not exceed EUR 17 500 and 2. the following year is unlikely to exceed EUR 50 000.
So-called small entrepreneurs ("Kleinunternehmer") are not entitled to invoice other entrepreneurs VAT and are not entitled to deduct input tax.
Although they are not obliged to pay VAT, small entrepreneurs must be registered with the tax office and must file an annual VAT return.
A small entrepreneur may declare that there will be no provision of § 19 para. 1 ustg apply.
This confession is binding on him for the next five years.
The entrepreneur can then invoice VAT and deduct the input tax.
For tax non-residents there is an opportunity to appoint a tax representative (§22a UStG).
A prerequisite is to undertake exclusively the business operations of tax-exempt and not entitled to deduct input tax.
Functions of a tax agent is to fulfill the tax obligations of the foreign entrepreneur, who thus need not register for VAT.
Invoices must contain information about representation for tax purposes.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation is different in both countries.
While in GERMANY entrepreneurs are registered regardless of their turnover, in the CZECH republic is the primary criterion (among others) for registration of exceeding the limit laid down in the law on VAT.
If the tax entity in the Czech Republic does not exceed the established limit, it has the opportunity to apply for VAT registration on a voluntary basis.
The registration procedure is standardized in Germany, but differences may arise as a result of different organizational models in federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the payer is assigned a tin at the time of his first registration for any tax.
In the event that the payer registers for VAT, he uses the same tin even in intracommunitary transactions.
In SRN, the payer is assigned a tax number when registering for VAT, serving only for commercial transactions in the territory of SRN.
If a German payer intends to carry out intracommunity transactions, must request the allocation of a specific identification number, the so-called VAT ID.
As the SAO and the BRH found, can the German two-tier registration system causing many misunderstandings in other member states, such as in the CZECH republic, which allocates a single id number for national registration for VAT and registration for intrakomunitárním transactions.
On the other hand, a two-tiered system allows retroactive (national) registration in cases where the payer to refuse to inform the municipalitu or the competent financial authority of their business.
This retroactive registration allows for the correct assessment of VAT for the previous tax period, especially an accurate estimate of the VAT tax liability.
As different registration methods cause problems, conditions should be balanced across the EU.
The German parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number (Tin).
The Federal Tax Office will allocate the tax code at the birth of a natural person.
This tin will be valid throughout the life of a natural person who is a German resident.
If a natural person starts a business, the competent tax authority will apply for an economic tin that will be used as a VAT ID.
In the future, there should be no delay between the National Registration of the payer and the allocation of VAT ID.
Work on the introduction of an IT resource to manage the tin has not yet been completed.
International passenger bus service
Legislation in the Czech Republic
According to the provisions of Section 70 of Law No. 235/2004 Coll. it is valid from 1. 5. 2004 transport of persons between member states and between member states and third countries in the Czech Republic exempted from VAT with a right to deduct tax.
This transport is exempt from VAT, even if it is implemented by entrepreneurs, who are registered for tax in other member states, or a foreign taxable person.
Return transport shall be considered as a separate transport.
If "not established" tax entities in the CZECH republic do not operate in addition to the international bus passenger transport other economic activity, have no obligation in the CZECH republic to register as VAT payers.
International passenger transport in the Czech Republic was exempt from VAT by virtue of the act of accession of the Czech Republic, annex in kap. Article 5 (5) Point 1 (b) where it is indicated:
"For the purposes of art. Article 28 (2) Article 3 (3) b) of directive 77/388/EEC, the Czech republic can continue to exempt from value added tax on international transport of passengers referred to in point 17 of annex F to the directive, until the condition set out in article. Article 28 (2) 4 the directive or, whichever is the earlier, when the same exemption is applied by an existing member state.“
Description of the legislation in Germany
Pursuant to Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28. November 2006, implemented by § 3b para. 1 of the German law on VAT the place of supply of passenger transport services (i.e. transportation services) route (i.e., location), where transport takes place.
Therefore, the German tax system does not distinguish between national and international cross-border passenger transport.
Only that part of the route which takes place in Germany constitutes the taxable provision of transport in Germany.
The German tax system also does not distinguish between tax residents and non-residents.
If a tax non-resident carries passengers through GERMANY, then that part of the route, which takes place in GERMANY, also represents a taxable supply of transport.
Tax non-resident shall, before he carries out his services in GERMANY, announce their intention to provide transport of passengers to the competent tax office.
The tax office registers this tax a non-resident taxable persons (see 4.1.2) and issue a special certificate for any bus or coach which is referred to in the notice of the taxpayer.
The taxpayer is obliged to declare its taxable provision of transport in the German VAT return.
1. in March 2006, the Chemnitz-Süd Tax Office registered 741 Czech payers who were engaged in passenger transport.
If passenger transport is provided to a tax resident who is a VAT-liable person, the tax non-resident does not have to pay VAT to the tax office himself.
Instead, an entity that is obliged to VAT to take to the tax office and the invoiced net amount of the tax non-resident is the tax resident who is a recipient of the services; this process is known under the name of "reverse charge" (reverse charge) and is in accordance with article 196 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC.
In addition, the announcement of the tax non-resident and its tax returns for VAT, the German tax authorities have several means to assess the correctness of the conferred on the taxable provision of passenger transport.
Mobile control groups of the customs office shall carry out audit certification of buses with permits (licenses) for foreign shipments, which are used to carry passengers over GERMANY.
After each audit, mobile control groups shall send a control report to the competent IRS.
If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group is entitled to require the bus driver to pay VAT before continuing further transport.
A tax non-resident may deduct the VAT thus paid on the tax calculated in his VAT return.
If the irs doubts about the accuracy of the tax returns for VAT, it may notify the intention to carry out an audit, which must take place in the office of the finance office, or they can use the means of administrative cooperation referred to in Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003 (see 4.6).
Even if the tax non-resident refuses to pay the amount of VAT calculated in accordance with its statutory rate, the tax office may apply for administrative cooperation under Council Directive 76/308/EEC.
If it is to be conducted a review of tax return for VAT or performing the duties of the tax of a nonresident, the BRH considers all these means of administrative cooperation as too demanding from the point of view of the labour force in comparison with the small amounts of VAT that have been paid for the taxable provision of passenger transport.
In particular, the audit of the accounting of a tax non-resident provokes disproportionate costs for both the taxpayer and the tax administration.
The tax administration shall carry out the audit of foreign accounts, which doesn't just mean need for a knowledge of a foreign language, but also familiarity with international accounting standards.
The audit of this type is also likely to require more time than an audit of a tax resident, this audit is, however, limited to the provision of passenger transport, which are made in GERMANY.
On the other hand, the tax non-resident does not have to just accept the law on inspection, that his or her national tax administration, but also the right to perform the audit by the other member states, which transports passengers.
Moreover, in each member state, in which it is carried out only one provision of the carriage of passengers, is the taxpayer obliged to fulfill any tax obligations that apply to it in these member states, and in all languages and on all tax forms these member states.
The actual taxation of cross-border passenger transport therefore creates disproportionate bureaucratic costs.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation in both countries is different.
In the CZECH republic is the transportation of persons between member states of the EU or between member states and third countries, on the basis of the Act of accession of the CZECH republic exempt from VAT with the entitlement to a tax deduction.
In Germany, part of the transport carried out in the German territory constitutes a taxable transaction.
If this transport provides the FRG an unsettled payer for the first time, is obliged to provide transport to pre-notify the competent tax office.
The financial office of this payer registers and the payer is obliged to admit in FEDERAL taxable the provision of transportation in a tax return.
The implementation of the law is very time-consuming in Germany.
At least three of the four Czech payers registered with the Chemnitz-Süd Tax Office are engaged in passenger transport.
In comparison with the given effort, the tax return, if implemented, is rather low.
Member states collecting VAT in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28. November 2006, on a common VAT system, is burdened with time-consuming obligations without a financially sensitive outcome.
To prevent undue costs to the assessment of VAT would provide cross-border passenger transport should be taxed in one member state only.
This could be the state where the transport starts or where the provider resides.
Such taxation would require adaptation of Council Directive 2006/112/EC.
VAT returns
Filing and processing of VAT tax returns in the Czech Republic
The payer is obliged within 25 days after the end of the tax period to file a tax return for VAT on a form prescribed by the MOF, even in the case that he incurred the tax liability, unless the law provides otherwise.
Your own tax liability is payable within the deadline for filing tax returns for VAT, with the exception of the tax vyměřované in connection with the importation of goods according to § 20 of act no. 235/2004 Coll. for which the maturity of the tax is determined by customs legislation.
If a repayable overpayment is incurred as a result of the excess deduction, the payer shall be returned without an application within 30 days of the excess deduction being calculated.
The period is not applied in cases where the tax administrator initiates a tax procedure relating to the payer's tax liability.
In accordance with the provisions of § 73 para. 11 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. can be entitled to a tax deduction to apply in ordinary tax return for VAT no later than the last tax period of the calendar year in which he could be entitled to a deduction.
After this period, it is possible to claim a tax deduction on apply within 3 years from the end of the tax period, in which he could be entitled to a deduction as soon as possible.
However, this is only possible by filing an additional VAT return.
Amendment to Act No. 235/2004 Coll. effective from 1. 1. 2005 allows the filing of an additional VAT return only for the period when the right to deduct tax could be applied for the first time.
The payer is required to submit additional tax returns for VAT, if a) a summary of the corrections increases the tax liability, b) performs the correction, while they do not change the last known tax liability, but only the data from the tax entity previously hardened, c) performs the repair rates and the amount of tax according to § 49 of act no. 235/2004 Coll.
The payer may submit an additional VAT return if the aggregate of Corrections reduces the tax liability.
An additional VAT return shall be submitted by the payer by the end of the month following the finding of these facts.
Submission of the VAT return in electronic form can be effected both through the Internet network or on a technical data medium.
Filing over the Internet can be done such as filing with a data message bearing an advanced electronic signature or of the filing with the data message neopatřenou advanced electronic signature.
In the case of filing with a data report not covered by a guaranteed electronic signature, submission in writing is still required, t.J. delivery of a computer report to the tax administrator (e-form).
The VAT return contains separate lines concerning the values of intracommunitary supplies / acquisitions of goods.
The values of the acquisition of services are reported on special lines of the VAT return.
Some lines are used for the purpose of initial automated control within the ADIS system.
The value of supplies of goods to other member states persons registered for tax in other member states shall be compared with the data given in the recapitulative statements submitted by the Czech payer.
The value of acquisitions of goods from other member states from persons registered for tax in other member states shall be compared with the values that are obtained through a system of VIES of the summary report of payers from other EU member states.
The tax office is undergoing an ADIS credibility test for VAT returns.
This test is carried out automatically, since VAT returns cannot be measured without the test.
The credibility Test involves calculating the credibility criteria and evaluating the risk types of VAT returns.
According to the provisions of § 37 para. 1 of Act No. 337/1992 Coll. can a financial authority who fails to comply within the prescribed period the obligation of non-pecuniary nature, resulting from this or the special tax act, or imposed in a decision under this act, to repeatedly impose a fine of up to $ 2 000 000 Czk (67 EUR 150).
An automated tax information system used by mergers to support tax administration.
The audit of the Sao found that the tax authorities did not usually use the possibility to impose a fine on payers for not filing a VAT return.
Filing and processing of VAT returns in Germany
In Germany, we distinguish between a preliminary monthly or quarterly VAT return and an annual VAT return.
Those taxpayers who are required to submit preliminary VAT returns must still submit an annual VAT return.
Even small entrepreneurs who are not obliged to pay VAT must file an annual tax return.
In general, taxpayers are required to submit quarterly VAT returns up to 10. on the month following the quarter in which the VAT is generated (§18 para. 2 UStG).
However, if the tax obligation of VAT exceeds in the preceding calendar year 6 136 EUROS or, in the case that it is a newly founded enterprise, the entrepreneur shall be obliged to submit monthly VAT returns to 10. the next month.
The taxpayer may also decide to file a monthly VAT return if there was a refund last year which exceeded EUR 6 136 (§18 para. 2a UStG).
VAT returns need not be made if the amount of the annual VAT does not exceed EUR 512.
The relevant amount of VAT duty must be paid within 10. on the month following the tax period in which VAT was incurred.
A refund can lead to an even more detailed investigation by the Fu.
Deadlines (according to the law) for the processing of tax returns and the refund of excess VAT deduction do not exist.
In order to timely refund, it is possible to offer collateral for the amount to be returned.
The basic principle is to process VAT returns and return the tax quickly.
The German VAT Act provides for the possibility to extend this period (§ 18 para. 6 UStG).
Such an extension should be applied for separately.
Allows you to to submit VAT returns and pay the relevant tax liability VAT a month later, provided that in the case of monthly returns is paid by the special advance.
This advance payment will be offset against the December VAT tax liability.
Whenever an error is detected, the entrepreneur must file a corrective VAT return.
There is no additional VAT return.
Once the annual VAT return, which must be filed by 31. may of the following calendar year, registered at the tax office, the entrepreneur can not fix the erroneous prior tax returns, but only the annual tax returns for VAT.
Correction of the annual VAT return to the benefit or disadvantage of the payer is possible during the next 4 years after the year in which the first annual VAT return was filed.
After these four years, the annual VAT return can normally be corrected only in cases of tax fraud or evasion.
Payers are obliged to file preliminary VAT returns electronically.
The tax authorities may apply exceptions to this rule to avoid excessive hardness.
Filing an annual VAT return is possible in paper form or via the internet, either with or without certification.
If it is carried out without certification, the payer must file a return once more on paper with personal signatures.
In the event that the payer does not file a VAT return, the tax administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the taxpayer's turnover.
In case of late filing, the payer may be charged a penalty payment (maximum of 10% of the tax to be paid, or EUR 25 000).
During a previous inspection, the BRH found that tax authorities often do not impose this standard fine.
In other cases where the tax authorities imposed a fine, the amount was calculated inconsistently and arbitrarily.
Therefore, the standard fine does not meet its goal of reducing the average delay, especially when filing an annual VAT return.
The VAT return contains separate lines relating to the values of intracommunitary supplies/acquisitions of goods.
The values of the acquisition of services are reported on special lines of the VAT return.
Non-taxable transactions must be reported on a separate line of tax return/ VAT.
In the case of VAT returns which are submitted in paper form, must be taken by a copy either through the scanner or employees who are specially authorised.
Data from VAT returns submitted electronically shall be immediately available to the IRS staff.
Once all the data is entered into the system, the RMS staff pass them and make a selection of cases that correspond to certain criteria.
The selected VAT returns must be rechecked by the IRS staff on the basis of a control report drawn up by the system.
(see Section 5.2).
Although the tax administration has to roughly estimate the amount of VAT that the taxpayer must pay the estimated tax must be as accurate as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, payers file VAT returns within 25 days after the end of the tax period.
The tax period, depending on the amount of turnover of the payer, is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
In GERMANY served to the payer preliminary VAT returns, depending on the tax liability in the previous year, either within 10 days after the end of the calendar quarter, or month.
Until 31. in May of the following year, payers are required to file an annual tax return.
The obligation to file an annual VAT return has its pros and cons:
+ about the end of the calendar year, the payer is able to correct errors in (monthly preliminary) tax returns by filing a single annual VAT return;
– if the payer corrects the awarded intracommunitary transactions, the correction may not be related to the period for which the summary report is submitted;
– the federal states usually do not compare the VIEs data on intracommunitary acquisitions of German payers before processing the annual VAT return.
In accordance with the marketing authorisation (see. 4.1.3) German payers are obliged to file an annual VAT return irrespective of the amount of their turnover.
This obligation allows the German financial authority to check the maximum turnover limit for small entrepreneurs.
In addition, the Responsible Tax Office is able to compare the annual VAT returns with the direct tax returns and the final accounts.
In the Czech Republic, tax administrators are able to determine the amount of the payer's turnover only from the filed income tax returns.
Unlike the Czech Republic, payers in Germany are obliged to file VAT returns in electronic form.
The introduction of the obligation to file tax returns electronically in the Czech Republic would help to increase the efficiency of the Czech tax administration.
Summary reports
Reporting and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic
The summary report (hereinafter referred to as "SH") shall be submitted in accordance with the provisions of § 102 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. the payer who made the delivery of the goods to another member state to a tax-registered person in another member state.
Data on the value of the delivered goods shall be always in the Czech currency in breakdown by individual tax entities, indicating their VAT ID under which they are registered in their country.
Data on services provided are not included in the SH.
SH shall be filed by payers with both monthly and quarterly tax periods for each calendar quarter within 25 days of its termination to the local tax office.
Correction of erroneous data is carried out in the subsequent SH within 15 days from the date of detection of errors.
The erroneous data in SH shall always be replaced by the data in the subsequent sh.
Like tax returns, payers can also file sh in electronic form.
In the event that the payer does not submit SH or subsequent sh and had them under Act No. 235/2004 Coll. file, prompts by the administrator of the tax to his administration and at the same time to learn about the consequences in the event of non-SH or subsequent SH, so that the tax administrator pursuant to section 37 of the act no. 337/1992 Sb. authorized for failure to fulfil obligations non-cash nature repeatedly impose a fine of up to $ 2 000 000 Czk (67 EUR 150).
The audit of the Sao found that the tax authorities did not usually use the possibility of imposing a fine on payers for non-compliance with their legal obligations.
In particular, in the case of SH are not tax entities sufficiently motivated to perform their duties, because no SH has no effect on the tax liability of VAT.
The tax administrator is obliged according to § 102 para. 5 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. the data in SH, or subsequent sh, shall be examined, any uncertainties removed and the data used for the determination of the tax liability.
In case of discrepancy of data in the SH and the data in the relevant (payers with a monthly tax period) or relevant (payers with a quarterly tax period) VAT return should the tax administrator to verify the accuracy of declared tax obligations referred to in the VAT return.
Erroneous data in SH the tax entity removes by submitting the subsequent SH itself, or may be prompted to do so.
The Tax Administrator shall correct the data on the supply of goods to other member states in the ADIS system in the event that::
– the payer shall not prove the information specified in SH (or subsequent SH), correcting it by submitting a subsequent SH,
- the tax administrator has shown that the information given by the payer in SH or subsequent sh is not true.
The tax administrator by inserting the repairs without filing a subsequent SH payer does not replace the filing of a tax entity, it only adjusts the information in the database VIES to keep it current, complete and accurate.
Sh data shall be sent to the member states concerned.
Can it send and receive only the national authority of the financial administration, designed to cooperate with other member states in the field of VAT; it is a DUTY (in the CZECH republic to perform this function, the MOF, the department of International cooperation in the administration of VAT (DUTY).
O_MCTL is an automatic message that customs duties receive from other member states.
Contains all faulty VAT ID specified in sent sh rows.
If an erroneous VAT ID is used in one of the transferred normal rows of SH or subsequent SH, an entry is made to the erroneous VAT ID table.
The table contains the so-called "notice of doubt on VAT ID".
The Tax Administrator shall verify the data and record the result of the verification in the system.
When acquiring goods from another member state, the payer is obliged to declare VAT and indicate the values of the acquisition on separate lines of the VAT return.
Selected cases of irregularities in the value of the procured goods declared by the Czech payer in his VAT return and in the value of the goods delivered, as stated by the payer from other member states in their SH, they are sent from DUTY on the irs to investigate.
Tax administrators have an obligation to investigate irregularities.
Three situations may occur:
(a) the value declared by the Czech payer in the relevant lines of VAT returns is lower than the value of the delivery declared by the EU payers.
In this case, the tax administrator will check the correctness of the data.
(B) the amount of the difference is 0.
This situation may occur either by changing the data in the EU (the foreign supplier will repair your SH) or by changing the data in the VAT return (the Czech tax entity itself in the meantime submits an additional tax return to VAT).
In this case, it is at the discretion of the tax administrator, whether despite this fact will verify the accuracy of the data in the VAT return.
(C) the value of the acquisition of goods from other member states indicated by the Czech taxpayer in the relevant lines of the VAT return is higher than the value of the goods delivered declared by the EU payers.
It is also at the discretion of the controller to verify the accuracy of the data.
After checking the difference and clarifying the causes of its occurrence, the tax administrator will put the result of the verification in the ADIS.
The screening results are transferred back to customs.
The number of cases sent from customs duties to the tax authorities for examination for each quarter of 2005 is shown in Chart No. 1 (note source: MF).
The above graph 1 shows that the number of cases transferred from DUTY to the fiscal authorities for each quarter of 2005 declined.
A significant decrease in the number occurred in 4. quarter 2005. The duty has increased the minimum threshold, including in view of the possibility of sending requests for information to other EU member states.
The discrepancy between VAT returns and EU data may not always be due to an error on the part of the domestic payer.
It may also be an error on the part of EU payers or an error arising from the fact that in individual EU member states certain types of transactions may be placed in a different way.
The most common reasons for irregularities in the values of reported transactions detected in the audited tax authorities are given in Table 1.
Reporting and processing of summary reports in Germany
Entrepreneurs, who carry out intracommunity supplies from GERMANY to other EU member states or are involved in the tripartite transactions, are obliged to submit every quarter of a year SH, in which are listed intracommunity supplies according to the beneficiaries (§ 18a para. 1 UStG).
SH must be administered within 10. on the month following the relevant calendar quarter.
If an extension of this period is allowed in the case of preliminary VAT returns, this also applies to SH.
Shinzo Abe: Shinzo Abe has been given the all-clear.
From 1. January 2007 must be submitted electronically.
Exceptions may be granted by the competent tax authorities certain tax payers, in order to avoid undue hardship.
In cases where taxpayers realise that the sh contains incorrect data, they are required to submit a corrective report within one month.
In the event that taxpayers do not file an SH, the duty shall initiate proceedings to enforce the submission of this report.
Part of this procedure is: – first reminder – second reminder associated with the threat of fines/periodic penalty payments, and – the assessment of a penalty.
Although the German tax code allows a fine of up to EUR 25 000 (§ 329 AO), it measures the fine in three steps, amounting to EUR 125, 250 and 500.
Furthermore, § 26a para. 1 no. 5 UStG stipulates that the payers are acting illegally if they deliberately or negligently do not submit a properly SH, shake it is incomplete, do not submit them in a timely manner or if at all they fix or repair late SH.
This offence can be punished with a fine of up to 5 000 euros.
Data on intracommunitary deliveries can not be entered in the VIEs by the tax authority, since the processing of SH is the sole task of customs duties.
Sh data is stored only in the duty system.
Therefore, sh data are visually available to the IRS only after processing them into customs duties.
The deadlines for processing SH are set out in Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003.
SH data must be stored within three months following the relevant calendar quarter.
In the event of incorrect VAT ID in the SH German payers receive the duty from another member state with the o_mctl codes.
Customs contacts a particular entrepreneur and asks him for the correct data.
If the duty fails to obtain the right information, the case is transmitted to the relevant tax authorities.
It is then up to these tax authorities to request the correct data.
During the inspection, BRH found that most entrepreneurs VAT ID at the request of Customs corrected.
However, the challenge, the threat and the assessment of three additional fines occupies in cases where the payer may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud, too much time.
These cases, which were ultimately reported to the competent financial authorities, were usually completed within one or two months.
The IRS denied exemptions for reported intracommunity deliveries in 73% of those cases.
When the payer provided the correct VAT ID, the IRS asked him to file for the duty corrected SH, since the IRS can not fix the data in VIES on its own.
The BRH found that neither the tax authorities nor Customs had checked the filing of the corrected SH, so payers often did not comply with the requests.
Due to the fact that the DUTY does not have access to the data from the VAT returns, the comparison of the data about the delivery of goods declared in VAT return and in the SH is not carried out prior to the submission of these data the DUTY of the other member states.
This control can only be carried out by the tax authorities and is usually applied in the preparation of VAT control.
Data obtained from other member states shall be processed into customs duties.
Incorrect VAT ID is selected and then submitted to the member states concerned.
These data are used for the purposes of the control of acquisitions carried out by the tax authorities.
Once they are entered into the system, the duty will recheck them based on comparisons with data from previous calendar quarters.
Where they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control information shall be generated and sent to the relevant tax authorities.
This procedure is applied steadily, while the compilation of data on the acquisition of goods or services for all VAT payer is created later and submitted to the tax authorities.
The RMS installed for the purposes of the assessment procedure shall subsequently double-check these data with intracommunitary acquisition data.
This system completely covers those entrepreneurs who do not have a full right to deduct VAT.
Comparison and evaluation
In the CZECH republic submitted to the payer who made the delivery of goods to another member state to a person registered for tax in another member state, SH within 25 days after the end of the calendar quarter, the locally competent tax office.
The tax authorities will process the SH and transfer the data to the duty.
The value of the supply of goods to another member state, referred to the payer in the SH, are in the financial offices compared with the values of supplies of goods to another member state, set out by these payers in the VAT returns.
The results of the comparison are used in the measurement procedure.
In Germany, payers who have made intracommunitary delivery are required to submit quarterly SH, up to 10. on the following calendar quarter.
SH payers serve on duty, from 1. 1. 2007 in electronic form.
The tax authorities have information from SH only available after processing them for customs duties.
Payers from the Czech Republic and Germany State in SH only the supply of goods, the supply of services is not specified in SH.
Unlike the Czech tax authorities, the German tax authorities are not able to correct the erroneous lines filed by SH on their own.
As a result of this limited access to data of the German VIES wasn't wrong VAT ID fixed, even if the payer gave the tax office the correct VAT ID.
The German tax administration does not compare the data on intracommunitary deliveries, which are indicated in the VAT return of the German payer and his sh.
Differences between the data of these two statements are usually not detected before the German duty provides data from VIES to other member states.
Given the BRH findings, it is clear that the comparison would increase the reliability of the data transmitted in VIES.
Data about the delivery of goods to the Czech tax payers, received from other member states, in the CZECH republic are compared with data on acquisition of goods from other member states declared by Czech payers in their tax returns for VAT.
Comparisons carry out duties separately for each calendar quarter.
The most significant cases of irregularities are forwarded to the financial authorities such as alerts for possible errors in the tax returns of payers.
Unlike the Czech tax administration, the German tax administration does not usually control the taxation of intracommunitary acquisitions.
Such a general check is processed only for payers who do not have a full right to deduct VAT.
In addition, the German tax administration controls the tax intrakomunitárních acquisition of other payers only, if RMS produce a control notice, or if the tax payer is designed for control anyway.
This procedure relieves the tax authorities from the need to clarify the reasons for each difference.
On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
Combating carousel fraud requires continuously updated information on intracommunitary acquisitions as soon as possible.
The current sh system, specially VIES, provides financial authorities with information that can be up to six months old.
This delay may be shortened by up to four months if payers serve Sherlock monthly.
Monthly filing would not be a significant increase in bureaucratic costs, since most payers in the Czech Republic and Germany are required to file monthly VAT returns – and SH does not require any additional information compared to the tax return.
In order to avoid bureaucratic costs, filing SH may be associated with filing a VAT return.
However, the obligation to submit SH monthly would cause more time disagreements between the reporting of intracommunity delivery and intracommunity acquisition, and could increase the flow of data between individual duties.
In 2006, the German federal government considered the general provisions of the monthly SH.
Its implementation failed because of the doubts of federal states.
They feared that the monthly submission of vies data to customs by other member states could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In fact, if the obligation of monthly submission of SH and monthly data transfer should be efficient, the monthly update of the VIES would require a european standard monthly SH.
Statistics on the delivery and acquisition of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany
In the framework of foreign trade, Germany is the most important trading partner for the Czech Republic.
The total volumes of intracommunitary transactions in goods between the Czech Republic and Germany are presented in Table 2.
Both SAI requested data on the number of wrong tin or VAT IDs contained in the o_mctl reports transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany for each quarter of the audited period.
These data are contained in the following tables.
The data show substantial differences.
The cause of these differences may be a different basis for determining the number of o_mctl messages.
While the Czech CLO relates their numbers to the calendar quarter in which it was filed SH, German the DUTY relates their numbers to the calendar quarter in which the report was O_MCTL taken.
Level 3 International Information Exchange
Implementation of the international exchange of information in the Czech Republic
The international exchange of information allows tax authorities to obtain from other member states information regarding intrakomunitárních commercial transactions and taxpayers that these transactions happen.
Council regulation (EC) no 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing regulation (EEC) no 218/92, distinguishes between two basic categories of information exchange, and the exchange of information on request and exchange of information without prior request.
The international exchange of information on request is carried out in the form of so-called requests for information (hereinafter referred to as "Joi"), using standardised SCAC forms.
The tax authorities of the CZECH republic is sending its RFIS, or answers to the RFIS through the financial directorate, customs DUTY, which ensures the translation of the information provided on standardized forms SCAC into a foreign language and their dispatch to other member states.
The DUTY also ensures the intake of RFIS from other member states and the replies to the sent RFIS, their translation into Russian and distribution of the locally competent tax authorities for execution.
In art. 8 Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003 provides for a maximum period of 3 months from the date of receipt of the application.
The Sao scrutiny was carried out by all Sao, transmitted during the controlled period between the Czech Republic and Germany.
Of the total number of 94 RFIS, taken in the CZECH republic from GERMANY, was 70 cases (i.e. 74,5 %) settled within the prescribed three-month period, the other 23 cases (i.e. 24,5 %) were settled after this period and the remaining 1 case was not to the time of the SAO audit, the answer to GERMANY sent.
More detailed information on the deadlines during which responses to the Czech Republic received from the Czech Republic were sent from the Czech Republic contains graph 2.
Of the total number of 335 RFIS sent from the CZECH republic to GERMANY was on 136 cases (i.e., 40.6% of) the answer delivered within the stipulated three-month period, other 179 (i.e. 53,4 %) requests were answered after the deadline and for 19 cases (i.e., 5.7 %) is not to the time of the SAO audit, the reply of the federal republic of GERMANY received (in the remaining 1 case was of the transmitted data can determine when the response from GERMANY delivered).
For more detailed information on the deadlines which have been to the CZECH republic delivered responses to RFIS sent to GERMANY, includes graph no.3.
The percentage expression of the values of intracommunitary transactions, indicated in the ŽOI transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany, includes graph 4.
As can be seen from the chart above, the value of commercial transactions, verified through the Joi, most often ranged in the band above 60 000 euros.
The international exchange of information without prior request shall take place either by automatic or structured automatic exchange of information, or in the form of spontaneous exchange of information.
Tax authorities from other member states are often provided with information that may be relevant to them in the management of VAT without prior request.
In the Czech Republic, All information is collected on customs duties.
Information shall be transmitted electronically between member states.
"Automatic exchange" according to the Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003, means the systematic communication of predefined information to other member states without prior request, at pre-established regular intervals.
"Structured automatic exchange", then, means the systematic communication of predefined information to other member states without prior request and as soon as that information becomes available.
The Czech Republic provides other member states with information on the delivery of new means of transport in the form of automatic exchange.
This information is available to the tax authorities from the form of the report on the delivery of a new means of transport pursuant to § 19 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. and a copy of the tax document issued.
The tax administrator fills in the processing of the above-mentioned form data into a specially created template and forward them promptly to the liaison worker in the financial directorate, where these data are collected in a timely fashion, i.e. at the latest within two months from the end of the quarter in which such information is available, forwarded to the DUTY for subsequent processing and transmission to other member states.
Further provided by the CZECH republic to other member states information on distance selling, which is exempt from VAT in the member state of origin, information about the operations within the EU, which appear to be unjustified and the information on potential "missing traders".
That information shall be sent to other member states in the form of spontaneous exchange using the SCAC form.
Implementation of international information exchange in Germany
In Germany, both requests for information and the processing of spontaneous information are initiated by the local tax office.
The tax authorities send the completed SCAC 2004 form by email directly to the German customs office, which transmits the SCAC forms to foreign customs.
The financial authorities were instructed to write their requests for information or its own spontaneous information only in German; even the used form SCAC is not multilingual.
Half of the German requests for information, controlled BRH has been sent with the aim of ensuring the taxation of intrakomunitárního acquisition in another member state, where appropriate, to demonstrate the liberation of intrakomunitárního delivery from GERMANY to another member state from the tax.
If the German CUSTOMS receives a request for information from another member state shall check the value of the supply of goods or the provision of services referred to in the application for a minimum limit of 15 000 EUROS.
If for this application there is no reasonable reason, German CUSTOMS will reject any request containing an amount lower than this limit.
In addition, the German DUTY translates free texts form SCAC [(B1-17) or (E)], if these texts are not in German nor in English.
To answer the request for information, the duty sends the request to the relevant tax office, pointing out a three-month period.
There are no additional deadlines for processing applications at specific organizational levels of tax administration.
Although the German duty has technical conditions for monitoring the elapsed time limits, it lacks sufficient staffing capacity to notify the tax authorities of the answer to unfilled requests for information.
The tax authorities get the necessary information by sending a letter to the taxpayer or carrying out an audit.
Auditors usually choose between two distinct types of audits: the special audit of VAT, which applies to any taxable process over a period of several months or the so-called inspection of the VAT, which may be for only one trading operation, which was carried out recently.
This short and flexible type of audit does not require any notification to the taxpayer and has demonstrated its usefulness in the investigation of the individual's taxable business operations.
In the framework of the automatic exchange, without prior request, provides the federal republic of GERMANY to other member states information about the VAT ID assigned payers who are resident in other member states, – the repayment of input tax the tax payers who are resident in other member states.
In addition, the German authorities undertook to provide other member states with the following information through structured automatic exchange:
and. Delivery of new means of transport to entrepreneurs without the use of their VAT ID, B. forwarding or catalogue sales in other member states not taxable in Germany, C. significant differences between intracommunitary purchases declared by the payer and VIES data provided by other member states, D. intracommunitary delivery of goods, which the German payer did not report in SH, because he treated the deliveries as domestic transactions, e. the potential "missing trader", which made intracommunity transactions independently of the validity of their VAT ID, f. entrepreneurs who supplied goods to potential "missing traders" or those recipients who have abused their VAT ID.
Comparison and evaluation
The dispatch of Joi or spontaneous information is initiated both in the Czech Republic and in Germany by the local competent tax authorities, which send the completed SCAC form for customs duties.
While the Czech CLO uses a bilingual form to SCAC (English – English) and sent the information translates into the English or the German language, the German financial authorities are governed by instructions according to which they have write RFIS or spontaneous information only in German at the jednojazyčném form.
German customs does not guarantee the translation of German texts.
Vetting of the Joi submitted in the period from 1. 5. 2004 to 31. 12. 2005 between CZECH republic and GERMANY found the SAO, the Czech tax administration settled the matter within the prescribed three-month time limit for 74.5% of the received requests, while the RFIS sent to GERMANY were the German tax administration are dealt with in the prescribed period only in 40.6% of cases.
Although the German duty warns the tax authorities of a three-month period, it does not monitor the elapsed time limits.
The result of the missing alerts is a large number of delayed responses to the Joi.
Because of these problems, the BRH recommended regular alerts on tariffs.
The situation has already improved.
According to the latest information, the German duty now alerts the tax authorities to answer unfinished answers to the Joi.
VAT risk management
Risk management in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, VAT risk management deals with several departments at different organizational levels of tax administration.
Within the framework of the MF, the following departments deal with the issues of risk management and combating VAT fraud:
The Department of VAT methodology and enforcement and within it a VAT risk management report which, inter alia, manages the selection of risks of possible tax evasion and evaluates the trends of these risks at domestic and community level.
It coordinates nationwide the functioning of the role of the credibility of VAT returns and the use of VIES data in terms of the risks of tax evasion in intracommunitary transactions.
Based on data from the Czech trade balance, the Czech Republic evaluates risk commodities, processes conceptually VAT risk management and cooperates in this area with the relevant EU institutions and with other member states.
Department of International cooperation in the administration of VAT, which, inter alia, provides for the exchange of information in the field of VAT, involved in the creation and maintenance of information databases, analyzes the data from other member states contained in the VIES, ensures public awareness and provides other forms of international cooperation within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003.
Both SAI requested data on the number of wrong tin or VAT IDs contained in the o_mctl reports transmitted between the Czech Republic and Germany for each quarter of the audited period.
These data are contained in the following tables.
The data show substantial differences.
The cause of these differences may be a different basis for determining the number of o_mctl messages.
While the Czech CLO relates their numbers to the calendar quarter in which it was filed SH, German the DUTY relates their numbers to the calendar quarter in which the report was O_MCTL taken.
Department of Methodology of tax inspection and search, which, inter alia, conducted a risk analysis in the framework of methodical management of tax inspections and in accordance with the risk analysis sets the priorities for the focus of tax inspections in the plans of the financial directorate, processes risk analysis in the context of reducing tax evasion, including the collection of knowledge obtained in the administration of taxes and from other sources and suggests measures to reduce tax evasion.
The financial directorates are set up the search department, which shall carry out, inter alia, a search of tax subjects and areas, which are risky from the point of view of the occurrence of tax fraud (e.g. internet shops, the gold, the pharmaceutical industry), search of unregistered tax agents in terms of risk of tax evasion (e.g. from the field of internet services, mediation of work, radio, and print services, etc.), the analysis links the string of fraud and transmission of information to the territorial financial authorities.
On the selected 12 tax authorities, specialized control departments are established.
They have regional competence, tax inspections outside the territorial competence of the tax authorities are carried out on the basis of mandates.
Need to set up a department specialized tax inspections resulted on the basis of the increasing detection of new and improved forms of tax evasion, that occur especially in subjects linked to the chains.
This department focus on the control of tax bodies according to the requirements of the search department, tax entities with specific activities and multinational companies and tax bodies of a large range of activities in terms of size of turnover.
The system of the ADIS have been integrated following the mechanisms used to limit risks in the field of VAT: – the role of Credibility of the tax returns of VAT, used to evaluate the riskiness of filed tax returns, – the role of Selection of taxpayers for inspection, allowing you to choose from based on the selection criteria of the payer to control – the role of the VIES, through which they have to the tax authorities access to data provided from other member states of the EU.
The role of the VIES allows, inter alia: – examine the validity of the VAT ID of the payers of other member states, – to obtain from other member states of the value of the goods delivered to the Czech payer, declared in the SH all his suppliers from other member states, – generate a report of payers who have not lodged SH, – to carry out a formal check of the data, that payers of the CZECH republic stated in the SH, before sending these data to other member states, – generate a report of payers, for which data on the supply of goods to other member states referred to in the VAT returns do not coincide with the data in the SH, – generate a report of payers, for which the value of acquisition of goods from other member states referred to in the VAT returns does not coincide with the data declared in the SH all his suppliers from other member states.
In the framework of the activities to mitigate risk of tax evasion are the tax administrator access to the registers of public authorities such as commercial register, land register, register of motor vehicles the registry of business trade etc.
More detailed information is provided in Chapter 4.4.1 submission and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic.
Risk management in Germany
Due to the federative (federal) structure of GERMANY the federal tax administration (especially CUSTOMS) and the tax administration of the 16 federal states involved in the development and operation of the RMS.
Although there are joint development working groups, neither customs nor tax administrations of federal states share a completely consistent database.
At the level of the DUTY, collects department ST I 2 (hereinafter referred to as "PIECES" – coordination unit for special audits, VAT and tax investigation) the findings of the audit relating to tax fraud in a special database called OPUS.
KUSS, in collaboration with the tax authorities, introduced a new database called ZAUBER designed to transmit the names of tax fraudsters "missing traders".
KUSS coordinates related cases of national and cross-border tax fraud.
The experience of KUSS is reflected in the development of RMS in working groups.
In addition, the specialists of several other departments of Customs and MF are entrusted with the duties and powers associated with the RMS.
At the level of customs duties, a formal control of the composition of VAT ID of other member states in the SH submitted by German payers is established.
This formal inspection is performed prior to providing the data from the SH to the other member states, to improve the clarity and use of the data provided VIES (see 4.4.2).
Verification of the validity of the VAT ID mentioned in the SH is done on the basis of codes O_MCTL provided by other member states (for the procedure for correcting an invalid VAT ID, see. also 4.4.2).
In addition, it is the RMS DUTY is based on data from VIES to be transmitted by other member states and creates several types of control messages based on several characteristics, which usually figure in the so-called revolving business operations, in order to identify potential "missing traders".
The federal tax authorities are instructed to process these Control reports and, in some cases, report on the results of their duties findings.
The findings of the audit of the BRH has confirmed that it is necessary to take into account all available characteristics, it has to be with sufficient probability implied the existence of a case of tax fraud (instead of an exclusive focus on the company's turnover).
Therefore, the BRH suggested to the MF that different characteristics should be taken into account when processing reports.
RMS should also be affected by other factors, such as payment behaviour (morale) of the taxpayer, discipline (economic activities) or shareholder structure.
The second level of RMS is processed in the tax administrations of the federal states and is aimed at processing VAT returns.
For example, RMS generates a list of those payers who have reported intracommunitary delivery in tax returns.
This list is sent to customs to monitor the full filing of SH.
In addition, this type of RMS compares the intracommunitary acquisition, reported in the payer'S annual VAT return, with data from the VIES system.
The tax administration of the federal states is trying to avoid comparisons to quarterly data because this comparison would reveal too many discordant data, which are attributed to other reasons than tax evasion or tax fraud; for example,:
- different period of implementation of the intracommunitary transaction in the opinion of the supplier, on the one hand, and the recipient, on the other;
– different accounting treatment of sales discounts and sales promotions (incentives) and their different reporting in the tax return.
In addition to comparing data from tax returns to VAT and system VIES many federal states have introduced elements of the RMS, which are based on the data of tax returns for VAT and some other facts (such as, for example, the structure of the title company, the age of the shareholders, number of employees and payment behaviour/ morality of the taxpayer).
Bavaria introduced the RMS based on the rules, which allow the team of specialists on tax fraud (hereinafter referred to as risk managers) to program your own rules for the exclusion of potential perpetrators of tax fraud.
This RMS is applied at the moment when the tax authorities process the monthly VAT return.
Therefore, the competent tax authority will receive a recommendation made by the RMS before the VAT is fixed.
Since this RMS is unable to reflect current findings in its activities, risk managers must adjust the relevant rules based on feedback from the tax authorities.
Administrative district Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania programmed adaptive artificial neural network with the data of tax files in which the check revealed the tax evasion.
Based on these data, the RMS is able to determine the characteristics of tax evasion.
RMS creates a monthly list of tax files suspected of tax evasion.
The relevant tax authorities use this list as a basis for deciding on the audit of proposed taxpayers.
After the audit has been carried out, auditors must report on their findings so that the results of the list can be reflected in the RMS.
The administrative area of North Rhine-Westphalia uses adaptive artificial neural network, which is combined with a system of fuzzy-based rules.
On the basis of a large number of data assessed tax returns for VAT and some other facts this neural-fuzzy system or a system of selection of potentially useful information (the so-called data-mining system) calculates the probability that a taxpayer committed tax fraud.
After that, he compiles a monthly list of potential perpetrators of fraud.
Local financial authorities use this list as a basis for the selection of taxpayers for review and reported the findings of the control centre for data processing.
The introduction of one of these three RMS in the other Länder is ongoing.
Since none of these three RMS are based on the same approach, a combination of all systems seems useful for dealing with tax fraud.
The question remains whether this system will lead to the expected results.
Comparison and evaluation
Although in this report cannot be discussed specific criteria RMS in the CZECH republic and GERMANY, the SAO and the BRH found that each member state has developed its own RMS.
As well as the different approaches in the three federal states of Germany, the RMS of each EU state has its strengths and weaknesses.
The tax authorities of EU member states are currently discussing new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.
VAT fraud - especially carousel fraud-does not turn out to be a national but rather a European problem.
Payers in fraudulent activities act simultaneously not only in one member state, but in several states.
An effective RMS cannot be developed by only one member state.
Successful RMS criteria, components and approaches must be exchanged and implemented in each EU member state, otherwise fraudsters will choose the member state with the weakest RMS.
The loss of VAT due to fraud in the EU may not affect the member state of the initiator of the fraud.
Any member state involved in fraudulent activities may be affected.
Therefore, there should be a European Exchange and discussion of the RMS.
Selected control findings in the verification of business transactions
In the framework of cooperation in realization of parallel control actions, check the SAO and BRH quality and use of information about the selected business transactions that were the subject of international exchange of information between the tax administrations of the CZECH republic and GERMANY.
Furthermore, the two audit institutions jointly check the implementation of several business transactions, for which there were doubts about their implementation, or inconsistencies in the way the payers of both countries, these business transactions had reported in its tax returns for VAT, or SH.
At the request of BRH, the Sao examined a total of 8 cases relating to commercial transactions between 8 Czech and 8 German tax entities.
In 43 cases, the Sao examined the values of INTRACOMMUNITARY transactions with SRN reported by Czech payers in their tax returns and SH.
At the request of the Sao, BRH examined a total of 23 cases relating to commercial transactions between 23 German and 21 Czech tax entities.
Important information has been exchanged under Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003 through official communication with customs duties.
The examination of selected cases found, inter alia, that a different method of registration in EU member states leads to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:
1.
According to data in VIES, the Czech payer should have acquired in III. quarter 2004 from the German payer of goods worth EUR 60 500.
Since the Czech payer only reported the acquisition of the goods worth EUR 29 869, the Czech tax administrator sent a request to Germany to verify the value of the goods delivered.
In response to a letter delivered from Germany, the German side stated that in II. quarter 2004, the German payer supplied the Czech payer with goods worth EUR 27 381, in III. quarter of EUR 31 997 and IV. quarter 2004 worth EUR 10 276.
The reply further indicated that the VAT ID of the German payer was valid only from 28. 9. 2004, but the German duty in 2006 at the additional request of the German payer for a certificate of validity of VAT ID retroactively issued a certificate of validity of VAT ID from 1. 5. 2004.
The German payer made a correction SH.
On the basis of this information, the Czech payer was the acquisition of the goods.
SAO by asking the local tax authority in the CZECH republic found that the Czech payer on the basis of the investigation, the tax administrator filed for each tax period of the year 2004, additional tax returns for VAT, in which the increased value of the goods acquired from other member states and at the same time claim to deduct VAT on acquisitions of goods from other member states.
Of these additional tax returns to VAT, however, the Czech tax administrator could not clearly determine whether they also included the value of the supply from the above German supplier.
On the basis of a request from the SAO, the BRH found that the German supplier was registered for VAT in September 2003.
However, since he did not apply for a VAT ID at the time of registration, he was assigned only an identification number for transactions within the SRN.
Although in Germany it is not normally possible to allocate a VAT ID to a payer retroactively, in this case the German tax officer assigned the above-mentioned German VAT ID payer retroactively to 1.5.2004 in 2006.
The German CUSTOMS allocates a VAT ID retroactively, if a German businessman did not cause a delay in the allocation; for example, if the delay caused DUTY after plátcově application for a VAT ID.
In this case, the duty allocates VAT ID retroactively, since the entrepreneur does not need his own valid VAT ID for intracommunitary delivery under Section 6 of the German VAT Act.
On the contrary, the German recipient does not need a valid VAT ID of his supplier in order to declare an intracommunitary acquisition.
Due to these different practices among member states, the German duty was retroactively allocated in this particular case to the VAT ID.
2.
As part of the international exchange of information on the examination of the registration of the German VAT payer, the Czech tax administrator asked for VAT.
VIES reported a registration date of 5. 3. 2005, whereby the date 1 was indicated on the registration certificate of the German payer issued locally by the competent German tax authority. 10. 2004.
In the reply received from Germany, the German party stated that the German tax entity had been registered since 1. 10. 2004, but VAT ID was provided to him in Germany for organizational reasons up to 16. 2. 2005.
By asking the local tax administrator, the Sao found that the Czech tax administrator had carried out a VAT check on the Czech tax payer during tax period III. quarters 2004 to II. quarter 2005.
This control of the financial bureau found that the Czech payer has included in the VAT tax return services worth 9 897 Czk (314 EUROS), granted by the German payer in the period before his registration for VAT (i.e. before 1. 10. 2004).
For tax period III. quarter 2004, the tax office paid VAT to the tax entity amounting to CZK 1 880 (EUR 60).
According to the request of the SAO, the BRH found that the German payer was assigned a VAT ID of up to 16. 2. 2005, when he informed the Tax Office of his business, which he started in 2004.
In addition, the Tax Office registered it for VAT retrospectively on 1. October 200415 to monitor the filing of the annual VAT return for 2004.
In this tax return the payer reported intracommunitary acquisition from the Czech Republic worth 160 euros (about 5000 CZK).
3. The Czech payer declared in the VAT return for September 2004 and SH for III. quarter 2004 delivery of goods worth CZK 114,615 (EUR 3,642) to the German payer.
The Czech tax administrator, when verifying the registration of the German payer in the VIES system, found that his registration was valid from 11. 11. 2004, i.e. only after delivery of the goods by the Czech payer to Germany.
The Czech payer submitted an additional VAT DAP in which he declared the tax base on transactions made in the Czech Republic worth CZK 114 615 (EUR 3 642) and VAT of CZK 21 777 (EUR 692), which he paid.
NKU query with the relevant tax authority in the CZECH republic found that the Czech payer subsequently filed an application for retrial in the matter of additional tax returns for VAT and as a means of evidence submitted confirming the German tax administration that the German payer was tax led from 1. 1. 2000.
Therefore, the Czech tax administrator verified the validity of the registration of the German payer in the framework of the international exchange of information.
The reply received from Germany indicated that up to 11 were allocated to the German payer. 11. 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods.
For this reason, the tax administrator in the Czech Republic rejected the request for retrial.
BRH found that, in the present case was not an intracommunity acquisition of goods, because the German payer received a VAT ID to 11.11.2004.
However, the German recipient has reported the acquisition as an intracommunity acquisition and showed a VAT on this purchase, he demanded the refund of input tax in the same amount.
However, there were no changes in the value of the VAT, which had a German payer's obligation to pay, didn't fix the tax administrator in GERMANY data in his VAT return.
The BRH also found that the name of the German payer referred to in the ŽOI was changed during the processing of the reply in Germany, resulting in the confusion of two German tax entities.
This change in the name of the German payer also confused the Czech tax administrator.
4.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax administrator verified the acquisition of goods by the Czech payer in I. quarter 2005 worth EUR 22 686 from the German payer.
NKU asking at the locally competent tax administrator in the CR, found out that this manager has performed in the Czech payer of the local investigation, which verified that the delivery of the goods took place and the Czech payer of the invoice for the goods in question were booked and paid.
The Czech payer admitted the acquisition of goods in the VAT return, because the German supplier on the invoice did not indicate their VAT ID, but only the tax number intended for domestic transactions in GERMANY.
In the application of VIES, the Czech tax administrator found that the German payer was registered for VAT for intracommunity transactions 21. 4. 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech payer.
The Czech tax administrator also asked the German tax administration by sending a copy of the certificate of registration of the German tax payer, if necessary, could take steps to tax assessment.
The Czech Tax Authority assessed the transaction in question as acquisition of goods from the non-payer from Germany and therefore did not charge the Czech tax on that transaction.
BRH found that the German legislation does not have a payer who supplies the goods to other member states, allocated a VAT ID, in order to intracommunity supplies of goods exempt from VAT.
The supplier must only have at his disposal a VAT ID of the purchaser from another member state and be able to demonstrate the transport of the goods in question to another member state.
Thus, according to the German VAT Act, it was an intracommunitary transaction, and VAT should be charged in the Czech Republic.
In any case, it is important that the Czech tax administrator noticed this transaction, since the delivery of the machine at that value was not the basic object of the German supplier's business.
As described in chapter 4.6.2, the German DUTY to refuse to answer RFIS that relate to intrakomunitárních transactions worth less than EUR 15 000: 5.
The Czech payer had, according to data from VIES in III. quarter 2004 acquire from the German payer goods worth 12 561 euros.
The Czech tax administrator carried out a tax inspection with the tax entity for this tax period.
In the framework of international administrative cooperation, the German tax administration requested through the SCAC form to verify the delivery of these goods.
The Czech payer of the acquisition of goods denied, claiming that with the German company never traded and in his accounts was the acquisition of the goods posted.
The German tax authorities the requirement to provide evidence – contracts, orders, invoices and shipping documents rejected on the grounds that the turnover does not exceed a value of 15 000 EUR and was listed no further explanatory justification.
Because the Czech tax administrator did not obtain evidence for additional tax assessment from the captured goods, he ended a tax audit without a finding, and the tax liability remained charged the original amount.
On the basis of a request from the SAO, the BRH found that the German payer acted as a so – called "fiscal representative" (§ 22 A-e UStG).
The German payer reported these deliveries in its annual VAT return and in SH.
The right to an exemption of delivery was recognized to him.
On the basis of the notice BRH, the German tax office will send to the Czech Republic the documents necessary for the tax on purchased goods in the Czech Republic.
As stated in Chapter 4.6.1, the replies to the CR sent from Germany to the CR exceeded the three-month deadline more frequently than the replies from the CR to Germany: 6.
The Sao audit found that the Czech Tax Administration sent on 5. 10. 2005 to Germany a request for information concerning the verification of the value of the goods delivered for 4. quarter 2004.
The German payer declared in SH for this period the delivery of goods to the Czech payer worth EUR 86 307, but the Czech payer stated in the same period in the VAT return the acquisition of goods only worth EUR 35 314.
In reply to ŽOI, delivered to the Czech Republic 9. 5. 2006, that is, after the expiry of the settlement period laid down in art. 8 Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003, the German party stated that the request could not be processed, since the operation of the German company was at the end of 2005 terminated.
Since the German tax administration failed to meet the deadline for the settlement of the ŽOI, the Czech tax administration did not have the documents necessary for the tax procedure in the Czech Republic.
7. In 2005, the Czech tax administrator requested, through the SCAC form, a verification of the delivery of cars worth EUR 1,265,554 to the German payer, carried out in III. and IV. quarter 2004, which showed signs of carousel fraud.
The Sao found that no response had been received from the Sao pending the inspection.
In addition, the Sao, by asking the local tax administrator, found that the Czech payer did not include in the VAT return the supply of new means of Transport for that German payer worth CZK 11 816 103 (EUR 375 472).
The Czech tax administrator corrected the data in the tax return and the Czech tax entity filed a subsequent SH.
On the basis of a request from the SAO, the BRH found that the German duty had not, for technical reasons, been forwarded by the aforementioned Joi to the local tax authority for examination.
After notice to BRH was in GERMANY conducted by the German maker of the check, in which it was found that the acquisition of all the car was properly taxed and that the cars were sold next to the payer in GERMANY.
8. According to data from VIES, the Czech payer should have acquired in IV. quarter 2004 from the German payer passenger car worth 48 500 euros.
The acquisition of these goods was not acknowledged by the Czech payer.
By asking the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the Sao found that the Czech payer had not filed VAT returns since August 2004.
Tax returns were not filed by the Czech payer even after calls from the tax administrator, the Tax Office therefore gave him 23. 5. 2005 levied VAT of CZK 0 for the period October to December 2004.
2. 6. 2005 the duty drew attention to the aforementioned delivery from the German payer.
Since the Czech payer did not cooperate with the tax administrator, he sent the tax administrator Zoi to Germany regarding the aforementioned delivery.
Because the answer to the Zoi was delivered to the Czech Republic up to 7. 2. 2007, until the end of the Sao audit, it was not known how the Czech tax administrator used the information obtained by the international exchange.
The Tax Office cancelled the Czech payer on 23. 8. 2005 VAT registration.
In some cases, the RFIS sent only a partial answer, because the inspection by the tax authorities by the payers not at the time of inspection the SAO and BRH completed:
9.
The Czech tax administrator requested in 2005 through the form SCAC to check the delivery car in the $ 16 to 991 EUROS to the German payers, made in the III. quarter 2004, which showed signs of carousel fraud.
In response to the ŽOI, the German tax administrator stated that he had only an invoice issued by the Czech payer for delivery worth EUR 16 335.
On the basis of a request from the SAO, the BRH found that the inspection carried out by the German tax office with the SRN purchaser had not yet been completed.
The German purchaser reported the acquisition of goods worth EUR 16 335 twice in tax returns for the months of August and September 2004.
10. In 2005, the Czech tax administrator requested, through the SCAC form, a verification of the delivery of cars to the German payer of EUR 198 167, carried out in IV. quarter 2004 and I. quarter 2005, which showed signs of carousel fraud.
The German tax administration sent a partial response to the Czech Republic, confirming the acquisition of some cars by the German payer, and further stating that the investigation in Germany had not been completed.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The SAO found that the Czech contractor by the locally competent financial authority in order to verify the pumping of excessive deductions of VAT a few local investigation, which found their unauthorized pumping.
BRH found that the German payer reported in that period in their tax returns to VAT acquisition of goods from other member states in the total value of 579 € 114 and that the inspection, carried out by the German financial authority at the of the maker of GERMANY has not yet terminated.
In chapter 4.4.1 described the reasons for the differences between the values intrakomunitárního the acquisition of goods, declared by the beneficiary in the tax return and the values stated by the supplier in his SH.
The controlled cases showed that the most common reasons for differences wasn't time shift or putting incorrect values intrakomunitárního delivery of the goods in the SH:
11.
The Czech payer had in I. quarter 2005 according to data from the VIES system to acquire from the German payer goods worth EUR 35 716, but the Czech payer did not admit this acquisition.
Since the Czech payer did not cooperate with the tax administrator and did not engage in any activity at the company's headquarters, the Czech tax administrator requested to verify in the international exchange of information how the German payer communicated with the Czech payer.
The reply to the letter received from the German tax authorities indicated that the Czech tax entity was unknown at the address communicated and that the goods were taken over by the negotiated carrier.
The order was for a total amount of 155 000 euros, but the German payer supplied only goods worth 21 659 euros.
The Czech payer sent a false receipt to the German payer for payment of EUR 155 153 in favour of the German payer.
After finding the fraudulent transaction made by the Czech maker of the German payers with the help of his other Czech customers managed to get the material supplied by the back, with the exception of one item worth 7 916 EUROS.
By asking the local tax office in the Czech Republic, the Sao found that, based on the information obtained, the tax administrator measured the Czech VAT payer on the acquisition of goods from other member states amounting to CZK 388 522 (EUR 13 044).
On the basis of a request from the SAO, the BRH confirmed that the German supplier had declared only EUR 7 916 to the Czech payer after the repairs.
According to the German legal situation, the German payer reported the corrected value of the goods and a reduction in the taxable amount in the quarter in which the repair took place.
Thus its SH included the following delivery values in relation to the Czech payer:
12.
In the framework of the international exchange of information, the German tax authority requested, through the SCAC form, to verify the supply of goods and services carried out in III. quarter 2005.
According to this ŽOI, the Czech payer should have delivered goods totalling EUR 396 126 to the German payer during this period and provided services worth EUR 11 885.
The Sao found that the Czech tax administrator had carried out a local investigation with the Czech taxpayer in order to verify this delivery.
In response to the ŽOI, the Czech tax administrator stated that the Czech payer had supplied the German payer with a production line including Assembly.
The individual parts of the production line were delivered by the Czech payer before the Czech entry into the EU and after 1. 5. 2004 the line was assembled on the basis of the order.
The German payer did not take the assembled line because it claimed to have defects.
In III. quarter 2005 the Czech payer issued invoices to the German payer for amounts of EUR 107 100 per assembly and EUR 11 885 for services.
The German payer took over the issued invoices, but did not recognize them and did not pay.
The Sao also found, by asking the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic, that all invoices are duly registered in the accounting of the Czech payer.
In VAT returns for III. quarter 2005 only amounts documented by the Czech payer relating to invoicing after 1 are listed. 5. 2004.
BRH found that based on a reply from the Czech tax administration, the local tax authority in Germany concluded that the transaction involved the delivery of goods from the Czech payer to the German payer, including assembly services.
In this special case, the place of so-called work filling is where the assembly of the production line occurred.
According to the German VAT Act, the German recipient of the delivered service is obliged to pay VAT.
At the same time, the recipient can claim a deduction of VAT from the same amount.
Since there would be no changes in the value of VAT which the German payer was obliged to pay, the corrections in the VAT return were neglected by the German tax office.
13. The Czech payer A was to acquire a machine worth EUR 58 000 from the German payer C in February 2005, according to data from VIES.
The Czech tax administrator sent a request to Germany to verify this delivery.
In response to the RFIS, the German party claimed that this machine already in 2004 the German payer C added Czech payer B, which, however, should this machine to the German payer C in October 2004 to return.
According to information of the German tax administration was the machine shipped back to GERMANY, but transported to the organizational units of the German payer C in the CZECH republic.
Furthermore, the reply to the request for information indicated that the German payer C sold the machine to the Czech payer A. in February 2005.
This payer machine took over at the headquarters of the organizational branch of the German payer C in the Czech Republic.
Since the delivery took place only within the Czech Republic, it was not an intracommunitary delivery of goods.
By asking the tax administrator locally responsible payer B, the Sao found that according to VIES data, the German payer C delivered in III. quarter 2004 Czech payer B goods (another machine) worth EUR 88 027.
Payer B denied this acquisition of the goods, therefore the local tax administrator of the Czech Republic sent the ŽOI to Germany.
According to the response to this request, the delivery of the machine took place.
Further investigation by the payer B found the Czech tax administrator that the machine in the value of the 88 027 EUROS in the accounts of the payer B did not find, and that this could be a machine of the same type was delivered to the organizational component of the German payer C the Czech payer And in February 2005.
The Sao also found that the Czech tax administrator was the local taxpayer and carried out a local investigation with that taxpayer.
The tax administrator had at his disposal an invoice from the German payer C of 7. 2. 2005, to which payer A. was listed as a customer of the machine.
The Czech tax administrator found that the payer A does not have this invoice included in the accounting.
The payer and had a lease agreement with another Czech company, where the object of the lease was a machine of the same type.
The handover of the machine from the leasing company took place 9. 2. 2005, the carriage of the machine was provided by the leasing company.
The information contained in the reply to the request for information was not used by the Czech tax authority to determine the tax liability for payer A.
BRH found that the German payer C machine worth EUR 88 027 did not deliver to the Czech Republic but to another German payer D.
Thus, it was not an intracommunitary supply of goods, but a taxable transaction in Germany.
For these reasons, the German tax administrator did not recognize the German taxpayer C exemption and corrected the data in his tax return.
German payer D supplied the machine to Czech payer B.
According to German legislation, this supply was not taxable in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.
In addition, BRH found that the German payer C listed in its SH for I. quarter 2005 delivery of the machine worth EUR 58 000 to Czech payer A.
This delivery was not examined during the tax inspection carried out by the German tax authority.
The following scheme shows the relations between the participants of the above business transactions.
14.
The Sao found that the Czech tax administration had adopted on 4. 10. 2005 from Germany a request for information in which the German tax administrator requested verification of intracommunitary delivery from the German payer worth EUR 879 680 625 to the Czech payer.
According to the German tax administrator, there was a suspicion that this was a pretentious intracommunitary supply of goods.
The ŽOI also stated that the German payer had not carried out any active business since 1999.
The Sao found that the Czech tax administrator had carried out a local investigation with the Czech payer.
According to the statement of the manager of the Czech company in the above case was the claim of the German payer to the German tax authorities apply a Czech payer as a partner of the German company in a German tax office.
According to the information provided by the SAO does not have a Czech tax administrator to the present time no information about the German tax administration issues related to the Czech payer, address.
According to the available information, this was not a delivery of goods, yet that value is still included in the VIES system as an intracommunitary delivery of goods to the Czech payer from Germany.
The main reason of the following irregularities were that the beneficiaries did not show in his tax returns intracommunity acquisition of goods (see also chapter 4.4.1):
15. According to data from VIES, the German payer delivered in III. quarter 2004 to I. quarter 2005 to the Czech payer of goods totalling EUR 33 205. The Czech payer did not admit this acquisition.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The Czech tax administrator requested in the framework of the international exchange of information on verification of delivery of goods from Germany.
In response to this request, the German tax administration stated that the German payer sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech payer, the remaining goods were picked up by the Czech payer personally.
By asking the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the Sao found that even before receiving the reply to the ŽOI, the Czech payer submitted additional VAT returns for those periods.
Despite this administration have not been differences in terms of acquisition resolved, therefore, the Czech tax administrator has recommended that the Czech payer of the tax inspection.
The inspection has not yet been carried out.
16. The German payer delivered according to data in VIES in III. quarter 2004 to the Czech payer of goods worth EUR 46 854.
For the same period, the Czech payer granted intracommunitary acquisition only in the amount corresponding to EUR 14 856.
The Czech tax administrator asked for verification in the framework of the international exchange of information the value of the deliveries made.
To answer the RFIS, delivered from GERMANY, were accompanied by 3 invoices with a total listed value of the delivery goods 31 999 EUR, i.e. the value corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech payer and the data in the VIES.
By asking the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the Sao found that after receiving the reply from the German tax administrator contacted the Accounting Officer of the Czech tax payer and agreed with her to discuss with the owner of the company the filing of an additional VAT return for III. quarter 2004.
An additional VAT return has not yet been filed.
The Czech tax administrator told The SAO that he would continue to comply with the deadlines for possible additional VAT assessment for the relevant taxation period.
17.
The German payer was in IV. quarter 2004 to deliver to the Czech payer goods worth EUR 11 600.
The German tax administrator requested in the framework of the international exchange of information on confirmation, whether the Czech payer actually existed, because the alleged companion of the German payer founded in GERMANY more fictitious companies.
When examining a commercial transaction, the Czech payer confirmed the acquisition of the goods to the IRS.
According to the Czech payer, however, the goods were not transported from Germany to the Czech Republic and were resold in Germany during 2005.
The Czech payer submitted documents on the sale of goods for January 2005.
The Czech payer was not in GERMANY registered as a VAT payer, a tax upon the sale of such goods in the CZECH republic or in GERMANY did not admit or did not pay.
All these facts suggested tax evasion in the territory of Germany, and the Czech tax administrator communicated them to the German tax administration in response to the ŽOI.
By asking the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the Sao found that the Czech payer had filed an additional VAT return for IV on the basis of the investigations carried out. quarter of 2004, which included the value of the acquisition of goods, inter alia, from a German payer and at the same time claim the tax deduction when the acquisition of goods from other member states.
VAT on the sale of goods in Germany to the Czech tax return on VAT did not indicate.
The Czech tax administrator issued an additional VAT return after the local investigation was carried out unchanged.
According to the Czech legislation in that case was not about the acquisition of goods from other member states, because the goods have not been dispatched or transported from another member state into the CZECH republic.
Thus, the Czech tax administrator made an incorrect conclusion of the local investigation.
The BRH found that the German tax administrator had corrected the tax return of the German payer immediately after receiving a reply to the ŽOI stating that the goods had not left Germany and demanded VAT of EUR 1,600 from the German taxpayer.
The competent financial authority in addition sent a notification to the irs of the actual recipient of the goods to ensure that the resale of such goods will be properly taxed.
In the following cases, the payers reported intracommunitary transactions, the implementation of which probably did not actually take place:
18.
The Czech tax administrator has received from the German tax authorities request the information, whether the Czech payer acquired in February 2005 from a German payer's personal automobile at a price of 47 EUR 400.
The annex to the application was a copy of the certificate of registration of the Czech VAT payer.
In addition, a copy of the passport of the person who was supposed to carry out the transfer of the said car was attached.
The investigation, the Czech tax administrator found that it was a stolen passport, the person referred to therein to any vehicle to the CZECH republic imported and denied any contacts with the German tax entity.
The VAT registration certificate, a copy of which was sent by the German party, was never issued by the Czech tax administrator.
This information said the Czech tax administrator in response to RFIS, together with the communication that can confirm the acquisition of goods – the car.
When asked by the local tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the Sao found that the Czech payer did not reside at the address listed in the commercial register and the company manager was non-contact.
The Czech tax administrator after the complaint procedure for the Tax Period February 2005 charged the Czech payer with a tax liability of CZK 0.
Another investigation, the Czech tax administrator found that the car was sold to another Czech operator, which bought it through an advertisement on the internet.
The BRH found that the local German tax administrator would not recognise the German payer's right to exemption from VAT on the basis of the Czech reply to the ŽOI.
19. During the inspection, wasn't the German tax office was able to clarify the difference in the amount of 3000 EUROS between the value of the procured goods declared in the tax declaration of the payer and the value provided from another member state.
It was reported that the Czech payer should have delivered during IV. quarter 2004 to I. quarter 2005 to the German payer of goods worth 89 424 euros.
Since the acquisition declared by the German payer did not correspond to the data in VIES, the German tax administrator requested verification of supplies and their reimbursement in the framework of the international exchange of information.
The Czech tax administrator stated in the reply to ŽOI that the Czech company's only managing director had been deleted from the business register on 8. 7. 2005 and the new managing director was not registered.
The German recipient of the goods was believed to be a relative of a partner of the Czech company.
The Czech payer filed tax returns to VAT I SH, which was signed by an unauthorized person – said partner of the company after the removal of the executive from the Commercial Register.
The accounting of the Czech payer of the tax authorities confirmed that the associate company cash paid for the invoiced goods in EUROS translates to on account of the company.
Cashier's papers were not issued.
The SAO in the Czech Republic, when asked by the local tax office, found that the tax administrator recognised the Czech payer as IV. quarter 2004 entitlement to VAT exemption on delivery of goods to another member state worth CZK 1,326,307 (EUR 42,145) and for I. quarter 2005 of CZK 1 416 180 (EUR 47 548).
BRH found that the tax administrator in GERMANY did not correct the tax returns for VAT, a German customer, because the German judge, meanwhile, confirmed the insolvency of the German payer.
Since an earlier inspection did not reveal any signs of tax fraud, it will not be possible to enforce the tax liability.
20. According to the VIES data, the German payer acquired goods worth EUR 4 251 196 from the Czech Republic in 2005 after acquiring goods worth EUR 43 274 in the previous year.
Neither in the 2004 tax return nor in the 2005 tax return did the German payer declare intracommunitary acquisition.
In addition, he did not report adequate supplies.
Due to these differences, the German tax office sent the Zoi, concerning 4. quarter 2005 and 1. quarter 2006.
The Czech supplier reported intracommunitary delivery of goods to the German payer for the two quarters totalling CZK 167,246,083 (EUR 5,615,299).
On 6. 9. 2006 was delivered to the ŽOI, in which the German party asked to check whether the Czech payer of the declared intracommunitary deliveries had been made.
In response to this report, the Czech tax administration stated that the German party's request could not be met because the Czech payer had no negotiator.
As evidenced by the materials provided to the Sao by the competent tax authority, on 30. 3. 2006 a protocol was drawn up with the Czech payer's manager on the initiation of VAT control for IV. quarter 2004 and January to December 2005.
Payer was at the same time the tax administrator is prompted to submit all the accounting and tax documents for the above-mentioned period, but no documents submitted.
The sole executive of the Czech payer, according to the commercial register, was terminated on 16. 5. 2006, a new executive has not been appointed.
Since April 2006, the Czech payer has stopped filing VAT returns.
Under the control of the SAO in cooperation with the BRH, inter alia, examined several cases of intrakomunitárních delivery, carried out between the CZECH republic and GERMANY, which have not been subject to prior exchange of information between the tax administrations of both countries.
Information on the investigated cases was transmitted by the two Supreme Audit Institutions through the customs duties of both countries.
21. The Czech company (eCR), which is not resident in Germany, has informed the relevant tax office (Chemnitz-Süd) that it intends to carry out taxable transactions in Germany.
Due to this information, the company has been registered since June 2005, but has not received a German VAT ID.
(ECR) received an order from the Danish entrepreneur (eDK) on the production of several wind power plants and on delivery of such wind power plants on behalf of, at the risk and for the account of Danish customer in Austria.
Due to the lack of its own capacities, the Czech company handed over part of the order to the German payer (eD), which is based in Germany.
The following scheme shows contractual relationships and the way wind farms are transported:
According to the German legal situation, the place of execution of such transactions must be determined according to the following:
- Danish entrepreneur (eDK) sent wind farms for assembly under his name, at his risk and his account to Austria.
Since the installation of this supply took place in Austria, the supply of wind farms is taxable in Austria.
– Because the carrier was instructed by the Danish entrepreneur (eDK), and transport took place under his name, at his own risk and on his own account, the supply of the German subcontractor (eD) took place there, where transport began – in GERMANY.
Although wind power plants have been dispatched to another member state and the recipient is a registered payer of another member state, the supply of the German subcontractor (eD) could not obtain an exemption from the tax because a different member state of destination differs from another member state of the Czech society.
This delivery is therefore properly taxed in GERMANY and the Czech company (eCZ) deducted input tax in their tax returns.
The place of delivery of the Czech company (eCR) is also determined by the beginning of the shipment.
Transport of some wind farms was started in the Czech Republic and others in Germany.
- The supply of those wind farms that are produced in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.
- The supply of other wind farms which are produced in Germany took place in Germany.
So the Czech company (eCR) carried out both intracommunitary delivery from the Czech Republic to Austria and intracommunitary delivery from Germany to Austria.
BRH found that the Czech company (eCR) did not report in his tax returns for VAT in GERMANY no intracommunity acquisition hasn't even HKE the German DUTY.
So it is possible that the Czech company has declared all intracommunitary deliveries uniformly as intracommunitary deliveries from the Czech Republic.
The Sao found that (eCR) reported no intracommunitary delivery to Austria but intracommunitary delivery to Denmark.
Examination of the taxation of intrakomunitárního acquisition in Austria would require the cooperation of at least four tax administrations (the austrian, the Czech, Danish and German), although this case does not show any sign of tax fraud or evasion.
Further, the SAO and BRH examine the transactions in order to highlight the differences between declaring in a tax return and data from the VIES, which were caused by the different legal treatment of VAT in 2004.
Controlled cases also demonstrate that changes in the legislation need time to apply the new legislation into practice by both payers and tax authorities:
22. In SH for II. until IV. quarter 2004 the Czech payer reported an intracommunitary delivery to the German payer totalling CZK 792 977 452 (EUR 25 197 885).
Over the same period, another Czech payer reported an intracommunity delivery to another German payer totalling CZK 18,157,265 (EUR 576,970).
According to the information provided by the Sao from the BRH, in both cases it was the supply of electricity.
Both Czech payers indicated the above-mentioned supply in SH in accordance with the text of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., valid in 2004.
Further examination of the aforementioned transactions, the Sao group found that in 2004 there were differences between the Czech Republic and Germany in the statutory regulation of supply or acquisition of electricity.
While in the Czech Republic the payers reported electricity supply in accordance with the applicable text of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. as the intracommunity supply of goods, from the point of view of the German legal regulations valid in 2004, this was not an intracommunity acquisition, but a taxable supply with the place of implementation implementation on the territory of the federal republic of GERMANY.
The difference in legal regulations was eliminated in the Czech Republic by the adoption of Act No. 635/2004 Coll. amending certain laws in connection with the adoption of the law on administrative fees, effective from 1. 1. 2005.
23. In addition, when examining selected intracommunitary transactions in cooperation with BRH, it was found that the Czech payer reported in SH for 1. up to 4. quarter 2005 intracommunity delivery to the German payer totalling CZK 240 411 163 (EUR 8 071 823) and other Czech payer reported in SH for the same period intracommunity delivery to the German payer totalling CZK 263 470 776 (EUR 8 846 050).
According to the information provided by the Sao from the BRH, in both cases it was the supply of electricity.
According to the text of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. effective from 1. 1. 2005 is in the case of the supply of electricity to the place of performance the place where the customer has its seat, place of business or has an establishment for which the goods are delivered.
Therefore, Czech payers should not have provided electricity to SH in 2005.
By reporting intracommunitary electricity supply in SH, the two above-mentioned payers distorted the VIES data by a total of CZK 503 881 939 (EUR 16 917 873).
Conclusion
Cooperation has met the objectives of the BRH and the Sao.
Both SAI have acquired a deeper knowledge of VAT management systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The cooperation revealed the differences between the two systems and showed that VAT governance legislation differs.
During parallel checks, suspicious cases of intracommunitary transactions were detected.
Some of them make sense to check subsequently.
Based on the audit findings, both SAI made recommendations on VAT management.
Monitoring these recommendations should also be part of the follow-up.
New experience and knowledge through cooperation between the two audit institutions are the basis for the successful implementation of the following controls the administration of VAT.

Report on the outcome of international cooperation in excise control checks between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in 2006
Introductory word
Presented to the joint report informs of the progress and outcome of international cooperation in the parallel controls, which implement the Supreme audit office, Czech republic Najvyšší kontrolný úrad Slovenskej republiky, focused on the administration of excise taxes in the period after the entry of both countries into the European union.
The cooperation was implemented on the basis of a cooperation agreement in control activities concluded in February 2006.
The theme of the parallel controls were selected with respect to a fundamental change in the system of collection of excise taxes that occurred in connection with the inclusion of the Czech republic and the Slovak republic into the internal market of the European union from 1. May 2004.
The functioning of the internal market of the European Union requires the free movement of goods, including excise goods.
The basic principle is to allow the circulation of goods unburdened by tax up to the date of delivery for final consumption.
In accordance with this principle, the new legislation adopted in both countries allows the movement of goods under tax supervision under the conditional exemption regime.
The system places great demands on tax authorities and presupposes a close interaction between the competent administrations of the member states in the fight against tax fraud in this area.
Report on the outcome of international cooperation in excise control checks for the period from 1. May 2004 to 31. December 2005 1.

3. Preparation and course of cooperation
The first coordination meeting of representatives of the Sao-CR and representatives of the Sao-SR, which discussed the specific procedure for cooperation in the implementation of parallel controls in the field of excise duties, took place in January 2006.
Both parties have become familiar with excise legislation and with the organization of Excise Management in both states.
Special attention was paid to the procedure of the customs authorities of the CZECH republic and SLOVAKIA during the authorisation process, or during start-up and shut-down of transport, products subject to excise duties in the regime of conditional exemption from tax and exchange of information between the administrators of the excise taxes of the two countries.
At the meeting it was agreed that the Czech and the Slovak side of the: - process the total data on the quantity of excisable products being transported from the CZECH republic to SLOVAKIA and vice versa, whose transport was initiated in the audited period, - comparing the data on the dopravách mineral oils - combined nomenclature code 2710 and 2711, and alcohol - combined nomenclature code 2207 and 2208 in the regime of conditional exemption from the levy initiated in the CZECH republic and completed in the SR and on the contrary, in the months of November 2004 and September 2005.
During the inspections, the period under review was extended by October and November 2005, and the transport of tobacco products under the conditional exemption scheme was also subject to scrutiny during those months.
Tables 1 and 2 show the total quantity of excise products transported under the conditional exemption scheme between Czech and Slovak tax entities during the period under review.
4. Comparison of registers of transport goods under the conditional exemption scheme
The Sao-CR forwarded to the Slovak side a database of transport operations in the Czech Republic containing a total of 5,876 items on accompanying documents, of which 5,738 items were mineral oils, 134 items alcohol and 4 items of tobacco products.
The Sao SR forwarded to the Czech party a database of carriers in the SR containing a total of 3,319 items on accompanying documents, of which 696 items related to mineral oil, 2,066 items of alcohol and 557 items of tobacco products.
The Sao-Czech Republic compared the data on the transport registered in the Czech Republic with the data on the completed transport registered in the Czech Republic.
The results of the comparison are presented in Table 3.
The transport data for November 2004 and September 2005 compared the Sao - Czech Republic with the database of the Slovak Customs Administration, which was transmitted to him by the Sao SR at the beginning of the inspection.
The database did not contain data allowing to reliably reconcile individual transport, and therefore managed to assign only 63 % started right.
Individual transport was assigned according to multiple data, e.g. sender, consignee, date of transport, quantity of products transported.
Data on dopravách launched in the CZECH republic and completed in the SR in the months of October and November of 2005 compared to SAO-CR with the database of the Slovak customs administration, which contained all the data according to the accompanying documents, on the basis of which managed to clearly assign 93% of the initiated transport.
In the database of Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, data on the amount of mineral oils were presented in liters or tonnes depending on the type of mineral oil.
The amount of alcohol was in most cases stated in litres, which, however, was possible on the basis of the database referred to the percentage of alcohol converted into litres of absolute alcohol.
The quantity of tobacco products was indicated in pieces, in thousands of pieces and kilograms by type of tobacco products.
The transport started in the CZECH republic, the termination of which is in the Slovak database has failed to reliably verify or for which yielded an indication of the transported quantity of the products was carried out inspection of the accompanying documents.
Accompanying documents on 487 transports of alcohol, mineral oils and tobacco products were inspected.
The inspection of these documents was carried out at the customs offices at which the Sao-Czech Republic carried out the inspection.
For Transport authorised by other customs authorities, accompanying documents were requested through the DGC.
The Czech party asked the Slovak party to verify the implementation of 141 transportation, to which the customs authorities in the CZECH republic did not substantiate the endorsed copy no 3 of the accompanying document, as appropriate disagree number of products listed on the accompanying document with the amount of products listed in the database.
In addition, Transport data registered in the Slovak database was forwarded to the Slovak party, which was not included in the Transport database of the Czech customs administration.
The Sao SR tracked 95 traffic in the database of the Slovak customs administration.
The remaining 46 carriers were verified by the local customs authorities, who proved their termination with copies of accompanying documents.
The Slovak party forwarded the Czech side of the copy of the accompanying documents, on the basis of which the transport identified in the Czech database, with the exception of transportation implemented two Czech tax entities, which in the Czech database initiated by transport were not found.
The examination of these cases was found:
- in the Slovak database of transport was registered 11 transport of ethyl alcohol in the total amount 276,7 liters of alcohol implemented by the Czech tax entity in 2004, and 20 transportation of alcohol in the total amount of 404,66 liters of alcohol implemented in 2005.
The Sao-CR found that this was a transport of taxed products, for the initiation of which the sender does not need the consent of the tax administrator.
The sender informed the tax administrator in writing of the commencement of transport. He carried out the transport on the basis of accompanying documents, which serve for the transport of products under the conditional exemption scheme;
- in the Slovak database of transport were registered a total of 94 transportation of mineral oil, combined nomenclature code 2710 11 21, in a total volume of 173 thousand liters implemented by the Czech tax entity in the period September 2004 to December 2005.
The Sao-CR found that between May 2004 and June 2005 the tax entity carried out transport of 102 thousand litres of non-taxable mineral oils without proper authorisation.
The taxpayer was the holder of a special permit to receive and use products which are exempt, on the basis of which he could tax-free products only deliver to the holder the same permit.
The commencement of transport to the customs office in the Czech Republic did not notify and did not provide tax collateral for the products transported amounting to CZK 1,207,680.
Between July 2005 and December 2005, the tax entity transported 71 thousand litres of taxed mineral oils to the territory of the SR. Even in those cases, he did not comply with the legal obligation by not notifying the customs office of the commencement of transport.
Transportation of the products put into free tax circulation in the tax territory of the CZECH republic to another member state, the consignor may in the CZECH republic to initiate without the consent of the customs office, however, is required before the start of transport of this fact in writing notify the customs office.
Tax entity collecting the products released into free tax circulation in another member state is obliged, before removing to report the amount of and ensure the tax.
Products can be transported only with a simplified accompanying document, the requirements of regulation no 3649/92.
This regulation allows also the use of the accompanying document for transport in the regime of conditional exemption from tax, on which, however, must be clearly stamped that this is a "simplified accompanying document for the purposes of tax control (products subject to excise duty)".
The same legislation shipping and receiving of products put into free tax circulation in another member state is valid also in SR.
In those cases, the tax authorities transported the products put into free circulation with an accompanying document for transport under a conditional exemption scheme of which 3. and 4. the copy of the recipient was submitted to the tax administrator in SR for verification.
The customs authorities of the SR registered these services in the database of services under the conditional exemption procedure, since the accompanying documents did not indicate that they were a simplified accompanying document.
Sao SR compared the database of the Czech customs administration with the database of the Slovak customs administration and found:
- in the databases was the amount of transported products reported inconsistently, e.g., mineral oil was given in litres, hectolitres or in kilograms; alcohol was given in litres or litres of alcohol, which was made difficult by the comparison of the transported amount of goods,
- the quantity of alcohol shipped in the invoices did not coincide with the quantity recorded in the databases,
- not all related invoices were listed in the databases,
- in the database of the Slovak customs administration have been registered two transport alcohol from the CZECH republic to the SR implemented in November 2004 in a total volume of 47 237 liters of alcohol that is in the database of the Czech customs administration were not.
The Slovak party submitted copies of accompanying documents to the Czech party.
5. International exchange of information between customs authorities of the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic
The conditions for cooperation between the administrative authorities of the member states responsible for the administration of excise duties were regulated up to 30. June 2005 Council directive 77/799/EEC concerning mutual assistance by the competent authorities of the member states in the field of direct taxation, certain excise duties and taxation of insurance premiums.
1. July 2005 entry into force of regulation no 2073/2004, which lays down rules and procedures enabling the competent authorities of the member states of the European union cooperation and the exchange of information necessary for a correct assessment of excise taxes.
Each member state shall designate a central liaison office, which secures contacts with other member states in the field of administration of excise duties and is responsible for the exchange of information about the movement of excise goods.
In the Czech Republic, to ensure the exchange of information on excise duties between the member states of the European Union, the "Excise Liaison Office" (hereinafter referred to as "ELO Czech Republic") was set up for DGC.
Security tasks related to the management systems to control the movement of goods subject to excise duties (SEED, MVS, EWSE) and the exchange of information within the framework of mutual administrative assistance between the member states of the European union and SLOVAKIA he performed with the effect from 1. May 2004 the Office of ELO at the Customs Office of Poprad.
Effective from 1. July 2005 the duties of the Elo office shall be carried out by the Department of Elo (located in Poprad) of the Excise Department of the Customs Directorate of the SR (hereinafter referred to as "ELO SR").
According to the provisions of Article 3 (3), 3 of regulation no 2073/2004 the central liaison office shall be responsible in particular for - the exchange of data held in the electronic register of the SEED, - a system of early warning "Early Warning System Excision" (hereinafter referred to as "EWSE"), - request for verification the movement of goods subject to excise duty dispatched to other member states or from them received "Movement Verification System" (hereinafter "MVS").
The content, scope and functions of SEED, EWSE and MVS systems are regulated in articles 22, 23 and 24 of regulation no 2073/2004.
SEED-a system for the exchange of information on tax entities trading in excise goods.
The system is made up of national registers of payers of excise tax and allows the tax authorities on the territory of the European union to find out whether the products subject to excise duty traded person authorized.
Each National Register shall be made available to the competent authorities of the other member states only for excise purposes.
The central contact authority of each member state ensures that the people involved in the movement of excise goods on the territory of the European union can obtain confirmation of the information held in this database.
In accordance with § 41 of law no 98/2004 Z. z., with § 39 of law no 104/2004 Z. z., with § 46 of Law No. 105/2004 Z. z., with Section 40 of Law No. 106/2004 Z. z. and with Section 39 of Law No. 107/2004 Z. z. ELO SR maintains an electronic database containing a register of tax warehouse operators, beneficiaries and tax warehouses - SEED database.
The customs authorities in the SR contribute to the database of SEED by registering a tax warehouse, operator of the tax warehouse or authorized recipient in the application software SysNed, which is automatically linked with the ELO SR.
For example, if a new tax warehouse operator, beneficiary or tax warehouse is registered in the sysned database, the related data is automatically transferred to the SEED database.
The SAO SR found that the exchange of databases the SEED between the customs administration of the SR and the Customs administration of the CZECH republic is carried out in a controlled period usually once a month, rarely more than once a month.
The customs administration of SR accepted 22 SEED files and sent 25 SEED files.
Data to the SEED database in the Czech Republic are transmitted from the National Register, which records all persons authorized to dispose of excise products and issued permits to dispose of such products.
Individual customs offices in the Czech Republic do not have access to the International SEED database.
Requests from customs authorities to provide information from the SEED database of other member states are obtained only through ELO CR.
EWSE - an early warning system aimed at controlling the transport of excise goods through which the carriage of risky consignments is notified.
For the risk package is considered to be both the transport of certain products subject to excise duty in quantities exceeding the limits set by regulation of the European commission, and, secondly, to the right, you like the risk, evaluate the tax administrator.
The exchange of information is realized in two forms:
- information-is sent when the limits set are exceeded,
- warning message-to be sent if the transport of goods is assessed as risky.
When evaluating the degree of risk of a consignment, ELO SR uses the SEED database for sending the warning message, which checks the data specified in the accompanying document.
In the event that in the database the SEED does not agree data with the data in the supporting document (for example, opposed the registration number of the recipient of the goods or address of the recipient), ELO SR will draw up a warning message that it sends to the office of ELO member state of the recipient of the goods.
ELO shall be governed by the regulations of the commission for the tax and Customs Area CED 317 and Ced 457, which, inter alia, determine the type and quantity of goods in the relevant units of measurement for the preparation of informative and warning reports.
In the controlled period, ELO SR sent one warning message to the Czech Republic.
In the Czech Republic, information on commenced transport of products in quantities exceeding the specified limits is automatically generated when entering data from the accompanying document into the database when approving transport.
Re-evaluate if the tax administrator in the CR on the basis of its own analysis of the parcel as a risk, treated a so-called warning message, which through the ELO of the CZECH republic shall send to the responsible member state.
In 2005, ELO cr sent two warning messages to ELO sr.
MVS - system controls movement of the goods - allows, through the application of MVS to control the individual transport of products subject to excise duty and control of the established routes of transport between the entities referred to in the accompanying document.
The exchange of information takes place on the basis of a request in which the Elo of the sending country specifies its requirements.
The system is used in particular in cases where the sender takes over the confirmed copy no 3 of the accompanying document and requires e.g. a refund of excise taxes, and in cases where the data referred to in the accompanying document cannot be checked in the international database of SEED.
In the audited period ELO SR sent 33 requests to the CR.
ELO CR sent 25 requests to the MVS to ELO SR.
The customs authorities in the CZECH republic the most commonly examined the data referred to in the accompanying documents, in particular the amount received, or sent products or whether the sender of the products referred to in the accompanying document is entitled to dispose of the products subject to excise duty, if this fact could not be verified in the international database of SEED.
Applications received by MVS in both countries have been forwarded to customs offices locally responsible for the consignees or consignors of excise products.
The customs authorities examined the data requested and notified the result of the investigation via ELO to the other member state.
6. Summary
The cooperation of the SAO, the CZECH republic and the SAO SR to compare the basic legal regulations governing the area of consumption taxes in both states, the procedure of the customs authorities of the CZECH republic and SLOVAKIA in the initiation and termination of transport of the products in the regime of conditional exemption from tax between the two states, the registration of such transport and further to compare the exchange of information between customs authorities in the framework of international cooperation.
6.1 comparing the legislation governing excise duties in the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic, differences were identified:
(A) in the procedure of tax entities and tax administrators when commencing the transport of products under a conditional exemption scheme.
Transportation of the products in the regime of conditional exemption from tax can tax entity in the CZECH republic start only with the consent of the tax administrator that the initiation of transportation shall, under the conditions that the shipped products protection was provided taxes in the amount of tax on them attributable.
The commencement of the transport of products under the conditional exemption scheme in the SR is not subject to the authorization of the tax administrator.
During the controlled period, the tax entity was obliged to notify the tax authority of the start of transport of alcohol and tobacco products.
The transport of mineral oils, beer and wine could commence without informing the tax administrator of this fact.
In 2006 there were in SLOVAKIA gradually adopted the amendment to all the laws of excise, according to which the consignor of goods in the regime of conditional exemption from tax is obliged before the start of transportation send a copy of copy no 1 of the accompanying document electronically or by fax to the customs authority that is locally competent to the sender;
(B) within the time limits for dispatch of copy No 3 of the accompanying document.
The consignee in the Czech Republic is obliged not later than the next working day after the end of transport to send copies No 3 and 4 of the accompanying document to the tax administrator for verification.
Certified copy No 3 shall be sent to the consignor no later than the following working day after receipt of it from the tax administrator.
The consignee in the SR is obliged to send to the consignor of the products copy No 3, confirmed by the tax administrator and the consignee of the products no later than 15. the day of the month following the month in which he accepted the goods.
6.2. Customs authorities in the SR and in the Czech Republic keep electronic records of transport products under a conditional exemption procedure.
The content and manner of keeping this register is not regulated in the Czech Republic or in the Czech Republic.
Customs authorities in both countries enter in the register all data from accompanying documents on the basis of which transport is carried out.
For monitoring the transport of goods in the regime of conditional exemption from tax between the member states of the European union there is currently no single electronic system that would allow administrators to excise duties in individual member states to obtain information on the carriage of goods in real time.
Pursuant to decision 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16. June 2003 is from 1. July 2009 foresees the introduction of an electronic system for monitoring the transport of excise products.
On the basis of the cooperation agreement in the control activity, the Czech party transmitted to the Slovak party a database of transport products under the conditional exemption scheme initiated in the Czech Republic and completed in the Czech Republic.
The database contained 5,876 items related to transported mineral oils, alcohol and tobacco products.
The Slovak party transmitted to the Czech party a database of transport products under the conditional exemption scheme started in the Czech Republic and ended in the Czech Republic.
The database contained 3,319 items related to transported mineral oils, alcohol and tobacco products.
The Czech side compared the data on the transport registered in the Czech Republic with the registration of the traffic completed in the Czech Republic.
The Slovak party compared the data on the transport of goods under the conditional exemption scheme started in the Czech Republic and ended in the Czech Republic.
The comparison of data was made difficult by the fact that the quantity of goods transported was not reported uniformly in the databases.
In cases where it was not possible to clearly assign the data on the individual dopravách in both registers, inspection of the accompanying documents and violation of the regime of conditional exemption from tax, no cases of tax evasion have been identified.
On the basis of the findings of parallel checks, it can be concluded that member states can obtain valuable information from the transport register to improve the quality of Excise Management.
Establishment of an electronic system for the movement and control of excisable goods within the meaning of the decision of the European parliament and of the Council no. 1152/2003/EC will enable the electronic transmission of the accompanying document and a more efficient control of the movement in the regime of conditional exemption from tax on the territory of the European union.
Communique
This report was prepared in Czech, English and Slovak languages.
The report was signed by the president of the highest Audit Office of the Slovak Republic and the president of the highest Audit Office, Czech Republic.
Administration of Value Added Tax in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany
Report on the results of the follow-up
Introductory word
Taxes generally represent a key source of public revenue.
It goes without saying that Supreme Audit Institutions (Sai) should focus their attention on this area.
An example is value added tax fraud ("VAT").
In their case, a loss of EUR 100 billion is estimated annually in the European Union (also "EU").
Already in 2005, participants VI. the EUROSAI Congress in Bonn agreed on the need for very close cooperation.
As part of this cooperation, SAI can exchange control procedures, find the best solution, etc.
VAT is a very suitable area for control cooperation as it is the only tax harmonised within the EU.
The supreme audit office of the Czech republic (hereinafter the "SAO") and the Federal court of auditors (Bundesrechnungshof, as well as "BRH") implemented the first parallel control action in the field of VAT in 2006.
The relevant report was published in 2008.
Because fraudulent conduct related to VAT not confined to a single country, but is widespread throughout the EU, close cooperation is required between the SAI to the security of a comprehensive evaluation of the steps taken to solve this problem.
The two SAI therefore decided to further develop cooperation in this area and carried out a subsequent parallel check.
1. Introduction
Control number: (CZ) 09/11 (d) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892
Subject of inspection: (CZ) administration of Value Added Tax (D) bilateral audit with Sao (follow-up)
Objective of control:
(CZ) the Aim of the audit was to examine the procedure of the financial authorities in the administration of VAT, in particular to verify the procedure for the solution of selected cases of business transactions between the Czech republic and the Federal republic of Germany (hereinafter "Germany"), and to examine the procedures of the tax administrations of the two countries in the framework of international cooperation.
(D) the Audit was designed to evaluate the measures adopted by the tax administration to implement the recommendations issued by the SAO and BRH.
It was also intended to cover other VAT-related areas.
The resulting Control findings were intended to be compared with the established best practice (if any).
The period under review was 2006 to 2008 and, in the case of factual context, the period preceding and subsequent, until the end of the control.
2. Summary of results and evaluation of parallel control actions
Subsequent control of VAT management in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two SAI.
In the course of previous parallel checks, suspicious cases of intracommunitary transactions were detected.
Some of them required further vetting.
Based on the control findings, both SAI formulated recommendations on VAT management.
Carried out follow-up actions used to evaluate the measures taken in response to these recommendations and to examine the selected suspicious cases.
The inspection also focused e.g. on selected cases of high-risk intrakomunitárních transactions, mutual assistance for the recovery of claims and the implementation of controls on VAT for large taxpayers.
In the control of VAT management in selected areas in both countries, the inspectors came up with the following Control findings:
1. Recommendations from previous inspection
* Recommendation 1: conditions for registration of payers should be harmonised within the EU
In previous parallel checks, comparisons of VAT registration systems in both countries were found to differ.
Since different registration methods cause problems, both SAI recommended harmonising the conditions for registration of payers within the EU.
This recommendation was presented at EU level.
A proposal for amendment of Council regulation (EC) no 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing regulation (EEC) no 218/92 (hereinafter referred to as "Council regulation (EC) no 1798/2003") demanded the expansion of existing databases within the EU, including the database of tax identification numbers of VAT payers.
It also amended common standards for registration and deregistration of taxpayers.
SAI expected that the EU member states agree on the appropriate standards that will support their decision as quickly as possible, to exclude unreliable traders from the VAT system.
However, the latest version of that document, agreed by the EU member states under ECOFIN, does not contain the issue already mentioned.
Both SAI regret that the idea of Common Minimum Standards has been abandoned.
However, they continue to regard this intention as a relevant tool for preventing fraud in the field of VAT.
* Recommendation 2: monthly reporting of summary reports
In the framework of international cooperation was in the previous control action recommended to all EU member states have imposed monthly deadline for the submission of summary reports and allow for the more timely examination of the values intrakomunitárních transactions.
Council directive 2008/117/EC amending directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax to combat tax evasion connected with intra-Community transactions, it shortens the period of time for which submitted a summary report on the implementation inside the EU, for one month.
In the Czech republic, this measure was implemented through the law on value added tax with effect from 1. January 2010, in Germany was implemented from 1. July 2010.
In Germany not the obligation to submit a recapitulative statement month introduced within a specified time limit in accordance with the applicable EU rules, while in the Czech republic, yes.
* Recommendation 3: Comparison of data in VAT returns and aggregate reports in Germany with a view to achieving greater reliability of data in VIEs and consideration of the interconnection of both VAT returns and aggregate reports
The German tax administration accepted the BRH recommendations and set up a working group to explore possible solutions.
Work is still ongoing and the BRH will closely monitor further developments.
• Recommendation 4: Sharing successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system at EU level On the basis of the results of the previous control actions with both SAI agreed that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by only one member state.
The successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system must be exchanged and implemented in individual EU member states.
If not, perpetrators of fraudulent activity, you will choose the member state with the weakest risk management system.
The review found that our two member states use different risk management systems that have their strengths and weaknesses.
In this area by the SAO control system EUROCANET, which allows the exchange of information within the EU, while the BRH is focused on the German participation in the so-called platform for risk management.
2. Follow-up of selected cases of intracommunitary transactions
In the course of the previous control actions have been jointly audited business transactions for which there were doubts about their implementation or discrepancies in the reporting of business transactions in tax returns or recapitulative statements payers of both countries.
Both SAI selected nine cases for follow-up control, which included intracommunitary movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany.
The checks carried out by the tax authorities of the countries concerned were not concluded at the date of completion of our previous joint control action.
Follow-up actions to verify that the majority of tax proceedings in connection with those selected cases of business transactions between payers from the Czech republic and Germany has been concluded and that the tax administration of the Czech republic or Germany has taken adequate measures (e.g. additional additional assessment of VAT or to prevent tax refund on entry).
3. Control of selected cases of risky intracommunitary transactions
High-risk cases of intracommunity transactions carried out by EU payers that were included in EUROCANET were selected for inspection.
EUROCANET is a tool for detecting risk tax payers within the EU.
Member states ' participation in this system shall be voluntary.
The Czech Republic is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has a passive status.
It is not satisfactory for an active participant in the system if some member states refuse active participation.
Due to the fact that the German tax administration involved in the exchange of data in the system EUROCANET, it was not possible to obtain any information about who the suppliers with a German VAT ID were identified as risk.
The SAO in the framework of the action control found as cases of ordinary business transactions, and cases with suspected involvement in a revolving transactions or fraud in respect of VAT.
Tax administrators have limited possibilities of controlling risk transactions, in particular as regards the so-called missing traders, while the mere physical scans of documents can hardly prove to the tax body of any fraudulent conduct.
A similar situation for tax authorities occurs when imports and exports to third countries are linked to intracommunitary carousel trades.
In such cases it would be appropriate to ensure greater mutual cooperation in customs and financial authorities with a view to identify the goods and discrepancies in the transport documents and also keep track of its physical movement within the EU towards the end consumer.
Germany, like some other countries, is hesitant to actively participate in EUROCANET because of the lack of a sufficient legal base.
In Germany, other tools are used to detect at-risk tax payers, which have so far proved successful for the German tax administration.
There is a need to communicate and exchange experience between EU member states in this area.
The EU Council reached political agreement on the proposal for a regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003.
Its main innovation lies in the creation of the eurofisc network.
The experience gained so far in the use of EUROCANET should be the basis for the creation of this new VAT fraud network.
4. Mutual assistance in the recovery of claims
In the area of international recovery assistance to all EU member states governed by the same european legislation.
Therefore, the method of processing applications for international assistance in debt collection in the Czech Republic and Germany is identical.
The SAO and the BRH carried out a comparison of the statistics submitted by both member states to the European Commission for the years 2006-2008.
The data contained in these statistics did not coincide.
Both SAI deemed useful statistics again to discuss on the EU level in order to find a way to avoid ongoing incompatibilities.
Without this, the statistics will not be reliable and comparable.
In addition, SAI agree in the opinion that reliable statistics should contain more information on VAT.
It would probably be useful for the Commission, on the basis of more detailed statistics, to draw up an analysis to help member states strengthen the effectiveness of combating VAT fraud.
In both SAI's view, this means helping member states with low enforcement success rates to raise the recovery rate to at least the EU average.
If a member state so wishes, the commission should take an active part in this process.
5. Control of large tax entities
The SAI analysed the legal situation regarding VAT control for large tax entities (also "VDS") in both countries.
In addition, in the form of a questionnaire, they collected information from tax authorities on areas that SAI considers essential for managing the issue.
The responses received clearly show that the situation in both countries is evolving differently.
The Czech Republic has a system based on a large amount of relevant data (e.g. information from tax controls, balance sheet data and profit and loss statements, etc.) to regulate the selection of risk-prone cases.
This ensures effective management and analysis of VAT control in general.
In 2012, it is planned to establish a specialized tax office for the administration of VDS.
In Germany, a similar system does not yet exist, which makes it difficult to manage and analyse VAT control in general.
Germany is so far more focused on the selection of individual relevant cases, in particular on the basis of data from tax returns to VAT and the recapitulative statement.
The analysis of these data is based on different risk management components that will be strengthened.
3. Course of control action
3.1 the course of the control action in the Czech Republic
The inspection was carried out between May 2009 and February 2010 by Department II. - by the Department of revenue of the state budget and territorial unions IX. Pilsen, X. České Budějovice, XIII. Brno and XV. Ostrava.
The persons controlled were: Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as "Czech Ministry of Finance") and 25 financial authorities (hereinafter referred to as "FÚ"): Fú Brno II, Fú Brno III, Fú Brno IV, fú in Breclav, Fú in Domažlice, Fú in Hodonín, FÚ in Hradec Králové, Fú in Cheb, Fú in Jablonec over Nisa, Fú in Karlovy Vary, Fú in Kralupy Vltava, fú in kraslice, fú Ostrava I, fú Ostrava III, fú in písek, FÚ in Pilsen, Fú for Threshold 1, Fú for threshold 4, FÚ for threshold 8, FÚ in RAKOVNIK, Fú in Sokolov, Fú in Tábor, Fú in Vysoké Mýta, FÚ in Zlin and Fú in Žamberk.
The control conclusion of this control action was approved by the College of the Supreme Audit Office on 27. April 2010.
3.2 the course of the control action in Germany
The audit was conducted in the period from February 2009 to February 2010 the control unit for indirect taxes and staff designated regional audit offices in Berlin, Frankfurt and Munich.
After selecting a sample of cases, a number of Länder were notified of the mission of the control action.
In addition to interviews at the Federal ministry of finance held a control action in these federal countries: • Bavaria, • Hamburg, • Hesse, • North Rhine-Westphalia • Saxony.
Included were tax files of the following financial authorities: • Erlangen, Zentralfinanzamt München (Central financial office in Munich), Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Grafenau; • Hamburg-Nord (Hamburg-nord), Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg für Großunternehmen (Hamburg-VDS);
In addition, the negotiation with the tax authorities Mühlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-Süd (Halle-south) and with the financial directorates in Frankfurt / Main, Chemnitz and Münster.
The report on the audit findings was submitted to the Federal Ministry of Finance in April 2010.
3.3 cooperation between the two control institutions
In the preparation of parallel control actions in September 2008 a meeting was held of representatives of both audit institutions to discuss and determine the themes of control.
Finally, in December 2008, the top officials of both SAI signed a cooperation agreement on the implementation of parallel controls.
At a meeting in Bonn in June 2009, the inspection teams to inform each other of the initial results achieved during the preparation of the checks, discuss the possible audit approaches and agree together the next procedure.
The second meeting took place in Prague on 2 days. - 4. December 2009.
The control teams exchanged the findings together until then and agreed a timetable for compiling a joint report.
Both SAI in the implementation of parallel control actions to focus on: • subsequent verification of the implementation of the recommendations made in the previous report, • verification of selected cases intrakomunitárních transactions between taxpayers from the Czech republic and Germany, which have not been resolved during the previous parallel control, • verification of selected cases intrakomunitárních transactions between taxpayers from the Czech republic and Germany, which have been classified as cases with high risk, • control the procedure for tax administrations in the field of international aid in the recovery of accounts receivable VAT • tax audits of large companies.
The report on the results of the parallel control actions was prepared during the June 2010 workshop.
4. Control of VAT management in selected areas
4.1 evaluation of recommendations from the previous review
4.1.1 evaluation of recommendations in the Czech Republic
Recommendation 1
Conditions for registration of payers should be harmonised within the EU
Based on the results of the previous inspection action, the Sao recommended the modification of the conditions of registration for VAT and the introduction of a new rule for the cancellation of registration in the Czech Republic.
The revised conditions should allow for a more effective reduction of the risk of possible tax evasion for VAT collection.
In this context, it was found that the financial authorities in some cases did not use the right to cancel the registration for VAT payers who failed to meet the obligations arising from the act no. 235/2004 Coll., on Value Added Tax (hereinafter referred to as the"VAT Act").
The amendment of the provision introducing the obligation of tax administrators to cancel VAT registration to payers when the VAT return is repeatedly filed has not yet been proposed by the Czech Ministry of Finance.
According to the law on VAT, the tax administrator can cancel the registration of the payer of the tax "ex officio" in cases, when: a) the payer did not materialize without notice due to the tax authorities for a period of twelve consecutive months of performance, b) the payer does not fulfill his obligations arising from this act, c) the payer ceases to be a taxable person.
In the previous control action, it was found that the applicable legislation allowed the mo for Threshold 1 to cancel the VAT registration at 31. in January of the following calendar year, so-called non-established payers who have not received any obligation to grant and pay tax during the current calendar year.
For Threshold 1, the Mo often did not revoke the VAT registration for these payers, since the relevant provision provided for an insufficient period for the cancellation of the registration.
This problem was eliminated by an amendment to the VAT Act with effect from 1. January 2009.
The tax administrator is entitled to cancel the registration of neusazeného tax payer in the case that the tax payer has not delivered in the previous calendar year any goods or services subject to tax or the goods or services are exempt from tax with right to deduct VAT.
Recommendation 2
Monthly reporting of summary reports
In the framework of international cooperation, the previous control action recommended that all EU states introduce a monthly deadline for submitting summary reports.
The Council Directive reduces the period for which intra-EU summary reports are submitted to one month. This measure was implemented in the Czech Republic through the VAT Act with effect from 1. January 2010.
The obligation to submit summary reports in electronic form is also newly established.
The aggregate report shall be submitted by the payer even if there are services for which the place of performance is determined in accordance with § 9 (2). 1 of the law on VAT, provided to another member state to a person registered for tax in another member state and if such services must declare and pay tax to their beneficiaries.
This obligation is based on council directive 2008/8/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC as regards the place of supply of services.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of data in VAT returns and aggregate reports with a view to achieving greater reliability of data in VIES this recommendation concerned the German tax administration.
The Czech administration carried out a comparison of the data about intrakomunitárních transactions reported in the VAT returns and recapitulative statements by Czech payers automatically in system ADIS.
Recommendation 4
Sharing successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system at EU level
Proper collection of VAT is one of the prerequisites for the proper functioning of the EU internal market.
The fight against VAT fraud is therefore a priority area and has been given considerable attention in recent years.
The importance of this struggle is evidenced by, inter alia, the conclusions of a study published by the European commission in October 2009, in which the external evaluator tried to determine the difference between the authorized and actually collected amount of VAT in the EU-25 member states (hereinafter referred to as "EU-25") during the period 2000-2006.
Based on the analysis of the available data, the author of the analysis concluded that the estimated amount of losses from uncollected VAT for this period is in the 90 to 113 billion EUROS, with the average per year in the EU-25 picks 12% of the legitimate VAT.
For the Czech Republic, the VAT loss for 2006 was even estimated at 18%.
In the framework of international cooperation was in the previous control action noted that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by only one member state.
The successful criteria, components and approaches of this system must be shared and implemented in each EU member state.
As regards the risk management system, the SAO has carried out an audit of the EUROCANET system for the exchange of information in the EU.
Cases of risky intracommunity transactions carried out by EU taxpayers included in EUROCANET have been selected for inspection (see Chapter 4.3).
Objectives improve administrative cooperation and increase the efficiency of the fight against VAT fraud should also be achieved through the establishment of the EUROFISC network, which should improve the cooperation of the responsible authorities in a form allowing disclosure of fraud already in their bud.
This network should later become an important source of information in assessing the risks of intra-community transactions.
The ECOFIN Council approved the creation of the EUROFISC network as early as 7. October 200812 and at the same time set out the basic principles to be followed by this network.
Type of EUROFISC is already a functioning system for the fast and selective exchange of information EUROCANET, which was developed by the belgian tax administration, in cooperation with other member states and with the support of the European commission and OLAF.
The aim of this system is to detect risky business transactions and entities involved in organised VAT fraud.
4.1.2 evaluation of recommendations in Germany
The evaluation of the recommendations from the first report yielded the following findings:
Recommendation 1
Conditions for registration of payers should be harmonised within the EU
The German tax administration has established a well-functioning system of registration of tax payers, which is based on a detailed questionnaire.
The Federal Ministry of Finance notified the Commission of this scheme in October 2007.
Improvement of the system is carried out on an ongoing basis.
Data from the questionnaire are currently electronically processed and will subsequently be used for the survey as part of risk management already during registration.
The commission presented a proposal amending Council regulation (EC) no 1798/2003, which included common standards for the registration and deregistraci tax payers.
Member states requested further clarification and detailed elaboration of this issue.
BRH asked the Federal Ministry of finance to ensure the already reached level of standards in this area in Germany.
Recommendation 2
Monthly reporting of summary reports
8. the law on the transposition of EU directives into national law was adopted in April 2010.
This law contains provisions relating to the monthly submission of summary reports on intracommunitary deliveries.
Those provisions took effect on 1. July 2010.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of data in VAT returns and aggregate reports with a view to achieving greater reliability of data in VIES and consideration of the interconnection of both VAT returns and aggregate reports
Established a joint working group consisting of staff from the länder and the Federal ministry of finance.
The group has developed a strategy to automatically compare data from VAT returns and aggregate reports.
This strategy has so far been discussed in the Länder.
In addition, the Working Party looked at the instrument intended to optimise the control procedure for transactions in the internal market.
Recommendation 4
Sharing of successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system at EU level the exchange of relevant information takes place at EU level.
Germany is a participant in this exchange within the so-called risk management platform.
The European Commission supported the idea of this platform and on the basis of a written consultation of 18. October 2006 the establishment of a risk management platform was added to the Fiscalis 2006-2007 action plan.
Platform members are further divided into sub-groups, which deal with individual topics, such as: • risk management tools, • influencing the negotiations, • evaluation, • the update guide to risk management.
In early 2010, reports on the results of the activities of these subgroups were published.
4.1.3 evaluation
Registration
The issue of the conditions for VAT registration and cancellation of this registration in different countries has been addressed at EU level.
The draft amendment to Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003 included the extension of existing databases within the EU, including the VAT tax identification numbers database.
It also regulated common minimum standards for registration and deregistration of taxpayers.
For the time being, the issue of registration and cancellation of registration has been left to the national legislation of the EU member states.
Member states requested further clarification and detailed elaboration of this issue.
BRH has asked the Federal Ministry of finance to ensure that the level of standards already achieved in Germany does not fall.
8. in June 2010, the ECOFIN Council reached political agreement on that proposal for a regulation.
The intention of Common Minimum Standards has been abandoned.
Member states shall implement national procedures and only have the duty to inform about these practices, the Committee for administrative cooperation.
Both SAI expressed regret that the Commission failed to persuade member states about the necessity of common standards for the registration and deregistraci payers, because both SAI considered this measure as an important element of prevention in the fight against VAT fraud.
They would therefore welcome further efforts by the Commission in this regard.
Monthly reporting of summary reports
In the framework of international cooperation was in the previous control action recommended to all EU member states have imposed monthly deadline for the submission of summary reports, allowing for more timely screening values intrakomunitárních transactions.
Council directive 2008/117/EC amending directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax to combat tax evasion connected with intra-Community transactions, it shortens the period of time for which submitted a summary report on the implementation inside the EU, for one month.
In the Czech Republic, this measure was implemented through the VAT Act with effect from 1. January 2010, in Germany took effect 1. July 2010.
Germany did not impose a monthly aggregate reporting obligation under the established calendar, while the Czech Republic did (in accordance with EU directives).
Comparison of data in VAT returns and summary reports in Germany with a view to achieving greater reliability of data in VIEs and consideration of the interconnection of both VAT returns and summary reports
The German tax administration accepted the BRH recommendations and set up a working group to find possible solutions.
Work is ongoing so far and the BRH will closely monitor further developments.
Sharing successful criteria, components and approaches of the risk management system at EU level
Germany and the Czech Republic apply different approaches to the risk management system for the purpose of identifying risk-prone traders.
The SAO has audited the EUROCANET system for the exchange of information in the EU (see Chapter. 4.3).
The BRH focused on German participation in the so-called risk management platform.
4.2. follow-up of selected cases of intracommunitary transactions
In the previous control action was jointly investigated the implementation of commercial transactions, for which there were doubts about their implementation, or inconsistencies in the way the payers of both countries, these business transactions reported in your VAT returns or recapitulative statements.
Both audit institutions selected for the subsequent control of the nine cases involving intracommunity movement of goods between the Czech republic and Germany, whose control by the tax administrations of both countries has not been completed during the previous joint action control.
1)
The Czech payer was acquired at 1. quarter 2005 goods worth EUR 22 686 from the German payer.
This acquisition of goods, the Czech payer in his VAT declaration admitted, because the German payer had in that period allocated a VAT ID, but only the tax number intended for domestic transactions in Germany.
On the basis of international administrative cooperation under Council regulation (EC) no 798/2003 received the Czech tax administrator information, according to the German law on VAT does not have a payer who supplies the goods to other member states, allocated a VAT ID, in order to intracommunity supplies of goods exempt from VAT.
The subsequent control of the SAO audit it was found that on the basis of the checks carried out by the Czech tax administrator filed a Czech payer the additional tax to VAT, in which he admitted the acquisition of goods in the indicated value and at the same time in this tax return to claim the VAT deduction in the same amount.
2)
The Czech payer was 4. quarter 2004 acquire from the German payer goods worth 12 561 euros.
The acquisition of these goods was denied by the Czech payer and did not indicate in his VAT return.
At the request of Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003, the German tax administration refused cooperation as the turnover of transactions did not exceed EUR 15 000.
Since the Czech tax administrator did not obtain the evidence, ended the control without the award and the tax liability remained charged the original amount.
The subsequent control of the SAO found that the Czech tax administrator has received from Germany two spontaneous information according to Council regulation (EC) no 1798/2003, which indicated that the German payer of specified goods charged to Slovakia.
The Czech payer acquired the goods from the Slovak payer and indicated this acquisition in a proper VAT return for the month of October 2004.
3)
The Czech payer was 4. quarter 2004 acquire from the German payer a passenger car worth 48 500 euros.
The acquisition of the goods in question was not admitted by the Czech taxpayer.
This payer has not filed VAT returns since August 2004, therefore the tax administrator has calculated VAT of CZK 0 for that quarter.
On the basis of the information obtained in the framework of the international exchange of information according to Council regulation (EC) no 1798/2003 of Germany urged in march 2007 the tax payer to submit additional tax returns for VAT, which, however, the payer did not file.
The subsequent control, it was found that the tax administrator did in 2007, the other acts in the tax procedure, from which it emerged that the personal automobile Czech payer sold a used car dealer in the Czech republic.
The Czech tax administrator issued the tax assessment for the tax period December 2004 establishing the additionally assessed VAT for the acquisition of goods from another member state and its subsequent sale in the amount of 295 379 CZK.
By order of the regional court, the Czech payer was annulled with liquidation and a liquidator was appointed.
In the absence of foreclosures of the affected property of the tax borrower, this arrears appear impregnable.
4)
The Czech payer was to deliver new vehicles (passenger cars) to Germany during 4. quarter 2004 and 1. quarter 2005 totalling EUR 198 167.
From the responses to the request for information according to Council regulation (EC) no 1798/2003 showed that against the German entity currently underway in Germany, the outstanding tax-criminal proceedings.
Following a follow-up check, BRH obtained information that after the completion of the Tax Procedure in Germany, it was established that the German taxpayer had been incorporated into fraudulent activities.
The intracommunitary acquisition of goods was taxed at EUR 182 424 (2004) and EUR 369 690 (2005).
The Sao subsequently found out that the Czech payer was involved in Carousel deals with new means of transport.
On the basis of the information of the German tax authorities, relating to the verification of delivery of the goods, was in the Czech tax entity started checking the VAT for the tax period April, may and June 2005.
The tax administrator, on the basis of control findings and information obtained in the framework of the international exchange of information additionally assessed VAT for the period may 2005 in the amount of $ 703 031 CZK and for the period June 2005 in the amount of $ 726 551 USD.
5)
The Czech payer and was to acquire a machine totalling EUR 58 000 from the German payer in February 2005.
This German payer was supposed to deliver at 3. quarter 2004 Czech payer B machine worth EUR 88 027, but payer B denied this acquisition of goods.
The subsequent inspection of the Sao found that payer B had acquired the machine from a German company that had established an organizational component in the Czech Republic.
The Czech payer and did not declare the acquisition of goods from the German payer in his VAT return.
From the replies from the German tax administrator on the request for information according to Council regulation (EC) no 1798/2003 showed that the German payer did not materialize intracommunity delivery of the machine in a value of 58 000 EUROS, but the delivery of the goods within the Czech republic.
The BRH subsequently found that after the tax inspection the intracommunitary delivery of the machine had been re-qualified for domestic delivery of the machine and the VAT exemption had been abolished.
6)
The German taxpayer was 3. quarter 2004 to deliver to the Czech payer goods worth EUR 11 600.
The goods were purchased and subsequently sold in Germany in 2005.
The Sao subsequently found that the Czech tax administrator had issued an additional VAT Return where the acquisition of goods from another EU member state, including the acquisition of goods at that value, was wrongly indicated.
BRH found that, after receiving a reply to a request for information pursuant to Council regulation (EC) no 1798/2003 fixed the German tax administrator tax returns for VAT to the German payer and the additionally assessed VAT in € 1 600€.
Further movement of goods in Germany and the application of VAT in Germany is subject to tax control.
Summary report of the German payer has not yet been fixed, because the bug summary report in Germany can be carried out only payer, that the summary report has filed.
7)
The Czech tax administrator has received from the German tax administration request for information pursuant to Council regulation (EC) no 1798/2003, whether the Czech taxpayer acquired in February 2005 from a German payer's personal automobile at a price of 47 EUR 400.
After the tax procedure carried out in February 2005, the Czech tax administrator imposed a tax liability of CZK 0 on the Czech taxpayer and informed the German tax administrator that he could not confirm the acquisition of the car by the Czech taxpayer.
The subsequent inspection of the Sao found that the registration of the Czech VAT payer was cancelled in 2007 for non-compliance and the Czech tax administrator sent documents to the police of the Czech Republic.
Subsequent control of the BRH found that the German payer changed its registered office and the new locally competent tax administrator on the basis of the checks carried out, canceled the exemption from VAT for the supply of car to the Czech payer.
The German taxpayer has not yet corrected the data in the summary report and has lodged an appeal against the tax administrator's decision.
8)
According to data from the VIES system, the German payer supplied the Czech taxpayer in the period from 3. quarter 2004 to 1. quarter 2005 goods totalling EUR 33 205.
The subsequent control of the SAO found that the Czech tax administrator trying to find out the causes of differences arising for the Czech tax payer in the procurement of goods in the period from 3. quarter 2004 to 1. quarter 2005.
The Czech taxpayer has repeatedly filed an additional VAT return for 1. quarter 2005.
The Czech tax administrator did not clarify the difference in the value of the Goods acquired in the amount of CZK 134 273 for the period 3. quarter 2004 to 1. quarter of 2005, because, according to the statement of the Czech tax administrator it was not possible to accurately capture business transactions for each quarter, and therefore the tax administrator accepted from the additional tax returns.
9)
The German taxpayer delivered at 3. quarter 2004 to the Czech payer of goods worth EUR 46 854.
For the same period, the Czech payer granted intracommunitary acquisition of goods worth only EUR 14 856.
The Czech tax administrator verified the amount of deliveries made in the framework of the international exchange of information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003.
The reply to the request for information received from Germany were accompanied by 3 invoices with a total listed value of the delivery goods 31 998 EURO, which is the value corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech payer in the VAT return and the data referred to in VIES.
The subsequent control of the SAO found that the Czech payer filed after many urgencích tax additional tax VAT return for the tax period July 2004 until January 2007.
At the same time, in this tax return, the taxpayer invoked the right to deduct VAT, thereby leaving the tax liability for that tax period unchanged.
Subsequent checking verified that for the selected cases of business transactions between payers from the Czech republic and Germany were most of the tax proceeding is completed and that the tax authorities in the Czech republic and Germany have made adequate arrangements (i.e., retrospectively assigned a VAT or to prevent tax refund on entry).
4.3. control of selected cases of risk intracommunitary transactions
4.3.1 results of the inspection in the Czech Republic
EUROCANET can be an important source of information for the detection of high-risk entities within a member state, in which the acquisition of goods.
In the Czech Republic, the signal information obtained from EUROCANET was compared by the relevant local tax authorities with data on the purchasers.
Starting with 1. quarter of 2008 sends Czech republic into the system of the EUROCANET data on risk transactions and tax entities acting as contractors.
In the framework of international cooperation, nine Czech tax entities included in EUROCANET were selected for control.
These entities acted either as suppliers or as purchasers of goods.
Relevant data from tax managers from other member states were captured in EUROCANET.
Due to the fact that the German tax administration did not participate in the exchange of data in the system EUROCANET, it was not possible to obtain any information that would help figure out whether they were contractors with a German VAT ID identified the German tax administration as risky entities.
The audit revealed cases of ordinary commercial transactions, as well as cases suspected of involvement in Carousel trades or fraudulent conduct relating to VAT.
Where applicable, the tax authorities used the exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003.
Perhaps:
* The tax authorities did not reveal any suspicions of involvement in risky transactions when verifying signal information.
The tax authorities shall monitor such tax entities on an ongoing basis for their inclusion in EUROCANET.
• Financial authorities during the verification, the risk of transactions not shown in the submitted accounts, derogations from the rules applicable for the calculation of the tax base and VAT, although they found inconsistencies in the area of transportation and storage of goods or revealed a business relationship with the suspects or nekontaktními companies from other member states.
* Verification of business transactions was complicated as some taxpayers did not cooperate with tax administrators and could not be contacted.
Locally competent tax authorities have mostly examined risk tax entities and risk transactions listed in eurocanet signal information.
The tax administrator in examining risk transactions, in particular in connection with the screening of the so-called missing traders , they have limited options and only from physical control of the documents it is difficult to prove to the tax entity of fraudulent actions.
Tougher requirements for VAT registration and more flexible cancellation of registrations would help reduce missing trader fraud.
In the case of the tax entities involved in a revolving fraud and other fraudulent activities is occurring to register for VAT for the purpose of reporting of fictitious supplies of goods within the EU or for the purpose of issuance of a formally proper tax documents to payers, who on the basis of unduly draw deductions of input VAT.
In cases where there is suspicion of the involvement of tax bodies to the revolving stores and other fraud and leads to the import and export of goods from third countries, it would be appropriate to ensure greater mutual cooperation in customs and financial authorities.
Closer cooperation between these institutions would help in the identification of goods and irregularities in the transport documents and also in monitoring of the physical movement of goods within the EU towards the end consumer.
The participation of EU member states in EUROCANET is voluntary.
The fact that the activities of the system EUROCANET did not participate in the three large member states (Germany, Italy and the United kingdom), reviewed by the European parliament in late 2008, as the weakness of this system, which would be the establishment of compulsory in the EUROFISC network should be removed.
4.3.2 results of the inspection in Germany
BRH analysed the information available to the Federal central financial authority, which contained data from EUROCANET.
These figures were a criterion for the collection of six files of German taxpayers for inspection.
Germany, like some other countries, has refused to actively participate in EUROCANET.
Thus, Germany has a passive status, which means that it does not send data to Brussels, but is only the recipient of data from EUROCANET.
The justification for this position is contained in the following statement:in the government's view, it is not legally permissible for state (public) institutions to provide data to EUROCANET.
Currently there is no legal base that would allow it to violate the valid regulations on the secrecy of tax information.
In addition, the government has no reliable information on the use of such data within EUROCANET by other member states.“17 Since October 2007, is made by the Federal central tax office analysis of data from the system EUROCANET and submits them to the tax authorities of the länder in accordance with the agreed procedure.
The German financial authorities receive the control information on the direct commercial relations of payers (registered for the specific tax authorities) with traders from other member states, who were included into the system of the EUROCANET.
The German financial authorities, however, do not receive any information about whether such a trader from another member state has some risky trading relationships with traders from other member states who also maintain a commercial intercourse with the German trader.
4.3.3 evaluation
The Czech Republic is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has a passive status.
It is unsatisfactory for an active participant if some member states refuse active participation.
As a result of this, the control in the area had to be carried out in different ways.
However, the results did not reveal major differences in the detection of VAT fraud cases, since EUROCANET is not the only systemic risk management tool.
The tax administration of both countries have a variety of other tools to detect fraudulent transactions, however, it is necessary to create within the EU a comprehensive risk management system.
The EU Council reached political agreement on the draft regulation, the main benefit of which lies in the establishment of the eurofisc network.
Experience gained in the use of EUROCANET data should also be part of the projected VAT fraud network.
Member states should therefore communicate their experiences at European level.
On the other hand, cases submitted to the courts at national and european level show that it is apparently necessary discussion between the member states and the Commission about the conditions of the tax exemptions in the intrakomunitárních transactions.
4.4 mutual assistance in the recovery of claims
4.4.1 international assistance for debt collection in the Czech Republic
In particular, the following directives are the basic arrangements for international cooperation in the recovery of certain financial claims within the EU:
• Council directive no. 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims resulting from operations forming part of the system of financing the European agricultural guidance and guarantee fund, as well as agricultural levies and customs duties;
• Council directive no. 2001/44/EC amending directive no. 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims resulting from operations forming part of the system of financing the European agricultural guidance and guarantee fund, and of agricultural levies and customs duties, value added tax and certain excise taxes;
• Commission directive no. 2002/94/EC, implementing certain provisions of Council directive no. 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to certain levies, duties, taxes and other measures.
In the Czech Republic, Council Directive 76/308 / EEC was implemented by Act No. 252/2000 Coll., on international assistance in the recovery of certain financial claims.
Following the adoption of council directive 2001/44/EC, it was necessary to implement this directive into the Czech legal order and at the same time to amend that Act No. 252/2000 Coll.
In this connection, a new law No. 191/2004 Coll.was adopted., on international assistance in the recovery of certain financial claims.
Commission Regulation (EC) no 1179/2008 of 28 is a new regulation in the system for regulating international cooperation in the recovery of certain financial claims within the EU. 11. 2008.
The annex to the regulation sets out new models of applications which apply from 1. 1. 2009, newly establishes the obligation of electronic communications and the obligation of the requesting authority to certify the conformity of the sent documents with the original document.
Guiding principles for providing international cooperation in debt collection:
1. reciprocity;
2. assistance shall always be provided only upon request containing the requisites prescribed;
3. the aid does not apply to financial claims which have the nature of criminal penalties in the requested state;
4. in the provision of international assistance for the recovery of claims shall be governed by the national legal order of the state, which was to help asked;
5. foreign receivables do not take precedence in recovery;
6. assistance shall be granted only in the recovery of undisputed claims;
7. the principle of exhaustion (the requesting state has, without success, used all applicable possibilities to recover the claim under its legal order).
Act No. 191/2004 Coll. defines the three forms, which assistance takes place, and that the provision of information, service of documents and custom recovery.
Procedure for sending claims for recovery to other EU member states
The locally competent financial office electronically sends a request for information, request for service or request for enforcement of the receivables together with the relevant documents to the Czech ministry of finance through the financial directorate.
The Czech ministry of finance shall ensure translation of the application into the relevant language, scans it, including its annexes and through the CCN/CSI network shall send to the competent authority of the tax administration of the designated state.
For recovery, two basic requirements apply: the claim must be more than EUR 1 500 and must not be older than 5 years.
If those requirements are not met, the requested authority may refuse enforcement.
Procedure for receiving claims for recovery from other EU member states
When receiving an application from another member state, the Czech Ministry of Finance must confirm receipt of the application as soon as possible, not later than seven days.
If the Czech ministry of finance decides not to accept an application, it shall notify the applicant authority of the reasons for rejection and indicate the specific provisions of the directive which it relies.
This communication must be sent no later than three months after the date of confirmation of receipt of the application.
After receipt of the request of the Czech ministry of finance shall verify whether the request of all the formalities under the law, and should request without delay to the pass through of the financial directorate of the locally competent tax office for processing.
If the request for recovery of accepted, the tax administrator, inter alia, determines the debtor's assets, e.g. the acquisition of statements from the cadastre, the survey accounts in banks, verification of vehicle registration, the dmv, etc.
After a lapse of six months from the date of acknowledgement of receipt of the request, should the Czech ministry of finance requesting authority to disclose the outcome of the investigation, which was carried out in order to obtain the required information.
In the case of non-contact tax entities where the claim cannot be recovered, the requesting authority should also be informed of this fact.
Any sum recovered by the tax authority shall be transferred to the applicant authority in CZK within one month from the date on which recovery was effected.
It is not excluded, that the Czech tax administrator to enforce foreign claims authorized an extension to its payment or payment in instalments, unless with the consent of the state which the enforcement requested.
For the period of recovery, the debtor is prescribed interest or penalty payments under Act No. 337/1992 Coll., about the administration of taxes and fees.
This interest or penalty payment belongs to the state which requested the recovery.
In the case of received applications for enforcement, the Czech Ministry of Finance did not refer the applications to the tax authorities locally in time for processing, in particular in 2006 and 2007.
A similar situation was detected in the framework of the international assistance for recovery even in the case of applications received from the tax administrators from the Czech republic.
The audit revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance did not act in accordance with Act No. 191/2004 Coll. because failing to notify the locally competent authority of the member state on the progress made in the enforcement within six months from the date of confirmed receipt of the request.
This situation has been improving since 2008.
Statistics
The Czech Ministry of Finance in accordance with the provisions of § 13 Para. 4 of Act No. 191/2004 Coll. processed every year until 15. march statistical data for the European commission, indicating the number of requests for information, delivery or enforcement of, sent or received in the past year stating the amount of the claims to which the requests relate.
The european commission prepares on the basis of information provided by all EU member states report on the status of recovery of claims by the EU Council and the European parliament.
Scrutiny it was found that the Czech ministry of finance podhodnotilo statistical data due to errors in the entry of the claims involved in 2008, about 5 to 250 thous. EUR, and placing an incorrect value of the claim to be recovered on the VAT (it was a shift in the decimal point after the conversion of receivables of the Czech crowns to the value in euros).
This error was subsequently translated into European Commission statistics.
Information on mutual assistance, including recoveries, is presented in the table below.
4.4.2 international assistance for debt collection in Germany
The legal authority to international administrative assistance in tax matters derives from the law of the European communities, Council directive no. 2008/55/EC of 26. May 2008 (EC debt collection directive) and Commission regulation of 28. November 2008 (EC implementing directive).
In the interests of more accessible wording and better clarity, the EC debt collection directive codifies council directive 76/308/EEC of 15. March 197621, the provisions of which have already been substantially amended several times.
The provisions apply, inter alia, to the recovery of VAT, income tax and capital gains tax, including accessories.
The EC debt collection directive was transposed into national German law by the state tax collection act (EC) of 3. May 2003.

The administrative operations of the tax authorities shall be governed, in particular, by execution instructions and enforcement instructions.

4.4.4 comparison and evaluation
In the area of international recovery assistance to all EU member states governed by the same european legislation.
Therefore, the method of processing applications for international assistance in debt collection in the Czech Republic and Germany is identical.
The SAO and the BRH carried out a comparison of the statistics submitted by both member states to the European Commission for the period 2006-2008.
The data contained in these statistics did not coincide.
In its 2006 report, the European Commission recommended that member states pay increased attention to the management of their statistics.
In the 2009 report, the Commission concluded that the incidence of mismatches in statistics had decreased even though the number of applications had increased.
Both SAI consider it important that the issues of Statistics be renegotiated at EU level.
This discussion should focus on how to avoid persistent inconsistencies, otherwise the data reported by EU states in the statistics will not be reliable and comparable.
In addition, both SAI concur in the opinion that reliable statistics are required to report the annual number of applications and also the nature of the claims (i.e. claims relating to VAT, income tax, etc.) and the amount of claims recovered by the member states.
Both SAI considered important that the Commission provide a more detailed analysis of the statistics submitted by the member states, because it can assist member states in assessing their own effectiveness in fighting fraud on the VAT.
The fact that the recovery rate can be calculated broken down by member state, both SAI consider it useful for member states with a lower recovery rate to intensify their efforts and seek to improve the recovery rate at least to the level of the EU average.
If a member state so wishes, the commission should take an active part in this process.
In particular, in 2006 and 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance did not submit applications for debt collection to the tax authorities locally in a timely manner.
A similar situation was found for applications for international assistance received from tax authorities in the Czech Republic.
The audit revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance did not act in accordance with Act No. 191/2004 Coll. about the international assistance for the recovery of claims, because it had not informed the competent authority of the member state on the progress made in the enforcement within six months from the date of confirmed receipt of the request.
4.5 control of large tax entities
4.5.1 control of large tax entities in the Czech Republic
General information
The VAT audit of large tax entities is governed by the same rules as that of other tax entities.
The procedural procedure for controlling VDS is based on Act No. 337/1992 Coll., about the administration of taxes and fees.
The Czech ministry of finance has defined VDS as natural or legal persons that were founded or established for business purposes and whose net turnover for the tax period referred to in the income tax return of natural/legal persons reached the amount of 2 billion CZK or higher.
The inclusion of the tax entity in the VDS occurred after the filing of the income tax return for the relevant tax period, for the first time in 2003.
Tax entity ceased to be referred to as the VDS, if in three consecutive tax periods from the end of the period, when he filed a tax return on the basis of which was between the VDS included, its net turnover for the tax period fell below the threshold.
The tax entity may not be excluded from the VDS register without carrying out a tax inspection of at least one tax per tax period.
All VDS were checked at least in a five-year period until the end of 2009.
Since the year 2010 must be at least once every 2 years carried out a written evaluation of the tax entity and the chosen subsequent procedure must be eliminated tax risks and their negative impact on the correct determination of and recovery of tax.
The control of the FU is aimed at at least one type of tax; as a rule, the tax administrator chooses several tax periods at once.
The VDS were controlled by the specialised inspection departments, which are set up for a total of 13 FUS, or by the inspection departments of the locally relevant FUS.
The Department of specialised inspections shall carry out tax checks within the scope established by the director of the financial Directorate.
In addition to large tax entity audits, it also examines
* tax entities operating in unusual and specific business fields;
* entities for which the implementation of tax control is professionally and time-consuming;
* entities with a branched territorial and organizational structure;
* entities suspected of large-scale tax evasion;
• entities linked in chains and networks, suspected of extensive tax evasion and the unjustified lure of excessive deductions.
The number of tax inspections carried out by the Departments of specialised M & A checks and the results of those checks are set out in Table 3.
The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed an amendment to Act No. 531/1990 Coll., on territorial financial bodies, which consists in the establishment of the specialized tax office with nationwide coverage for selected tax entities (including for legal persons created for the purpose of business, which reached a turnover of more than 2 billion CZK).
4.5.2 control of large tax entities in Germany
General information
Checks on VAT for large companies is governed by the same rules as the tax control in general, i.e. the relevant provisions are enshrined in the following legislation: • the German fiscal code (AO), • the law on fiscal administration (FVG), • regulations on tax inspections (BpO).
Other methodological documents are also in force.
German fiscal code
Statutory provisions relating to control are enshrined in articles 193-203 of the German fiscal code in section IV - Tax inspection on the spot. These articles in particular provide the rules of admissibility of tax inspection on the spot (i.e. in the premises of the enterprise), their range around the page of the course, the rules for the division of responsibilities, the form and content of the notice of inspection, control principles, the obligations of the entity to cooperate and the prerequisites for the implementation of the final discussion and communication of the inspection report.
On-the-spot tax inspections are carried out by the responsible tax authorities (article 195 of the code).
The Fiscal Governance Act referred to in Article 5.1 (1), in connection with Article 5.1 (1), 19 of the act, participation in on-the-spot tax inspections carried out by the federal Central Tax Office is compulsory.
The authorities involved shall agree together on the spot the nature and extent of the federal Central Tax Office's participation in tax controls.
In addition, it has the Federal central tax office the right to require specific businesses, which selects, were subjected to scrutiny at a time you designate.
In this case, it can declare the rules for the implementation and content of the inspection at the premises of these companies.
The regulations on tax inspections According to the article 108.7 of the German constitution were regulations on tax inspections (German acronym BpO 2000) agreed by the Federal council (Bundesrat, upper house of the German parliament, in which are represented the governments of the länder).
These administrative regulations apply for the on-site inspection by the financial authorities of the länder and the Federal central tax office.
Undertakings shall be classified according to size at regular intervals in accordance with Article 3 of BPO 2000.
Large enterprises are subject to subsequent control (article 4.2 BpO).
Pursuant to Article 33.1 of BPO 2000, each informed Tax Authority must keep a register of Company groups as defined in BPO 2000.
Methodological guidelines
In addition to the above, the additional methodology for tax administration provides the following guidelines:
* Single manual for special VAT checks in Germany ;
* a USLO manual setting out a methodology for the use of intracommunitary business relationship data held in VIES;
* ZAUBER manual that sets the methodology for using the Zauber database;
* work aids for various and special items.
The classification of tax entities is based on criteria such as turnover and net profit, with different limits by type of business.
The data is published by the Federal Ministry of Finance.
They are evaluated every three years and fixed for the next three years.
The number of companies to control - not just large enterprises - must be determined at regular control intervals.
In general, inspections of large enterprises are carried out on an ongoing basis.
Checks are usually declared including VAT checks.
This means that in the course of the inspection, checks shall be definitively carried out mainly on income tax, excise duty and VAT - i.e. checks on all types of relevant taxes.
VAT checks may be carried out either by tax inspectors or by VAT inspectors.
Implementation varies and depends on the organizational arrangement of the Länder.
The number of tax periods covered by checks usually ranges from three to five years.
BPO 2000 envisages a three-year Control Period.
The subject of examination is all taxes of the company.
4.5.3 control management of large tax entities
Both SAI decided not to investigate individual cases of VDS checks carried out, but focused on management issues in order to get an overview of how tax administrations manage VAT checks at VDS.
In the form of a questionnaire, they collected information from tax authorities about the areas they consider essential for managing the issue.
• What statistical records and analyses regarding VAT control for VDS are available to the management of tax administrations?
Especially:
• Are there any statistics or records of rates in which a distinction is made between combating VAT fraud and generally controlling VAT?
Czech Republic: No, the ADIS system does not allow such a resolution with the current data version.
Germany: the tax administration does not distinguish between the control proposed to combat VAT fraud and the general control of VAT.
• Are there any statistics or records of the timeliness of VAT checks (in connection with the time period of controlled transactions)?
Czech Republic: Records on the timeliness of inquiries with relevance for intracommunitary acquisition of goods for selected VAT payers are reported in the ADIS system.
In addition, the information registered in ADIS also includes data on the type of Question Time.
Germany: No, the unified statistics at the federal level for tax inspectors to contain only information on the average time of the last inspection (information on the year).
This figure does not provide an overview of the selected control periods with respect to individual entrepreneurs.
VAT controllers focus on the latest tax assessment period; they also have the right to carry out VDS checks.
However, statistics produced at the federal level for special VAT control services do not provide information on the classification of tax entities.
• There are any statistics or records on the nature of the additional tax revenues generated, broken down e.g. by the following criteria:
and. net tax increase (e.g. in cases where a tax entity has unlawfully applied a reduced VAT rate instead of the standard tax rate);
II. only nominal increase in tax liability (e.g. transfer of a fully qualified VAT case to another tax period);
III. additional collection of the income tax (payment of the additional tax due).
Czech Republic:
The Czech tax administration monitors the number of carried out verification of the tax, the volumes of the additionally assessed tax broken down by type of tax, according to the number of controlled taxpayers and in the number of audited tax period.
Other tax procedures (local inquiries, complaints) are followed in the same way.
As a separate task, time data and amounts of additional taxes paid are recorded.
General Debt Statistics broken down by type of tax, but not by the declared tax or by the Tax Administrator shall also be kept.
Germany: no, uniform statistics at the federal level for tax controllers and special VAT control services do not distinguish between those criteria.
Moreover, most tax administrations visited do not distinguish these differences.
• Are there areas of control that generate high additional returns?
Czech republic: Yes, the tax administrator has the right to collect tax payer for verification on the basis of criteria, which can be build on the selected indicators in special sections of the ADIS.
Germany: there are no regulations at the federal level.
It follows from this that uniform statistics at the federal level for tax controllers and special VAT control services do not provide such data.
However, there is one coordinated approach by the finance ministers of the federal states and the federal government.
In the database ZAUBER must tax investigation or tax investigators from the German länder to write them levied an increased tax (VAT) the obligation, if it exceeds a certain amount.
In this case, they must specify, for example, the nature of the tax increase measured.
* What findings are most common?
Czech Republic:
- VDS make an unauthorised right to deduct input tax for supplies and services:
* which have not been used to carry out any economic activity under § 72 (2). 1 of the VAT Act;
• which have been used for representation pursuant to § 75 para. 3 of the VAT Act;
• on the basis of tax documents that did not comply with the requirements set out in § 73 para. 1 of the VAT Act;
- The VDS have not declarised output VAT pursuant to § 21 (2). 1 of the VAT Act.
Germany: it was noted that there are no regulations at the federal level.
It follows from this that uniform statistics at the federal level for tax controllers and special VAT control services do not provide such data.
VAT findings are not independently registered by the Länder if they result from the VDS tax controls.
However, in the database ZAUBER, where tax auditors or by investigators from the länder to write them levied an increased tax (VAT) the obligation, if it exceeds a certain amount, is the Federal central tax office able to these information to analyze.
* Does the tax administration analyse the areas of control resulting from high "yield" and infer the consequences for management?
Czech Republic: yes, for example, they are launching national audits on risk commodities or the subject of economic activity.
Germany: there are no regulations at the federal level.
Uniform statistics at the federal level for tax controllers and special VAT control services do not provide data on Audit areas resulting in high "revenues".
There are different views on the process of analysis, as well as on the management of cases in terms of significance.
Some regional financial authorities provide special information, but their use is at the discretion of the financial authorities.
4.5.4 comparison and evaluation
Differences in the responses of both the member states show that the Czech republic provides a system that collects the amount of data of the carried-out tax inspections and further data from the statements of the accounts - the balance sheet and statements of profit and loss.
Based on a wide range of data, the Czech Republic is able to regulate the selection of cases with a risk-prone nature.
The same applies to the analysis and management of VAT control in general.
In 2012, the establishment of a specialized tax office for the administration of VDS is planned in the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the tax administration does not collect this information.
It follows from this that it is more difficult to carry out these tasks in a similar way.
However, Germany's philosophy places more emphasis on the selection of individual cases on the basis of data from the tax returns submitted.
The risk management components will therefore be strengthened and improved.
On the basis of adequate reference notes, expert auditors must be able to measure the exact amount of VAT.
Both SAI concur in the opinion that member states should be able to ensure adequate financial management and adequate risk management system.
This will help reduce outages in VAT revenue.
As a result, the return on VAT collection will increase and the level of risk detection among unreliable entrepreneurs will improve.
5. Conclusion
Cooperation between the two SAI on parallel controls of VAT management has met the objectives set by the SAO and the BRH.
Both SAI know each other better applicable systems in the following areas: • intracommunity transactions, • risk management, VAT, in particular as regards the choice of transaction is prone to risk, • assistance in recovery of VAT and • control of VAT for large taxpayers.
Thanks to mutual cooperation, differences in VAT fraud detection strategies and differences in the above VAT management areas in the Czech Republic and Germany were revealed.
The control findings were compared and best practices were identified on their basis.
In addition, both SAI hope that the results achieved will provide an impetus for stakeholders to start discussing approaches and strategies within the member states, among them at European Commission level.
The extremely valuable experience and knowledge gained from the cooperation of both SAI can serve as an encouragement for the implementation of future VAT management control actions.
