b ' COVID-2019-20 apps are mobile software apps designed to help follow the relationship in 19 coronavirus disease, for example, identifying those people (′′ contact ′′). Process that may have been in a relationship with the suffered person.
Different apps in some areas and powers have been created or suggested with official support of governments.
A lot of frames have been created to create a relationship tracking app.
Privacy concerns have been raised, especially on those systems that are based on the geographical location of app users.
In a few disturbing alternatives include using bluetot sagnals so that user can enter other mobile phones nearby.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced together that they will support these apps based on Bluetooth to work directly on their Android and iOS operational systems.
In China, China's government, together with Alipay, has created an app that allows cities to see if they weren't in contact with people who have Quid-19 disease.
This app is used in many cities from China. In Singapore, an app is used as TraceTogether.
The app has been created by the IT Regional Community, which has been published as freedom resources and will be handed over to the government. Northern Macedonia has put on the way to Bluetooth Probinst app that identifies potential patients and provides a strong response to health service officials.
The app was created by the Ministry of Communication and Technology.
Until April 14, 2020, the app was waiting for Manzoori by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government said that the contact app is in the final stage of development, and will be available in a few weeks. The same app has been planned in Ireland and France (′′ StopCovid ′′).
Australia and New Zealand both consider the TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocols based on applications. Russia considers to introduce geofencing app for those patients suffering from Covid-19 diseases in Moscow, and the format is created to make sure they don't go out of home.
Ross Anderson, Cambridge University Security Engineer, listed a number of potential practical problems in app-based systems, including positive results and potential lack of effectiveness if using the app is only limited to a few parts of people..
Considering concerns about publishing ′′ Coronavirus ′′ apps, Apple has set restrictions on which organizations can add coronavirus-related apps in Apple Store. It's limited to famous organizations only in ′′ official ′′ or in other words.
Google and Amazon have put the same limitations.
Privacy campaigns have expressed their concern about the group overseeing impacts using coronavirus applications, especially whether the surveillance infrastructure created to fight coronavirus buba will be eliminated when this threat It's finished.
The International Forgiveness Organization and more than hundreds of other organizations have published a statement that demands restrictions to oversee this type of way.
The above organizations announced eight conditions on government projects.
Surveillance should be ′′ legal, necessary and appropriate
Surveillance and surveillance must have the poverty of ending.
Using information will be limited to Quid-19 goals;
Information security and disgrace should be kept safe and protected based on evidence;
Digital surveillance should prevent discrimination and disorder.
Sharing information with the third group should be defined in the law;
In order to respond to bad benefits, there must be protection against bad benefits and the rights of followers.
A meaningful participation is needed by all ′′ related reservation including public health workers and groups. Germany's chaotic computer club (CCC) and unproof journalists (Greenzine report) also published checklists.
Google / Apple is considering a suggested plan to solve a continuous observation problem by removing its operational systems when no longer needed.
Some countries have used a network-based tracking location instead of apps, which can eliminate the need to download the app and prevent tracking.
In Israel, the network probinstate chasing was Manzoor.
Network Probinst solutions that have access to raw location data have potential privacy problems.
However, all central systems don't need to have central servers access to personal location data; a number of privacy protection systems are created that central servers use only for internal contact (see below).
In South Korea, a system without app was used to follow up in South Korea.
Instead of using a special app, the system collected tracking data from different sources of mobile tools and card giving data, and joined the possible illnesses to notify those with short messages..
In order to inform the potential contact people, the government has released public access to location information, which has been allowed in the country after the publication of MERS. This is
People have access to this information through a number of apps and websites. Other countries including Germany use central and privacy systems.
Until April 6, 2020, details still haven't been published.
The pursuit of privacy contact is a good idea, which has a enough literature research part of at least 2013 years. Until April 7, 2020, dozens of workers have been working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using bluetot low energy (BLE) so that user can enter other mobile phones nearby.
However, Pepp-PT is a co-operation attempt that has both central and centralized ways and doesn't have a single protocol. Focus protocols Nearly Credit Protocols (DP-PPT / DP-3 T), short contact number (TCN, fka contact numbers, CEN), privacy allergies protocols and mobile contact tracks. Mechanics (PACT) and more included.
In these protocols, a diagnostic personal information never leaves a tool, and all comparison is done in the device.
The privacy group when tracking the COVID-19 publishes a location or way of the intersection of data in MIT Media Lab, which is a platform for using privacy protection techniques.
It's the White Pepper's ′′ Apps Gon Rouge: Keeping Personal Privacy in BBA ′′ based on a published research on the headline. Another same attempt is to build a SafeTrace Platform by Enigma MPC, which is a company of privacy technologies and was originally created in MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace is using Hardware safe technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health information with other users and officials, without agreeing to the privacy of this information.
On April 5, 2020, the TCN International Coalition was created by a number of groups that joined around and joined the large-level protocols that aimed at compulsion, tracking and alert applications. Providing international cooperation in the area that is a key aspect of achieving the goals of use.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that the BlueTrace protocol has released as a freedom source used by their official government app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an innovation to follow a relationship, which will protect the privacy and reduce the bluetooth. Energy technology and the combination of cryptography will be built based on.
They also published the specifications of the original technologies used in this system.
According to Apple and Google, this system will be implemented in three stages:
Putting such tools so that governments can create official apps for the protection of Coronavirus.
Directly integrating this activity into iOS and Android Google and Apple Plan to first update the system by distributing the system and then in the same way when the threat ends by removing the information. Solve the beginning and continuous problems of observation.
Wash of hands, which is also known as the health of hands, is the act of cleaning your hands for soil, food, micro organisations or other unwanted materials.
During the day in ′′ important moments ′′ constantly preventing the spread of many diseases with soap, as an example, diarrhoea and diversion, which this disease is from the mouth through the abusive materials. Shipped.
People can suffer from respiratory diseases such as flu or common infections, for example, if they don't get their hands before they hold their eyes, nose and mouth (e.g. mucasia).
Five sensitive times a day that are important to put your hands on soap in the following way: before and after removal of need, after cleaning under the baby or changing the pump, before the baby feeding., before and after food prep, or after touching raw meat, cub, or chicken.
If there is no water and soap, hands can also be washed with aero. The International Health Organization offers hand-cutting in the following situations:
Before, on time and after food prep.
Before and after patient care.
Changing the dippers or cleaning the kids who have been able to do it.
After a burnt nose, jokes or a burnt.
After handling with the observers, foods, or monitored wastes.
The medical protection of hands is referring to health habits regarding medical actions.
A hand removal before medication regulation or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main health purpose of hand-washing is to clean hands from petogenes (bacteria, virus, or other microorganism that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease.
This is especially necessary for people who are handling or working in medical, but a important act for all people.
Hand washing has many health benefits, such as flu, coronavirus, and other sari diseases; prevent diarrhea causes; reduce respiratory diseases;
And raising the death level of children during birth at home.
A research of 2013 shows that hand-rectified habits may cause small development in the age of 2013 years of age.
In growing countries, the level of children's deaths can be reduced by introducing simple habits, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple act can cause about 50 % decrease in the death level from these diseases.
Ways that promote hand-washing can bring down almost three parts of diarrhea case, and it relates to cleaning water in low-return areas.
48 % reduction in diarrhea events can be related to soap with hand washing. Soap with soap is the only effective and cheap way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory intensity (ARI), if this action is done automatically in homes, schools and communities.
The biggest part of ARI, is the first cause of death between children under the age of 1.8 years, taking around 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhea and breast hugs cause the death of around 3.5 million children a year.
According to UNICEF, before eating and using toilets, washing your hands is a fixed habit of saving many people's lives than any vaccine or medical ways, and due to a half-dead and breathing. The level of th part deaths from Antanatu can be reduced.
Wash hands are often linked to other ways of health care as part of the water, cleanliness and healthcare program (WASH).
Wash of hands also protects the deadly stones that are sent through direct physical contact.
The only small damage to hand-washing is to cause skin damage due to drying skin.
In 2012, found in a study in Denmark that can increase the hands, the condition of the skin is known as the Las Eczema or the hand dramatite, especially the health. This situation is common between care staff.
Hand loading is also known as a sign of compulsory obsession disorder (OCD).
There are five important times during the day that are while washing hands with soap is important in reducing disease transmission: after using toilet (to remove the emptiness or need to remove the need).), after cleaning under the baby (changing the pumper), before the baby nutrition, before and after food prep or after touching raw meat, cub, or chicken.
Other cases where the right hand-washing technique should be used to prevent disease transmission such as before and after treatment of cuts or tap; after pinning, cotton and pose; and pinning. After; and after touching the garbage.
In many countries, the level of soap with soap is very low.
In 2015, there was a study of hand-washing in 54 countries that on average, 38.7 % of the families are shaking their hands with soap. A study of 2014 showed that the highest level in Saudi Arabia was 97 percent; in the United States is almost 23 percent; and the lowest in China is 77 percent.. Methods of habit change are now available to increase the habit of hand-washing with soap in important times. Washing a group of hands for school kids in growing countries is a choice to make children a habit of hand-washing.
The ′′ Essential Health Care Program ′′ implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a level action for children's health and educational development.
Chenjio treatment twice a year, along with soap every day, brushing teeth every day with Florida is the main objectives of this national program.
This program is also being successful in Indonesia.
Removing micro organism from the skin grows by adding soap or detergent in the water.
Soap and detergent's major action is to reduce barriers, and increase the solution.
Only water is not effective in skin cleaning as the oil and proteins, which are parts of organic soil, are not easily solved in water.
The proper water flow only helps clean up.
Solid soap, due to a reusable feature, may keep bacteria from previous works.
A few studies that have looked at bacteria transmission from the solid soap has reached the result that this delivery is very low as bacteria is cleansed with soap foam.
CDC still says ′′ The use of soap is better to use a clean soap to control a hand contact by many people ".
Anti-germ soap has been promoted at a large level among the people of knowledge about health.
Still, there is no evidence that anti-biotic or non-anti-medicines suggestions used in nature are better for antibiotics-resistance organism.
But, anti-germ soap has common anti-germ materials like triclosson, which has a wide list of resistance types against organism.
So if the antibiotic resistant types of anti-germ soaps aren't better, they may not be as effective as they are marketed.
Surfactant and skin protective material, as a pH regulator, anti-microbe active benzwic acid and other skin conditions (Elo Vera, vitamins, mintol, plant extraction) may have acid acid acid acid (acetic acid, scrubic acid, lactic acid). Public Health University of Oregon School has a great analysis that prevent diseases and remove bacteria from hands. Simple soap is as effective as the anti-bacteria soap that has a triclosson.
The hot water that's suitable for washing hands isn't hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria boosts the temperature of the body (37 37).
But in removing natural food that has soil and bacteria, hot soap water is more effective than men's soap water.
Unlike popular beliefs, science research has shown that using hot water has no effect in reducing microbial pressure on hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a hand cleaning material without water.
In the last 21 years and at the start of 1990th century, as a hand-free cleaning material (with alcohol with hands, hand-solving antiseptic, or hand-hand-snapper. The name is also known (found fame).
Most are related to superprople alcohol or ethanol mixed with thick materials in gel such as carboomer (acrylic acid polymer), or hemocent such as glycerin in liquid, or foam to make easy use and alcohol drying effects. To reduce.
Hydrogen pyroxide thick liquid will increase the anti-microbe activity. Hands snatchers that have at least 60 to 95 % alcohol are effective in killing germs.
Alcohol Snatcher Bacteria, Penza and Hypatics Resistant Bacteria (MRSA and VRE), Narcasm, and some viruses (including HIV, Herps, RSV, Renovirus, Vaccinia, Flu and Hipaties) and Fengasi.
Alcohol Sinetizer that has 3.5 % alcohol on hands 30 seconds after bacteria 35 % (99.97 lag reduction, 70 dc bill) kills and on hands 1 minutes after hitting the bacteria kills from 99.99 % to 99.999 % (from 5 to 4 lag). Hands snatchers are very effective against bacteria and a little effective against some viruses.
Hand Alcohol Sinetizer is totally ineffective against Norvirus (or Norwok). You should be hit on your hands enough antipatics or alcohol to put both hands down or down.
On the face and back of the hands and in between all the fingers and to the end, the sanctizer should be put for around 30 seconds to dry liquid, foam or gel.
You should also have the heads of your fingers, and show it to both of them. The U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Center recommends hands-on-hand sanctuary, especially when hands are too fast.
Most of these materials are related to rapid killing activity against micro organisations, but they shouldn't take place for a proper hand washing but if there's no soap and water.
Using a hand alcohol sanctizer bar can cause skin drying without having a skin soft or moisturizer formula.
Alcohol skin drying effects can be reduced or eradicated by adding glycerine and / or other soft materials in the formula.
In Clinical tests, hand-alcohol synthesisers that have soft materials can cause a less dry skin than soap or anti-microbe detergent.
The allergies of contact with Dermitates, the contact of Utcaria Syndrome or severe alcohol allergies or hands-on-hand-to-do.
Low tendency for a stretchful motivation with Dermatites is more attention than to soap and water with hands.
In addition to their effectiveness, doesn't clean organic materials from hands without water, but simply anti infection.
That's why the hand sanitizer isn't as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pitogens, because pitogens still stay on hands.
The effect of clean hand sanitizers from alcohol is very dependent on components and structure, and less than the alcohol on the hands.
Recently, the formulas that Benzalconim Cloride uses have shown that, contrary to alcohol, durable and more operating anti-microbe after use, and reduced effect after repeated use, which may be continuous on the skin. It is due to negative reactions.
Many people can't buy soap in low-Eid communities and instead use soil or soil.
Erie or soil may be more effective without water but may be less effective than soap.
A worry is that if soil or Erie is sinked with microorganism, it might increase it instead of reducing the spread of the disease.
Like soap, Erie is also an anti-infectious material because it is made of a alkali solution from them.
The International Health Organization has suggested aero or sand as a soap replacement when there is no soap.
The right technique offered by the U.S. Center to prevent transmission of disease has the following steps:
Put your hands with hot or cold water.
Running water is recommended because the water in the bowl may be dumb, while water heat doesn't make any difference.
Give your hands to your hands with coffee size and soap to your hands including the fingers and nails.
Soap removes microbes from the skin, and research shows people want to wash their hands more well when they have soap instead of washing hands with water.
Show it for at least 20 seconds.
Motivation creates friction, which helps remove microbes from the skin, and removes more microbes for a long time.
Get better under the running water.
Can be re-put in the bowl with the hands of the bowl.
Dry your hands with clean laspock or hold it to the air drying machine.
Low and wet hands can easily be re-put. The most common residual spots of hand are the biggest finger, blonde, spots between fingers and finger nails.
Artificial nails and nail polish may equip micro organism.
A moisture lotion is often recommended to keep your hands from drying, dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of transmission of disease.
In growing countries, where there is no pipe water and / or soap, there are many low-cost options to make hands easy, for example, water from a spilled pumpkin or pumpkin that Have a suitable hole and / or use aero if needed. In such conditions where water rings are limited (such as school or rural areas in growing countries), there is again water protection solution, such as ′′ Tipi Tapes or Drops ′′ and other low cost options.
Tippy-tap is a simple type of technologies that have been made with a stretch, and the moving wood on the hands of the foot is a small amount of water and soap is also available.
Effectively drying hands is a necessary part of the hand-keeping process, but there is some discussion on the most effective type of drying in public toilets.
High level research suggests that paper is more healthy than hand drying machines.
In 2008, a study was done by West Monster University of London, which was financially supported by the paper production industry, to make paper, heat air, hands and hands. More advanced jet air drivers comparison with the suggested level of preservation.
After drying hands with a hot air drive, the total number of bacteria was found up to 194 % on the top of the fingers and up to 254 % in the foam.
Drying hands with jet air drying machine in the head of the thumb, the total number of bacteria in the average of 42 % and 15 % increase in the crop.
After drying hands and drying paper, the total number of bacteria is on average to 76 % up to 77 % in the head and in the foam. Science scientists have also done these exams to find out if there is a possibility of deck between other bathroom users and toilet environment or not.
Jet air dryer, claiming 180 m / s (650 km / h; 400 mph) air speed, has the ability to remove micro organism from hands and unit and probably up to 2 Away to the metro toilet users and toilet environment.
The heat air drying machine spreads micro organism from the machine to 0.25 metres.
No special spread of micro organisations in paper. In 2005, in a study done by 2005 Produkt und Umwelt, different hand drying methods have been evaluated.
The following changes were seen in the number of bacteria after drying hands:
There are many manufacturers of hand drying machine, and is comparable with a hand drying machine in hand.
Using hand-cleaning tires for a hand-cleaning is an alternative to traveling during the absence of soap and water.
A hand alcohol snatcher should have at least 60 % alcohol.
Medical hands were needed after Ignaz Semelois found the effect of hand washing in the hospital environment of Hungary (in 1846).
There are electrical tools that remind hospital staff to hold your hands when they forget them.
Found a research that has been reduced by using them.
The method of medical hand is for at least 15 seconds, and enough soap, water or gel should be used to be smiled and all parts of the hands should be filled.
Hands should be held by putting both hands in each other's fingers.
If there is a good thing under the finger nails, it must be used to remove the brush.
As microbes may stay on hands in the water, it's important that hands are cleaned and dry clean with the crooked.
After drying, paper tissue should be used to shut down water (and if needed then the door of leaving can also be opened with paper).
This prevents hands from those places.
The aim of hand-washing at the Health Care Center is to eliminate and prevent shipping from pitogenic micro-organisations (′′ microbes ′′).
New England Medical Journal provides that in many medical environments the level of unacceptable hands in many medical environments, which many doctors and nurses constantly forget their hands before contact with patients, and so on. Sending microbes.
A research has shown that hand washing and other simple method can reduce blood flow disease 66 %. The International Health Organization has published a page that shows the standard ways of hand-and-hand-handing and hand-handing in health care sector.
The design of the hands-on guide by this organization has also been published on its website for public views.
This related review was done by Whitby (Whitby) and his colleagues.
Commercial Tools can measure and confirm hand-preservation, if the regulations need to be proved to be obeyed.
According to the International Health Organization, the hands should be held in the following ′′ five situations
After contact with blood / body fluids
Before doing anti-infectious work, and
After a patient treatment. Adding anti-chemicals in soap (′′ medical ′′ or ′′ anti-microbe ′′ soap) gives the strength to kill the material of hand-washing.
This type of microbial killing may be required before surgery or medical centers where the antibiotic resistance organisations are very likely to spread. In order to surgical surgery it's necessary to clean someone's hands there's a pipe that can't run and shut down without touching hands, some chloroxidine or aidine should also be available, along with the hands after the pipe. Healthy tool for drying, healthy brush to clean your finger nails.
All neighbors should be removed.
In this way, hands should be wasted from 2-6 minutes to 2-6 minutes.
Hands hold for a long time (10 minutes) is not inevitable.
When you put water, you should prevent water from going toward your hands while putting water.
After the work of hand washing is done, hands need to dry with a healthy piece, and surgical clothes should be worn.
To reduce the spread of microbes, it's better to remove your hands or use the sick person's treatment and after hand infectious material.
In hospitals, a stefilococal disease has been found to control the biggest benefit of hand washing has come from the first 35 % of the first % of the % of the 35 % of the 35 % of the 35 % of the 35th of the 35th of the 35th of the 35th of the 35th of the 35th of the 35th of the 35th of the 35th of Increased than
Wash hands with simple soap causes three more transmission of bacteria saree diseases than to wash microbe soap. Average 26 seconds to put alcohol on hands for 30 seconds and showed hand-washing with anti-microbe soap that 26 % more microbes than microbe soaps. Give me a break.
But soap and water are more effective than hand washing alcohol to reduce H1N1 flu A virus and cholesteradium deficiency springs. Healthcare centers can be given education on hand-preservation reforming ways to give employees education on hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-handed materials increase, and write and verbal reminiscent to staff.
A lot of research needs which ways of health care are very effective in different centers.
In growing countries, soap-washing hands with soap has been identified as a low cost and necessary tool for good health and even good nutrition.
In any case, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand-washing possibilities in people's homes, schools, and work places is the cause of the challenge to become a global habit.
For example, in many rural areas of Africa, there are very low hands-on pipes near personal or public toilets, while there are cheap options for building hand-washing places.
In any case, the low level of hand-washing can be the result of a bad habit of being made than soap or water.
Promoting and supporting soap can affect policy decisions, raise awareness about hand-washing benefits, and cause people's long-term habit of changing.
In order to prove effective, supervision and evaluation is necessary.
70 research systematic reviews have found that the habit of handling in LMICs is effective on community-based attitude, while social marketing campaigns are slightly effective. A ′′ three star attitude ′′ in schools is a model by UNICEF ′′ that encourages school to take simple and cheap steps to make sure that students get their hands on soap between other healthy demands.
When minimum standards are achieved, school can finally climb three stars from one star.
Creating hands-on spots can be part of hand-washing campaigns done to reduce disease and child death levels.
The International Day of Hands-Wash Awareness Raising Campaign is another example that tries to achieve the goal of habit change. As a result of 2019-20 coronavirus spread, UNICEF has promoted to choose a hand-washing emoji.
A few research on growing countries has considered the general impact of hand-washing cost on DALYs preventing the DALYs.
Though, it's been recommended in a review that the soap is much cheaper than water and health care and other ways.

SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV, which created SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may be published by evening s' sings and create the same symptoms through the same mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has less intensity and death than SARS but more spreading and affects more men than young people and women.
Responding to the dirty number of programs in the disease, this article tries to provide time and complete reviews of the rapidly growing research subject.
We will cover the basics on disease prevention, ecology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, advance blood, and disease prevention.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope this review will help to understand and eliminate the disease of the disorder.
The 2020th of January 25 Spring Festival has been an unforgettable and unforgettable memory for all the holidays and more weekends to stay inside.
Coronavirus (CoV) is a very homogus that caused severe respiratory synrome (SARS) in 2003; so, it's by the World Health Organization (WHO) February 11, 2020 Named SARS-CoV-2, and related disease is named as CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
This disease has started in Wuhan city of China and has been spread quickly across the country and around 50 other countries worldwide.
From March 2020 to March 2, the virus created more than 80,000 confirmed cases, more than 40,000 patients left and more than 3,000 patients died. A little bit.
WHO warns COVID-19 is a ′′ 1 degree enemy ′′ and is probably more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed), more than 200 articles about COVID-19 have been published including its pedemology, ecology, diagnosis, and treatment. The first report on January 7, 2020, has been set for a virus that has been infected with many patients.
This review is trying to summarize research development in the new and growing subject area.
Whenever possible, we'll compare SARS and another Covid-2012 to compare covid-19 with a SARS and another CoV disease, middle eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS, published in 2012).
We will discuss this on the prevention and diagnosis and some of the remaining urgent questions that we have learned so far.
CoVs have been identified to humans as non-fatal illnesses, which usually causes 15 % normal 4
In any case, in this century, we've been faced twice with the high-rising human CoVs, for example, SARS - CoV and MERS-CoV, which is actually in the first top 2003 in China and then. In 2012, the spread in Saudi Arabia has caused and soon the disease and death has been spread to many other countries with fear.
This is why, current COVID-19 is the third wide event in the history of human / human beings.
As shown in 1,1 forms, the chest hug cluster that had an unknown source first reported to the China National Health Commission from Wuhan on December 31, 2019
Oh (7) days later the CoV sequence was released.
The first murder case was reported in Wuhan city on January 15, 2020
At the same time, this disease has been spread quickly to neighbors, provinces and countries.
In January 20, Healthcare providers reported, suggesting that it was possible to transfer from human to human.
On January 23, Wuhan city was closed with the lockdown of the entire public transportation.
In January 24, the first clinic study on disease reported that, out of 21 confirmed patients, only 41 of which had contacted the wuhan sea food market directly from the unidentified surveillance of the source of the unidentified. Disease started is considered the area.
On January 30, WHO announced that this is a international health emergency.
During this report, this disease was already spread in China and spread to around 50 other countries. (Shape) (Shape 2) 2).
As the situation develops rapidly, the last circle of development and intensity will be further determined.
In February 11, 2020, a few centers have presented a new update on 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients including 8,866 patients (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ULBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
In SARS-CoV-2 people of any age have been suffering, but most of 30-65 years.
Around 47.7 % of suffering people were more than 50 years old, very less than 10 years, and only 14 in sick people over 20 years. He was short of life.
SARS-CoV-2 has suffered more (0.27/100,000) men (0.31/100.000) than women.
CoVID-19 was originally published in Hobby and around clusters.
COVID-2-9 caught an average of 5 (19) days from start to diagnosis.
The average duration of Kaktia was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from beginning to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The first reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (% 95 CI: 3.51-4.05), and the regulated R0 was 2.23-4.82
The number of people who have been suffering has increased in an extraordinary way before January 23, comparing a big delivery time before the spring festival in China.
The death of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44 (% 95 CI: 1.10-1.86) and the death of all patients was 3.06 % (% 59.: CI 95 % 4-02.2
Three risk factors for COVID-19 are sex (men), age (۔ 60), and severe chest hugs.
CoVs are the sub-family of large and covered viruses that have a single RNA.
They can be distributed in four types, such as Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta, from which Alpha-and Beta-CoVs are identified as human beings.
In order for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV converting these room resippers angiotensin enzyme 4 (ACE2) and deptidale peptides 2 (DPP4), and then the jihale. Fusion is happening.
The RNA genome virus has been published in cytoplasm; after the reaction of virus genome, the genomics RNA create a viral scooter with lfafo glacoprotins and nucleocapsyd proteins, which then stops to release the virus with plasma membrane.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 reported on January 10, 2020
SARS-CoV-99.98 has been found as a new type of Beta CoV that has more than 10 % born in the expanding area of the expanding area of the air..
SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV than MAR-CoV.
via Transporting Ballicteron Microscopy, SARS - CoV-2 particles found in human air opethelium altratine parts.
Human ACE2 found was a buyer for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
Anyways, the protein is more weak than SARS-CoV-2 S Protein is tied to human ACE2, which is compatible with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV-2 In patients cause a little severe intensity.
SARS-CoV-2 can also create a short protein that is spread by orf3b and orf8 out.
The SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in viral translation capability and choose the case of.; anyway, orf8 has no identified active domain or shape.
In February 18, 2020, Zho, ETL, with Amino Acid Transporter B0AT1 reported a full-long human-length structure ACE2 in the contract.
They found that the patch, which has open and closed conditions, collected as a demer and mixed ACE2-B0AT1 can tie two S proteins, which offers evidence to identify and suffer from CoV.
B0AT1 may be the target of treatment for a pharmaceutical test to bury SARS-CoV-2 Antan.
Source and middle host
It has been known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have taken source from the evening's springs and have been sent to humans through cats and tears.
By comparing SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, the evening was the main host of SARS-CoV-96 as the new virus % 2 is the same as two SARS. Identified as-SL-CoVZX45. bat - SL-CoVZX21
In any case, what the middle host has helped the virus to eliminate the type of obstacles to the disease of humans, and the way of shipping is not clear.
G, ETL, Maran has offered humans as a virus supplicator from the evening S Protein
According to a research, China's researchers in Guangzo suggested that Pengolins - long mouth-mouth-eater, muddle-eater t-t-eaters often used in traditional Chinese medicines - SARS-CoV-2 potential intermediate hosts that The 99 % birth homology based on CoV found in Penglins and SARS-CoV-2
In any case, the 1 % difference in two genes is still a big difference; so, looking forward to the results of real and true evidence (shape). (Shape. 33 33
SARS-CoV-2 Physical Chemical Features are not yet widely identified.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can live in Vitro for 48 hours and up to 5 days up to 20 40 and % 50 -% 50 humidity can remain below.
SARS-CoV-2 may have the same features.
Reported that SARS-CoV-75 is sensitive to 2 56 for 30 minutes, Ethanol, Chlorine, Anti-infectious, Parsetic acid., chloroform and other cool solutions, but chloroxidine can't effectively disable this virus.
All human beings are usually not exempt for SARS-CoV-2 and so are sensitive to this unknown virus.
Now, no detailed research has been reported on an exemption response to SARS-CoV-2
In this way, we can only refer to other former CoVs studies, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (format). (Shape 4) 4).
Generally, after the virus attack hosts, first it's identified by the host domestic exemption system (PRRs), including C-type lactine, all types of TLR buyer. (NOD) like buyer (NLR), and - (RLR).
From different ways, virus infinity factors, completing dendriotic chambers, and the combination of I type interventions (IFNs) that restricts the spread of the virus and makes the virus antagonists microfagocitus.
In any case, SARS-CoV N protein can help with the virus from exemption reactions.
Soon, an exemptable response will join in the fight with the virus.
Including T4 Lymphasites play an important role in defending CD4 + and CD8 + T chambers.
The CD4 + T chambers are encouraging B room to produce a special antibody of virus, and kills the CD8 + T chambers directly.
The T-assisted room produces Parvin Flazmery Saitkins to help defender chambers.
In any case, CoV can prevent T stones activists by encouraging T chambers opotus
Neurological exemption like C3a and C5a and Anti-Buddies are also necessary against Virus Antan.
For example, a healthy sick Anti-Buddy's place in MERS-CoV.
Another, working a lot of exemption system creates great radicals that can hurt other organs, and in very bad condition, can cause many failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 Disease, started with a cluster set, more likely to affect old people, pregnant women.
It's normal that for people who have a large number of viruses or their exemption acts have more chance to suffer than others.
SARS-CoV-425 has been 1 days, many of which are based on the first 3-7 case study in Wuhan.
In any case, a study on 1,099 cases shows that the period of contraction was 3 days and was from 0 to 24 days.
A recent study, as explained above, shows that the period of 8,866 cases was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on demography.
It's very important for health officials to arrange an effective quarantine time based on the effective rule time, so prevent virus transmission to others from suffering but unimpered people.
As a common action, people have faced or suffered from this disease, usually need to be quarantine for 14 days.
Does the quarantine period have to go to 24 days?
Fever is often a large and primary sign of COVID-19, which with no signs or other signs such as dry coughs, breath short, members / muscle pain, headache, columns, scandal, chest pain. Diarrhea, dirty / congregation can be with.
Some patients experienced dyspnea and / or hypoxemia after a week.
In difficult cases, patients have developed quickly with acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acid, and cogolopiti.
Symptoms and / or respiratory symptoms and severe fever patients, even without unusual pictions, must be tested for the virus for first diagnosis.
Recently 98 December 2019 a demographic study shows a percentage of symptoms for fever 3 %, for dry jokes 76 % for white 55 %, and 3 % for a ness session. Wah. 8 % of patients need freedom air.
The same findings have been reported in two recent studies of family cluster and cluster caused by transmission from a non muscle disease.
Relatively, in 2012 Demographic study shows that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (% 98), dry cough (% 47), and dispense (% 55) were their main signs.
In any case, this 80 % needs air-taking support, more than COVID-19 patients and matches MERS higher killings than COVID-19
Diarrhea (% 26) and colonic pain (% 21) also met with MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it's shown that fever (% 99 -% 100), dry cough (% 29 -% 75), dispense (% 40 -% 42), Sitting (% 20-25), and colonic pain (% 20.)-14) were large signs and fresh weather was needed for patients.
February 14, the COVID-19 death was 2 % when the confirmed case reached 66,576 global level.
Relatively, the death of SARS in November 2002 was 10 % confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on demographic study on June 2012, death was 37 % confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that the SARS-CoV-5.71-7.23 R0 was higher than 95 to 6.47 % 2 break (CI), while the SARS-CoV R0 only Was from 2 to 4
Compare SARS-CoV and SARA-CoV with their signs, death, and R0 on table 1.1
The top numbers suggest SARS-CoV-2 has a higher ability to publish than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it's less deadly than the last two.
In this way, the control of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is more challenging than SARS-CoV-2
The start of Clustard often happens in the same family or the same gathering or car like cruise boat.
Patients often have contact with travelling or residence history in wuhan or other influential areas or with sick people or patients two weeks before.
However, it has been reported that people can send a virus for more than weeks without symptoms and patients left hospitals can transmit this virus again, which has sent a call to increase quarantine time.
Patients have a normal or low number of white booths in the first stage (especially lemophits).
For example, the number of blood white chambers.
In the blood of the patients, the level of zagger / muscle enzymes and Miglobin has increased, and the C-reaction protein and eritroseite destruction has increased in the blood of many patients.
In patients facing hard cases, the level of D-dimer, which is the product of fibrine destruction in blood, has increased, and the number of lymphatic has gradually reduced.
The unusual in the chest radio found in many COVID-19 patients and have been vague by a two-sided twisted shade or a vague earth's glass.
Patients often create a nervous chest hug, severe cold tap, and severe respiratory disease (ARDS) syndrome.
When ARDS happens, irregular controlled burning, liquid collecting, and advanced fibrosis damage to gas exchange.
Tape I and Type II samples disorder reduces the level of Surfactant and increases the surface pressure, reduces the capability of the stones and increases the risk of falling.
This is why, bad chest radioography often parallel to the severe limit of disease.
In February 18, 2020, CoVID-19 first contemplation analysis of Cinomites, Hyalin membrane, and Interstetile Lymphasite influence, and several synecytal cabin in a patient's body that died due to disease. Shaw, right with the contemplation. Virus Antan and ARDS and SARS and MERS patients.
Rivers - Transcraft Polymers China's Interaction (RT-PCR) has been used as a great standards for the diagnosis of COVID-19
In any case, due to high errors - negative level, which may cause disease, clinical expressions are used for diagnosis (which no longer rely only on RT-PCR) February 13, 2020 Used in China.
The same condition happened with the SARS diagnosis.
This is why, combining the history of disease, clinical expressions, lab exams, and radioology is necessary for effective diagnosis.
In February 14, 2020, Feng Jong Group explained the CRISPR MISHTE SHERLOCK technique to discover SARS-CoV-10-18, from 20 10-18 2 Mol / L. 200 Artificial SARS-CoV-2 RNA Discover pieces.-18 10-100 Mol / L (10-18 copies per microletter) use deputies in less than an hour without a detailed tool needed.
Hope, new technique can dramaticly promote allergies and ease if approved in clinical models.
Due to no experience with anonymous CoV, therapists can provide support for COVID-19 patients while trying different treatments already used or recommended for other CoVs treatment. Be such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral disease (table 2 2 2).
In these treatments, Anti-Wirel medicines, amionospresents, sterides, plasma, Chinese medicines, and mental support includes current and potential treatment.
Even a plasma has been recommended to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical manufacturers are promoting Anti Body and vaccines against virus.
SARS-CoV-2 strikes on the first head and may attack, less to a degree, other members that express ACE2, such as stomach system and Pashtoons.
In any case, respiratory illness and failure is a great cause of death.
In this way, respiratory support is important to reduce signs and save lives and relates to general oxygen treatment, high flow oxygen, flawless ventilation, and intensity of disease.
Patients with severe respiratory signs should be helped with Extrapurville Jal Oxygen (ECMO), used for life's dumb heart and breath treatment is a heart stabilization technique.
In addition to curtains, electrical balance protection, secondary antanatos and septic shock preventing and treatment, and protecting life organisation functions are also necessary for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It's been known that the SARS and MERS storm has a result of more activity in SARS and MERS patients.
Cycoin storm is a part of the systematic infinity reaction including 1, IL-1 1, IL-2, IL-1, 1, 1, 1, 1, AND MCP-6 Published by.
These Saitkins defender chambers are encouraging to release many free radicals that are the big cause of ARDS and organ failure.
Exemption is necessary in the treatment of Sitcoin storms, especially in severe patients.
Curtie Costroids and Tusilazumab, an anti-body anti-Anti-body used to treat Sitcoin Storm.
The T-flood guide for more exemption treatment includes modification of exemption by T-flood; IFN-the, IL-4, and TNF preventing; JAK Prevention; blinatumomab; Sitotine signalog 1 and the HDAC Preventors.
SARS, as an exemption force, used widely in SARS treatment to reduce burning damage.
In any case, the sterides in higher doses were not useful for severe wounds in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they may cause serious sided effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, dramaticly affecting Progenes.
In any case, short courses are recommended to use COVID-19 carefully for serious patients.
Until the time of writing, no effective treatment of Anti Verwal has been confirmed.
In any case, the veins administration with Remedysaware is a Newclotide's Inlog, found to be influenced with COVID-19 in an American patient.
Remidswire is a Nawal Anti-Wirel medicine created by Gilad for treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlberg viruses.
Later, again the reminisce of other units suffering from RNA viruses including MERS and SARS viruses.
According to this, Gilad has prepared the center for China to perform this pair of tests on SARS-CoV-2 patients, and the results are very much presented.
Furthermore, baristenab, interron., lupinavir / retonavir and rebavirne have been offered as possible treatment for severe respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, inflammation, kangi, liquor damage, and other negative interactions can happen after a joint treatment with Lupinavir / Retonveer.
The interaction of these medicines used for patients should be precisely considered.
Plasma for getting patients and anti-body making
Blood from patients raised from sari disease to treat other patients or have a long history of protecting health disease.
In fact, the healthy patients often have a fairly high level of Anti-Buddies in their blood.
Anti-Buddies are a relief force that is created to fight disease and other foreign things and recognize special financials in this kind of disease and directly ineffects.
Based on this, plasma collected from the blood of a group of patients who have been healed from COVID-10 and injected in 19 serious patients.
Their marks have grown in 24 hours, burning and virus pressure and growing oxygen center in blood.
In any case, confirmation and explanation is necessary before the specific treatment is not yet created.
Further, considering medical effects, some damage to plasma should be taken care of precisely.
For example, Anti Buddies can boost an exemption reaction and cause a Sitcoin release syndum, which is likely a life venom.
Anti-Buddy's concentration in blood is usually low, and plasma demand is great to treat serious patients.
The production of special Anti-Buddies is very difficult to fight against international disease.
In this way, it's very serious and practical to recognize the effective antibods or examination or genetic codes from the patient's chambers and the virus's essential proteins.
In this way, we can easily measure the production of Anti-Buddies.
TCM has been used to treat a series of diseases in China for thousands of years.
Although, this effect rely on the combination of many parts in the formula that relies on the diagnosis based on TCM theories.
Most effective parts remain unknown or vague as it is difficult to extract and confirm the same components or their best components.
Currently, due to a lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM is a great alternative to moderation from light signs for patients or for those who have returned from difficult stages.
For example, Shin Feng Zhi Du Capsule and Lian Ho King Wayne Capsule found effective for COVID-19 treatment.
Best treatment rates in COVID-50 patients have been given in several levels of China that TCM uses in their 87 % patients, including Gansu (% 63.7), Ningia (% 19), And Hanan (% 50), while Hobby is the province, which used TCM only in this COVID-13 patients (% 19).
However, it's a bit of comparison as many other effects such as the number of patients and intensity should be included in the currency.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Jong and colleagues published a study to compare the treatment of WM and TCM joint treatment (WM) only.
They found out that the necessary times to restore body temperature, marks, and bed in the hospital were just short than the WM + TCM group
Very effective, the signal worse level (serious from light) was a attention low for the WM + TCM group for only WM group (% 46.2 than 7.4 %) and death only than WM WM + TCM was low in the group. Group (% 39 than 8.8 %).
Thus, TCM effectiveness and safety are still waiting for better controlled trials in large scale and other centers.
It will be careful to determine the action mechanism and determine the effective parts of TCM treatment or if possible to determine their compositions.
Suspicious or confirmed COVID-19 patients often experience a great fear of very sari and even deadly disease, and the quarantine people also experience tiredness, loneliness, pain and anger.
In addition to the curtains, signs of disease such as fever, hypocia, and cotton and bad treatment effects such as cartecosters can cause a lot of anxiety and spiritual affliction.
In the first round of SARS disease, a series of mental illnesses in which constant depressions, anxiety, fear attacks, mental illness, psychological symptoms, heart-heart-heart-heart-heart-heart-heart-heart-heart-heart-heart-heart-and even suicide-killing were reported.
A part of the public health reactions on COVID-19 disease, people can worry more about the disease, quarantine, and infamous effects in family and friends.
In this way, spiritual health care should be prepared for COVID-19 patients, suspicious persons, and them in contact with people as well as common people that are necessary.
Spiritual support must create multi-sided spiritual health teams, close contact with regular and accurate updates on SARS-CoV-2 disease and treatment plans and using professional electrical tools and applications. Included to prevent.
Effective vaccines are necessary to interfere with the transmission series from the observant and suffering human beings and are often completing Anti-viral treatment in control of viruses.
Efforts have started to create S protein vaccines to produce a long-term and strong non-united antibodies and / or protective exemption against SARS-CoV.
Live nutrition vaccinations for SARS have been evaluated.
In any case, the effect of these vaccine candidates and zonotic virus infections were determined before clinical study started.
This may be because SARS was gone 17 years ago and no new case came up after that.
In contrast, MERS types of cases and clusters happen in the middle east and spread to other areas that continue zonotic resources in unusual areas.
Vaccinating strategy has been created for Mers using inactive virus, DNA plasmides, virus vitracons, nano particles, viruses and re-productive protein subunits and some of them have been evaluated in supervisor models.
The SARS-CoV-2 is urgent and serious job to control a safe and effective vaccine development for unexpected persons.
In any case, it's a challenge to remove problems as it takes a long time for vaccine development and coVs moving changes (on average 18 months).
As an anonymous disease, COVID-19 just started its full clinical course over thousands of patients.
In many cases, patients can gradually heal without taste.
In any case, same with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 also relates to high disease and deaths in serious diseases.
Thus, creating a diagnostic model for disease is necessary for health care agencies to prioritize their services, especially in limited resource areas.
Based on reported clinical studies, the following factors may relate or affect the diagnosis of COVID-33 patients (table 19):
Age: Age was the most important factor for SARS diagnosis, which is also important for COVID-19.
CoVID-50 generally created in 30-65 years that 47.7 % of those patients who are aged 8,866 in study of cases.
Patients who need deep care had more potential mess and disorders and were more old than those who weren't in the middle age of 51 years, who are old. CoVID-19 patients offer as a prosthetic factor for the results of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: more men than women (100,000 than 0.27), as described above.
Mix and disorders: CoVID-19 patients in need of deep care are more likely to have severe heart disease and eritemia.
Heart incident was also the main cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also be tied to ACE2 - Positive Chulangiosite, which may cause the loss of blood / lodge in COVID-19 patients.
It's a reminder that age and original disease are strongly related and may interfere with each other.
Unusual lab findings: C-reaction protein (CRP) in blood reflects the intensity of burning or tissue wounds and has been suggested for disease, treatment, and final recovery.
CRV level connection is also recommended with the intensity and diagnosis of COVID-19
Furthermore, high-high Litite D Hydrogenes (LDH), Sportit Aminutransfires (AST), Alanin Aminotransfires (ALT), and Kristin Kaines (CK) may also help in the results.
These enzymes are shown widely in organisations, especially in the heart and blood / tissue, and are released during tissue damage.
So, it's a custom sign to deactivate a heart or a nigger.
Great Clinical Signs: The short-term development of chest radio and clinical signs should be considered together with other issues for the results and complexity of COVID-19
Using sterides: As described above, sterides are a disease that is used as a treatment for sari diseases to reduce the intensity of burning damage.
Since the high size of corticosteroids are widely used in severe SARS patients, many rescuers have faced isocular osteconocis during life.
Thus, if needed, Striades should be used in low food and for short time of COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As mentioned above, many patients have faced unusual stress during the COVID-19 disease because they often have suffered a long-term unrecondent and close family members and friends. Death is a witness.
It's necessary to provide mental advice and long-term support to help these patients return to healthy and normal life from stress.
As far as Demographic Studies, COVID-19 shows that there are different epidemology signs from SARS.
In addition to moving in low breath, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively react in the upper respiratory flow and create moderate or signs in the first stage of suffering, same with other CoVs That is the cause of normal pain.
This is why, in the first round or in ancubation period, patients can create a large amount of virus during daily activities, which causes a big problem to control the disease.
Anyways, SARS-CoV transmission happens when patients are extremely sick, while many transfers didn't happen in the first round.
In this way, the current COVID-19 spreading is more difficult and controlling than SARS spreading.
At this time, there are great efforts in the way to put a barrier in the way of SARS-CoV-2, including SARS-CoV-2, including the delivery of SARS-CoV-2
Although these actions are dramatic to harm the country's economy and other sectors, the number of new patients are reduced, it shows the disease's dirty.
The most delightful idea is that BBA will end in March and the down stage will continue for 3-4 months.
But still, no more workers are so good.
Paul Hunter, ETL, has guessed COVID-2020, which looks more suffering than SARS, won't end in 19
Ira Langini, and more, has created a sample for the results of the disease and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 can cause 2rd part of the people to suffer disease.
Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 found in medium turbine and both colonial flow that got healed 2 weeks ago and left hospital, indicating that newly identified. Virus can be a cycling event like the flu.
In any case, committed signs have occurred based on the number of new cases in China, which indicates the current strategy may work.
Ebola was actually suggested that he would create a million cases with half a million deaths.
In any case, through severe quarantine and separation, the disease has finally been controlled.
It's possible, like SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 may weaken in suffering and eventually die or remain shared with human a little pain virus.
Compare Covid-19 disease with SVS and Mers. (shape). 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is shipping through cough or rice / cooling, and may be in direct contact with the virus-mastered materials.
Virus has also been found in human defence, which raises the new possibility of transmission through mouth.
A recent study on 138 cases reported that 41 % of the cases caused due to non-surreal diseases, including 17 other patients who provide other previous diseases and 40 health care. It is included in it.
In this way, human beings should be protected, especially health care providers, social staff, family members, colleagues, and even sick or suffering people.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of disease is through wearing face mask; both using surgical mask and N95 respiratory mask (series #1860 s) helps control virus spreading.
Surgical facial mask prevents a potential disease member of liquid drops from traveling through air or entering to material levels, where it can be delivered to others.
Anyways, only N95 (series #5 s) mask can protect from 10 to 80 am to 1860 am small viruses, only 5 % viruses can fully enter; SARS-CoV-2 is the same size SARS-CoV and both are around 85 nm.
As particles can enter even five surgical masks together, health care providers should wear N95 (series #1860 s) mask but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers must wear fit in clothes to reduce contact with viruses.
Virus can also make someone sick through the eyes.
In January 22, 2020, a doctor suffered SARS-CoV-2 although he is wearing a N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his burnt eyes.
In this way, health care providers should also wear clear face cover or glasses while working with patients.
For the common people in effective or potential effective areas, it is suggested that everyone is with pest soap more than usual, try to stay inside the house for self-care and limited relationship with potential patients. Do it.
Three steps / step away from sick is called a proper distance for people.
These actions are effective methods that reduce the risk of suffering and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-7 has come to the human world as a new virus, SARS-CoV to its great homology as reported on January 2, 2020 must high China. Alert cause of SARS release in 2003 has been created by her deep memory.
In any case, the head of disease control in Wuhan city from January 2020 to January 2020, assures cities that are low and limited fit to human being and it is to prevent and control the disease. There is no problem for it.
This message reduced people's anxiety, especially when the whole country is getting ready for spring celebration, and lost the important time to avoid this disease at least in wuhan.
Disease Control Administration in China may study this hard and create important reforms in the future.
As an example, this administration should be (1) very careful while making public advertisements as every word is worth people and can change their attitude and decision; (2) official reports of doctors or officials. More sensitive and reactive to unusual information instead of waiting for clinics; (3) more restrictions to having a potential disease instead of giving people comfort. And (4) many times to increase people's awareness and effective homework and examines and corrects the community reaction system.
COVID-2019 Disease has been created due to an unidentified virus SARS-CoV-2 that started at the end of December 19
In less than two months, during this writing, this disease has been spread in China and around 50 other countries around the world.
As the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the signs are the same between COVID-19 and SARS, then the covid-19 reaching makes the feeling of repeating SARS.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are necessary for disease treatment and treatment.
CoVID-19 more aged people than young people and more influenced men than women, and the level of intensity and death is higher in old people than youth.
SARS has higher death than COVID-10.91. (19 % than 1.44)
COVID-19 patients send virus even when they have signs while SARS patients usually do it when they are severely sick, which is a big problem in the spread of COVID-19 than SARS. It creates it.
This explains a little bit why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading more widespread than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA Assay for SARS-CoV-2 can be negative in COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, medicated patients can be positive for the virus.
This finding dramatically increases the risk of spreading virus.
Considering such a big progress in the research on COVID-19, some important issues are still solved, the types are below:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96 % of Genetic Humulog was found between SARS-CoV-2 and 2 SARS SARS, we still can't reach the result that SARS-CoV-2 is one of the shoppers ۔ ۔ ۔ ۔
Which animal was living in the middle level that sends virus to human from the original host?
Without knowing 1 and 2 answers, we can't effectively drop the shipping, and this incidents can be re-raised at any time.
Although the Malecoller Modelling and Biochemical writings have shown that SARS-CoV-2 ACE2 is tied up, how can the virus enter the airline chambers and then create contemplating changes?
Has the virus also closed the ACE2 showing chambers in other members?
Without clear answers to these questions, we can't get a dirty, precise diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this disease last?
How does this virus grow genetically during the transmission between humans?
Will this be wandering all over the world, die like SARS or rise like a zakam at the same time?
It's necessary but may take time to search for above and many more questions.
Anyways, with whatever cost this can ask, we have no choice but to stop the bubba as soon as possible and bring our life back to normal.
B ' A COVID-2019 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 19
Although the vaccine clinical exams are not completed, a lot of efforts are going on to build such a vaccine.
In February 2020, the International Health Organization said that the organization does not expect to create vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, related or factor virus, in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates in Phase I safety research in April.
Covid-19 was identified in December 2019
Disease spread around the world at a high level in 2020, resulting in significant investments and research activity in making a vaccine.
Many organisations are using a possible vaccine to build a possible vaccine against SARS-CoV-2
As shown in April, the CEPI's innovation necessary work to make a vaccine is the speedy, building capability, information selection measurement, and international access.
Scientists reported in April 2020 that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development to create an effective vaccine against Quid-19
The big goals of the Platform that have been developed in phase I safety research are as below:
Noklick acid (DNA ORNA) (first phase progressor and vaccine candidate: Moderna, MRNA-1273)
Viral Victor (First Phase Progressor and Vaccine Candidate: Cancino Biologyx, Adenovirus Type 5 Victor)
As the CIPI reported by Science Scientists in April, the total of 79 vaccine candidates are in the first stage of development, which 78 have been approved as active projects (115, 79 Milken Institut (and 39 others have been announced but in hand with public information (it is considered under plan or being designed).
Phase I-II exams that take place in the first safety and emunogenicity test, in general random, plastic controller, and in different sites / places, while many minutes and effective fires. / Pharmaceuticals are also the election.
In phase III exams are usually very participating. In these participants, a group of control, includes vaccine test effect to prevent disease, while in the hope of a side effects observer.
In the active development stage of 79 vaccine candidates confirmed by the first April 2020, 74 have not been tested in human currency (still in advance of clinical research).
In Australia around April 24, 2020, Queensland University announced that the University of Malekol's possible vaccine is under research that inheritance makes a change in viral proteins to create an exemption reaction.

On March 10, 2020, Emirgent Biosolation announced that they are with Novacs company.
Vaccine has joined in development and production.
Both partners have planned for the exams before the clinic and announced the clinical examination phase I in July 2020
On March 12, 2020, Indian Ministry of Health announced that they are working separately on 11 microbial signs, and that soon, a vaccine will be made from one to two. Take time around years.
On March 2020, 12, the biotechnology company reported the construction and development of coronavirus particles to support Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
Selected vaccine is a laboratory research as planned in July or August 2020
In the first week, Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump, Kyorwok has paid a lot of access to Quid-19 vaccine, against the German government.
On March 17, 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pefizer announced friendship with MRNA based vaccine.
The MRNA-based vaccine BNT162, which is being examined before the clinic is underway, in April 2020 Clinical exams will start.
In Italy on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotic, an Italian company announced that they will get the test results before the clinic in April 2020 and the last selected vaccine will accept human exams / Start in autumn.
On March 19, 4.9, the BBA Preparation Coalition of 2020 Coalition of Coalition-19 vaccine announced $ 4.9 million for the Research Federation. In this union, the Institute of Pastor, Temis Biosience (Vienna, Austria), and the Petersburg University that brings all CAPI investments to $ 29 million to make vaccine.
More CEPI Investment Partners to build a Covad-19 vaccine are from Moderna, Kyorwok, Inuview, Novaks, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that Scientists have started an animal test of six different electoral vaccines.
Imperial College London Researchers announced on March 20, 2020 that they are creating RNA vaccine for Quad-19
Selected vaccine made from China in 14 days with a series achievement.
In March, the Canadian government of Canada, like Medicago and Saskatchivan Initiative University of Canadian companies and universities, including a number of selected vaccinations against Cavid-19 against Medical Actions. 96 Research Projects 275 Millions of Canadian dollars have announced financial aid.
At the same time, the Canadian government has announced a 19 million Canadian dollars to build a covid-192 vaccine. There are also plans that will be made of different new vaccines ′′ vaccine bank ′′ which will be used by spreading / creating other forms of Coronavirus.
On April 2, 2020, the University of Petersburg reported on the testing of Pittkwok. It's a possible vaccine for the covid-19 in the mouse. The report said, ′′ MNA has presented second-level vaccinations of SARS-CO-2 S19 to encourage special antibody reactions [in muscans] after exemption on 2 Shown up in the weeks."
In Canada on April 2020, 16, the Waterloo University has announced the design of a possible DNA vaccine as a possible dna.
Using Bacterophigis, DNA will be designed to place bacteria inside the human body to produce harmless particles / paratics like virus that can make SARS-KO-2 viruses. Encourages an exemption system to produce Anti Body.
In March 2020, US government, industry, and three universities join the Hollit Paccard Interprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google, including Claude Computing Resurses from IBM to get supercomputers from IBM. Share it.
Some vaccines have the effect of hatrologos, also called unreal impacts / bad impacts.
That means they can have more benefits besides preventing the disease.
For Lanoro random exams / exams in Australia want to hire 4170 health workers.
Vaccine may not be safe and effective while progressing.
Animal models related to Quad-2, such as ACI 19-Transjenic Mock, other labs, and inhuman animal-related animal-2, and the first vaccine impact evaluation research to cover live viruses. 3th of May Biological Safety Measures and Safety Standard Processes Need International Coordination To Ensure.
Vaccine against SARS and MERS has been tested in inhuman or animal models.
Until 2020, no vaccine has been created by SARS treatment or safety yet to prove that it is both safe and effective for humans.
In 2005 and 2006 years, the new vaccines and medicines for the treatment of SRS was a priority for all governments and public health agencies. There is no proven vaccine against MIS.
When MISRS is published, it is believed that research in SRS may provide a useful sample for vaccines and medicines against MISCO.
Until March 2020, DNA based on MISRS only had a vaccine that completed the clinical examination phase I and three more are in progress. All vaccines are virus transmission vaccines, two more are Adenwirel-Victorad or ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac, and one is MVIRS-S-Vaccine.
In social media posts have developed a conspiracy theory claiming that the covid-19 virus has not already been identified and that the vaccine was not already available.
Recorded inventions that have been documented by many social media posts, have given other types of coronavirus, such as SRS Coronavirus, inheritance series and vaccines.
Injutensin change enzyme 2 (ACE2) are such an enzyme that are connected to the exterior surface of the room in the sands, arteries, heart, Pashtoons and Colmo.
ACE2 Reducing Angiotensine II and preventing Angiotensin-Transformation Enzyme (ACE) with the increase of Angiotensin-Transformation (ACE), and with this committed medicine for the treatment of heart disease. ACE2 also works as an entry point for some coronavirus.
The human version of enzyme is often called hACE2.
Angeetensin change enzyme 2 is a type of sink, which has metal enzymes and is in the level of endothyl and other chambers.
ACE2 Protein has N-Terminal Peptides M2 Domain and C Terminal Clinerine Rainell Amino Acid Transfer Domain.
ACE2 is a single passive I type of membrane protein, which has an active enzymek domain, and is being spoken at the level of room in the lodge and other tissues.
ACE2 Exterior Domain has been separated by another enzyme known as shedas, and the latest solution protein is spread in blood flow and finally exterminates through urine or distinction.
ACE2 is available in many organisations: ACE2 is linked to original coaler II in most organisations, small colmo entrosites, arteries and veins endothyl booths and artery air muscles.
ACE2 mRNA format is also found in brain cortex, stretch, high potalamos, and brain stroke.
ACE2 first job is to act as balanced for ACE.
ACE Vigonstrictor Angiotensin II separates in Anguotensin II hormone.
ACE2, on its own turn, carboxyl terminal mino acid phenylanine separates from Angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and in Vasodilater Anguotinsin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Turn it to Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Oh).
ACE2 can separate a few more peptides such as [des-Arg9] - Bradicine, Epilene, Neurotensin, Denverphine A, and Grelyn.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane that is a neutral amino acid transmitter SLC6A19 and has suffered a hartinp disease.
As a transmeren protein, ACE2 works as the main place to enter the chambers for some coronavirus, such as HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (The virus that causes COVID-19).
Especially, the ACE2 Enzyme Domain with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spike protein tying both viruses and enzymes that are in the room can cause endocotis and shipping.
The process of entering this process also needs to provide S protein by the host siren protein TMPRSS2, which is now under investigation as a potential treatment. This has caused some of the incident that reducing ACE2 levels in the chambers may help fight the disease.
In any case, the professional communities and organizers have suggested the standard ACE control and the ARB treatment to continue.
In July 11, 2012, a systematic reviews and meta analysis found that ′′ The use of ACE controllers were related to a 34 % reduction in a risk of modesty than controls."
Furthermore, ′′ The risk of samples has also reduced in patients who have been treated with ACE controllers who were faced with high risk of model, especially those who had brain stroke and heart disease.
The use of ACE controls was also related to reducing the deaths related to model, although the results were less stronger than the general risk of model."
ACE2 Human Combination (rhACE2) is considered as a new treatment for acute wounds and seems to improve pulse hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in the pigs with severe respiratory syndrome with pulse hemodynamics and oxygen saturation.
RhACE2's half-age in humans is around 30 hours and the effect for 24 hours is 10 minutes.
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a hopeful medication for those who don't tolerate classic Renin - Anguotensin system controlers (RAS controllers) or in those diseases where Anguotensin II has increased. RhACE2 injection of rhACE2 for acute respiratory syndrome treatment has been evaluated in clinical exams.
Coronavirus BBA of 2019-20 Coronavirus (2019-CoV) continues, which is spreading due to the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The recognition of this boba was held in China's city in December 2019, and in December 2020, the state's national hopes were put in the country due to international concerns, and March 11, 2020 The date has been turned into a global bubba again.
According to April 10, 1.60 million cases of coronavirus were reported in 210 countries, which caused the death of over 97,000 people.
Around 364,000 people have been healed from sickness.
The death statement in China is 13.04 %, and 4 % around the world in Algieria. 08 % and recorded in Newland.
General signs are fever, dry cough, and tiredness.
Serious disease symptoms from the chest hug, respiratory system different symptoms, and many members of the body that result is weakness or death.
The signs of this disgrace are generally shown in five days but in some stories it takes two to days.
No special vaccine or treatment for the new coronavirus.
The first treatment is the sign of losing a patient and helping him, the prescribed precautions are important, such as washing hands, what to hold a cough, keep distance from each other, and doubt people. Separating yourself is important.
International level officials apply laws like control of travel bans, quarantine, mobility, and risk control at work.
There has been a severe economic and economic mess in the world due to BBA, the end of games, religious, political and cultural incidents and fear has been reduced in the transfer of fears.
Universities and schools have been closed in all 193 countries in the world, because around 99.4 % of students have affected the world.
Online has been shared the wrong information about the virus, and has come against Chinese people, including the eastern and South East Asian generation, and the virus's attention.
Low travel tools and ban of large factory has been reduced in air and carbon expulsion due to the ban of large factory.
On December 31, 2019, the case of unknown autology incident in Hobi province, Wuhan was reported.
More incidents have a link to the hwanan sea food items and it is said to be the original virus zonetics.
The BBA programmer virus has been known as SARS-CoV, the newly found virus is near the same with SARS-CoV, the first person who was suffering on 1 December 2019 This whit cluster market has not been related.
In the first reported incidents in December 2019, two people found in third part who had contact with the market.
In China, March 13, 26, the unconfirmed report on South China's Marning Post News, said that Habi Subi was found on 55 November 17, 2019, on 2020 February 2020, 2020 WH and China reported in the pandemic incidents, but there were increased incidents in Italy, Iran and South Korea. First time China has increased from incidents in China.
Might be very low reporting, especially in events that have small symptoms.
A few incidents reported in youth in February 26, 19 and 60 % of youngsters in the world are 2.4 %, England's big Scientific Mashir Patrick Valance guessed that England should be 60 % of the disease. Be exemption before.
In the number of incidents, the people who have been tested for COVID-19
Until March 3, a country did not test 23 % of its people, it was the most of the countries that we will not test the least signs of the signs of the barter, such as Atali, Neiderland, Spin and Switzerland. ۔ ۔ ۔ ۔
According to a research published on March 86th, it was said that up to 23 % COVID-19 incidents were not found and that's it. Non-Sindh Infinity was a source for 79 % incidents.
The number of people suffering from coronavirus in Italy is higher than that reported on the 30th of March.
The first size of COVID-2.4 base production number is from RO (1.40) to 19
The U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Center is coming in a study that might be 5.7
Most people heal from COVID-19
It's not to be restored to death signs is 6 to 41 days, and it's 14 days for most common people.
Until April 10, 2020, around 97.000 billion deaths have been killed by Quid-19
In China, 5 % of the deaths of 80 % of 75 were among more people than 60, and 75 % of people already had heart and sugar disease, usually ′′ officially COVID-19 BBA gives protocols for a positive test.
It's possible that COVID-19 is really a number of dead people, because it won't include those dead people who have died without test, e.g. homes or nursing homes and other places. Kay
First information from Italy shows the number of deaths due to COVID-4 is 5 x-19
The spokesperson of the United States Disease and Prevention Centers (CDC) has accepted that (number of dead people) has been shown, the report of the Anikdotal has been confirmed in the U.S., such a low value is in the pandemic, such as in 2009 H1N1 Swine flue pandemic in H1N1 Swine The first confirmed dead po wuhan city was on 9th of January 2020
First dead outside China Manland were in Philippines on February 14, and the first dead out of Asia came in France on 14 February.
28 February, dozens of deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On March 13, 40, many countries, regions and Antarctica have been reported in deaths, many general measures have been taken to measure the deaths.
These numbers change with area and time passes, and test volume, health care quality, treatment option, after first incident and characteristics such as age, sex, and general health, proportion to death incident. The selected time in the flow reflects the number of diagnosed incidents.
John Hopkins University's number 2020, 6.0 % death rate in the world until April 10th.
This number is different from the area level.
Death rate in China in 17.3 % of people (which is 1 from 0.7 to 10 January 2020) down to 0.7 % (in which it is 0.7 %) 1 February, 2020 after the signs came). Other steps include the level of deaths (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people dead from disease, and the level of disease incidents (IFR), which shows the percentage of the patient (diagnosed and undiagnosed) people who have been sick. They are dying of illness.
This feeling has no limit of time and especially Abadi is following the solution from infection.
Some scientific foundations have tried to use these figures for special people.
The Oxford University Center has measured the evidence that the disease level is 0.1 % between 0.39 % for the pandemic.
The high size of this Range in Germany is diagnosed with COVID-19, and and a statistical research measure the diagnosis in CFR effective.
The International Health Organization has shown that BBA can be controlled.
The increase of disease and time is unreal and the place is different on the occasion.
Maciej Boni's University of Penn University says that the general type of non-tested infinity disease starts filting and then reducing when the disease passes from the present host.
But it's not possible to offer some kind of clever now when it will be.
China's senior medical advisor zhong Nashan argues that this will end until June, if all countries act on the advice given to prevent the spread of the virus from the international health organization.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of London School of Hygiene & Typical Medicine says SARS-CoV-2 may be one or two years.
Neil Ferguson at Imperial College Study says it should have distance and more caution ′′ until there is no vaccine (in the next 18 months or more) 18
William Shaffner from Winderbelt University said,," I guess it's not possible that this coronavirus - because it's easily overlookable will be completely lost and it's possible to ′′ turn into seasonal illness, To come back every year.
The return of the virus will be related to the limit of exemption and change.
CoVID-19 symptoms are relatively ′′ unsemble and sick people can be without signs.
Two common signs are 88 % fever and 68 % dry.
In a few general symptoms include fatigue, sadness, lack of sense, breath short, muscle and dams pain, pain, headache, cancer disease, cancos, hemoticis, pitches or saiianosi. The International Health Organization says one person gets sick in sixes and has difficulty breathing.
The US has created a list of the disease control and preventive center (CDC) that includes respiratory problems, chest pain or stress, unexpected brain, problems and face or lips. The medical care has been prescribed to having these signs. This sickness can also bring more hard samples, severe respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock and death.
There will be no signs of these sick people and there will be no medical signs, but there will be a disease in the diagnosis. Researchers advise who have been with the sick people near time. They should keep your eyes on them. And research to end the infection.
China is 44 % without disease.
There is 14 days between signs and signs, more than 5 days, in this case what is the case of COVID-15 faced people is 30 % of the sense of 15 % and then 19 % something.
Some explanations about the spread of the disease are still in the stage of identification.
The first disease is living in close relationship with people, because of the weather, drops, open or near people are spreading 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 ft). ۔ ۔ ۔ ۔
Finding shows that the virus can be transferred from 4.5 meters (27 ft) to 8.2 (15) photos.
Some people suggest the virus can also be shipped in the air as it stays in the air for a long time, which doesn't get out while talking, breathing drops also find this breath in time. But when it is talked, the solution virus doesn't find power in the air.
These drops can either sit in the mouth of the nearby people or may go to the thug.
Some medical actions such as intubation and cardioplomonary re-system (CPR) can also be published in the air.
This virus can also be published through eye, mouth and mouth in case of contact.
There is also a concern that the disease is also spreading the reduction of dirty material but the risk is considered less.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 has been taken out of the decrease. This virus is more spreading in three days after the signs of signs, even if it is possible to spread before the last stages of the infection.
People have tested positive for this disease three days before the start of the SMS which is possible to deliver before the result of the remarkable signs.
There are only reports confirmed by the lab, but during the relationship investigations, the sympatomatic transmission has been identified by some countries.
ECDC has said that while it's not completely clear how the disease is easily spreading, one person generally suffers from two to three others. Virus lives in the flow from hours to days.
Specifically, the virus has been found to be discovered in plastic (poly propylene) and 304 stainless steel, on board card for a day, and up to four hours in copper.
It's a difference based on humidity and heat anyway. Testing positive for COVID-19
There is no evidence that the supervisor sends virus to humans, although the British officials are advising on hand-cutting with the prosecutors after contact, such as other levels that can be connected with the disease.
A new virus of severe and delicate respiratory syndrome Corona Virus 2019 (COVID-19) is a new virus that was taken from three patients for the first time with severe respiratory disease in the venue.
All parts of Nawal SARS-CoV-2 viruses happen in nature related to Coronavirus. The human body is killed outside, virus is killed by family soap, which analyzes its protective lap. SARS-CoV-2 is close to original SARS.
It is said that the virus is from animals.
Genetic Analysis shows that Corona Wire is genetically combining two dual pressure with Beta Coronavirus (Nesb B) in Sabjins Sarbec Virus (Nesb B).
This is 96 % the same as the whole genome to the BatCov RaTG13
On February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one mino acid difference between pengolins and humans from the human beings.
A relatively 92 % of the full genetic materials with date found genetic materials shared between Pengolin Coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove pangolin to be a medium host.
Virus can be detected shortly based on signs, although confirmed at the end of the inflicted products or CT Amigs exchange is by the polymer's series reaction.
A study in Wahan has suggested comparison with PCR with PCR that CT is more sensitive than PCR, although slightly specific, many of these reactions are covered with other patterns and disease processes.
Until March 2020, the American Radio College suggests ′′ CT should not be used for a first line test or screening to diagnose COVID-19 ".
The International Health Organization has published many RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-17, first published on January 2
Test use real time Rivers Transfer Polymer Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR).
Exam can be done on breathing or blood samples.
Results are usually available from a few hours to a day.
In general this test is done on Nasophrengel Swab while the column swab can also be used. A number of labs and corporations are taking the exams, which are detecting Anti-Buddies.
From April 2020 to April 6, none of this has been proven to be approved for extensive use.
Sereological examination created by Silix in the United States was only made for emergency use by Certified Labs.
Radio and Computer Tomographic (CT) features that are marked include the disproportionate perfirill grid epicis and non-present fragrance factor.
The Italian Radio Society is setting up international online database for confirmed cases.
Due to more intensity with other Antonians such as Adino Virus, taking photos without approval by PCR has limited characterization of COVID-19
A big study in China compare with St. CT results PCR and demonstrated that though the reaction is slightly specific for infinity, but very sensitive, in Epidemic parts, look at this as a screenshot. He is suggesting.
Strong neurological network is created to detect a virus reaction with both radioography and CT.
Strategies to prevent transmission of disease include general personal health maintenance, hand washing, hands, hands and mouth not leaving hands with hands, nose and mouth, joking or shaking and putting tissue directly in the container..
Those who may already have antenna have been recommended to wear surgical mask in public.
Physical distance measures are also recommended to prevent shipping. Many countries and regions have been damaged by growth, restricted or advised all unnecessary travels.
In any case, the virus has reached the spread stage in the world's large parts.
This means the virus is spreading in communities, and some members of the community don't know where and how they are suffering from the disease. Healthcare providers take care of those who may use standard caution, contact caution and eye protection. Relationship stabilization is an important method for health officials to select the source of disease and prevent shipping.
For this purpose, the governments have been raised with the use of mobile phones, the world's forgiveness organization and 100 other organizations have demanded the restrictions of this type of supervision in a statement.
Different mobile apps have been implemented or recommended for order use, and from April 2020 to 20, expert groups work privacy friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth with other mobile phones to close the user.
Users get a message if they have close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 Wrong understanding is spreading about how to prevent disease. For example, cleaning a nose and a mouth wash is not effective.
CoVID-19 vaccine is not available, though many organizations are working to create this vaccine.
Wash of hand can prevent or reduce spreading of disease.
CDC recommends that people spend more time with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when hands are clearly rush; before eating; and after baking, jokes. Or a joke.
That's because outside the human body, virus is killed by family soap, which breaks its protection nightingale.
CDC has more suggested using Alcohol Base Hand Sanator at least 60 % Alcohol according to volume when soap and water are not easily available.
The international health organization tells the people that don't touch your eyes, nose or mouth until you have your hands.
Faces can be anti-virus with the help of a number of solutions (face-free steel face to at least a minute to face a virus cleaner) with 62-71 % to 50-100 % to 0.1 % propinol, 0.1 Sodium Hypoclouride, 0.5 % hydrogen includes oxide and 0.2-7.5 % podon oden.
Other solutions such as Benzalconium Cloride and Chlorohexiden Gluconite are a little effective.

Cowed-19 risk control measures at work
In the work of covid-19 risk control measures are the use of work safety and health techniques to prevent work.
Risk control measures at work, risk assessment of resources on disease, intensity of disease in society, and risk factors of every employee that may be on the covid-19 disease. It's possible to suffer, it's related to work instead of work and work.
The United States Professional Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has a low-risk relationship with people and other workers in the disease, which is to prevent the first measures to prevent the disease. It is recommended. First preventive measures, told staff to stay at home in case of sickness, to prevent the transmission through breathing, and daily cleaning the work environment and It is to disinfection.
The middle level of disease is the risk of being suffering from the unknown and those who need to keep close relationships with the people who are suspicious of the covid-19 disease, but may be the current social transmission and international travels. Because he gets sick.
In this working environment includes staff who contact people, such as school, many people's pinpoint work environment, and people's pinfall-full-selling places.
In addition to the first measures of disease preventing, this group includes the effective air filtering air in control measures, plastic or glass curtains, personal safety equipment or equipment as it may be from someone like this. Meet when you're suffering from Quid-19
The United States Professional Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is an engagement with health and funeral workers, who are suffering from covid-19 disease, are at a high risk of suffering from disease. Have it. If employees are suffering from Covid-19 disease and suspected people in the air, or collect samples for testing or working from them, high risk of disease. It reaches the level.
Risk control measures that are suitable for these workers are engineering controls, such as negative pressure aircraft, and job suitable for personal safety equipment.
Cowed-19 release can have a lot of impacts on the workplace.
Workers may not be present to work due to fear of being sick, care for others, and disease.
Business ways may find a change. These ways may change both by demand of items and the tools that these items are obtained (e.g. shop during less barbar, or delivery / customers by themselves or car / Providing quick services through motorcycle)
Finally, from those geographic areas that have been severely affected by covid-19, the transmission of items may be cut off. The plan of preparation and response against spreading disease can be used to guide safe measures.
Plans to endure resources, from home risk factors, social places, high-age and lasting health workers, including different places and jobs related to different places and jobs.
Also, in plans, control measures are taken to reach risks and provide possible plans for the situation that may happen as a result of the spread of the disease.
Preparation and response plans against Sari diseases may need national and local orders.
Responding targets of a surreal disease to the spread of a surreal disease, rescuing people who have a risk of many poor health condition, continuing work activities, and in the complete / supply chain of activities. The impacts of the side are reduced.
The intensity of disease in that society in which business activities are being carried out, affects possible reactions.
Risk control measures are the frame, which is used to classify risk control measures during work safety and health.
The most effective control measures are the most effective measures of engineering controls, after administrative controls, and finally personal safety equipment.
Engineering controls, without a small employee, are to remove workers from work-related risks, and may be the lowest cost solution to implement this work.
Administrative controls are the changes in work policy or procedures that need to be seen by staff and administrators.
Personal safety equipment is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but sometimes can help prevent disease.
All types of personal safety should be appointed to employees based on attention risk, installed properly (e. g respiratory altar), constantly and properly, regularly, maintained, and if needed. Change in, and to prevent the tune must be properly removed, cleaned, kept or eliminated.
The United States Labor Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) says that the low risk of illness is in a low level of work with people and colleagues in jobs.
The first measures to prevent the spread of the disease, which are recommended for all work places, to be full of hands, if the workers are sick, they call them to stay at home, including the covers of the cough and the pearl. Preparing to prevent disease transmission measures, preparing for paper and used items, ready to hold telephone connections or change shifts if needed, prevent staff from using other tools and equipment, And daily work environment is to keep clean and disinfection.
The most important step in the safety of the workers, customers, inspectors, and at work is to recognize and separate the possible disease.
U.S. CDC (CDC) to control and prevent disease, staff who have signs of acute respiratory disease should stay home until the fever eliminates fever or symptoms. Pharmaceuticals are dried for at least 24 hours, removal of fever signs, and other symptoms go away. Vacation policies should be changing, staff should be allowed to take care of sick members at home, and that employees are aware of these policies.
In the view of the United States Professional Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), in the middle level of disease-risking jobs include workers who are not suffering or suffering from people who are not suffering or suffering from covid-19 disease. No doubt, 6 ft (1.8 m) is in karat or close relationship, but may be in the community due to transmission of disease in SARS-CoV-2 Suffered or suffered a disease that this person has recently traveled to the international place where Quid-19 has been widely published.
These include staff who are in general contact with people, such as schools, high-level pinch working environments, or retail stores or places where there are many customers. Engineering controls for this and high-risk groups, effective air filters installation, increase the number of aircraft, physical barriers such as bright plastic curtains installation, fast service via customer / motorcycle. It's a word of doing. For these high-level and high-risk groups to recommend patients to stay at home, meeting through virtual relations, building different working shifts, to places where covid-19 disease. Publish to close the trips, create emergency contact plans to build a community, the Quid-19 risk factors and small safety. Training workers who need to know how to use safety clothes and equipment, provide resources and a working environment in which personal protection is considered, several times the need to wash hands, limited access to customers and people., and posters are installed on other safety measures from the Covid-19 Looking at work, staff who have a place in the middle level of illness should wear personal safety equipment including hand-on / gloves, medical clothes, and face-hiding mask or glasses.
The staff of this dangerous group need a very low respiratory alo.
If someone is sick on the plane, the perfect controls for the safety of staff and other passengers, with 6 ft distance from other passengers and staff, suggesting a patient wearing mask, and Asking a sick person to close your mouth and nose on paper.
Related cabinet passenger should use a medical use when they take care of a patient passenger or touch a liquid or possible surface, and if possible use other personal safety equipment in case that A patient passenger has a fever, constant jokes, or a problem while breathing.
Lasmakuan and once consumer items should be put in red colour / hazard bag, and the surface should be cleaned and disinfected later. The time of travelling and transporting risk controls including a lot of travellers and other passengers, including a shipment and transmission controls, which is when someone is sick, and if anyone has fever and other symptoms of disease. It should be separated from others and the medical workers should be informed about the same.
In fact this separated person can be done medical surveillance in the cabinet. For school and child care centers, USA centers (CDC) recommend a short-term school holiday for cleaning and disinfection, if a sick person is a social disease. Publishing has come to school while not taking care of it.
If social transmission is less chance, social distance strategy should be implemented, such as field trips, meetings and other great meetings, such as physical education or church sitting or in cafeteria, up to tables. Increasing the distance, changing the times of coming and back, restricting / reducing the diminishing, and using a separate health office for children with symptoms like zakam.
When the transmission of disease continues strongly in the local society, social and social strategies may be considered a school holiday. For the control and prevention of disease, US centers (CDC) are considered a low level of Emergency Health Risk.
The government officials of law, who may be in touch with covid-19 persons or suspects, are recommended to follow the instructions related to the emergency medical workers including the appropriate equipment of personal safety.
If you are arrested closely, staff must clean and disinfection on their belts and military clothes before the second time in the home, and disinfection of the personal safety equipment used. And follow the standard operational plans / processes to protect and wash clothes.
The USA Labor Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is faced with health and funeral workers at high and high level of disease.
Health care and aid providers, laboratory, and medical transportation workers who face covid-19 illnesses.
If employees are suffering from Covid-19 disease and suspected people in the air, or collect samples for testing or working from them, high risk of disease. It reaches the level.
Piping in the body in the available particle production processes in the air, cough method, broncoscopy, some dental processes and examinations, including the collection of samples.
High-level burial jobs include workers who are busy preparing the bodies of people who have been identified in the covid-19 illnesses. If these workers do body examination, their disease is getting more high. Separation of houses for this dangerous group for additional engineering controls-19 suffering and suspicious patients as well as air-availability processes.
Negative pressure special aircraft may be suitable in some health and funeral centers.
The samples should be taken into account the 3 pre-measures of Biosifty Level.
The International Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the future patients should be held in a separate awaiting house by looking at the Quid-19 case. In addition to other personal safety equipment, USA Labor Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recommends respiratory equipment for those staff who are suffering from SARS-CoV-6 or suspicious patients at 2 ft. Works and workers who do preventing the production of available particles in the air.
In the USA, NIOSH approved N95 facial respiratory masks or better be used in a wide and written respiratory safety program. In this program includes appropriate, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory tools can be used for better safety and provide easy for staff. The International Health Organization does not recommend coverage / lapse, because Quid-19 is a respiratory disease. This disease is not transmitted through body fluids.
The international health organization only recommends medical mask for examination staff at the door of the international health organization.
The International Health Organization for those who take a respiratory sample of covid-19 patients, take care of them or send them to another place in the air without performing the availability of the production processes, Surgical mask, glasses, facial mask, medical clothes and hands / gloves recommend.
If there's an availability process of production in the air, the surgical mask is to wear a N95 or FFP2 breathing mask instead of a surgical mask.
Because the international preparation of personal safety equipment is inadequate, the international health organisation is to build remote health and physical barriers such as, cleaning windows, reducing the need for personal safety equipment, only allowing those to use personal safety equipment that quid-19 patients perform directly, only special necessary jobs, such as removing a breathing mask without removing a breath mask, completing personal safety equipment, personal safety equipment / Supply chain observing and sympathizing, and recommending not to prescribe masks for those who don't have symptoms.
SARS-CoV-2 affected people in the world have increased than one million.
On Thursday, John Hopkins University information shows that SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus incidents have increased than 2 million in the world.
At least 52 thousand deaths are related to Quid-19, the disease caused by coronavirus.
This goal was the day when the first death of the corona virus was recorded in Malawi and the first death in Zimbia.
North Korea has been fighting on Thursday that the country is one of the few countries that are clean from the infection of Coronavirus.
Last day, the International Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed incidents of this group 79,332 incidents that were central European time (10 UTC) at 0800 am. It's already been created.
In the United States, Coronavirus has been recorded more than 5,900 thousand incidents, including at least 244 deaths.
According to John Hopkins University's information, in the United States, more than 1,000 people lost their lives due to Corona disease on Wednesday.
At the world level, some countries have taken hard steps to prevent the spread of corona disease.
On Thursday, the mayor of Moscow Sergi Sobianin has been held until the first time of quarantine.
Russian President Wladi Mir Putin said that the Russians will be paid inside their homes until April 30
Portugal parliamentary emergency votes for more 15 days; 215 votes were positive and a negative vote for the emergency situation.
Saudi Arabia has been putting mobility in the holy cities of Maka and Madina to continue until the end of the day; before the movement was from 3 pm until 6 am.
Thailand is planning to implement mobility from 4 am to 4 pm.
Ohio Governor Mike D Wayne has announced that the state has put a residence order in May 1
B coronavirus disease 2019 or covid-2 is an antic disease that causes severe respiratory disease 19 symptoms of coronavirus.
The ordinary signs are fever, jokes, and salandi.
Other signs of tiredness, members pain, sitting, pain, pain, loss of smell, are pains of people.
The time of disease and symptoms start about five days but may take time for two to days.
While many events are normal symptoms, but in some, it includes a viral breast hug and a lot of physical members.
As of April 17, 2020, 2.24 million incidents were reported from 210 countries and regions of the world, because more than 153,000 people were killed.
More than 568,000 people have been restored. Virus is spreading through small drops during close contacts between people.
While these drops are produced during the sa, these drops usually grow on the ground or other surfaces, but not an infinite virus through a lot of distance.
People can also take a virus by touching the surface of the cakes and then touch their eyes, nose and mouth.
Virus can survive on different levels for 72 hours.
After the start of symptoms, it is very spreading and valid during three days, although the virus is before the symptoms of disease are shown or spread in the last stages of disease. Disease standard diagnosis method is done through Nizofaringel Swab / Dicky by the rewards of the translation polymirez China.
Using mask is re-prescribed for those who have a virus.
Mask orders are different in public, some officials allow not to use, some demand to use and some demand to use.
Update, no vaccine or anti-virus treatment available for covid-19 virus.
Disease transmission has been registered in all six areas of the international health organization, in many countries.
Those who are suffering from a virus may not have signs like a fever, jokes, tiredness, and salandi.
Problem in emergency symptoms, constant chest pain and stress, gangstia, sleep severely awakening, red face and lips; with these signs or symptoms, it is allowed to obtain emergency medical care.
Unusually, the symptoms of the upper respiratory system include brushes, inviting nose, or colonic pain.
Gastrovantistinal symptoms, such as vomiting, kangi and diarrhea / nes sitting are seen in different percent.
In the first time some incidents in China, only chest and heartbeat has been seen.
In some people, sickness to the chest, many physical members are disabled and reached death.
This is called the stage of Incubation.
The Quad-19 stage is usually six days but may be different between 14 to 14
97.5 % of people who show symptoms take 11.5 days to show symptoms of virus. Reports show that all those who are suffering from the virus are not shown in it.
I still don't know the role of transmission without these symptoms; but still, first evidence shows they might help spread the disease.
The proportions of those who are suffering from viruses that are not visible are not visible and are under research. Korean centers report to control and prevent disease that 20 % of all confirmed incidents were left without symptoms in hospital.
The China National Health Commission has also started registration of signs of events from April 78; on this day, 166 or 130, on examination. % of people are not shown to the symptoms.
There was a high-level virus in Bulgamo and there was a high-level virus.
Speaking louder than normal talks makes a lot of drops.
A research in Singapore that an unprecedented joke can deliver a mouth drop to 4.5 metres (15 ft).
Although the virus is not transmitted through air, the National Science Academy has suggested that biavirusal transmission may be possible and all the air equipment installed outside people's houses in Delhiz, find samples that viral R. NA was positive.
Some medical processes like piping / putting and cardiopolmonary residence may cause respiratory filters to be aerosolize and then cause virus spread in the air.
Although there is a concern that has been transmitted through the fazel material, the risk of trust is low. Virus is very valid when there are signs and symptoms among people; while there is a possible to spread before the symptoms are raised, and the risk may be low.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control says while it's clear how easily the disease can spread, but one person can generally inflict two to three people on viruses. Virus stays alive in hours or days on the surface.
In particular, virus live on paper beds for a day, on plastic (polypylene) and the iron (ISI 99) for three days, and 304 % of copper survived up to four hours. Something.
However, the survival of the virus on these levels depends on humidity and air level.
Soap and mediators that are used properly are very effective; soap-related materials removes, deactivates, deactivates, and also removes from skin and other levels.
Also other solutions, such as benzalconim chloride and chlorhexidine gluconite are at least effective. In Hong Kong, the samples were taken two days after being in hospital during a study.
In six in five patients, the first sample was shown that the virus was taken at a high level, and the sixth patient showed that the rate of virus taking increased on the second day of examination.
Severe respiratory symptoms Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute respiratory symptoms of coronavirus, which is the first time in wuhan to have acute respiratory incidents related to three chest. Separated from those who have hugs.
All symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 new virus are found in its nature related coronavirus.
Outside the human body, virus is killed by using soap in homes, which breaks the cover of the virus. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is related to the original format of SARS-CoV.
The body's body is the organisations that are most effective due to covid-2, because the virus hosts to the chambers are accessible through the angiotensin-changing enzyme 19 (ACE2) enzyme, which is the second type of Syrian chambers. It's getting a lot together.
Virus uses a special glacoprotein called ′′ Spike / Spike ′′ (peplomer) and is riding up to ACE2 enzyme and entering the chambers related to this enzyme.
A severe heart injury was found on 12 % of people who were admitted to hospital in Wuhan state of China, and this type of incidents occur in severe diseases.
Inflammatory reaction and exemption system is high in the heart disease during the development of a disease, but the heart muscle tap may be related to ACE2 enzyme resipator / buyer.
ACE2 Respectors / Buyer are in the heart and performs their activity in the heart.
In Emergency Care Room, there are 31 % of blood-19 people who have been suffering from blood (25 %) and 25 % of the veins were found that cause. There is less awareness of the disease. Because of Covid-19, there was a bad change in the structure of the dead body, and the lymphosite enters the inflammation of the lymphosite.
Although the SARS-COV-19 virus has a defensive system for ACE2 visible epitylial cells, severely suffering patients have symptoms of high-level systemic inflammation.
Specially the GM-CSF filtering T-cells have been shown in the cabinets that have found inflammatory IL-6 patients collecting inflammatory IL-6 and severe damage to the cavid-19 patients. Relationship with.
The presence of lymphosetic infinity has also been reported.
The International Health Organization has published a lot of examination protocols for disease.
Armhaal resource transcriptions polymirez chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is the standard examination method.
Usually, the examination is done on respiratory samples obtained by nazophrenjial pip. But still, pip or bulgam samples can also be used.
Examination results come between a few hours and two days.
Blood exams can be done, but in this examination two blood samples are necessary that the second sample is taken two weeks after the first sample and the results of each sample requires very short time.
Chennai Science has been able to publish a separate and inheritance series of coronavirus / originality, so that laboratories around the world can independently detect the disease through the virus (PCR). Do it.
On April 2020, 4, Anti-Body Examination (active disease and that one person has already suffered or not, found) was in development, but widely not working yet. Taken.
The precision and precision of Chinese experiences proven is only 60 to 70 % years old.
USA FDA confirmed the first test or examination for use on March 2020, 21 Diagnostic instructions published by Wuhan University Zhunan Hospital, recommended the methods for diagnosis based on clinical symptoms and Epidemiology.
Two-sided glass darkness is public in the environment, contrast and latest distribution of diseases.
Sub seller dominance and Crazy Pewing (with a differently filling of the player's curtain), and getting together may show up with the development of the disease.
Less data is accessible on Microscopic Tap and Potfziology.
The important identification of damage while examining the body is as follows:
Macroscopy: Plyoric, Pircarditis, Pulmonary Oedema or Liquid collecting in the aircraft and tissue.
A viral chest hug can be seen in four types of intensity or hardship:
Ordinary chest hug: pulmonary oedema or collecting liquid in airlines and tissues, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large unusual pneumocytes, interstial / fertilizer inflammation along with lymphosetic inflammation and large multi-nuclear chambers.
Severe chest hug: A bad change in the structure of the cuddle (DAD) along with the inflammation in the holes.
A bad change in the structure of the sighs (DAD) is caused by severe respiratory disease (ARDS) and severe hypoczema.
Chest Hug: Inflammation and polymonary interstichel fibrosis created in the sorios.
Blood: Blood sprinkling inside the vein (DIC); Lucoritroblastics reaction.
Staying at home in preventive measures on virus, avoiding the finger space, washing hands on water and soap for at least 20 seconds, protecting a good respiratory system, And to stop touching the mouth, eyes, and puzzles on the bad hands is to stop touching the mouth, eyes, and puzzles.
Disease Control Center (CDC) is recommended to hide the mouth and cook on paper. In the absence of paper, it also recommends to hide the mouth and cooker in the forest.
After all kinds of jokes and bricks are born correctly.
Also, the CDC recommends the use of facial covering fabrics / pieces in public places to reduce the virus transmission level from a disease-symptoms person. The aim of social distance strategies, to close schools and workshops, to restrict travel, and to cancel large public meetings, to many people with viruses.
In Waton instructions it also comes that people stay at least 6 ft (1.8 m) away from each other.
Apparently there is no effective medicine yet to prevent covid-19 disease. Although the disease vaccine isn't expected until 2021, but the key part of Covid-19 Virus is trying to reduce the development of disease, called ′′ curve / planol It's being recognized.
Also the disease control center (CDC) recommends that people hold their hands a few times for 20 seconds, especially after the toilet or when hands are dead / kakar urban, before eating and After cleaning, jokes, and brush.
Memorial Center also recommends 60 % alcohol hand snatzers / disinfection use, but only when soap and water are obviously not available. In places where hand-business snatchers are not easily accessible, the international health organization offers two formulas of local production.
In this formula, the anti-microbe activity comes from Ethanol or Isopropanol.
Hydrogen Proxide is used to help remove bacterial eggs in alcohol. It's ′′ not an active article to remove the microbes of hands ".
Glycerol is added as a delicate material.
People are managed with support care. In these care includes helping liquid treatment, oxygen, and other vital impacted organisations / members.
The CDC recommends that those suspected people wear a simple mask on the virus.
Giving oxygen outside the body (ECMO) is used to solve respiratory activity problems, but the benefits of this method are still below.
Personal protection of health and healthy method of living and nutritional regime is allowed to strengthen the exemption system.
Support therapy is useful for those who have normal symptoms in the first stage of disease. The International Health Organization and China's National Health Commission has published recommendations for the care of people who are admitted to Quid-19
In the United States, intellectual and specialists have published a free treatment request from different organizations, IBCC.
No special treatment for Quid-19 on April 2020
Some health carers recommend prostamol (acetomenophin) to eliminate symptoms for the first time using ibuprofin.
Precaution should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of virus, especially in health centers, such as pipe to the body or air to the patient with hand that can be done in the air. Production of particles.
For those health workers who take care of people suffering from Quid-19 viruses, the disease control center (CDC) standard precautions, contact precautions and air precautions, air virus detecting room (AIIR is recommending to place a sick person in AIIR. The Disease Control Center (CDC) provides guidance to use personal safety equipment during BBA.
What are the prescribed items and tools: personal safety medical clothes, respiratory or facial mask, glasses / eye safety, medical handmaguan / gloves. In case of possible, a respiratory mask is considered better than a face mask.
The N95 Respiratory Ellis has been confirmed for industrial places, but the FDA has allowed to use the formal permit (EUA) based on memorial mask.
These masks are made for the safety of particles in the air like dust and dust, but not without any signaled use against a special biological virus.
When there are no masks, the Disease Control Center (CDC) recommends to work as the last effort made at home.
A lot of covid-19 incidents aren't so severe that a mechanical respiratory ventilator or replacement is needed, but in some events it is necessary.
Covid-19-related patients have been actively arrested in hospital to activate a respiratory system with a respiratory system. Some evidence shows that pipe not to be used during a respiratory pipe or double-sided air positive pressure machine (BiPAP).
Whether these two ways will end in the same way for those who are severely ill or not, it's unlimited.
Some doctors prefer to use mechanical ventilator through mouth as this technique is more limited to air particle spreading than breathing pipe. Severe incidents are in general white beard (over 60 years old, especially those who are older than 80 years old).
Many advanced countries don't have enough beds in hospitals for everyone. It restricts the capacity of the health system to control the number of quid-19 incidents that are needed to be bed.
A research in China found that 5 % of patients were bed in ICU, 1.4 % needed ventilator mechanical help and 2.3 % died.
Nearly 30 % of the patients in Covid-19 are finally admitted to ICU hospitals.
Mechanical Ventilator is still getting more dissolved when the symptoms of acute respiratory disease increase in covid-19 and more difficult to give oxygen.
Ventilators that have pressure control mood and PEEP should increase the oxygen level, while the ventilator related to the ventilator also decrease in the hazards of the tap and neomotorax.
High-level Pep may not be done on old ventilators.
Research on possible treatment started in January 2020 and many anti-virus medicines are tested in clinics.
It seems like Remedysivir is a very hopeful medicine.
Although new medication may last until 2021, many of the tested medicines have been confirmed or tested in an advanced form.
Anti-virus medication may be tested on severely sick people.
The International Health Organization is asking the supporters to take part in the impact and safety exams of possible treatments. The FDA administration has allowed a temporary plasma to give a recovered patient plasma as an experimental treatment.
This experimental treatment has not been experienced during clinical research that shows safe and effective for disease.
In February 2020, a mobile app was created in China to help fight the spread of disease.
Users are asked to write their name and ID number in it.
The app can be risked using ′′ close relationship ′′ and infected with disease.
Every user can also see the situation of three other users.
If possible risk is found, the app not only recommends to quarantine itself, but also the local health officials inform. Large-level data analysis on mobile data, facial identification technology, mobile surveillance and artificial intelligence are used to help those sick people who have contacted people in Soheili Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government demanded security agencies to follow the mobile data of those people who might have corona.
This action was taken to implement the quarantine and protect those people who may contact those who are suffering from the virus.
Also in March 2020, Dutch Telecom has shared a mobile location with the German federal government office, Robert Coach Institut to investigate the virus and prevent spreading.
Russia has hired facial recognition technology to find the breaker of the quarantine.
Italian Regional Health Commissioner, Gulio Galera said he was informed by mobile phone operators that ′′ 40 % of people are walking around."
The German government has given 42000 hour vacation this weekend with more than 48 participants.
Estonia President Kirsty College called for solutions against Coronavirus.
People may experience sadness from quarantine, travel restrictions, treatment effects or disease / virus.
BBC has received a speech by Rory O ' Connor, says." Most social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economics is a storm to harm people's mental health and well-being."
Disease may be in normal condition with the presence of some symptoms or absence of some symptoms.
Normal incidents usually go up to weeks, while severe and severe incidents may take time up to weeks.
Based on the same viruses to SARS and MERS, women are at high risk due to the intensity of covid-19 disease, but there is no data related to Quid-19 Cowed-19 some people who are suffering may affect and create a chest hug.
Severely influenced people, Quid-19 virus may quickly create symptoms of acute respiratory disease (ARDS) that resulting in the activity of the respiratory system, spreading virus all over the body and the body. A lot of members can be the reason for the activity.
The complicated condition of Quad-19, spreading virus all over the body, blood sprinkling, heart, Pashtuns and jugs have hurt the heart.
Blood sprinkling, especially during protrombine, found in 6 % hospitalized in 19 % patients, while Pashtuns are unusual activity. The group has been seen in 4 % patients.
Nearly 20-30 % of those people have been seen as a Derwali at the transamenasis enzyme, suffering from Quid-19
According to this report, the average time between the beginning of symptoms and death was ten days in the hospital.
Besides, the people who were shipped to the ICU room, the average time between beds and death was days.
According to an early incident, the average time of 41 days was 14 days from the symptoms of the first symptoms and the average time of 41 days, which is all the time of sickness and death from six to 41 days. It was up to it.
According to a research of China's National Health Commission, men's death rate is 2.8 %, while women's death rate has been shown 1.7 %.
After the death of the histopatolajikal examinations of both the tissue wounds and the fibromaxweed inflammation of the fibromaxweed in both times.
Virus Scientopathic changes have been seen in Nomositeis.
The picture of the hair had the same with the symptoms of acute respiratory disease.
11.8 % reported by the China National Health Commission in deaths, the high level of troponin and the heart pains have been taken from the eyes of heart disease.
According to March data in the United States, 89 % of the hospitalized patients were signs. Access to medical resources and a region's social-economy may affect deaths.
In such a situation, the expectation of the dead is different from the local differences, but also because of the methodological differences.
Showing a few normal events can be the reason to exceed the death level.
But still, the fact that deaths due to past incidents means that the current number of dead people are shown less than reality.
The probability of cigarettes is 1.4 times more than smoking drinkers and the probability of bed and death in ICU is almost 2.4 times more. Concerns have been raised about the long-term effects of disease.
Hong Kong Hospital officials have found 20 % to 30 % low in the capability of people who have been improved from disease and have shown damage to organisations in the scan.
This could bring physical, mental and emotional symptoms after ICU's rescue patient.
Till March 2020, it was unknown whether the pre-disease could create a long-term exemption in those who are sick, effective and long-term disease or not.
There is a possibility of change based on coronavirus behaviour, but there is a report on those incidents that have been healthy after coronavirus positive examinations.
The belief of these incidents is that it causes constant disease to worse instead of new macrob.
The belief of the virus is that it's a natural virus and it's resourcing from zoo through widespread macrobes.
The real source is unknown, but in December 2019, the virus started spreading from one human to another.
Quid-19 confirmed research, published in Lancet (The Lancet) in January 2020, showed the most pre-start of symptoms of disease on December 1, 2019 Oh, oh, oh.
The first start of symptoms of disease in the official program of the International Health Organization has been shown on 8 December 2019
Many actions are used in common to select the number of dead people.
These numbers different from each area based and time passes and volume of examinations, health care system quality, treatment options, time since the beginning of disease, and people's specifications, such as age, sex., and all health is under effect.
In recent 2019, the International Health Organization has used ICD-10 emergency codes. The U07. 1 code for those dead who were confirmed in the lab with SARS-CoV-2 virus and U07. 2 code for those dead in clinic or epidemologic type of SARS-CoV-2 virus was diagnosed without lab approval. The number of people who are killed in the number of diagnostic cases in the time of the death-to-incident.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, until April 6.9, 2020, the world rate is 17 % from death-to-incident.
Numbers are different in every area. Other actions are the death level of incident that reflects the percentage of those diagnosed people who have died of a disease, and the death level of virus that reflects the percentage of those who have been suffering from disease (diagnosed and not diagnosed). He has died of disease.
These statistics aren't based on time, they are watching people with illness through the incident.
While many sick people don't produce anti-body, the presence of Anti-Body may provide information about why so many people are suffering from virus.
A small village in the beginning of the disease in Italy, Castiglin D ' Ade, 4600 people live in, 80 (1.7 %) died before.
In Ganglit, the disease has been spread due to carnivals, and the youth class has been spread to the people whose death level is relatively low and in such a way the death of all people suffering from Quid-19 is officially hidden. No wow.
Besides, Germany's health system hasn't been under pressure yet.
With the value of blood donors, 3 % of people in Holland may have had an anti-body.
69 confirmed people (0.004 % of all people) have died from Quad-19
The effect of bubba and death level is different in women and men.
In China and Italy, the death level is high in men according to research.
Their dangerous age for men is 50 years old, which is closed between men and women only at 90 years old.
In China, the death level of men was 2.8 % and the death rate of women was 1.7 %.
The real reason for this sex difference is not known, but the inheritance and practical factors can be the reason.
Sex-based emonological differences, which are less than men in women and in men the presence of several diseases such as high pressure in youth can cause their deaths..
In Europe 57 % of the people who died from Quid-19 were men.
Until April 19, the US government hasn't monitored the sex-2020 diseases.
Research has shown that Ebola, HV, Influenza and SARS viral disease affect men and women separately.
Higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, women, and they have a great chance to suffer the virus.
The International Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease should be ′′ Quid-19
The head of the International Health Organization, Tedros Adanom Gibriasus has revealed that CO of Coronavirus, VI, D, and 19 comes for the first time when the disease started and identified: 31 December 2019.
This name was appointed as a special geography (such as China), Zhu, or a group of people to avoid reviewing a group of people. This name is appointed as international orders, which is to prevent disgrace. Virus that creates-19 is known as acute respiratory disease symptoms of coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2
Furthermore, the International Health Organization has used ′′ Quid-19 Virus ′′ and ′′ Covid-19 Virus ′′ in its general statements.
Disease and virus are both called ′′ Coronavirus ′′ in general.
In Wuhan city of China, the virus and disease were both called ′′ Coronavirus ′′ and ′′ Wuhan Coronavirus ′′ and ′′ Wuhan Coronavirus
In January 2019, the International Health Organization has given a temporary name of 2015-Cov and 2019-Cov and 2020-CoV..
Official names, COVID-2020 and SARS-CoV-2 issued on 11 February 19
Due to the limit of capacity in the standard complementary chain, some digital producers make healthy things and items like a respiratory pedestal.
The example is that when a hospital in Italy needed a respiratory cover, and the company wasn't prepared in time and time, a new active company made 100 hoods in one night.
After the first spread of Covid-19 disease, the contemplation of conspiracy, treatment, incorrect information and false information was published on the internet.
Humans can transfer and spread viruses to some animals.
Research remained in finding the evidence of viral signs in chain, hopes and chicken.
No medication or vaccine confirmed for disease treatment.
International research on vaccines and medicines continues by government organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the international health organization started a ′′ dirty test ′′ to perform the impact of four anti-virus compounds in the hope of effect.
There is no accessible vaccine, but many agencies are actively busy making vaccine.
Benefit on SARS-CoV as both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 Respector to enter human chambers.
Three strategies of vaccine making are under research.
The first strategy of researchers is to create a vaccine for the whole virus.
The purpose of using such a virus, if it is inactive or dead, is to encourage the rapid response of the human body exemption against the covid-19 new virus.
The second strategy is to create sub-vaccines that aims to create a vaccine that senses the exemption system against the sub-parts of the virus.
In the SARS-CoV-2 incident, this type of research focuses on S-spike proteins that help the virus in the ACE2 Enzyme Respector.
rd strategy is nuccic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, new technique for vaccination).
Experimental vaccines from each of these strategy should be benefited for safety and effectiveness. On March 16, 2020, the first vaccine exam in Seattle started on four content.
In vaccine there is a harmless inheritance code from the virus that causes the disease. The relying on Anti-Buddy has been prescribed as a possible challenge to create a vaccine, but this has created a lot of discussion.
As of April 2020, more active clinical exams have been done from 300
In exams, confirmed medicines were done for Malaria, four research done on hydroxycoin or chloroquin.
In many Chinese research included the research of other diseases, in many countries, the 9th / 9th phase III exams have been done on the remedies.
Until April 2020, a dynamic study of Clinical Development for Covid-19 vaccine and medicines has been done. There are many anti-virus medicines under evaluation and research for covid-19 treatment. Including remediesior, chloroquin and hydroxy chloroquin, lupinavir / eritnavir and lupinavir / ritunavir as well as interfera beta.
There are evidence of remediesvire impact testing from March 2020
Clinical development has been seen in the treatment of remedies.
Phase III Clinical Exam is underway in USA, China and Italy. Cloroquin, pre-used for malaria treatment, was arrested under research in China with the first results in February 2020
But still, a joint research reviews are required.
Korean and Chinese health officials recommend the use of chloroquin.
Furthermore, Wuhan's Veuhan's Verology Institute, while prescribing a gram dose a day, reminds that eating this medicine twice a day is more dangerous and potentially death.
On March 28, 2020, FDA issued a demand for hydroxy chloroquin and chloroquin to treat the covid-19 patients. The use of interfyron, rebavirine, or umphinavirus in China's 19th print directions is also mentioned.
First data shows more use of rebavirine is necessary to thicken SARS-CoV-2 in exams.
SARS-CoV-2 Virus has been recommended in the exams after a low-level concentration. Research has shown that high-level protein pumping is important to enter SARS-CoV-2 through transmembrane protease serine 2 through ACE2 receptor.
With and without azitromycin, there are many restrictions on chloroquin and hydroxychloroccoen research that has prevented health community to use in treatments without any other research. Osilatamoyer doesn't prevent SARS-CoV-2 in exams and doesn't have any apparent role in the treatment of Quid-19.
Saitokin Storms can detect health condition in difficult and recent stages of Covid-19
There is evidence that hydroxy chloroquin may have anti-Saitokin storm features. After completing a small research, China's national health commission also included tosellisomab medication in the guidance of China's National Health Commission.
After showing positive results in severe patients, Phase 2 will be held in Italy at national level.
To know Sitokin storms, the purpose of preventing such developments that are thought to be the cause of death in some affected patients.
Interlokin-6 Respector Antagonist has been confirmed for the treatment of steroid referectorin Sitokin symptoms which are caused by the separation, CAR T cell, 2017.
So far, there is no random and controlled evidence that Tosilizumab can be considered an effective treatment for CRS.
From Cood-19 illnesses, the transmission of the infrastructure and thick antibodians to those who need it, is under research as a non-vaccine method.
This strategy has been tested for SARS without results.
Virus neutralization is a predictable action mechanism that strengthens the defense system against SARS-CoV-2
But other mechanics, such as Anti-Body-Dependent Silver Sitotaxy and / or Fogasitosis are also possible.
Other forms of inactive treatment of Anti-Body's inactive treatment are also in progress.
Production of recovered patients, which includes blood liquid from health patients and includes using special antibodians, can increase the number for fast spreading in the body.
Coronavirus disease, related symptoms group.
Lee Winliang, the Wuhan Central Hospital Doctor who has increased awareness about the spread of the virus, suffered and died on Quid-19 virus.
Stores have lowered the limit of toilet paper in Australia.
Sunday and Saturday evening Australian Store Chain Wolverts and Coles have reduced toilet paper sales restrictions on all stores at the same time at the national level.
ALDI also introduced the limit of a package on Monday.
These limits were put on the Facebook page on the Venue entry places and the chain of this chain.
According to the report, they have been afraid of being quid-19 because of being quarantine.
On Wednesday, Wolverts has also reduced the limit to buying toilet paper for a bed.
These changes came after four packages that were introduced by Walworth and Coles on March 4 and 5
Coles on March 8, 8 in Media report that these four beds are limited, ′′ Most stores sell their items in an hour after arriving ′′ and call ′′ unsari next side Aldi Tuesday. On Facebook post they call this ′′ unexpected ′′ on the day.
Wolverts spokesman says the sale was ′′ too much ′′ last week.
Costco store in Canbra also limited the amount of allowed to two last week.
To decrease, Coles has asked for a large bag and delivery from the supplicers, Wolverts has ordered an extra stock, Aldy has made stock for a special planned Wednesday.
Australia's Federal Executive Director Russell Zimmerman said the retailers are trying to increase stock, but it's difficult due to ban on the Lario time by the council.
He expects to increase the production values, because the supplicers try to fulfill the demands and what special.
On Tuesday, Aldie announced that after the stock end, some shops can't drive special Wednesday.
at News.com. au report in Queensland Universal of Technology Dr. Gerry Mortimer says Stores are doing a lot of fun every night.
Reminder that Tattle Pepper is big items, and low amounts, and when sold, places are empty in big mario, and feel less stock.
Russell Zimmerman ABC News has an idea that if there are more things in Almario, and if there are more things like toilet and sanitizer, it may be less risk.
The Ri-biked Tattoo Piper Wala said last Wednesday that they are going to end up with them.
In the News Dotcom report, Clinics Tattoo and Solaris Pepper Sorbent Making Wala Camberly-Clark says they have done 24/7 to keep the spell.
Real Estate Site Domain Dotcom report said that the Property workers in Melburn have given the first of the Tattle Piper free, a series of time reduced on Liberd.
The eighth page of Darwin newspaper NT news on Thursday Edition was used as a Tylet Pepper.
The Australian BBC March 3 report wasn't in the right of ban, and there is no plan on banning things.
Russell Zimmerman added that the demand for other things is also high, including masks, sanitizers, dry spots, handwash and summer.
Just like out of Australia, Bretch on Sunday's Line Sparket Andres Tattle Pepper got a 12 Roll Pix.

This month we see ourselves in considerable situations.
The Covid-19 BBA is one thing that illuminates our international human relations and responsibilities that we have against each other.
We don't have a history of these challenges, but we know that our best reactions rely on a kind of international sweetness, cooperation and community building that this organization has a place in the heart of the organization.
The collaboration and care we had between our colleagues through emails, calls, and online talks is the trust and trust of those interesting human beings that we work together.
I can't thank you and be proud of my co-workers.
Last week, someone shared a thank you for our work.
They reminded me of how meaningful it is for the world to turn to Wikipedia, and as an important source this is what a powerful symbol of online and accessible for all.
It's because of your job whether you leave this website open or buy money from your colleagues or want to keep the community safe.
The world more than ever needs the information that Wikipedia offers.
This is the moment that not what we do or how we do, may show a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this message and your role in it we will create some remarkable adjustments in the next week.
Fit with my work and timeline
As Robin mentioned before, the C-Team had a meeting last night to discuss our plans and schedule for next days and months.
In this conversation, we've considered what we think would be a proper reaction to what we face and in this would be the best way to keep the organization or administration stabilizing and strong.
Very intensely we wanted to remove the pressure and support our mission.
If you want to do it again, it's not a problem.
For all staff, contractors, and contractors:
Our daily work expectations until next news, 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week.
We don't have any vacation - if you can work more than normal hours, the mission can be taken from you.
But still, the world isn't much of an offer, and for us is your preference, if you take care of your food, buy home business or go to the doctor.
We don't watch your time.
If you are sick, don't work.
This should be done without saying, we still tell you.
Don't need a sick holiday or PTO - just tell your manager and help your team review your genetic and timeline to make sure the key parts of work are caught under the coverage.
(If you're getting a positive result of the Quid-19, please let Brian T & C Ops know so T & C can help you and make sure your status is right by management. Attention is getting).
The watch workers are fully paid to their money.
We have already said and again respect our contractors and watch workers for staying committed.
Everyone will be paid on their normal hours based on normal conditions.
If you are sick and not able to work, also includes.
If you want to work, we support you.
A lot of people around us are taking advantage of their work as a way to turn their stress around us.
What we do, is unbelievably rewarding, especially at a time as it is now.
Still, this means your care.
The request is that you talk to your manager, that's how we know what to expect and we can get the same.
Some things are considered important.
There are some things we need to do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust &, Safety and Cold Attraction Teams (between others) do an important job that may need more help as well.
We will start a process together with all agencies to increase current goals and focus on supporting what is important for our mission.
There are so many organizations that do for us, we should focus all on the most important projects.
After going to now, no pains will be found.
We don't plan to ′′ give double time to get up ". with the end of the BBA ".
You can't expect to do extra work to complete the speed, because it's now imaginary and unrealistic.
We agree that the situation has changed, and we need to work to set new goals and timeline.
What happens with an annual plan?
In order to adjust our new reality and daily working hours expectations, we're aware to adjust our 2020-2021-year plan to deliver our 2020-2021-year plan.
Our intention is to prescribe 2019-2020 plans, which creates a lot of time to build budget and gives employees the opportunity to be given priority to important work, self care, care, and care, while they are Place that wants to work in the next week with a reduced schedule.
Templation at a high level reduces the volume and pressure of current planning work throughout the organization.
We'll be introducing our proposal to the board next week and getting confirmation on new actions and update to teams.
Thank you for the APP team leadership in this part.
Office's respect, faced with illness, and cleanliness.
Last week, we got news that our SF related staff may have been suffering from Quad-19 virus.
But still, with a few precautions, we have hired an anti-virus cleaning team to disinfect all levels in San Francisco office.
They are taking advantage of the hospital-level anti-virus solution to disinfect every level as well as the laby and the lift side that reaches to our floor.
Using the care job protocol in the building and using materials that help the rental buyers safety.
We feel relaxed that the office will be properly ready when we come back.
Our DC office is located in WeWork that has shared the Quid-19 protocols with us and DC related staff.
From last week, our DC office has been fully moved to a distance with San Francisco.
As our related colleagues in New York City know, we discuss and talk about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These words continue, but there may be a delay in it.
First time some of our co-workers working in far areas.
Our long-distance colleagues know that this might be a kind of order and adjustment, and would like to offer you some salutations:
Limit the length of meeting time to or hours.
If long meetings need to be seen, consider how this meeting can be distributed in a few days process.
Know the purpose of the meeting clearly, must have agenda, and send before the meeting of reading materials.
Download the video on Google Docs and Zoom tools to create live cooperation and contact.
Select a leader to build every meeting. Somebody to supervise questions and follow the list of talkers and someone to help take note (or take note shared).
If you need a calm mic or earrings, send an email to the support section of technology.
Use your hustle payment for a breakfast food.
Join #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about the divided work.
Human Resource Activities Team is looking at the Argonomic Guide to support the divided work in support of the Webinar.
Last week we asked community-related contracts to cancel public financial programs by Wikimedia, such as Editatons until then, until the international health organization has not been destroyed. Announcement has been announced.
We informed them that we knew that for cancellation and other restrictions we wanted to make it impossible to perform their contract-based activities and that no one will be able to delay the activities and change the goals. It will be a fine.
We'll start overseeing more guidance on Vikimania and other regions and community thematic conferences next week.
It seems that the general sense of the international community is depressed from the confusion, but it is calm and comfortable to focus on our communities, Wikimedia and others.
In advance, CRT is working on building a page in Mitawiki to create a space for the community in order to follow our relationship.
Dealing with Covid-19 related topics
We will send an invitation to your girl on Thursday, 14:00 UTC / 07:00 PT, to your girl on a special working meeting.
We'll use this time to share more information, answer your questions and connect with each other.
We are together in this or we can help each other like this.
Besides this, you can keep finding information in this email address and find more important information related to Quid-19 in Office Wiki.
CRT will release updates on these pages and keep all information in one place.
We are also working on maintaining continuous relations with those employees that are currently living in many influential countries.
If you have questions about such a travel, programs, great work process, cover-related challenges, or something you need help, you can call or work without a doubt CRT.
We want to provide help and create contacts if needed.
If you have sensitive and sensitive information, kindly send the head of Human Resources International Operations, Brian Joden by email.
No change should be seen as a job and responsibilities.
Rather, it's a formal recognition that at a time our work and responsibilities should be regulated in such a way that weren't regulated before.
These are the steps we believe are necessary to support each other, so we can continue our work, stamp our activity with the help they need and make the world a service that they are You can trust it.
Our planned work will be waiting for us with time.
For now it's time to support each other and create a space for his important work that may be faced in the next weeks and maybe months.
We need you to achieve this goal, and we ask you to take care of yourself and your families, so you'll be ready and ready when you're needed.
Now with kindness - cut your hands and don't touch your face!
Catherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Dorian Day, Gregory Wee, Jim Wee, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and other members of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jim. Wee, Janine Yo, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby In).
CoVID-19 is necessary to update the diagnosis standard information of ′′ suspicious cases ′′ and ′′ confirmed cases
On February 2019, 6, our 2020 new coronavirus (2019-CoV) has published a quick counselling tips for diagnosis and treatment, and these tips offer our experience and Good information to fight this public disease around the world.
But, the 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease of Coronavirus, our awareness and knowledge of current research and clinical work experiences are increasing regularly; that's why diagnosis and respect strategy is constantly new..
In this letter we asked for a comment about our guidance and offered a new diagnosis standard of ′′ suspicious cases ′′ and ′′ confirmed cases it's the latest diagnosis for COVID-19 (19th edition) and Treatment guidance is a probability, which has been published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, 2019 new coronavirus (2019-CoV) started publishing, now officially named Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) The name of the virus has been named after severe respiratory disease Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 2020, 11, the International Health Organization COVID-19 announced a public disease.
To fight with SARS-CoV-06 SARS-2, our team has created a quick counselling tips and has been published online in military medical research on February 2020th
It has taken a lot of attention since it has been published.
But keep in mind that COVID-19 is a new disease, the current research experience and clinical work is increasing our awareness and knowledge systematically; that's why diagnosis and treatment strategy is constantly new.
The diagnosis and treatment tips for COVID-3 published by the National Health Committee of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), January 2020, 16 and March 2020, 19 All versions have been published, some of them have changed more.
Now our tips get a look by Zhou et al, they suggest scores that their clinical experience is a probation.
Their work has added new evidence to our guidance and valuable information for this public disease.
We approve of their most work and thank you.
However, their work information should also be updated with the latest diagnosis and treatment tips and recent studies for COVID-19 (Exam 19).
The 2020th edition (March 2020, 3) Probent, to confirm a suspicion case, the history of Sari Disease identification must join two materials to create a every aspect analysis, or should have Clinical evidence. Complete three materials if there is no history of Sari Disease identification.
History of Sari Disease: (1) in the city and around the areas, or other community where the Covid-19 cases have been reported in the past 14 days before the start of the disease. Residence History; (2) Relationship History with SARS-CoV-3 Cases (with a positive examination of Noclic Acid); (2) with patients who are in the city and around the areas, or other. Where the community has reported covid-4 cases before the beginning of disease in the past 14 days that had a history of relationship with fever or respiratory patients; (19) confirmed cases groups. A relationship history 2 2 cases with fever and / or respiratory signs in a small area such as home, office, school class, and more over 2 weeks.
Clinical Signs: (1) fever and / or respiratory signs; (2) suffering from COVID-3 with pictures; (19) the number of blood white booths show normal, reduced, or The number of Lymphokite decrease in the first start.
A confirmed case diagnosis should be a suspect case that is as a probation of a material of patogenic or serological evidence: (1) a real-time PCR examination for SARS-CoV-2; (2) 2 (Viral series all genome that shows high with new coronavirus; (3) Special IgM Antibody and SARS-CoV-2 for IgM antibody; or SARS-CoV-2 2 Special IgM antibody increases from negative to positive, or material 4 4 in the improvement phase until it's in the hard stage.
We can see that in a respiratory device or in a blood bilgo for the real time examination of PCR in second (January 18, 18) and 22rd (January 22th 2020th 22) Added in the versions.
Blood Ballogo's identity was added on the fourth (January 2020, 27) and 2020th (February 2020th 8) versions; and then the serology evidence was added in the 2020th version.
These changes are the probation of continuous researchers work to search for a high-level neucleic acid kit for a quick diagnosis, and take a blood sample from a respiratory device, which added different types of bills, and confirmed. Support the special positive results in the standards.
Besides, there are other evidence that we should treat normal signs and unminded patients.
That's why, Zhou et al. Work plan information should be new, as those who have been in the clinic marks have been ranked as ′′ low risk
The grading system should also be confirmed in other clinical work and studies.
In the result, we are hoping for more straightforward evidence to come and ask readers to give their views.
To diagnose ′′ suspicious cases ′′ and ′′ confirmed cases we suggest to follow and obey the new guidance of our countries.
Our team has renewed their guidance on time to offer help.
Bangladesh reports the deaths of five other people in the day of the dead.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed the death of five other people due to COVID-19
This is the most number of deaths in one day due to virus.
Bangladesh's Bangladesh Control and Research Administration (IEDCR) published a report on coronavirus, including 114 people who still have the virus, and 33 There are also incidents that have been healed from this disease and it stayed in their homes.
In total, 17 dead people have been recorded.
In an online news, IEDCR DIRECTOR Dr. Mirjadi Sabirina Flora has said that there are four men and one woman among the dead.
Dr Meerjady says that in the dead people, two people were 51 to 50 and one person was 41 to 60 years old.
She also said that two people are residents of Dhaka (Dhaka) in the victims.
The International Health Organization announced COVID-19 International BBA on March 11, 2020
Hospital officials told the news to the Agency that one of the dead people was the president of the anti-corruption commission of Bangal, Saif Rahman, who was in Quit Materi Hospital.
In an online video on Saturday, the minister of land roads and bridges in Bangladesh said that the public transportation will be closed for more time.
First this public transport was closed on March 2 and the plan was to end on Saturday April 4th.
But the necessary things such as medicine, sung materials and food was still open.
The Covid-19 incident in Bangladesh came forward on March 19th, where two people were returned from Atley and also included one person's wife.
After these three people healed on March 19th.
The International Health Organization has announced COVID-19 virus as the international bubble.
On Wednesday, the international health organization has been held-19 pandemic, which caused by Corona Wires Sars-Ko-2 disease.
If the word pandemic is over the level of sickness, not how dangerous incidents are, order the international health organization to take action to the governments.
All countries can still change the period of pandemic.
The International Health Organization says by Dr. General Tedrooz Adhnom Chibrisos that if countries have discovered, test treatment, treatment, only and strengthened their people in response to countries.
We are very worried about not taking steps against it with a dangerous level of home disease.
In America, Ex-Disease Control and Preventive Dr. Tom Frieden says this is ′′ unseen
CNNN has been published in a breakdown in February, that the influenza has been published on the international level without influenza.
Gibresus has also shown his own green, we have never faced such a pandemic as Corona virus is a pandemic ؛.
He said, we haven't even seen such a pandemic that can be made at the same time.
The international health organization's decision in January is the international health organization that the epidemic will declare a global public health situation.
The President of the United States of America of allergies and infectious disease has said that the BBA will be destroyed by a low line.
The Associated Press News Agency again said in a report on Thursday that the Coronavirus has been affected by some people and six thousand people have been reported in a lock and six hundred people.
2019 Coronavirus Respiratory Disease 2-COVID and 19-SARS-CoV available in testing labs that detect the existence of virus and the production of antibody. Expressing against the virus.
The presence of virus in models is confirmed through RT-PCR to detect coronavirus RNA.
In March 2020, SARS-CoV-2 Virus original protesis was identified as a target for medication after Antan.
It's used to detect the newest and active pollutants.
Anti-body detection can be used for both diagnosis and care of people.
Anti-body test shows how many people had this disease, both those who were very low symptoms and those who showed the symptoms.
The level of deaths and the level of public safety can be found by the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, no country had any figures about spreading virus in its people until March 2020
Until March 23, a country has not tested 3 % of its abadi, there was a policy of more countries that we will not test the least signs of the signs, such as Atali, Neiderland, White and Switzerland.
This variety of reported incidents also affects the high level of deaths that may have been estimated to be high in some countries.
Test use real time Rivers Transfer Polymer Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR).
Results are usually available from a few hours to a day.
RT-PCR performed test on column models is only valid for the first week of disease.
Later again virus can lose the columns and enter the shines.
For those pollutants who are tested in the second week, stretchers, or also using their deep respiratory routes.
One of the first test of PCR took place in Berlin Charity in January 250,000 in which the real-term polymery interactions series (rRT-PCR) was used and the international health organization was 2020 Thermal thermometers equivalent to distribution field.
Britain also completed a test on January 23th On January 28, 2020, a company called Kogenibicic in South Korea has created a Clinical Scale to detect the temperature based on PCR and SARS-CoV-2
It's looking for E-Genes and specified SARS-CoV-2 by Beta Coronavirus. BGI Group was one of the first companies in China to get a license for use of SARS-CoV-2 Temperature Diagnosis from China's National Health Products Administration. In the United States, Disease Control and Prevention Centers (CDC) to their public health laboratories through International Resource Introduction (2019-CoV). The exact time diagnostic equipment to their public health labs (RT-PCR (distributes).
One of three genetic exams of the oldest test has caused inappropriate results due to incomplete actions and created a test barrier in Atlanta in CDC; this is why the day is only 2020th of February 100th. Samples can be successfully processed.
From February 2020 to May 28, the tests performed on two dollars were not called reliable, and these tests were not accepted to allow government and local labs to test.
These tests have been confirmed by the food and pharmaceutical administration by an emergency use of an emergency permit. U.S. Business Labs started their tests on March 2020th
LabCorp announced on March 5, 2020 that COVID-19 testes are available to benefit from RT-PCR across the country.
Quest Diagnostic also provided access to COVID-19 test in March 9
No amount of limitations announced, samples collecting and processing should be fulfilled according to CDC demands.
Covid-19 testes in Russia were prepared and put on the way to the government research center.
Test has been registered by federal care services for health on February 11th. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic announced the test of COVID-19 On March 24, 2020, Roche Diagnostic Company received a test license by FDA that will be executed in three half hours, so through a machine will be in 13 hours. 4,128 Tests are done in Cabo.
FDA allowed Abbott m2000 for emergency test use of Abbott m2000 on March 19th; same licenses were given to some laboratories by FDA such as: Halogic, lipcorp and tirmo. Fisher Scientific.
On March 45th, Sifid also received a 21 minute test license for an emergency use by FDA.
FDA accepts the test in which thermal nucleic acids have been used to strengthen thermal nucleic acids instead of PCR.
This method can detect positive results in at least 13 minutes and detect negative results in 5 minutes as the rotating temperature is not required in this method.
Cabo 50,000 pieces of these machines are now available in the USA and Abbott wants to produce these machines to do 18,000 tests a day. In Taiwan, there is a method of testing in Taiwan that is used by an individual anti-body that joins coronavirus nucleoscoped protein (N protein), there is hope that test through this method will be like Take time to 15 to 20 minutes like a cold flu test.
The March 2020 Literature Review has reached the result that ′′ Chest Radio is worth a little diagnosis in the early stages, while CT [calculated tomography] findings may even exist before the marks."
Two-sided glass darkness is public in the environment, contrast and latest distribution of diseases.
Sub seller dominance and Crazy Pewing (with a differently filling of the player's curtain), and getting together may show up with the development of the disease.
A study in Wahan has suggested comparison with PCR with PCR that CT is more sensitive than PCR, although slightly specific, many of these reactions are covered with other patterns and disease processes.
Until March 2020, American Radio College suggests ′′ CT should not be used for first line exam or screening until March 2020, WHO Suggested the definition below of the cases:
A part of the exemption reaction against Macrob is the production of Anti Body including IgM and IgG.
These cases are used to take care of people, to be identified as an exemption system, and to detect the disease of those who have been seen in the first 7 days or after. Tests can be done in central labs (CLT) or through care test (PoCT).
In many clinical labs, high-level automated systems will perform these capabilities to do tests but their existence will depend on the production rate for each system.
A screen blood sample for CLT is commonly used, although series samples are used to react to the exemption system.
For PoCT, a sample of blood is generally taken by skin pouring.
Against the PCR method, before the test is not necessary. On March 2020th, 26, FDA has been appointed to the administration to be alerted and now have the ability to distribute their Anti-Body exams.
From April 2020th to May 7th, only one test confirmed by FDA's emergency use license. Last March 2020, Euromon Medical Diagnostic Laboratory and Epitop Diagnostic Labs received European approval for their Test Pot, which can diagnose the virus in the blood samples IgGG and IgA Anti Body. Do it.
Testing capability is a few hundred samples in hours and so it's very dirty instead of viral RNA testing PCR.
In general Anti-body is diagnosed after 14 visible. In the first of April, the UK has found that no one of their diagnostic device is useful.
Hong Kong has created a design where suspicious patients can stay at home, ′′ Emergency department will give the patient a sample tube they insult, send it back and get the test result later. British NHS has announced that it is a plan for a suspicious cases examination at home, which removes the risk of a patient if it comes to hospital or an ambulance is necessary. Testing through drive for suspicious cases for covid-19, a health care specialist takes a sample of proper caution.
Today's car diagnostic centers have helped South Korea to make the test more widespread than other countries. In Germany, the National Physicist Union of Physicists said on March 10.700 that it has a capacity of around 12,000 tests and 2 tests were taken last week.
When the Dest request is done by the doctor, the costs are done by health insurance.
According to Robert Coach Institut's leader, Germany has a capacity of 160,000 tests in a week.
Until March 19th, Testing has been recommended in many large cities.
The number of tests done until March 26th was not known as only positive pashto figures were spreading.
The first survey of labs showed that up to 2020/12 weeks, all of them completed at least 483,295 testes including 33,491 samples incidents (6.9 %) by SARS-CoV-2 Positive for the virus. In Israel, Technin and Rambam Hospital researchers at the same time have created a method for 64 patients ed test and tested, which is done by combining the samples, and in combined samples. In case of positive incident, more tests are done. On February 2020th, 5th, in Wuhan by BGI 2000 square meter in the area of 2000 square meter for emergency diagnosis (in Chinese: huǒ yǎn or fire eye in English). A lab has been established that will process more than 10,000 samples a day.
BGI founder wang jin with 47 days of construction supervision and 5 days time, modling shows that the case in hobby has increased 47 % and the cost of solving quarantine would have been double if this testing capability. It wasn't at the same time that was raised.
Wuhan Labs Samadelas has been followed by Hu Yan Labs in all 12 cities of China in Shinjin, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai.
On March 50,000th, 2020th, the capacity of testing was 4 test in one day. Open source, shared designs by Oregami Assis that can test the patient samples for COVID19 by using only 1122 test. This balanced design can be done in small labs without the need of a machine liquid.
By March, the incomplete and inadequate amount of education has been difficult for group testing in European Union, England and the United States.
Some authors need to search for sample preparation protocols that include heat samples in 98 208 (5 208) to release RNA genomes for more examinations. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates is now examining more people for Coronavirus than any other country, and the people's examination has reached the level that many people have examined. It is.
It was a compound of a group examination lab from the patient, and from the 42 and BGI group from the 42 and BGI group (based on the ′′ Hu-Yan ′′ Emergency Laboratories in China).
In 14 days, the lab is able to perform tens of thousand RT-PCR examinations every day, and this level is the world's first lab to operate outside China.
Coronavirus Genetic profile marking different parts and performing different examination actions in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and USA.
The International Health Organization has sent a German program to produce kits to those countries that have low income and have no resources to produce their own kits.
Germany's process was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol created by the U.S. centers for disease control wasn't built until January 28, which postponed existing examinations in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the trust of examination kits in the beginning of BBA, and these countries and Australia couldn't provide coffee kits to fulfill the demands and suggestions of health workers.
On the contrary, experts say that the extensive examination possibilities in South Korea have helped to reduce the spread of new coronavirus.
South Korean government has been built in private sector labs at a large level of examination capacity over a few years.
On March 16, the International Health Organization demanded that examination programs be the best way to slow down the COVID-19 BA. The high demands for the development of the virus have caused hundreds of thousands of examinations in private labs, and sobes and chemicals have become difficult.
In March 2020, China reported precision problems in their examination kits.
In the United States, CDC test kits had ′′ incomplete ′′ after which the government removed bureaucratic barriers which prevented examination by private labs. Spanish has bought examinations kits from the Chinese company Shinjin Biotechnology company, but later found out the results aren't right.
The company replied that wrong results may be due to problems or incorrect use of kits in collecting samples.
The Spanish Ministry said they will restore the kits that had wrong results, and instead they will get different examinations from Shinzhen Biwizi company. The Czech Republic who bought any test kits from China, gives 80 % of the wrong kits. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test kits from China, after which the results were found wrong.
Prime Minister Matthews suggested that it should be turned into Danube. Fire Kara from Turkey Ministry of Health said that there are ′′ high-level errors ′′ in Test Cats bought from China and ′′ did not use them England has bought 3.5 million test kits from China but at the beginning of April 2020 announced that purchased kits are not used.
The examinations that are positive, the patients have been quarantine and those who had positive results of SARS-CoV-2, the results are positive.
Researchers who work in 19 Italy, which is the first death area of COVID-3,400 in Italy, with around 3,400 days on the distance of all the people around 3,400 people are doing double exams. Do it.
Nearly half of the people whose examination was positive had no signs, and all the discovered patients were quarantine.
Due to a limited trip to the community, new disease is completely destroyed.
Following an unexpected contact, with the restrictions, examination, and quarantine, 2020 coronavirus disease in Singapore is going more slowly than other developed countries, and on the restorants and retail stores. There are no serious limitations like this.
Many of the ceremony have been cancelled, and Singapore has advised people to stay in homes until March 23, but school has been reopened on time after March 28th holiday.
A number of other countries like Iceland and South Korea have managed this disease, but the level of lockdown or mobility was low.
A statistic study that is very low in those countries that have done a lot of examinations, may be the reason these countries have the best ability to know people who are only less or less. No signs.
The International Health Organization recommends that countries that do not have examination capacity and national labs have limited experience in COVID-19 their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 models are for examination. The International Health Organization sends to 16 labs.
Out of 16 Client Labs are 7 in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the below chart, Colum ′′ as a % positive ′′ examination ′′ Colum is influenced by the country's examination policy.
A country that only checks out the people of visitors to hospitals is % higher than the country that performs the examination of all people, whether people have signs or not, but other things are equal.
Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in the European Union / European Economic Area and Britain (COVID-2020) in the European Union / European Economic Area and Britain (COVID-2020) rapidly spreading incidents, from January 1 to March 15, 2020
Coronavirus Total Disease (COVID-19) cases show the same incidents in European Union / European economic region and England to confirm it, while it relates to the country in different stages, COVID-19 BBA is spreading quickly in all countries.
Based on Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and care units must increase their readiness to increase COVID-19 patients that will need health care and especially serious care.
On December 31, 2019, the case of unknown autology incident in Hobi province, Wuhan was reported.
On January 20, 2020, China's reporting center to a new coronavirus to control and prevent disease, now a severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) It is known by name.
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 Antan has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
So far evidence is that 19 % of people have less illness with COVID-80, for example, short-breath disease from chest hug or without chest hug, and many are healthy.
In Ca 14 % cases, COVID-6 promotes a very serious disease that needs bed in hospital while the remaining 19 % experience serious disease that needs serious attention.
Due to COVID-4, the death of bed patients in hospital is 19 %.
In this research, we evaluate the total incidents of COVID-19 in every European Union / EEA (EU / EEA) in the country and England and compare it with China's Hobi province.
We compare the current number of COVID-31 cases in EV / EEA countries and England during January 2020, 19-March 15 in Italy.
COVID-19 cases in England and European Union / EEA countries.
Recently from China, COVID-19 has been published in geography and the COVID-19 BBA is now following this country around the world.
On March 2020, 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) General Head of CoVID-19 Disease announced as the international BBA.
In Euro Survilance 19 March 5, the first confirmed case has been reported in Europe with the definition of WHO case.
In EU / EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France from China's Hobby, and Wuhan.
As March 2020, 15, the COVID-31 cases were found in all 30 EU / EEA countries and England, while between December 2019 to 19 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported on this date, in 17,750 cases only 1,441 deaths were reported from Italy.
Get the total number of CoVID-19 cases and collection events
In the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), COVID-19 confirmed case is considered in every country, only from official resources such as the Ministry of Health, National and Regional. Health Officials and International Health Organization (WHO) is published every day at 8:00 am.
This information has been used to evaluate COVID-19 events in EU / EEA and England, and it is compared to Italy.
As a sign of active COVID-19 cases expanding, we calculate the 14-day low-19 cases total incidents, so January 1-March 15, 2020 During a long time with a natural course of COVID-19 in every EU / EEA country and England.
We have presented the total number of confirmed cases of each country on March 15 2020 at 8:00 pm, which comparisoned Italy from January 31 to March 15 2020
Covid-19 cases in England and European Union / EEA countries.
In 14 days, this process has been followed by the most COVID-19 cases in EV / EEA countries and England in general after Hobi Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU / EEA and total England, the COVID-2020 total events have started to increase around February 21 and then around February 28 19 (complete items). It's been
These are often caused by rapid increase in cases reported from Italy, but other EU / EEA countries and England have shown the same as COVID-19 (supplementary materials).
Figure 2 for January 31-March 19, 2020 for a period in Italy than this in EV / EEA countries and England.
This says, 3 am March 15, 15 more EU / EEA countries and England reported the same case with Italy just 3 weeks ago or a little bit.
Our results show that the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 are rapidly growing in EU / EEA and England.
The COVID-19 total incidents suggests intensity that develops more than a bubble disease in all countries.
Countries are in different stages, different protocols in national public health reactions, and possibly different defines of case in countries, selecting patients and follow-up testing different protocols that should be approved by COVID-19 Tested for.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors explained the situation in the effective areas of Italy in which 10 % needed serious care of COVID-19 patients and reported media resources that hospitals in these areas and Care units have already reached their high capacity.
In the hospital and / or strong care unit of COVID-1 cases now available for EU / EEA level only for % 6 and % 19 cases (info) It has not been shown).
In any case, they need to be systematically collected to complete the current supervision documents / records that focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study done in 100,000 shows a big difference in the presence of focused care and middle care beds in Europe, which has 4.2 beds in Germany from 29.2 to Portugal. Have
This means countries may have more or less resources than Italy (care and middle care beds in 12 all 100,000 people are on top 12.5) ۔
Modelling scenarios, with every EU / EEA country's attachment and hospitals in England. Covid-90 incidents increase the capacity of concentrated care &gt; 19 % risk, COVID-19 Quick Risk Assessment presented at 19th ECDC.
As the case has been clustered in some areas in EU / EEA countries and England, and hospitals and care units usually select local detention, so information about cases and care beds should be better. Get ready in the name of the area units. For statistics 2 (NUTS-2) level.
Our experience from Italy shows that the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases is rapidly growing in EU / EEA and England.
Countries, hospitals, and care units should provide for healthy care to increase the number of COVID-19 patients, which are with health care., and especially needs serious attention, as it happens in the influential areas of Italy.
As pointed out in ECDC high risk evaluation, the SARS-COV-2 is necessary to delay, active and hustle attitude, to a decrease from a skillful situation, because the number is selected fast. Increase of cases may not give time to hospitals to design, accept and implement your reaction if they don't apply before time.
Risk evaluation also lists public health measures to reduce the impact of disease.
There is a short window of opportunity while countries can increase their control efforts to reduce SARS-CoV-2 spreads and reduce health care stress.
Stay in this, it is possible that other EU / EEA health systems will face the increase of patients that need deep care in the next days or weeks.
Human coronavirus zonotic original / resources.
Change and consent has created coronavirus (CoVs) and their host, which also includes humans.
Before 2003, two human (CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified as the cause of small disease, as normal cold.
Spreading a severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) and a middle eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) metal-metal-showing how devastating and life-durable to be in HCoV.
Last 2019 in Central China, SARS-CoV-2 has turned CoVs back into a remarkable spot and we amazed her high transfer side but her sister SARS-Reduced mental illness than CoV.
HCoV Antan Zonioses and understanding the real HCoVs Zonotics will serve us well.
Many HCoVs have a source of shoppers where they are safe.
Some HCoVs intermediate host has also been identified.
Identifying host has a direct impact on preventing human illnesses.
Investigating CoV-host interactions in the supervision may also get an important view of CoV disease in humans.
In this review, we offer a general review of the existing knowledge on the HCoVs, with their discovery history and their main sources of zones and the intersection transfer focus.
Importantly, we compare different HCoV viruses with a combination of virus upgrade and genome.
Current CoV Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been discussed in this part.
In addition to the screens, the needs of successful host and the intensity of disease have also illuminated the effects of virus upgrading.
Coronavirus (CoVs) depends on the coronavirus family, which has been covered, positive sensible, only RNA viruses.
These viruses that have the largest genome in the RNA virus group from 26 to 32 kg and are called ′′ CoVs under the electric microscope
Structuredly, CoVs have uninterrupted parts genomics that share the same regulation.
Around Genome has two large wide open readings frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which is translated into pp1a and pp1ab transport proteins.
Polyprotins are more processed for production of 16 non-structure proteins, designed nsp1 ~ 16
The rest of the genome has ORFs for structural proteins, including spikes (S), lapfaf (E), jahli (M) and nucleoprotein (N)
Access to a series related proteins have been encoded by various CoVs numbers.
Based on the difference in protein arrangements, CoVs have been classified in four Jenera (Alpha-CoV, Beta-CoV, Gamma-CoV and Delta CoV), in which Beta CoV Jenera has many HCoV and distributed in four series (A, B, C or D).
Poly Genetic has shown the evidence that Shoppers and Moccans work as many Alpha-CoVs and beta CoVs jeans, while the birds are the main stages of Gamma - CoVs and Delta - CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have constantly been raised from some kind of obstacles and some have been raised as a major human diseases.
So far, human (CoVs) have been identified.
Among them are HCoV-229 E and HCoV-NL63 Alpha CoVs.
HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), middle eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2
- OC43 HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause ordinary signs, such as common zakam and / or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV MERS-CoV and the newly known SARS-CoV-2 are very very disturbing, which causes a low respiratory system to create a high respiratory system disease in relatively many patients. Have it.
The first HCoV-1960 E patient, B814, was separated from the incomplete outside of the public disease between 229 years.
Since then, a lot of information has been collected through extensive study in HCoV-229 E and HCoV-OC43, which both causes self-restriction signs.
In fact, the concept has been widely accepted that being infected with HCoVs is generally harmless as long as the SARS is created.
The SARS disease caused in 2003 is the most devastating incident in the current history, and more than 10 people have suffered with almost 8,000 % casualties.
Ten years later, MERS's disease has caused a constant infection in Arabic Island and the rest of the world will spread a spot.
The 2019 Nawal (HCoV (2019-CoV, which has been turned back into the name of SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the current disease 2019 (COVID-19), Who took more than 3,120 lives and killed 91,000 people until March 3, 2020
Danger's call and the world should be ready for the next SARS-CoV-2 BBA.
All HCoVs have a zonotic original from shoppers, mugs or family observers.
Evidence line supports all HCoVs uprising principle from all HCoVs, where viruses are well applied and non-disease but great genetic diversity shows.
COVID-19 has offered a great medical, science, social and ethical challenge to China and the world.
HCoVs main resources chasing zones provides a frame, driving power and species restrictions to understand natural history.
This may make it easy to guide or search for a SARS-CoV-2 host of SARS-CoV-2, which has important signs in preventing future spellers.
In this review we offer the origin of zonotic, intersection transmission and HCoVs disease.
In particular, we point out the common topic and discuss that HCoVs parents viruses especially in their natural resort host but the new host gets sick after the intersection transmission to the new host.
We also look at the HCoV upgrading situation in which the increase of shipping capability often comes with disease reduction.
The current results of SARS-CoV-2 have been held under the discussion.
CoVs have been identified since 1930 years.
Before HCoV-229 E first isolation B814 is breathing from the patient's pose that normal man had a disease, different CoVs were separated in different diseases, including elephant chicken, mouse, cow, chain, cat and Dogs.
In the past decades, HCoV has been identified.
Short information of HCoV discovery history in chronological order (table 1) will be informative and guide.
The first HCoV-229 E pressure was separated from the respiratory flow during the year 1966, and then applied to improve the Wi-38 cabin lines.
Patients suffering from HCoV-20 E have signs of common cold, including headache, bronze, colonic pain, fever and cough seen in 10 ~ 229 % cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was separated from the series passing through the brains of the crooks.
HCoV-OC43 Clinical Features of HCoV-229 E, which in other parts of respiratory disease triangle such as flu A virus and renavirus are not separated from macrobes..
Both HCoV-229 E and HCoV-OC43 have been distributed worldwide, and it's being delivered during the winter season in the climate.
In general, these two viruses are less than a week, and the disease is getting longer / longer.
Human satisfaction study, healthy people who have been suffering with HCoV-229 E create common cold.
Just a few exemption patients have shown a severe respiratory system low flu.
SARS, also known as ′′ Atpical Neumonia the first widely created by HCoV in the history of human being is identified by the disease and the ethological agents are SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS was found in the last 2002 in Guangdong province of China.
As a result of SARS disease, 8,096 cases have been reported that face 774 deaths, which are spread in many countries and greats.
In addition to high publishers, it has been expected to improve the case of almost 4 secondary cases, the impeachment period from 4 to 7 days and the weight of the virus is shown on the 7th day of disease.
In SARS - CoV patients come to the first headache, headache, fever, sickness and disease, after which dispensation, jokes and respiratory problems are signs of delay.
Lemophinia, Testing / Testing, and the high-rising Cretin Kanz are unusual for SARS general lab.
Reducing the damage of the alvalar, growing the opetyl room and also seen in the sars patients.
After almost 20-30 % of patients need deep care and mechanical weather.
Low breathing, several organs including stomach stones, gigger / gigs and pashtoons can also suffer in these difficult events, usually with Sitcoin storm, which may be deadly especially in weak exemption in patients.
Virus was first dismissed from the free of relatives from the biopsy who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzo.
After that, extensive efforts are dedicated to HCoV investigation.
HCoV-NL63 was separated from a 2004-month child from Holland in the last 7
It was started in the beginning of children, adults and recovery patients who have faced respiratory diseases.
The presence of Koreanza, Kenzactuits, fever, and the presence of crobe is common in the disease created by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study in Holland has explained the example of the basic virus isolation.
Although it is known in Nederland, it is really distributed worldwide.
HCoV-NL63 has almost 4.7 % part of normal respiratory diseases, and this high reality occurs in the beginning, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is related to Preventive Laringits, also known as Crup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was dumb from a 71-year-old man who was in hospital with a sample and a disease in Hong Kong.
In addition to the community model and bronchiolites, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported related to acute asmatic disease.
HCoV-NL63 HCoV-229 E and HCoV-OC43 were found in the world, which caused less respiratory diseases.
All of these four communities obtained HCoV have become well ordinary in humans and generally less possible to cause more ills, while the incidents have been created due to unknown reasons as HCoV-NL63 more viral sub. Types of events are happening. Recently reported that in China a short respiratory disease is causing shortness.
Usually, when these HCoVs get the capabilities to effectively transport and keep themselves continuously in humans, they become a little dangerous or sick.
MERS - CoV for the first time in 2012 a-60-year-old patient has caused acute samples and reinal failure in Saudi Arabia.
While many of the confirmed lab cases come from the middle east, the import case has been reported near the second end in different European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary disease occurred in South Korea with 186 confirmed cases in 2015
MERS Clinical Expressions are the same with SARS, identified by the advanced acute models.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also created severe reinal failure, which is very special for Mers in the diseases created by HCoV.
More patients are available with stomach symptoms, such as diarrhea and inflammation.
From February 2500 to 14, 2020, more than 34.4 lab confirmed cases have been reported on a 34.4 % high case, which Mers-CoV created a very deadly virus.
From December 2019 to the end, new patients clusters related to SARS - CoV-2 diseases have been identified, found in China's Hobi Province, Wuhan.
The International Health Organization created by SARS-CoV-2, the current incidents of the international public health concern has announced the emergency condition of this disease as COVID-19
March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases confirmed worldwide, with 3.4 % raw / unconfirmed deaths.
Attention, death case in Hobby, China is 4.2 %, while outside it is 1.2 %.
SARS-CoV-2 causes serious respiratory disease like CoV and MERS-CoV, which is presented as fever, jokes and Dispinia.
In some patients, the diarrhea has also been seen.
Samonia is one of the hardest signs and can promote severe respiratory syndrome.
Though SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-82 are very homology due to 2 % of high nucleotide, they are getting clusters in different branches of filaghetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 Apparently a little cancer disease but more delivery than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-' s 2's's's's's's's's's's's's's
Comparing SARS-CoV-2 with other six HCoVs and the difference shows many benefits differences.
First, the duration of the Inkobation and HCoV disease is the same.
In this part, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general situation of other six HCoVs.
Second, the intensity of COVID-229 marks is available between SARS-CoV and four social obtained HCoVs (for example HCoV-19 E HCoV-OC43 HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 intensities show the forms that are seen more commonly during the HCoVs, including the indefinite, moderate, or even the marks are not available.
On the other hand, the COVID-19 severe case subsidies can also be seen in SARS-CoV Antan, though the fit is a little low.
2rd, SARS-CoV-2 shipping also shows amazing ways to show both features received by the community HCoVs and SARS-CoV.
On one hand, the SARS-CoV-2 shipping capability is at least higher than the community received by HCoV.
On the other hand, it should be confirmed whether SARS-CoV-2 transmission abilities fall in humans after passing as seen in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 should be discovered in the Fixel models.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 sars linguistic transmission plays an important role as the SARS-CoV is illuminated at least by future studies in some cases.
It's especially very interesting to see if the SARS-CoV-2 might explain seasonal as the community received in HCoVs cases.
In any case, the SARS-CoV-2 form of this transmission, disease and continuous spread in humans will be effective for the latest COVID-19
little HCoVs obtained community that create moderate signs have been well implemented in humans.
From another view, it might be true that humans have shown a good match with these four HCoVs.
In other words, both may survive from the former HCoV BBA.
HCoVs that cause severe diseases in humans. And the humans that caused severe HCoV disease have been destroyed.
For this to happen, HCoVs must repeat enough in humans to allow applicable changes to fight host restrictions factors.
Meaning, the more the SARS-CoV-2 disease lasts and the more people suffer from disease, there is more chance that it will be fully familiar with humans.
If this is well known, it will be difficult to stop by the control of the quarantine or other infrastructure measures.
For many years, the four achievements of the community have come in human beings, it is getting colder in the exemplary subjects.
These viruses don't need to be observing.
In contrast, high cancer - SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not good in humans and their transmission cannot continue in humans.
They need to protect and program in their zonotic stones and seek opportunity to promote suspicious human goals. Probably through one or more average and advanced hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has the same shape that both are the same with SARS-CoV / MERS-CoV and four communities obtained HCoV.
It's very deliveryable like HCoVs, at least for now
However, it's a little sicker / sicker than the community received HCoVs and less sick than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
This will be seen if it will fully apply to humans and take a host without a human being.
Before discussing the main resources of HCoVs, it will serve us well to discuss HCoVs upgrading, natural submissions, medium and expanding hosts and characteristics.
A supervisor does a job as a HCoV upgrade host if it relates to close parents that share high homology at Newclotide sequence.
The old virus is often well known and non-disease in this host.
Similarly, the HCoV host is continuously and maintaining for a long time.
In both cases, host has a natural disease and HCoV is a natural host or a virus parents.
In contrast, if the new HCoV is introduced to the middle host before or around humans, this new host doesn't apply well and is mostly sick.
This intermediate host can act as a human infinity zonotic resources and play a transitional role through virus and then play a host role by expanding human infinity.
HCoV can do a death end antenna if it can't protect this delivery in the middle host.
On the contrary, HCoVs can join the middle host and create even long-term profit.
In this situation, the middle host is hosted by natural stones.
By considering the Epidemological Data, it shows that the SARS Index case has a history of relationship with the supervisors.
SARS-CoV IgG has a high level of SARS-CoV IgG.
In live supervision markets, Mask Seats (Pigoma Larvata) and Raccoon dog first known to send SARS-CoV - such as viruses that are close to the same as SARS-CoV.
It was indirectly supported by the fact that there was no more SARS report after killing all the siege in the market.
However, it has been reported that the masked cubs were negative for SARS-CoV without reaching the wilderness or farms, suggests that the mask is only hosted by the middle level but the CoV-SARS Natural Natural Nature.
Attention, since 80 % of different supervisors in the markets in Guangzo have anti-anti-anti-antibodies, possibilities for small-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-s-cov may host a medium-level SARS-CoV as well. Serve.
This all looks like the end of SARS-CoV death host.
Looking for a natural host of SARS-CoV has revealed a close-related CoV evening, named SARS Renolovs CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3, which is available in Chinese Harsusho Shoppers.
These shoppers are positive for SARSR-RH-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence and SARS-CoV Anti-Bods.
This and other covs share with SARS-CoV's 92-88 % newclotide homology sequence.
These studies have created the basis of a new idea that Katmat hosts human-creating human corgio.
Several types of coronavirus (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in the evening, but no one can be separated as a virus except for WIV1.
The human angiotensin change enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a SARS-CoV buyer or admirer.
An unprecedented wiv1 in the evening's unprecedented wiv1 that uses this virus to enter the room as an evening pantry, wandering and human ACE2 to enter the room.
It's important to be neutralized by SARS recovered patients or dynamics of WIV1.
So far, WIV1 is representing the closest SARS-CoV in the evening, which has 95 % of the Nucleotide series with the same governor.
Although there are more similarities between these two viruses, general belief is that WIV1 is not a near-parent virus and the evening's sARS-CoV is not hosted by a near SARS-CoV protector.
Philippines Analysis and Analysis of MERS-CoV evening cov-HKU4 and evening cov-HKU5 in the same group as the CoV-HKU5.
The evening's MERS-HKU4 and MERS-CoV both use the same host to enter the virus, Deepptidale Peptidies 4 (DPP4).
RNA-RNA-CoV related RNA Polymers series identified in Europe and Africa the evening mister beta-CoVs is close to the same.
So far, no live MERS-CoV could be found in the wild evening.
MERS-CoV and the closest relatives of this evening cov-HKU25 have only 87 % nucleotide series with the same.
That's why the evening's mers-CoV may not be hosted near MERS-CoV.
Another, studies in the middle east have shown that Arabic tears have had positive results for MERS-CoV special neutral anti-Buddies, just like many African countries like the middle eastern tears.
MERS-CoV has been separated from Arabic tears, which are sprinkled by the light that the tears are hosted by MERS-CoV's main guardians.
It's also a reminder that there were often mild symptoms in MERS-CoV for experience but the virus was very wide in it.
It's a reminder that the tears are not only sprinkled by respiratory paths but also through the mouth-mouth, which is also the main way to spread the virus in the evening.
Anyways, questions still remain as many of the MERS confirmed incidents have no history of any relationship with tears before the start of symptoms, apparently human is not sent to human or attributed to unidentified ways of transmission. Included life includes which MERS-CoV has.
SARS-CoV-96.2 SARS-96.2 SARS-CoV-2 SARS-CoV-96.2 SARS-CoV-96.2 SARS-96.2 SARS-CoV-96.2 SARS-96.2 Nucleotide
In SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV events, the series of differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are too much to select a birth relationship.
Meaning the evening's maker may not be hosted by SARS-CoV-2, if near the next one can be found in the evening's hustle coronavirus.
Possibly, the SARS-CoV-2 mid-hosts must be bought in the wholesale sale of Hanan Marine food market between the killed wildlife, where many of the first incidents of COVID-19 were closed., which is a sign of a possible transmission incident to a human being.
A few recent studies of the metagenomic series Probanset has given the idea that the small animals known as the mister (Manis Yavanica) may also have heritage beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
The new pengoline CoV these genomics have a joint series of 2 % of homologies with SARS-CoV-85-92
But, they are similarly related to RaTG13 that the Newclotide series is almost 90 % the same.
They collect viruses like SARS-CoV-2 in two sub-families groups, one of them with SARS-CoV-2 more similar mixing area (RBD) Have, which 97.4 % of the mino acid series is the same.
Very differently, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, RBD are very different, though the genome-vast homological series size.
A previous study of the disease has also reported on a viral disease, which relates to SARS-CoV-2
Different ways of uniting and handicapped in this study to produce a genome series with the combination of viral genome nearly 86.3 % full-length.
We can't even notice that my sister is one of the SARS-CoV-2 Middle Hosts.
But, at the moment, SARS-CoV-2 and the mild sister SARS-CoV-2 related to beta-CoVs due to the different series, Miggy sister and SARS-CoV-2 There is no evidence of a direct supporter of origin.
Besides, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is more short than the SARS-CoV-2 and the mild sister SARS-CoV-2 related to beta-CoVs.
The SARS-CoV-2 growth route hasn't been found yet in the drinks, mastery sisters and other animals.
While the high homological series between SARS-CoV-2 and Miggy sister has been found in RBD, SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 has a joint homological homological homological between high-level genome-wide series.
It's a very interesting thing that the SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 high level of RBDs is due to the growth of the best intermediate components.
Another suggestion re-production between 2rd wild animals in the types of 2rd wild animals SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoV and RaTG13.
As a progressive power, the production is very wide in the beta-CoVs.
SARS-CoV-2 judgement is still far away.
Besides this high level sick HCoVs, HCoV-229 E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 Animal origin has also been studied.
Philippines evidence shows that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229 E may be born from the covs, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 inherited in the family of mouse.
Report has been given that ARCoV. 2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) has shown close contact with HCoV-NL63 in the three colors of North America found in three colors.
On the other way, HCoV-19/2008 E is related to the other Genetic CoV, named Hipposideros / GhanaKwam / 229, found in Ghana, while in the family of tears. There is also doubt as the middle host.
For clarification, the current information briefs on the origin of HCoVs came in 1 form and 2 table.
Historically, HCoVs has presented biological analysis for the transmission of events between animals.
When HCoV-OC43 domestic animals came to humans in around 1890, a respiratory disease has been recorded.
The HCoV-229 E transmission history has a little clarity.
The alpha-CoVs that are close to HCoV-229 E has been found.
There are alpaca alpha-CoV between these.
A few different evidence supports the transmission of viruses between people and people.
First, it is possible that in the surrounding area, humans not alpaca had a relationship with drinks.
But, humans have a close relationship with alpaca.
Second, the alpha-CoVs related to HCoV-229 E are different and doesn't bring the organs in the drones, while the alpaca alpha-CoV has caused the respiratory disease in the suffering animals..
As a result, alpaca alpha-CoV is not found in wild animals.
Because, it can't stop the alpaca taking alpha-CoV-229 E from humans.
In fact, dirty is a direct source of human disease viruses including crazy dog virus, Ebola Virus, Nipha Virus and Hendra Virus.
Because it's not so amazing that the seats could directly transfer HCoV-229 E to humans.
On the other way, while the alpha-CoVs works as a HCoV-229 E inheritance source, alpacas and a book's tears can be hosted to transmits viruses to humans, as It shows the case of MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV is a good example of spreading animals between a book tears and the tears of a book.
The origin of MERS-CoV growth has been identified in the first round and has been supported in recent findings.
It's clear that a rich source of viruses between inheritance and animals to spread the inheritance.
Long life, high-level, close social relationships and flying power are all those supportive situations that make the virus suitable programmer.
On the other side, MERS-CoV has been sent to a book tears over decades.
It's become a good habit with these animals that turned into a stable and natural source from a middle host.
MERS-CoV causes many low-level disease and keeps the low level of change in these animals.
This irregular transmission to humans is an event and humans are host to the end of MERS-CoV because they can't continue to spread.
Against tears in the MERS-CoV transmission, if any of the MERS-CoV's share, is different in publishing SARS-CoV-2
Specifically, the mud sister beta-CoVs are very sick at the high level in the mugs.
In the case of SARS-CoV families, they may be a host of beta-CoVs-2 end of beta-CoVs.
Different dissemination for animals from animals to humans from SARS-CoV-2 for animals should be accepted or not accepted.
First, may be the same host source of the SARS-CoV-2 virus related to SARS-CoV-2
Maybe humans can share the area of the same environment with the way of butchers or sackers.
2nd, may be a very intermediate host that has been sent to the SARS-CoV-2 virus recently.
Humans are suffering from the ways of butchers and eating the meat of the hunt.
Might be weak against SARS-CoV-2
A survey of families and wild animals is necessary for Anti-Body.
Third, as said above, may have come between the SARS-CoV-2 re-mixing and getting used to third animals that are connected to both drinks and siblings.
SARS-CoV-2 Animal Search is also going on.
Without different types of host animals, three important causes of viral transmission to animals are also important.
First of all, most of their high change level in RNA back production.
As opposed to other RNA wire viruses, CoVs can be from ′′ medium ′′ to ′′ higher and the medium change level ~ 10-4 per year in every 2 areas, And it's about the new host to the CoV round.
CoVs have an Xoribonoclis correction, which is the result of removal of high level change and decrease or not.
Notice is that the Newclotide Analog Remedswer has been identified to prevent CoV reproduction through this Xoribonoclis and RNA-related RNA Palimers.
Remedsaware is very motivating against SARS-CoV-2 factors to be tested clinically.
But, the CoVs change level is almost a million times more than their host.
Besides, the change level is high when CoVs is not a good habit with hosts.
The change of high level than SARS-CoV, is seen as low as the change level of SARS-CoV-2, which means a high-level habit with humans.
Maybe it's used to the same host to human beings.
Besides SARS-CoV-2, it's also related to MERS-CoV, which has become a good habit with the tears of a book.
Theoretically, it's impossible that the genetic change will prove vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and anti-virus very soon.
nd, in CoVs the large RNA genome transformation and re-composition route uses more softly in genome change, as it increases the mix-growth-growth-growth, when the condition is appropriate, it is useful to come in between new CoVs..
This support is finally doing 3 ' coded open reading frames and more special performance of proteins.
rd, CoVs changes the irregular and re-production of RNA through a special ′′ version options
In a host that serves as a co-cov, the wire change comes repeatedly during the CoV RNA registration.
High-level same full-length and sub-genomic RNA can reunite to produce new CoV.
Natural re-composition biological evidence has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in CoV animals such as SL-CoV and CoV-HKU9.
Virus-Host Relationship Relationship
Aside from three viral factors mentioned above, transmission between animals is another important factor.
Because, the SARS-CoV's back combination was taken as a common example, which also showed positive options during animal transmission incidents.
A probinstate between human and cat is thought to be used to rapidly in different corbo, especially S protein changes in RBD.
Generally, a CoV protein RBD connects with a room buyer and is chosen strongly by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is in the 510th to 510th of 510th of 510th of 510th of 510th of 510th of 510th of 510th of 510th of 510th of 510th of 510th of 510th of 510th of 510th of 510
SARS-CoV, RBD can identify different animals, including the cotton, cat, museum and racon dog buyer ACE2, which allows to spread the virus between animals.
In fact, it's been seen that only 6 min acid remaining in RBD was different from human and wild cat and 4 are located in a buyer-connecting design for ACE2.
The cat SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T changes in its RBD, which may increase the spike protein relationship with the ACE2 buyer.
In other words, the changes of these two amino acids may be important to get used to viruses with humans.
It's worth saying that SARS-CoV-2 has the same mixed room buyers with SARS-CoV.
The 2 % difference between SARS-CoV-30 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit shows that human's interested in connecting S protein with ACE2 can change.
Truly, a cryo-EM study has shown a high level of connection from 20 to 10, which is between human's ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
This would also be interesting to find out if any friend buyers might be necessary to publish SARS-CoV-2
Amazing thing is that HCoV-NL63 has also connected to ACE2 but with another part of S.
There are many buyers of HCoV, such as Amino Peptides N for HCoV-9 E, and HCoV-OC43 for 229-O-acetate silk acid.
After spreading animals from their animal host they may also be considered to make these CoVs a successful habit.
Besides the pods, the result of spreading HCoVs is also managed by another host needs and restrictions factors.
HCoVs such as the dirty, the tears of a book, the mocks of the human and natural resource hosts can be a barrier to spreading between animals.
HCoVs must pass host needs factors and eliminate host restrictions.
Because, the malical factors in this important area of Virus-Host Relationship still need to be identified and explained.
Using a modern CRISPR Technology could be useful for the Genome-Widespread Unit Examination of SARS-CoV-2 for Hosting Needs and Hosting Factors.
Coming to the middle of the new HCoVs: Back to the main place
Many types of CoVs provide more opportunities to come to the new HCoVs.
So, HCoVs is the source of HCoVs jeans.
Screens, quick change and genetic re-composition also has a part of HCoV growth and works as two important steps in this series.
For example, gaining or losing new protein-coding genes is capable of changing severely viral.
Among SARS-CoV friends proteins, it is thought that ORF8 is important in getting used to human, as the SARS-CoV has been isolated but found to enact different proteins of ORF8.
A 29-Newclotide has a SARS-CoVs feature to be found in the beginning of human diseases.
Removing this ORF8 separates in ORF8a and ORF 8b and is thought to be a habit change in the host change effort.
Besides this, the SARS-CoV has a possible reunion history whose family is Alpha and Gemma-CoVs, where the RNA-required reunion of RNA Palmers are found.
The back-composition locations are also known in nsp9, many nsp10, and also in nsp14 parts.
Similarly, it has been shown that MERS-CoV has experienced a re-combination among different families, which has come to the middle of a book of Saudi Arabia.
Besides this SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have also been seen in other HCoVs, in these HCoVs are back in their unnatural structure jeans with other CoVs.
It should also be considered that artificial options can take part in the transformation of Viral Genomez, to many of the results from the selected pressure, such as the host safety system is free of viruses.
A sample of these effects is to lose a full length of ORF4 in HCoV-229 E, due to removal of two nucleotide.
While the full ORF4 can be seen in the viruses that are related to HCoV-229 E, the alpaca alpha-CoV connecting shows an individual nucleotide, the result is changing.
As a result, the growth of new HCoVs is also developed by the options pressure in their hosts.
No signs of disease or just a low sign disease found when the covs suffered, it shows a common habit between CoVs and drinks.
Seems to be a better habit with CoVs automatically and physiologically.
For example, the effects of the pearl reactivation actively reduces the activation of CoVs.
Besides this, Natural Killer Room Activity is prevented by NKG2 / CD94 and the main level equivalent of I-degree malicoles to prevent above activity.
Besides, high-level reactive oxygen types (ROS) produced due to high metabolic activity can both produce CoV back and prevent correction effects by Xoribonicles, because when a very sick virus is a new host. Shipped to provide the pressure for the production.
Very sick CoV viruses can change to a back combination, and take new protein or protein format to get used to the host.
Because, it's not a chance that three new HCoVs have come between the past two decades.
CoVs in their host s' lashes such as in tears and tears or causes less illness.
They're producing quickly without showing a powerful reaction to the host safety system.
That's why there's a mystery here why the ills are seen and what causes hard cases in human suffering.
Hard signs are actually due to high performance of safety reaction and Sitocaine star, or the more the power of safety response is, the more the loss of the head.
In other words, the immunity reaction in unmissible patients has been separated from the production of CoV.
The same strategy of separating immunity reaction may have useful effects in anti-CoV-2 treatment.
Interferen reaction is especially powerful in the years.
Because, giving I type of interfere in the first round of human beings in SARS-CoV-2 should be useful.
Besides, NLRP3 Inflamasum Activation has the effects of NLRP3 Inflamasum.
With this argument, preventing NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19
Coming between SARS-CoV-2 follows the general view that came between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While found to share 96 % of the same nucleotide with a sARS-CoV, there is also a bat-CoV with 2 % SARS-CoV. Newclotide is sharing the structure.
While cats and other animals have been found in markets that have the same viruses to SARS-CoV, near SARS-CoV-2 is not identified.
Found to be the same as SARS-CoVs-2, it shows that the sars can be a middle host or a mild sister beta-CoVs may be a SARS-CoV-2 Participate with Jean Toto in the result example.
Although questions remain, there's no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was made by human being.
CoVs has been re-commoned due to the last coming between SARS-CoV-2
The CoVs study in other animals has changed our awareness to the human being of HCoVs and in animals the importance of animal and animal principle.
General evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are the main principle of sars-CoV-2 and is spread to humans through intermediate hosts.
Seeing that SARS-CoV Virus is a relationship between humans and cats in markets, closed markets and killed cats could have destroyed the SARS Sari disease.
The same reasoning probinstate, the muds have to be removed from landmarkets to prevent animal spreading, as the mud sister beta-CoVs is close to SARS-CoV-2 and a number of links found.
But, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is spread to humans through the ways of eating or other animals should be explained in future research.
MERS-CoV has been available for a long time in a book tears.
These tears serve as an important source for local people as a central source of meat, milk, leather and small products.
They are widely available in the middle east and Africa.
That's why it's impossible to sacrifice all the tears for MERS control, as they were done in China's landmarkets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
To prevent MERS reposting, a great attitude should be chosen to create more effective vaccine for the MERS-CoV.
Just like we can't remove the virus, new genotypes may come in between and bring the spread.
There are so many types of CoVs in the wildlife.
Especially the covs have many types with animal potansial.
There are so many opportunities to change and reintegrate this animal CoVs, resulting in the middle of new CoVs that are more spreading in the future and / or deadly in humans.
In some places of China, the culture of wild animals should be prevented to reduce the relationship between humans and animals.
A plan for preparation and response for problems of SARS, MERS and COVID-19 must be created.
In fact, there are many viruses in the world since a long time.
They stay in their natural bars until they get the opportunity to spread.
Although there are many forms that help spread viruses, the chance of human relationship with other wild animals can be reduced if people are given awareness to stay away from them.
Continuous observation from animals is necessary to gain awareness from CoVs environment and corbo natural environment, which will prove useful in preventing animal to human in the future.
As a result, the most effective way to prevent animal virus for humans is to stay away from the natural environment of animal viruses.
SARS-CoV-2 A few pieces are still lost in the mystery of the SARS-CoV-2
First, if the SARS-CoV-2 is spreading to the sisters, it would be interesting to see it until the condition of the underworthy and hungry foods can share it with the environment area.
Second, if a person has a direct part in spreading a person, it should be known how humans come in relationship with the tears.
Third, if a third animal acts as an original host, it's how to connect with different animals with humans, drinks and thirsty sisters, it should be clear.
As a result, since most animals including domestic animals can be weak against SARS-CoV-2, both supervision and experimental spread should be done.
If this is a drink, a sister or another animal, it's expected to be SARS-CoV-2 or heritage viruses that are close to them will be recognized in their natural hosts in the future.
Continuous research in animals will explain SARS-CoV-2 growth ways in humans, which will be important in preventing and controlling results of COVID-19
