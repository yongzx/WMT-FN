Joint report on the parallel audits of expenditure on the construction of the Prague motorway - Dresden Preliminary remark Without trans-European motorways, modern, united Europe could only cope with the high volume of traffic between the partner countries with considerable restrictions and quality losses.

High-quality transport networks are indispensable for maintaining and increasing living standards in Europe.
Ensuring fast, safe, reliable and economical passenger and freight transport is an important task for the state.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
It requires a high degree of organisational, technical and financial effort.
When building and developing a sustainable European transport infrastructure, difficult compromises often have to be made with European and national political objectives, such as the preservation of the environment.
It is precisely because of the necessary environmental protection measures that the construction of the transport infrastructure is complex.
When planning and awarding the construction of transport routes, administrations can save considerable financial resources through careful action and decision-making and use them for other useful purposes.
One of the tasks of state audit authorities is to identify deficiencies that preclude optimum economy, cost-effectiveness and effectiveness in expenditure on the construction of transport facilities.
The audit authorities should not only alert administrations to the shortcomings identified, but also make suggestions for improvements for the benefit of citizens and for the benefit of Europe.
Summary
In 2005 and 2006, the two Supreme Audit Authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic, the Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) and the Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad (NKò), carried out parallel audits of expenditure for the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway (motorway D 8 in the Czech Republic and motorway A 17 in the Federal Republic of Germany).
The two motorways are connected by a border bridge jointly financed by both states.
The cooperation with the NKò enabled the BRH to carry out an in-depth examination of the cost-effectiveness of the use of funds in the construction of the border bridge.
In the course of its cooperation with the BRH, the NKò received data from German bridges and tunnels for its own cost comparisons.
In 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany signed a contract for the construction of the border bridge.
According to the planning progress, the date of completion was finally set for the end of 2006.
During the award procedure, however, the Road and Motorway Directorate of the Czech Republic (RMD) made errors that delayed the procedure and shortened the available construction time.
The contract with the contractor was therefore concluded later than planned.
The contractor assured the accelerated construction of the bridge by the end of 2006.
However, the RMD had to accept considerable additional costs.
As part of the joint audit activity, the prices of motorway bridges on the D 8 and the A 17 were compared. The benchmark for the price comparison of the bridges was the size of the bridge area.
A price analysis using statistical methods identified bridges with high costs per square metre.
The analysis showed that the border bridge under the large bridges with lengths of over 100 m was the most expensive.
This was also due to the price increase as a result of the delays in the award.
The comparison of the prices of the tunnels showed that the prices of the tunnels in the course of the D 8 are considerably higher than the prices of comparable tunnels in Germany.
In future audits of the profitability of expenditure on transport infrastructure, both BRH and NKò can rely on a data collection of bridge and tunnel prices.
Both courts of auditors recommend standardizing bridge structures and carrying out steel composite and special structures only where prestressed concrete structures are inappropriate.
The course of the examination was characterized by teamwork and an open approach.
During the parallel examination, the examiners from both sides exchanged their expertise and skills.
Introduction
The subject of this report is the parallel audits of expenditure on the construction of the motorway from Dresden to Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and A 17 in Germany).
The audit focused on economy, cost-effectiveness and effectiveness of the use of funds.
The parallel tests were conducted by the BRH in Germany and the NKò in the Czech Republic
in 2005 and 2006.
The NKò examined the economy, cost-effectiveness and effectiveness of the expenditure for the border section 0807 of the D 8 motorway in the amount of approximately 20 billion CZK gross (approximately €690 million).
Of this amount, €64 million will be allocated from EU Structural Funds (ISPA).
Independently of the parallel tests with the NKò, the BRH had already examined the planning and construction of the A 17 motorway between 2003 and 2005.
Of the financial volume for the construction of all three sections of the A 17 of approximately €670 million, €277 million will be co-financed by European Funds (ERDF).
The Prague-Dresden motorway is part of the Pan-European Transport Corridor IV Dresden - Central and Southeastern Europe - Istanbul.
The D 8 runs from Prague via Usti nad Labem to the Czech / German border,
the A 17 from the border to Dresden.
At the time of the inspection, the border sections of the motorways were under construction.
Both sections were opened to traffic on 21 December 2006.
While the motorway is thus completed on the German side to Dresden, the D 8 remains incomplete on the Czech side, as the section 0805 over a length of 16.4 km between Rehlovice and Lovosice is still in the planning phase.
Here the crossing of a protected landscape area in the Bohemian Central Uplands is planned.
According to Czech forecasts from 2001, traffic in 2008 in the border section 0807 of the D 8 motorway will amount to 22 940 vehicles per day.
German forecasts estimate the volume of traffic on the A 17 at the Czech border in 2010 at around 25,000 vehicles per day.
In 2000, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic concluded a contract for the merger of the German motorway A 17 and the Czech motorway D 8 at the common state border by building a border bridge.
Since both states are involved in the construction of this bridge, this individual construction project represented an important aspect of the parallel audits of both courts of auditors.
Cooperation between BRH and NKò
From mid-2005, both courts of auditors made joint considerations on cooperation in the examination of the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway.
Both sides had important reasons for this cooperation:
1.
Germany is partly financing the construction of the border bridge.
Planning and construction are the responsibility of the Czech Road Construction Administration.
There was no possibility for the BRH to examine this construction project itself.
2.
The NKò had no comparative data to assess whether the funds were used sparingly with regard to the total construction costs of the bridges and tunnels on the D 8.
3.
The NKò also had to examine the effectiveness of the expenditure by examining the essential technical parameters of the bridges and tunnels, which should ensure the same quality of use on both sides of the border.
After preparatory negotiations, the Presidents of the two Court of Auditors concluded an agreement on the coordination of the audits of the Prague-Dresden motorway on 4 January 2006.
The auditors of both courts of auditors met at intervals of about six to eight weeks in the course of 2006.
They dealt with current problems and tasks. They developed a uniform methodology for testing bridge and tunnel prices, exchanged test results for the construction of the border bridge and prepared joint reports.
Essential to the cooperation was the ongoing exchange of information.
While the BRH devoted itself primarily to the comparison of the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels as well as the award procedures, the NKò mainly developed the methodology for the analysis of bridge and tunnel prices.
In Germany and the Czech Republic, the legal basis for financial control differs and thus also the way in which the two courts of auditors complete their audits.
Therefore, both authorities prepared separate national reports on their audit results.
This report takes into account the results of the two parallel tests.
The cooperation ends with the signing of a final communiqué in the first half of 2007.
Construction of the border bridge
In the 2000 treaty, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed to complete the border bridge in 2005 if possible.
They later postponed the date by mutual agreement until the end of 2006.
The RMD acted as the client of the construction project.
Germany contributes 42.13% to the construction of the bridge.
Initially, the RMD envisaged a prestressed concrete construction for the border bridge.
However, the RMD agreed with its German partner in 1999 on the construction of a steel composite structure.
They justified this decision with the possible reduction of the number of pillar pairs from seven to five and the associated ecological benefits for the floodplain.
In addition, a comparative calculation of the RMD had shown the steel composite structure as the more cost-effective solution.
However, this was due to a calculation error.
The calculation assumed a length of the new steel composite structure of only 397 m,
In fact, it is 5% longer.
During the award procedure, the RMD made serious errors,
by insufficiently preparing the award documents and inaccurately describing both evaluation criteria and sub-criteria.
These errors led to subjective and ambiguous assessments of the evaluation commission and the director general of the RMD.
A losing bidder challenged the outcome of the award procedure.
The subsequent investigation by the Czech Antitrust Office delayed the signing of the construction contract for the border bridge.
As a result, the summer construction season following the bid review was lost in 2004 and the total construction time available was shortened.
The contractor agreed to build the bridge in a shorter time, resulting in a significant price increase.
Among the measures offered were the double assembly of the superstructures, the change of the pillar shape and the construction of an assembly hall.
In addition, the contractor was unable to procure the originally intended type of steel.
The new type of steel - whose higher costs of around €4 million were borne by the client alone - made it possible to shorten the construction time planned for corrosion protection and thus the total construction time.
Compared to the offer price of approximately €18.3 million net, the acceleration measures and further supplements will significantly increase the total construction costs of the border bridge.
The shortened construction period alone led to a price increase of approximately €5.9 million.
Without price sliding, the costs are currently around €25.9 million net (as of October 2006).
Comparison of prices of bridges and tunnels
Both courts of auditors examined the bridge prices on the D 8 and the A 17 in order to identify the bridges, which were characterized by particularly high prices and to compare bridge prices on the German and Czech sides.
The study was based on mathematical statistical methods.
The tunnels on the D 8 were compared with similar tunnels on the German motorways A 71, A 38 and A 4, as there were no comparable tunnels on the A 17.
In preparing this part of the exam, a precise definition of the price concept was important.
For the comparison of bridge prices, both courts of auditors agreed on detailed specifications, such as: to use the current price paid for the bridge without VAT.
(VAT rates in the Czech Republic and Germany vary and may change), not to take into account the costs of special start-up measures, to use the exchange rate of the European Central Bank of 30 December 2005 for currency conversion (29 CZK = 1 €).
Bridges of various types (reinforced concrete, prestressed concrete, steel composite and steel) and various sizes are available on both the D 8 and the A 17.
In order to ensure the comparability of the tested bridge structures, the bridges were grouped according to their design.
The analyses also took into account the bridge size within these groups.
By far the most common were concrete bridges on both sides of the border (20 bridges on the D 8 and 36 bridges on the A 17).
The study focused on this type of bridge, as the size of the sample allowed the application of mathematical statistical methods and improved the reliability of the results.
The study showed that the m ² price of the concrete bridges on the D 8 / A 17 depends on the bridge size (length, road surface): the larger the bridge, the lower the price per square metre.
For German bridges, the correlation between price and size is more pronounced than for Czech bridges (see illustrations below).
On the A 17 two bridges could be found, on the D 8 four bridges with significantly increased price.
These bridges were determined partly by a method for detecting significant deviations within a sample and partly by regression analysis of the correlation between bridge price and size (atypically expensive bridges can be identified based on the distance to the regression curve).
However, the atypically high price of these bridges should only serve as an indication of which bridges should be concentrated on.
In order to draw final conclusions, the causes of the respective high price must be determined in individual cases.
This could be due, for example, to uneconomic administrative action, but also to the requirements for protecting the environment or other legitimate reasons.
Taking into account the larger average length of Czech concrete bridges compared to the German ones (see table 1), the proven negative correlation between the bridge price and the length suggested that the Czech concrete bridges would be cheaper.
This was also supported by the lower labour costs in the Czech Republic compared to Germany.
However, the evaluation of the results showed that the price of the concrete bridges on the D 8 is higher than on the A 17.
During joint meetings, two reasons for this situation were identified:
1.
In Germany, construction contracts for bridges are mainly awarded separately.
This also enables medium-sized companies to participate in the award competition.
In the Czech Republic, many bridge buildings are awarded as part of larger contracts for the construction of several kilometres of motorway sections.
Orders of this magnitude cannot be handled by medium-sized enterprises.
2.
In the Czech Republic, the variety of bridge constructions built is greater than in Germany.
In this context, the NKò noted that the construction method of bridges is determined long before construction begins,
already at the submission of the application for planning approval by the RMD.
At this time, it selects a certain bridge construction variant from several alternatives. However, economic efficiency plays a minor role in this decision.
Only by means of a thorough analysis of the construction industries of both countries would a final conclusion have been possible with regard to bridge prices in the Czech Republic and Germany. However, this would have gone beyond the scope of this audit.
The border bridge is the most expensive steel composite bridge on the D 8 and A 17.
The prices for the tunnels on the D 8 are about twice as high as in Germany.
However, a comparison of the technical parameters between the tunnels on the D 8 and the tunnels in Germany revealed no significant difference.
The significant price differences may be the result of too little competition for tunnels in the Czech Republic.
However, the small number of tunnels did not allow generalizing conclusions.
Economy and effectiveness of the Dresden motorway - Prague
The independent Czech Republic was founded in 1993.
In the same year, the government adopted the plan for the expansion of the motorway network.
It was planned to gradually expand the D 8 from Prague to the state border with Germany.
Section 0805 was to be built through the Bohemian Central Uplands before the border section 0807.
The Czech Republic finances the D 8 as part of the programme financing.
The programme number 327 220 "Construction of the motorway D 8 Prague - Ústí nad Labem - Czech German state border" defines two objectives:
1.
as a national objective: to improve the link between Prague and Ústi nad Labem;
2.
as an international destination: the connection between Prague and Berlin as part of the Pan-European Transport Corridor IV BerlinIstanbul.
The programme envisaged completing the construction of the section through the Bohemian Central Uplands in June 2008 and the construction of section 0807 near the border in June 2007.
It should be noted that the end of the construction work is not identical to the time of commissioning.
The NKò noted that the planning approval decision had already been issued for the construction of the section leading through the Bohemian Central Uplands.
Environmental associations have appealed against this decision.
A final judgment is still pending.
Compared to the schedule provided for in the programme documentation, a delay in the completion of section No.0805 by several years could not be ruled out.
In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed a postponement of the completion date of construction phase No.0805 to 2010.
As a result, the construction of the border section did not achieve the national goal of improving the connection between Prague and Usti nad Labem.
The RMD subjected the border section No. 0807 of the D 8 and section No.0805 through the Bohemian Central Uplands to a profitability study in the years 1999 to 2001.
As investment costs, it estimated approximately €639 million for both sections No. 0805 and No. 0807.
Table 2: Results of the profitability study (EIRR = internal interest rate)
Variant Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.
Traffic volume in the northern part of the border section 18 000 vehicles per day in 2010.
Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.
Traffic volume in the northern part of the border section 22 000 vehicles per day in 2010.
Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.
Traffic volume in the northern part of the border section 25 000 vehicles per day in 2010.
The profitability study from 2001 was based on the assumption that the section near the border and the section leading through the Bohemian Central Uplands go under traffic simultaneously.
At the time of the examination it was obvious that the section through the Bohemian Central Uplands would not be opened on the original date.
This reduces the aforementioned EIRR values.
The costs of both sections as at 31.12.2005 were €897 million excluding VAT and thus 27.4% higher than in the profitability assessment 2001.
In addition, there is a risk that section 0805 will have a different more complex route, which would affect the profitability of the project.
The economic assessment showed that the construction of both motorway sections with a daily traffic volume of at least 18,000 vehicles per day in 2010 is economically justified.The forecast for 2008 had predicted 22,940 vehicles per day.
However, a study on diversion routes as an alternative to the missing section through the Bohemian Central Uplands assumes a traffic volume of 12 600 to 13 750 vehicles per day in 2007. The project is then below the profitability limit.
A higher volume of traffic on the routes, which are intended to replace the missing section with the Bohemian Central Uplands, is highly likely to result in congestion and thus increased external costs, which were not taken into account in the original profitability study.
The aforementioned reduction in revenue and increase in costs means that the already low EIRR for the construction of the border section of the D 8 will not be achieved.
The construction of the border section of the D 8 is therefore uneconomical.
Also in the construction of the A 17 there were cost increases as in the construction of the two above-mentioned sections of the D 8.
As part of the macroeconomic assessment for the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan 1992, the Federal Ministry responsible for transport assumed investment costs of around €320 million.
It thus determined a benefit / cost ratio of 4.6.
In the meantime, costs have increased to around €670 million and the benefit / cost ratio has been reduced by more than half.
Independently of the parallel tests with the NKò in the years 2003 to 2005, the BRH had examined the profitability of the planning and construction of the A 17 motorway.
He noted that the authority responsible for the approval demanded an unnecessary landscape tunnel for the third section of the A 17.
In the course of the examination, the BRH succeeded in convincing the Federal Ministry and the Road Construction Administration of the superfluity of the landscape tunnel.
This avoided €10 million in construction costs and €150,000 in annual operating costs.
During the examination of the first section of the A 17, the BRH found that the construction project was inadequately prepared.
The following example illustrates this:
During the planning phase, the road construction administration refrained from assessing the condition of the rock on the surface of the Dölzschener Wand, as it was difficult to access.
Only when the tunnel tunnelling reached the wall did she make up for it.
It turned out that the rock was more weathered than assumed in the tender.
Complex measures such as anchorages, injections and rockfall protection nets for around €3.3 million were necessary.
The road construction administration not only borne the costs for additional, already necessary services such as securing the Dölzschener Wand, but also for those that would not have been necessary in a flawless construction preparation.
These include expenses due to disrupted construction processes (€3.2 million), additional training of the tunnelling team (€0.5 million) and increased wages and material prices due to the construction period extension (€7 million).
This additional expenditure of around €10.7 million is not offset by any lasting added value.
The BRH took these and other measures as an opportunity to call on the Federal Ministry to better exercise the specialist supervision incumbent on it for major road construction measures.
In this context, it should be urged that road construction administrations introduce quality assurance systems.
Advantages of cooperation for BRH and NKò The cooperation met the expectations of both courts of auditors.
The BRH received insights into the planning, awarding of contracts and execution of the construction of the border bridge.
Both courts of auditors developed a database on bridge and tunnel prices, which will be helpful in future audits.
The NKò found that the most important structural parameters for bridges, tunnels and roadway of the D 8 do not differ from those of the A 17.
The auditors from both courts of auditors involved in the cooperation gained valuable experience that will be useful in future audits.
Report on the results of the parallel audit of the VAT administration of the Czech Republic and Germany
Preface
The Lima Declaration, adopted in 1977, emphasises that the Court of Auditors has the power to audit all public finances.
The declaration requires that the Court of Auditors must have the power to examine tax collection as much as possible.
The Organisation of the European Supreme Audit Authorities (EUROSAI) considers taxes to be an important part of public revenue.
The thematic focus of the Sixth EUROSAI Congress, which took place in Bonn in 2005, was the audit of public revenues by the Court of Auditors.
One of the most important steps towards optimising the audit activities of a Court of Auditors is the development of a special strategy for auditing public revenues.
This is especially true for taxes as the largest source of public revenue with a high risk of default.
As national economies are increasingly interlinked and interdependent, there may be a situation in which the national courts of auditors can only carry out their audit activities in cooperation with the courts of auditors of other countries.
An example can be the examination of internationally organised fraud, which can lead to significant revenue losses in many countries.
Cooperation between the authorities is needed to combat such crimes.
Court of Auditors examining this area must be prepared to cooperate closely with each other.
The idea for an audit of the VAT and the MIAS system arose at the VI. EUROSAI Congress in Bonn. This audit was carried out in cooperation between the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Court of Auditors.
In the course of thorough preparation, the participating courts of auditors first had to familiarize themselves with the legal framework and procedures of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.
Based on the evaluation of the available information, we selected the examination subjects for the examination planning.
Achieving the efficient and effective management of VAT is a long-standing problem and individual states (in particular the EC Member States) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify the collection of VAT and create greater transparency in this area.
We are convinced that the results of our audit can not only contribute to improving the work of the financial administration, but also form the basis for a proposal for an improved system of international exchange of information.
Report on the results of the parallel audit of the VAT administration of the Czech Republic and Germany
Introduction
Case number: CZ) 06 / 27 (DE) VIII 2 - 2005 - 1215
Subject of examination:
(CZ) Management of VAT after the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union
(DE) Examination of administrative cooperation in the field of VAT in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and 1925 / 2004
the Commission's audit objective:
(CZ) The aim of the audit in the Czech Republic was to investigate the procedures applied by the financial administration in the field of VAT following the integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter "EC") with the free movement of goods and services and the use of MIAS1, in particular the control of the use of the VAT exemption for intra-Community supplies.
(DE) The aim of the audit was to examine the system of intra-Community VAT control with a focus on mutual assistance in the area of VAT in accordance with the above-mentioned regulations.
As a result of the audit, weaknesses should be identified and recommendations made to remedy them.
VAT Information Exchange System The audits were carried out jointly by the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic ("NKò") and the Federal Court of Auditors ("BRH") of the Federal Republic of Germany on the basis of an agreement concluded on 8 June 2006.
The cooperation focused on the review of selected business transactions between entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the exploitation of information obtained through international administrative assistance between the financial administrations and the comparison of VAT management systems in the two countries.
A joint final report on the results of the audits was prepared in accordance with European Guideline No. 31 for the implementation of INTOSAI audit standards.
The audited period covered the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005.
Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel examination
The parallel audit of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two courts of auditors.
In addition to the focus on "exchange of information" in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and the Commission's 1925 / 2004, other closely related aspects were also examined, such as the registration of taxpayers, tax returns and summary notifications.
The audit also covered the legal situation for cross-border passenger transport by bus and the comparison of statistical data.
When comparing the systems of VAT administrations in the two countries, differences were found in the following areas:
1) Registration for VAT purposes.
While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, among others, the essential criterion for registration is exceeding the turnover threshold laid down in the VAT Act.
In the Czech Republic, taxpayers receive only a single tax identification number, which they also use for intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, the tax liable receives a tax number valid only for domestic turnover for VAT purposes.
If the German tax liable wants to make intra-Community transactions, he must apply for the issuance of a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID No.
As problems arise from the different registration procedures, the rules should be standardised within the EC (see 4.1).
2) Cross-border passenger transport by bus.
In the Czech Republic, cross-border passenger transport by buses is VAT-free, but there is a right to deduct input tax.
In Germany, the transport service, as far as the route runs through Germany, is subject to VAT.
Efforts should be made at EC level to standardise the situation under Article 393 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common turnover tax system (see 4.2).
3) Tax returns.
While in the Czech Republic taxpayers only have to file VAT returns for taxation periods during the year (month or quarter), taxpayers in Germany (monthly or quarterly)
VAT pre-registrations and a VAT annual declaration after the end of the calendar year.
In contrast to the Czech Republic, tax obligations in Germany must submit VAT pre-registrations electronically.
The introduction of the obligation to submit VAT returns electronically in the Czech Republic would improve the efficiency of the Czech financial administration (see 4.3).
4) Summary messages.
While tax liabilities in the Czech Republic must submit their summary notifications to the tax offices (FÄ), German tax liabilities must submit the summary notifications to the CLO2.
Accordingly, the information from the summary notifications will be available to the FÄ in the Czech Republic immediately after their submission.
The information from the summary reports is only available to German FÄ after their processing by the CLO.
In order to combat VAT fraud, updated information on intra-Community turnover is needed as soon as possible.
The monthly submission of summary notifications would shorten the period between the time of sales and the update of MIAS data.
This would allow a timely examination of taxation in the acquirer's Member State (see 4.4), but only if all EC Member States introduce the same deadlines.
5) International exchange of information in the field of VAT.
In case of incoming requests for information, the Czech CLO monitors compliance with the three-month deadline.
The German CLO does not monitor the processing times.
As a result, the German financial administration has completed a significantly lower percentage of requests for information received within the specified deadline.
Because of these problems, the BRH has recommended that the German CLO constantly monitor the deadlines (see 4.6).
6) Risk management.
Each of the two Member States is developing its own risk management system (RMS) with corresponding strengths and weaknesses.
The NKò and the BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by one Member State alone.
Successful criteria, elements or approaches of an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in all EC Member States. Otherwise, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5.).
Within the framework of the cooperation, the two Court of Auditors examined selected cases of intra-Community turnover between Czech and German tax entities.
Of these, 31 cases were jointly reviewed by using the legal possibilities of the CLO in which there were doubts about the correct taxation or the suspicion of VAT fraud.
The Court of Auditors found that:
In some cases, the FÄ used the information obtained in the international exchange of information and redefined the VAT liability of the taxpayers concerned.
In these cases, the taxpayers had either unlawfully claimed the VAT exemption or had not shown the purchase of goods in their VAT return.
In some cases, the FÄ could not use the information obtained in the exchange of information because it was incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be used due to different legal requirements in the two Member States.
In some cases, the financial administration of another Member State refused to provide the requested information.
Some cases have been revealed in which tax liabilities incorrectly reported sales in their summary reports.
As a result, the data in the MIAS were correspondingly incorrect, so that the clerks (the FÄ) had to investigate in these cases (see 6).
Examination procedure
Examination procedure in the CR
The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by Division II - "State Budget Revenue" and the Territorial Examination Departments of Central Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and Northern Moravia.
Audited positions were: The Ministry of Finance and the 10 FÄ Humpolec, Jihlava, Kadač, Liberec, Nymburk, Otrokovice, Prague 1, Prague 4, Sokolov and Třinec.
The College of the NKò approved the audit findings on 23 April 2007.
Examination procedures in Germany
The examination was carried out in the period July 2006 to February 2007 by the examination area traffic taxes and employees of the assigned PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt / Main and Munich.
It was part of the work plan for 2006 and was therefore announced to the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2006.
After a test phase, the actual test began in the fourth quarter of 2006.
According to the cases selected by the BRH and later by the NKò, the BRH had to announce the examination in several federal states.
Apart from interviews in the BMF and the CLO, the examination was carried out in the following federal states:
Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.
Tax records from the following FÄ were included in the audit:
Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, Munich corporations, Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-Nord and Hamburg for large companies, Hannover-Nord, Winsen-Luhe, Bonn-Innenstadt, Cologne-Mitte, Cologne-Porz, Cologne-South, Sankt Augustin, Pirmasens, Bautzen, Chemnitz-Süd, Dresden II, Freiberg, Leipzig I and Zschopau.
In addition, talks were held with the FÄ Augsburg-Stadt, Aurich, Düsseldorf-Altstadt, Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.
The audit results were communicated to the BMF in May 2007.
Cooperation between the two Court of Auditors
In the run-up to the parallel audit, several meetings of representatives of both courts of auditors took place.
Participants in these meetings familiarized themselves with the organisation of the financial administration, the legislation on VAT and the system of VAT administration in the other country.
The subject of the test phase was agreed at the meeting in May 2006.
The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.
At this meeting, a timetable for the further procedure was drawn up and the following examination topics were determined for the parallel examinations: 1.
Registration of taxpayers.
2.
Cross-border passenger transport by bus - legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.
3. International exchange of information, in particular the approach of tax officials in processing requests for information and reviewing selected problem cases mentioned in the requests for information, as well as spontaneous information between the Czech Republic and Germany.
4. Tax returns.
5.
Summary Messages.
6.

An entrepreneur with a legal registered office, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic whose turnover exceeds CZK 1,000,000 in the last 12 consecutive calendar months will be subject to payment on the first day of the third month after the month in which he exceeded the threshold (§ 94 (1) of Act No. 235 / 2004 Coll., concerning VAT; hereinafter "Act No. 235 / 2004").
The person concerned must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he has exceeded the registration threshold.
Current legislation does not allow the retroactive registration of a taxpayer if he has exceeded the application deadline for registration.
An entrepreneur with a legal registered office, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic who provides services subject to VAT or services exempt from VAT with the right to deduct VAT must register for VAT even if his turnover does not exceed CZK 1 million, but he meets other requirements specified in Act No. 235 / 2004.
An entrepreneur with a legal registered office, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic who does not meet any of the requirements specified in the law can voluntarily apply for VAT registration.
The registration procedure in accordance with Law No. 337 / 1992 begins with the receipt of the registration application by the local tax officer.
Anyone who wants to register voluntarily for VAT must indicate in his application the deadline from which he applies for registration as a VAT subject.
The tax officer must check the information provided by the entrepreneur, i.e. the completed application for registration with all attachments.
If he has doubts about the information provided therein, he must ask the applicant to explain, supplement or prove the information provided.
If the tax officer has determined by verification that the entrepreneur meets the requirements for registration, he must issue a written notice of registration and the allocation of a tax number.
In the decision, the tax officer must indicate the date of entry into force of the registration for VAT and the assessment period for VAT.
The assessment period is the calendar quarter; unless the entrepreneur's turnover for the previous calendar year has reached the amount of at least CZK 10,000,000.
If this is the case, the assessment period is the calendar month.
An entrepreneur whose turnover reached at least CZK 2,000,000 in the previous calendar year is entitled to choose the calendar month as the assessment period and must inform the tax official of this change.
The issuance of a tax number in the registration notice always has a constitutive character.
The taxpayer must provide the tax number for any communication (including payments) with the tax officer, as well as in cases where a special law prescribes this (e.g. Law No. 235 / 2004, concerning the issuance of tax documents) 3.
The tax number contains the coding "CZ" and a basic component in the form of a general identification mark.
For natural persons, this is the number of the birth certificate or another general identification mark, insofar as a special law stipulates this. For legal persons, the general identification mark is the company identification number (in accordance with the provisions of § 33 (12) of Act No. 337 / 1992).
If the entrepreneur has not fulfilled his obligation despite the corresponding request by the tax official, the local tax official must register him ex officio.
A notice will also be issued to the taxpayer.
In the Czech Republic, every entrepreneur authorised to do business receives a tax number for any type of tax at the time of their first registration.
This also applies to registration as a VAT payer.
According to Law No. 235 / 2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, in the event of non-fulfilment of the obligation to register VAT, the tax officer may require that the tax officer make up to 10% of the proceeds from the tax-liable turnover, which the person concerned has unlawfully made without taxation, for the period from the date from which the entrepreneur should have been registered as a tax officer, up to the date on which the registration as a tax officer was made by order of the tax officer (§ 98 (1) of Law No. 235 / 2004).
The payment of the amount fixed in this way is considered a tax payment within the meaning of § 98 (3) of Act No. 235 / 2004, i.e. it is not a fine or penalty.
If the legal requirements are met, the registration of a VAT obligation can be deleted for two reasons:
1)
Deletion of registration at the request of the taxpayer, i.e. mainly for the reason that the turnover does not reach the threshold for registration (§ 106 (1) of Act No. 235 / 2004).
A tax subject may request the cancellation of his registration at the earliest one year after the date of entry into force stated in the registration notice.
2) Deletion of registration ex officio (§ 106 (7) of Act No. 235 / 2004) if: a) the tax liable has not provided a service for a period of 12 consecutive months and has not informed the tax official of the reasons for this, b) the tax liable has not fulfilled his obligations in accordance with Act No. 235 / 2004, c) the previous tax liable no longer fulfils the requirements for the tax obligation.
B) Tax liable persons without legal registered office, registered office or business premises in the Czech Republic A person who is registered for tax purposes in another Member State and has neither his legal registered office, registered office nor permanent establishment in the Czech Republic nor a tax-liable foreigner who provides services in the Czech Republic and has to file a tax return and pay taxes for these services or deliveries in accordance with § 108 of Act No. 235 / 2004 ("non-resident entrepreneur") becomes tax liable with the provision of the service in question.
He must submit an application for registration with FA Prague 1 no later than the day of the delivery in question.
It is obliged to indicate in this application all VAT ID numbers allocated to it in other Member States or third countries.
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration later than on the day of the first tax-subject service provision in the Czech Republic, the FA Prague 1 must register him retroactively, as he became subject to VAT in accordance with Law No. 235 / 2004 on the day of the first tax-subject service provision in the Czech Republic.
In the event of retroactive registration, FA Prague 1 must request proof of performance from the entrepreneurs concerned (invoices or written explanations).
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration in the Czech Republic before the first execution of a service, FA Prague 1 must require the submission of the performance-based contract documents.
As of 31 December 2004, 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered with FA Prague 1, 124 of them from Germany. As of 31 December 2005, a total of 951 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered, 233 of them from Germany.
In accordance with the provisions of § 106 (9) of Act No. 235 / 2004, the tax officer is authorized to delete the registration of a non-resident entrepreneur on 31 January of the following calendar year if he does not accept the obligation to submit tax declarations or declarations and to pay taxes.
During the examination of the NKò it turned out that in the case of filing a tax return by post with dispatch abroad on 25 January, i.e. in accordance with the mandatory deadline for filing a tax return, this declaration has not yet been received by the FA by 31 January.
In cases where these facts, which are relevant to the possibility of cancellation of the registration, become known to the FA later than on 31 January, it is no longer possible to cancel the registration of the non-resident entrepreneur for VAT in the Czech Republic in the relevant calendar year.
Registration of taxpayers in Germany
In accordance with the provisions of the Tax Code (§ § 137, 138 AO), every business operation must be registered with the municipality and / or the competent tax office.
This registration must be made no later than one month after the start of business.
The municipality forwards the registration to the tax authorities.
If the competent tax office determines that a business activity has been started but not declared, it can also register the tax liable ex officio retroactively.
In Germany, tax liable persons, regardless of whether they are resident or non-resident, are obliged to register for Zwekke of VAT if they meet the requirements in § 2 of the German VAT Act (UStG).
This does not depend on the amount of turnover generated.
There is no voluntary registration in Germany.
Special FÄ are responsible for entrepreneurs based abroad.
For example, FA ChemnitzSüd is responsible for those entrepreneurs based in the Czech Republic.
As of 30 April 2004, a total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered; as of 1 March 2006, 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered there.
According to the BRH, these FÄ with special responsibilities often refused to register so-called bogus self-employed persons residing in the new Central and Eastern European Member States of the EC.
Since the free movement of workers is still restricted after the accession of these ten states to the EC, these self-employed people tried to circumvent these restrictions by setting up their own business.
These (certificate) self-employed persons do not fulfil the requirements specified in § 2 UStG for recognition as entrepreneurs, since they are usually dependent on a single client who determines their working time and the type of work carried out.
In order to be registered, the entrepreneur must fill out a questionnaire from the responsible FA and provide information about the company and the business activities carried out.
The questionnaire is a binding form for all FÄ in Germany.
It is processed either in special organisational units within the FÄ or in the organisational units generally responsible for tax assessment.
With the help of this form, a risk assessment for the individual tax liable is carried out before the allocation of a tax number.
The structure of the tax number for domestic sales is based on certain requirements:
The first three digits are the identification number for the responsible FA, The following three (or four) digits indicate which department is responsible within the FA, The following five (or four) digits are the identification feature for the tax subject, the last digit is always a control digit.
If an entrepreneur wants to participate in intra-Community trade, he needs a VAT ID in order to be able to make tax-free intra-Community deliveries.
This is allocated by the CLO on request if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany for VAT purposes.
The VAT ID number is automatically assigned by the CLO if the tax liable declares intra-community deliveries in his VAT pre-registrations or in his VAT annual declaration.
The VAT ID number consists of the country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.
The registration of an entrepreneur can be deleted: 1. Upon request (e.g. if he stops doing business), but only after completion of all taxation transactions (assessment of all financial years) or 2. If the financial administration determines that he no longer operates a business.
As a rule, the validity of the VAT ID depends on the validity of the VAT number.
In these cases, the FÄ must inform the CLO about the deletion of the VAT number so that the validity of the VAT ID number can be terminated there at this time.
According to the VAT Act (§ 19 (1) UStG), domestic tax liable persons do not have to pay VAT in the following cases: 1. the turnover of the previous calendar year plus the resulting VAT has not exceeded the amount of 17,500 €and 2. will probably not exceed the amount of 50,000 €in the following year.
The so-called small entrepreneurs are not entitled to charge other entrepreneurs VAT, nor to deduct input tax.
Although they do not have to pay VAT, small business owners are obliged to register with the tax office and submit an annual VAT return.
A small business owner can declare the non-application of § 19 (1) UStG.
This declaration is binding for the following five years.
He may then charge the VAT and deduct the input tax.
Non-resident taxpayers can appoint a fiscal representative (§ 22a UStG).
The prerequisite for this is that they exclusively make tax-free sales and waive the deduction of input tax.
The fiscal representative fulfils the tax obligations of the foreign entrepreneur, so that he does not have to register for VAT purposes.
The invoices indicate that a fiscal representative has been appointed.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation in the two countries is different.
While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the first prerequisite for registration (among others) is to exceed the threshold amount mentioned in the VAT Act.
If an entrepreneur does not exceed this threshold, he can register voluntarily.
The registration procedure in Germany is standardized, but differences can occur due to different organisational structures in the individual federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the taxpayer receives a tax number for any tax at the time of his first registration.
In the case of its registration for VAT, this tax number also applies to intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, an entrepreneur who registers for VAT purposes receives a tax number exclusively for domestic German sales.
If the German entrepreneur wants to carry out intra-community turnover, he must specifically apply for the allocation of a VAT ID number.
Both the NKò and the BRH noted that the German two-tier registration system in other Member States, such as the Czech Republic, which assigns a single identification number for both national VAT registration and intra-Community turnover, can lead to significant misunderstandings.
On the other hand, the two-stage system enables retroactive (national registration) in cases where the taxpayer does not register his business with the municipality or the competent FA.
This retroactive registration enables an accurate assessment of VAT for previous assessment periods, in particular an accurate estimate of the VAT liability.
As the different registration procedures lead to problems, the rules for the whole EC should be standardised.
The German Parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number.
This is to be allocated by the Federal Central Office for Taxes to each natural person after birth.
This number is valid for life for natural persons resident in Germany.
If a natural person takes up a business activity, the responsible FA applies for a commercial tax identification number, which serves as a VAT ID number.
In the future, there should therefore be no delay between the national registration of a taxpayer and the allocation of the VAT ID number.
Work on implementing an IT procedure for managing the numbers has not yet been completed.
Cross-border passenger transport by bus
Legal regulations in the Czech Republic
According to the provisions of § 70 of Law No. 235 / 2004, since 1 May 2004, the transport of passengers between the individual Member States and between the Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic has been exempt from VAT and is entitled to deduction of input tax.
The exemption from VAT also applies if the transport is carried out by persons registered as taxpayers in other Member States or by foreigners who are subject to domestic tax.
The return journey is considered a separate transport process.
If non-resident entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic do not carry out any economic activity other than cross-border passenger transport by bus, they are not obliged to register in the Czech Republic as subject to VAT.
Cross-border passenger transport has been exempted from the VAT obligation in the Czech Republic under the Act on the Accession of the Czech Republic Annex V, Chapter 5 (1) (b).
"For the purpose of applying Article 28 (3) (b) of Directive 77 / 388 / EEC, the Czech Republic may, in accordance with point 17 in Annex F of the Directive, maintain the tax exemption for cross-border passenger transport either until the requirement of Article 28 (4) of the Directive is fulfilled or as long as the same tax exemption is applied by any of the current Member States."
The legal regulations in Germany
In accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006, as implemented in Germany by § 3b (1) UStG, a transport service is carried out where the transport is carried out.
Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and cross-border passenger transport.
Only the domestic part of the transport service is subject to tax in Germany.
German taxation also does not distinguish between resident and non-resident (bus) entrepreneurs.
If a non-resident tax liable person carries through Germany, the part of the transport attributable to Germany is considered tax-liable transport.
Before providing its services in Germany, the non-resident entrepreneur must report his intention to provide passenger transport services to the competent FA.
This registers it for tax purposes (compare 4.1.2) and issues a special certificate for each bus named in the registration of the taxpayer.
The entrepreneur must state his tax-liable transportation services in a German VAT return.
As of 1 March 2006, 741 Czech bus operators were registered with FA Chemnitz-Süd.
If the transport service is provided for a domestic entrepreneur, the non-resident tax liable does not have to pay the VAT himself to the FA.
In its place, the domestic customer of the services must pay VAT to the tax office and the net amount invoiced to the non-resident tax liable, which is referred to as the "shift of tax liability" and is in accordance with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC.
In addition to the registration by a non-resident tax liable and his income tax return, the German tax administration has several means of checking the correctness of the tax return with regard to tax-liable passenger transport:
Customs mobile control groups check the certificates of buses registered abroad, which are used for passenger transport through Germany.
After each examination, the mobile control groups submit an inspection protocol to the responsible FA.
If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group can require the bus driver to pay VAT before continuing his journey.
The non-resident tax liable can deduct the VAT paid in this way from the tax liability stated in his VAT return.
If the FA has doubts about the accuracy of a VAT return, it may order an audit to take place in the FA or may use the means of mutual assistance referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 (see point 4.6).
Even if the foreign taxpayer refuses to pay the legally fixed VAT, the FA may request mutual assistance in accordance with Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC.
The BRH considers these means of administrative assistance in tax matters to verify the VAT return or compliance with the tax obligation by a non-resident bus operator as too expensive in relation to the low revenue from VAT on taxable passenger transport.
In particular, the audit of the books of a non-resident tax liable causes disproportionately high costs for the tax liable himself and for the financial administration.
The latter must examine the foreign books, which requires not only knowledge of the foreign language but also of foreign accounting principles.
Accordingly, a higher time expenditure is to be expected in such an audit than in the case of a resident tax liable, although the audit is limited to the passenger transport taking place in Germany.
On the other hand, the non-resident taxpayer must accept not only the audit rights of his national financial administration, but also those of the other Member States, insofar as he carries out passenger transport there.
Furthermore, for each Member State in which even a single passenger transport is carried out, the taxpayer must fulfil all existing tax obligations in the different languages and on the basis of the forms of the financial administrations of the EC Member States concerned.
This means that the correct taxation of cross-border passenger transport services leads to a disproportionate administrative burden.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation is different in the two states.
In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between different EC Member States and between Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT under the Czech Republic's Accession Act.
In Germany, the transport service is subject to VAT in accordance with the transport route attributable to German territory.
If a non-resident tax liable provides such a transport service for the first time, he must register this beforehand with the competent FA.
This registers the tax liable, who must declare the tax-liable share of the transport service in a tax return in Germany.
Law enforcement in Germany is very time-consuming.
At least three out of four Czech tax obligations registered with FA Chemnitz-Süd have passenger transport as a business purpose.
The tax revenue in question is quite low in relation to the administrative burden.
Member States - which levy VAT in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common VAT system - have a high administrative burden in relation to the relevant tax revenue.
In order to avoid the disproportionately high cost of assessing VAT, cross-border passenger transport should only be subject to tax in one Member State.
This could be the state in which the transport begins or in which the service provider is based.
Such a type of taxation would require an amendment to Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006.
VAT returns
Submission and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic
Unless the law stipulates otherwise, even if no tax liability has arisen, the entrepreneur is obliged to submit a VAT return on the form specified by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days of the expiry of the taxation period.
The tax liability arises at the expiry of the deadline for submitting the VAT return. According to Law No. 235 / 2004, VAT on the import of goods is excluded from this regulation. Here, the due date of the tax is determined in accordance with the customs regulations.
If there is a claim for a refund as a result of above-average deductible input taxes, this amount will be refunded to the taxpayer within 30 days of the fixing of this input tax deduction, without the need for an application to be made.
The deadline is not applied in cases where the tax officer initiates tax proceedings regarding the tax liability of the taxpayer.
According to § 73 (11) of Act No. 235 / 2004, the entitlement to input tax deduction can be asserted at the latest with the regular tax return for the last taxation period of the calendar year in which the entitlement to input tax deduction was incurred.
After expiry of this period, the deduction of input tax can still be claimed within three years of the end of the taxation period in which the assertion would have been possible for the first time.
However, this requires the submission of a supplementary VAT return.
An amendment to Act No. 235 / 2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, permits the submission of a supplementary VAT return only for the period in which the entitlement to input tax deduction could have been asserted for the first time.
A tax liable must submit a supplementary VAT return if: a) the sum of the corrections leads to an increase in the tax liability, b) he makes corrections by which the last known tax liability is not changed, but only previous information is changed, c) he makes corrections to the VAT rate and the tax liability in accordance with § 49 of Act No. 235 / 2004.
A tax liable can file a supplementary VAT return if the sum of the corrections reduces the tax liability.
The taxpayer must file the supplementary tax return by the end of the month following the month in which the facts in question were established.
The VAT return can be submitted electronically either via the Internet or via data carrier.
The delivery via the Internet can be made with a certified electronic signature or without it.
If it is done without an electronic signature, it must also be submitted to data carriers.
The form for the VAT return contains separate lines for indicating the value of intra-Community deliveries and purchases.
The value of purchased services must be stated in separate lines of the VAT return.
Some headings are used for automated primary controls under the ATIS system.
The value of the goods delivered to other EC Member States to persons registered there as taxable is compared with the data provided by the Czech taxpayers in their summary notifications.
The value of the purchases of goods from other Member States from persons registered there as taxable is compared with the information in the summary notifications of taxpayers from other EC Member States with the help of the MIAS.
Within the framework of the ATIS system, the FA carries out a credibility check of VAT returns.
This is done automatically, as the VAT return cannot be processed without the prior examination.
The credibility check includes a calculation of the standards of credibility and an assessment of the risks of VAT returns.
In accordance with the provisions of § 37 (1) of Act No. 337 / 1992, the FA may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 million on persons who fail to fulfil their non-monetary obligations under this or a special tax law or a decision under this Act.
Automated tax information system - Automated tax information system used by the Czech tax offices to provide technical support for tax collection.
During its examination, the NKò found that the FÄ rarely made use of the possibility of imposing a fine on the taxpayer concerned if the VAT return was not filed.
Submission and processing of VAT returns in Germany
In Germany, a distinction is made between monthly or quarterly VAT pre-registrations and the annual VAT return.
Those tax liable persons who are obliged to submit VAT pre-registrations must nevertheless submit an annual VAT return.
Even small business owners who are not obliged to pay VAT must file an annual VAT return.
The tax liable persons are generally obliged to submit a VAT pre-registration until the 10th day after the end of the calendar quarter in which the VAT is incurred (§ 18 (2) UStG).
However, if the VAT liability amounted to more than €6,136 in the previous year or if it is a newly founded company, the entrepreneur is obliged to submit monthly VAT pre-registrations no later than the 10th day after the end of the month in question.
The tax liable can also decide to submit monthly VAT pre-registrations if he has been reimbursed an amount of €6,136 in the previous year (§ 18 (2a) UStG).
If the annual VAT does not exceed €512, neither VAT pre-registrations nor VAT returns must be filed.
A resulting VAT liability must be paid 10 days after the end of the taxation period.
A refund can lead to a more thorough audit by the financial administration.
(Legal) deadlines for the processing of VAT returns and for the refund of VAT overpayments do not exist.
In order to receive a timely refund, a security for the refund amount can be offered.
In principle, VAT returns, including reimbursement cases, must be processed quickly.
The German VAT Act allows an extension of these (surrender or payment) deadlines (§ 18 (6) UStG).
The extension of the deadline must be requested separately.
If it is granted, the submission of the VAT pre-registrations as well as the corresponding payments may take place one month later. In the case of monthly notifications, however, a special advance payment must be made.
This payment will be offset against the VAT liability determined for the pre-registration period of December.
If an error is discovered, the entrepreneur must submit a corrected VAT pre-registration.
There is no "supplementary" VAT return.
If the VAT return to be submitted by 31 May of the following year has been submitted to the tax office once, the entrepreneur can no longer correct an incorrect VAT pre-registration, but only the incorrect annual VAT return.
Corrections to this VAT return to the advantage or disadvantage of the tax liable are possible within four years after the end of the year in which the first VAT return was filed.
After expiry of this four-year period, a VAT return can usually only be corrected in cases of a frivolous tax reduction or tax evasion.
The taxpayers must submit the VAT pre-registrations electronically.
The FÄ can grant exceptions to this rule in order to avoid unfair hardship.
The annual VAT return can be submitted both in paper form or via the Internet with or without certification.
If the levy is made without certification, the tax liable must additionally submit the declaration on paper and with his personal signature.
If no VAT pre-registrations or declarations are made, the financial administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the turnover generated by the tax liable6.
In case of late levy, the tax liable may be subject to a late surcharge (up to 10% of the tax liability or up to an amount of €25,000).
In an earlier examination, the BRH found that the FÄ often do not charge this delay surcharge.
In cases where the FÄ levied the late surcharges, the fixing of the amount was inconsistent and arbitrary.
The late surcharge therefore misses its purpose of reducing the average delay, in particular when filing the annual VAT return.
The form of the VAT return contains separate lines for value information on intra-community deliveries or acquisitions.
There are also separate lines for the purchase of services.
Non-taxable sales must be stated in a separate line of the VAT return.
The VAT returns submitted on paper must either be scanned or electronically recorded by specially designated personnel.
The data of electronically filed tax returns are directly available to the financial administration.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
After all data is recorded electronically, they are subjected to a risk management procedure and a case selection is made on the basis of certain standards.
The VAT returns selected in this way must be checked by the responsible clerk on the basis of the automatically created test instructions (see 5.2).
Although the financial administration only has to make a rough estimate of the VAT liability, it still has to be as accurate as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, taxpayers must file their VAT returns no later than 25 days after the end of the taxation period.
Depending on the turnover of the taxpayer, the taxation period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
In Germany, taxpayers must submit their pre-registrations no later than 10 days after the end of the calendar quarter or the calendar month, depending on the amount of their tax liability of the previous year.
The annual VAT declaration must be submitted by 31 May of the following year at the latest.
The obligation to submit an annual VAT return has some advantages and disadvantages:
+ After the end of the calendar year, the tax liable can correct the errors in the monthly pre-registrations by submitting a single VAT return;
- If the taxpayer corrects his information on intra-Community turnover, the correction cannot be attributed to a specific reporting period of the ZM;
- The federal states compare MIAS data on intra-Community acquisitions of German tax liable persons only when the annual VAT declarations have usually been processed.
According to the registration (see 4.1.3), German entrepreneurs must file a VAT return regardless of the amount of their turnover.
This levy obligation enables the German financial administration to verify compliance with the turnover ceiling for small entrepreneurs.
In addition, the competent FA can compare the annual VAT declaration with the corresponding declarations for direct taxes and with the annual financial statements of the company concerned.
In the Czech Republic, the tax administration can only verify the amount of turnover on the basis of the income tax return filed.
In contrast to the current regulations in the Czech Republic, German tax obligations are obliged to submit the VAT pre-registration electronically.
The introduction of the obligation to submit tax returns electronically in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech financial administration.
Summary notifications
Submission and processing of summary notifications in the Czech Republic
In accordance with the provisions of § 102 of Law No. 235 / 2004, an entrepreneur who delivers goods to a person registered in another Member State for tax purposes must submit corresponding summary notifications (hereinafter "ZM").
The value of the delivered goods is always indicated in the ZM in Czech currency, broken down according to the VAT IdNr7, the individual tax liable under which they are registered in the other Member State.
Information on services is not provided in the ZM.
The tax liable persons with a calendar monthly or quarterly taxation period must hand over the ZM to the local FA no later than the 25th day after the end of each quarter.
Incorrect data must be corrected in a correction CM within 15 days of the detection of the error.
Faulty data in the ZM is always replaced by the data from the correction ZM.
Similar to tax returns, tax liable persons can also submit the ZM electronically.
If a tax officer does not surrender a ZM or correction ZM, although he is obliged to do so under Law No. 235 / 2004, the tax officer must ask him to surrender the ZM in question and thereby point out the consequences of the non-surrender. In case of non-fulfilment of non-monetary obligations, the tax officer is authorized to repeatedly impose fines up to an amount of CZK 2 million in accordance with § 37 of Law No. 337 / 1992.
During its audit, the NKò found that the FÄ usually did not use their power to impose fines on their defaulting tax liabilities.
Especially with the surrender of the ZM, the tax obligations are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their obligations, since the failure to surrender a ZM does not affect the amount of their VAT liability.
According to § 102 (5) of Act No. 235 / 2004, the tax officer is obliged to check the information in the ZM or Correction ZM, to eliminate all ambiguities and to use the information to determine the tax liability.
In case of disagreement
8 of the information in the ZM with which The tax liable corrects incorrect information in the ZM by submitting a correction ZM either on his own initiative or on request.
The tax officer must correct the data on deliveries of goods to other Member States in the ATIS system if:
- the tax liable does not prove the correctness of the information reported in the ZM (or correction ZM) and therefore corrects it by submitting a correction ZM,
- the tax officer has proven the incorrectness of the information reported by the taxpayer in the ZM or correction ZM.
Notifications entered by the tax officer, without a correction ZM being submitted by the tax obligation, do not replace the obligation of the tax obligation to submit a correction ZM, but only lead to the correction of the data in the MIAS, so that they are up-to-date, complete and accurate.
The data from the CMs will be forwarded to the Member States concerned.
Only the national tax authority named for cooperation with the other Member States in the field of VAT may transmit and receive this data.
This is the CLO (in the Czech Republic this function is performed by the Department of International Administrative Assistance in the field of VAT at the Ministry of Finance). The CLO automatically receives the notification "O _ MCTL" from the other Member States.
It contains all incorrect VAT ID numbers specified in the transmitted ZM lines.
If the incorrect VAT ID number is used in some of the transmitted lines of the ZM or the corrected ZM, an entry is made in the list of incorrect VAT IdNr.
The list contains a "Message about doubts regarding VAT-IdNr."
The tax officer checks the data and enters the result of the review into the system.
When purchasing goods from another Member State, the taxpayer must state this in his VAT return and enter the value of the acquisition in the designated lines of the VAT return.
Selected cases of differences between the values of the purchases made by the Czech tax liable in its VAT return and the values for the delivery of goods indicated by the supplier from the other Member State in its ZM will be forwarded by the CLO to the competent FA for examination.
The clerks there must investigate the deviations.
Three different situations can then occur:
a) The value indicated by the Czech acquirer in the relevant headings of its VAT return is lower than the value of deliveries indicated by suppliers from other EC Member States.
In this case, the tax officer checks the accuracy of the information.
b) The difference is zero.
This situation can arise either by changing the information within the EC (the foreign supplier corrects his ZM) or by changing the information in the VAT return (the Czech tax liable in the meantime submits a supplementary VAT return on his own initiative).
In this case, it is at the discretion of the tax officer to check the accuracy of the information in the VAT return nevertheless.
c) The value of goods purchased from other Member States indicated by the Czech taxpayer in his VAT return is higher than the values of their deliveries reported by suppliers of the other EC Member States.
Here, in turn, it is at the discretion of the tax official to verify the accuracy of the information.
After reviewing the differences and clarifying the reasons for their occurrence, the tax official enters the results of his review into ATIS.
These results will be forwarded to the CLO.
The number of transactions sent by the CLO for audit is shown in Graph No. 1 for the individual quarters of 2005 (source: Czech Ministry of Finance).
Graph 1 above shows that the number of cases submitted by the CLO to the FÄ for the individual quarters of 2005 has decreased.
The significant reduction in the number in the fourth quarter of 2005 is due, among other things, to the fact that the Czech CLO has raised the threshold for a case selection, taking into account the minimum amount limit for a request for information to the other EC Member States.
Deviations between the information in the VAT returns and the data from the EC do not always have to be based on an error by the domestic acquirer.
There may also be an error by the taxpayer in another Member State or an error caused by the fact that certain types of deliveries in the CM are indicated differently in the individual EC Member States.
The most frequent reasons for deviations in the value of reported transactions identified in the audited FÄ are shown in Table 1.
Submission and processing of summary notifications in Germany
Entrepreneurs who make intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EC Member States or participate in triangular transactions must surrender ZM quarterly in which intra-Community deliveries by purchaser are listed (§ 18a (1) UStG).
The ZM must be submitted no later than the 10th day of the month following the calendar quarter in question.
If a permanent period extension is granted for the submission of VAT pre-registrations, this also applies to the ZM.
The ZM must be handed over to the CLO.
Since 1 January 2007, the electronic levy has been mandatory.
The competent FA can allow exceptions for individual tax obligations in order to avoid unfair hardship.
If the tax liable determines that the ZM was faulty, he is obliged to submit a correction ZM within one month.
In case of non-surrender of the ZM, the CLO initiates enforcement proceedings.
This includes the following steps: - first reminder - second reminder, coupled with the threat that a penalty will be set and - fixing the penalty.
Although the German Tax Code permits the fixing of a penalty of up to €25,000 (§ 329 AO), the CLO sets penalties of €125, €250 and €500 in three stages.
In addition, § 26a (1) No. 5 UStG stipulates that the tax liable person acts disorderly if he intentionally or recklessly does not deliver a ZM correctly, not completely or not in time or if he does not correct a ZM or not in time.
This infringement is punishable by a fine of up to €5,000.
Data on intra-community deliveries cannot be entered into the MIAS by the FÄ, because the CLO is exclusively responsible for processing the ZM.
The data of the ZM is only stored at the CLO.
The information from the summary reports is only available to the FÄ after their processing by the CLO.
The deadlines for processing ZM are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003.
The data of the ZM must be stored within three months of the relevant calendar quarter (in MIAS).
In the case of incorrect VAT ID in the ZM of German tax obligations, the German CLO receives a notification "O _ MCTL" from the other Member State.
The CLO then turns to the entrepreneur and requests the right data.
If the CLO fails to obtain the correct information, the case will be submitted to the competent FA.
It is then their task to request the correct information.
In the course of its audit, the BRH found that most entrepreneurs corrected the VAT ID at the request of the CLO.
However, remembering, threatening and fixing up to three consecutive penalties takes too much time if a taxpayer may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud.
The cases that were ultimately reported to the competent FÄ were usually completed within one to two months.
The competent FA refused the tax exemption for reported intra-Community deliveries in 73% of these cases9.
If the tax subject presented the correct VAT ID number, the FA requested him to submit a corrected ZM to the CLO because the FÄ cannot correct the MIAS data themselves.
The BRH found that neither the FÄ nor the CLO controlled the surrender of the corrected ZM.
Therefore, the tax obligations often did not comply with the request. Since the CLO does not have access to the data of the VAT returns, there is no comparison of the information provided in the VAT pre-registrations or the VAT return on goods deliveries with the corresponding information in the ZM before this data is forwarded to the CLO of the other Member States.
This comparison can only be made by the FÄ. This usually happens during the preparation of a special VAT audit.
Data received from other Member States is processed by the CLO.
Incorrect VAT ID numbers are detected and reported to the Member States concerned.
The data will be used to control employment taxation in the FÄ.
As soon as they are available in the system, the CLO compares them with the data of previous calendar quarters.
If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control notifications are drawn up and sent to the competent FÄ.
This happens continuously, whereas a payment of the acquisition data of all VAT obligations is later prepared and forwarded to the FÄ.
The risk management system (RMS) for the investment procedure then compares this data with those on intra-Community acquisitions.
The system fully (only) checks those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct input tax.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, taxpayers who have made intra-Community deliveries to a person registered for VAT in another Member State must submit a ZM to the local FA within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter.
The FÄ process the ZM and forward the data to the CLO.
The values of intra-Community deliveries reported by the tax liable persons in the ZM are compared with the values of intra-Community deliveries indicated by the same tax liable persons in their VAT returns.
The results of the comparison will be taken into account in the context of tax fixing.
In Germany, taxpayers who have made intra-Community deliveries are obliged to submit quarterly ZM within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter10.
Since 1 January 2007, tax obligations have to submit the ZM electronically to the CLO.
The data from the ZM are only available to the FÄ after their processing at the CLO.
In both the Czech Republic and Germany, the tax liable persons in the ZM only indicate the deliveries of goods.
The provision of services is not specified in the ZM. Unlike the Czech FÄ, the German FÄ cannot correct incorrect information in individual lines of the submitted ZM themselves.
Because of this limited access to the German MIAS data, incorrect VAT ID numbers were not corrected even if the tax liable informed the FA of the correct VAT ID number.
The German financial administration does not compare the information on intra-Community deliveries made by German tax liable persons in their VAT pre-registrations with the information provided by the corresponding ZM.
Differences between the data of the pre-registration and the ZM are regularly not revealed before the German CLO forwards the MIAS data to other Member States.
Based on these findings of the BRH, it is obvious that a comparison would improve the reliability of the transmitted MIAS data.
Data transmitted by other Member States on deliveries of goods to Czech taxpayers will be compared in the Czech Republic with data on the purchases of goods indicated by Czech taxpayers in their VAT returns.
The Czech CLO makes the comparison separately for each calendar quarter.
The most serious cases of deviations are forwarded to the FÄ for examination.
Unlike the Czech financial administration, the German financial administration does not generally examine the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.
Such a general inspection is only carried out for taxpayers who are not fully entitled to deduct input tax.
In addition, the German tax administration only controls the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other tax liable persons if the RMS draws up an audit notice or the tax liable has been selected for an audit anyway.
This procedure relieves the FÄ from clarifying the reasons for occurring differences.
On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
In order to combat carousel fraud, updated information on intra-Community acquisitions must be available as early as possible.
The current system of the ZM, in particular MIAS, provides the tax authorities with information that may well be half a year old.
This time delay could be reduced to up to four months if the taxpayers had to surrender monthly ZM.
The monthly levy would only marginally increase the bureaucratic burden, since most tax liable persons in the Czech Republic and Germany are obliged to submit monthly VAT returns or pre-registrations anyway and no more information is required for the ZM than for the VAT returns or pre-registrations.
In order to avoid bureaucracy, the surrender of the ZM could be associated with the submission of VAT returns or pre-registrations.
However, an obligation to levy ZM monthly would cause more periodic discrepancies between the information on intra-Community supplies and those on intra-Community acquisitions and increase data flows between the CLOs.
In 2006, the Federal Government considered the general introduction of monthly ZM.
Implementation failed due to the concerns of the federal states.
They feared that a monthly forwarding of MIAS data to the CLO of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In order for the obligation to submit ZM monthly to have an effect, it is necessary to agree on the uniform monthly levy at European level, so that a monthly update of the MIAS data is possible.
Statistical information on goods deliveries and acquisitions between the Czech Republic and Germany
In foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the Czech Republic.
The total turnover of intra-Community trade in goods between the Czech Republic and Germany is shown in Table No. 2.
Both courts of auditors requested data on the number of incorrect tax numbers or VAT ID numbers in the O _ MCTL notifications exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany for the individual audited quarters.
These data can be found in the following tables.
They have significant differences.
The reason for the differences can be a different calculation basis for the number of O _ MCTL messages.
While the Czech CLO refers the figures to the calendar quarter for which the ZM was submitted, the German CLO refers its figures to the calendar quarter in which O _ MCTL notification was received.
International exchange of information at level 3
Implementation of the international exchange of information in the Czech Republic
The international exchange of information enables tax officials to obtain information from other Member States on intra-Community transactions and on the taxpayers who have carried them out.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 on mutual assistance in the field of VAT, which repealed Directive (EEC) No 218 / 92 (hereinafter "Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003"), distinguishes between two basic types of exchange of information: the exchange of information on request and the spontaneous exchange of information (without prior request).
The international exchange of information on request is carried out by a request for information (RFI) using the standardized SCAC form.
The tax officials in the Czech Republic send their RFI or their responses to an RFI received by the Finance Directorate to the CLO, which ensures the translation of the information provided in the standardised SCAC form into the foreign language and the forwarding to the other Member States.
In addition, the CLO receives requests for information (RFI) from other Member States and responses to requests sent. It provides for their translation into Czech and their distribution to the relevant FÄ for processing.
Art. 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 sets a maximum period of three months from receipt of the request for its processing.
All RFIs exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany during the audited period were audited by the NKò.
From the total number of 94 RFIs received from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were processed within the three-month period; in a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) this processing period was exceeded.
In the remaining one case, no reply had been sent to Germany until the examination by the NKò. More detailed information on the deadlines within which requests made by Germany were answered by the Czech Republic can be found in Graph 2.
From the total number of 335 requests for information (RFI) sent to Germany from the Czech Republic, 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) received a reply within the three-month period; a further 179 (i.e. 53.4%) were processed after this deadline and in 19 cases no reply had yet been received from Germany (in the remaining one case it was not possible to determine when Germany answered the request for information on the basis of the declared information).
More detailed information on the deadlines within which requests for information from the Czech Republic from Germany were answered can be found in Graph No. 3.
The percentages of intra-Community turnover indicated in the requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in Graph No. 4.
The graph above shows that the turnover audited in connection with requests for information usually had values of over €60,000.
The international exchange of information without prior request takes place either automatically, structured automatically or in the form of spontaneous information.
The tax officials of other Member States are often provided with information without prior request, which is important for fixing the VAT liability.
In the Czech Republic, all information is collected at the CLO.
The exchange of information between the individual Member States is electronic.
"Automatic exchange" in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 means the systematic transmission of previously defined information to other Member States at regular, pre-determined intervals without prior request.
"Structured automatic exchange" means the systematic transfer of previously defined information to another Member State without its prior request as soon as the information in question is available.
The Czech Republic informs the other Member States in the automatic exchange of information on deliveries of new vehicles.
The tax officer obtains this information from the form notification of the delivery of a new vehicle in accordance with § 19 of Act No. 235 / 2004 as well as from the copy of the issued invoice.
When processing this form, the tax officer enters the required data in the corresponding document template and forwards it directly to the responsible employee of the Finance Directorate, where this data is collected and sent to the CLO for further processing. Thereafter, this data will be transmitted to the other Member States within the specified period, namely no later than two months after the end of the quarter in which it was obtained.
The Czech Republic also provides other Member States with information on mail order transactions that are tax-free in the country of origin, on intra-Community transactions that appear inadmissible and on potential "missing traders."
This information is transmitted to the other Member States by means of an SCAC form in a spontaneous exchange of information.
Implementation of the international exchange of information in Germany
In Germany, the initiative for requests for information and spontaneous exchange of information comes from the local FA.
The FÄ send the completed form SCAC 2004 by e-mail directly to the German CLO, which forwards the SCACforms to the foreign CLO.
The FÄ are instructed to write their requests for information or spontaneous information only in German, even the used SCACform is single-language.
Half of the German requests for information examined by the BRH were sent in order to ensure employment taxation in the other Member State or to prove the tax exemption of intra-Community delivery from Germany to the other Member State.
If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it checks whether the value of the deliveries mentioned in the request exceeds the minimum amount limit of €15,000.
If there is no adequate justification for the request, the German CLO refuses to provide information regarding a turnover that is below the minimum amount limit.
In addition, the German CLO provides the translation of the freely formulated texts in the SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)] if they are not written in German or English.
To answer the request for information, the CLO forwards it to the responsible FA and refers to the three-month period.
No further deadlines have been set at the various levels of the German financial administration.
Although the German CLO has the technical means to monitor compliance with the deadline, it does not have the necessary personnel capacities to remind the FÄ of responding to the unfinished requests for information.
The FÄ receive the required information by letter from the tax subject or carrying out an external audit.
The external auditors usually choose between two forms of audit: the VAT special audit, which covers all tax-subject transactions within a period of several months or the so-called VAT inspection, which may only refer to a recent transaction.
With this short and flexible form of examination, an announcement to the tax liable is not necessary and it has proven itself in the investigation of a single turnover.
In the automatic exchange of information, Germany transmits the following information to the other Member State: - via VAT ID number allocated to companies established in other EC Member States - on the reimbursement of input tax to entrepreneurs resident in other EC Member States.
In addition, Germany has undertaken to provide the other EC Member States with the following information as part of the structured automatic exchange of information:
a. The delivery of new vehicles to entrepreneurs without VAT No., b. Remote sales (mail order) to other EC Member States that are not subject to VAT in Germany, c. Significant deviations between the acquisitions reported by a tax liable person and the MIAS data transmitted by other Member States, i.e. intra-Community deliveries of items incorrectly subject to taxation by the tax liable in Germany, e. Potential "missing traders" who have made intra-Community sales, regardless of whether their VAT number is still valid or has already been deleted, and f. Tax liable persons who have made intra-Community deliveries to potential "missing traders" or to customers who have misused a VAT I
Comparison and evaluation
The sending of requests for information or spontaneous information takes place both in the Czech Republic and in Germany on the initiative of the locally responsible FÄ, who submit the corresponding SCACforms to the CLO.
While the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCACforms (Czech-English) and translates provided information into English or German, the German FÄ follow the instructions to write requests for information or spontaneous information on a monolingual form only in German.
The German CLO does not produce translations of German texts.
When examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany in the period 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005, the NKò found that the Czech financial administration completed 74.5% of the requests for information received within the three-month period, while the requests for information addressed to Germany were only settled by the German financial administration in 40.6% of the cases within this period.
Although the German CLO informs the FÄ of the three-month period, it does not monitor its compliance.
Due to the lack of memories, there is a high proportion of temporarily answered requests for information.
Therefore, the BRH has recommended a continuous reminder procedure to the German CLO.
The situation has now changed.
According to the information available to us, the German CLO now reminds the tax offices to answer the outstanding requests for information.
VAT risk management
Risk management in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, several organisational units at various levels of financial administration are involved in risk management in the area of VAT.
Within the Czech Ministry of Finance, the following organisational units are responsible for risk management and the fight against VAT fraud:
The Department of Methodology and Economic Administration of VAT and its Department for Risk Management deals with the identification of potential risk areas for tax revenue and evaluates the trends in these risks in domestic and intra-Community trade.
At national level, this body coordinates the requirements for the criterion "credibility of VAT returns" and uses the MIAS data to detect possible tax evasion in the context of intra-Community supplies and acquisitions.
Based on data on the trade balance of the Czech Republic, it evaluates high-risk goods, conceptually prepares risk management in the area of VAT and cooperates in this area with the competent EC institutions and the other Member States.
The Department for International Administrative Assistance in the field of VAT provides, among other things, for the exchange of information, contributes to the creation and maintenance of a relevant information database, evaluates the data available in the MIAS system from other Member States, carries out public relations work and is responsible for other forms of intergovernmental assistance within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003.

The Department of Tax Audit and Tax Investigation Methodology carries out risk analyses in the context of the methodological management of tax audits, sets priorities for the work planning of the financial directorates with regard to the selection of cases to be examined, prepares risk analyses to combat tax evasion and, in this context, collects information from the financial administration and other sources and makes proposals for measures to combat tax evasion.
Their tasks include the search for tax liabilities and industries that are risky in terms of the frequency of tax evasion (e.g. internet transactions, gold, pharmaceutical industry), the search for unregistered tax liabilities (e.g. in the Internet services, employment services, electronic and print media, etc.), the investigation of entanglements in chain fraud cases and the information of local tax authorities.
Special examination units were set up in 12 selected FÄ.
These have regional jurisdiction and, on the basis of appropriate authorisation, also carry out tax audits outside the local jurisdiction of the FÄ.
The need to set up the special audit units resulted from the increase in identified new and "improved" forms of tax evasion, especially in connection with chain transactions.
These special units examine according to the needs of the tax investigation agencies or concentrate on tax liabilities with certain activities, multinational companies and tax liabilities with particularly high turnover.
The following mechanisms for reducing VAT risks have been integrated into the ATIS system: - the task of "credibility of VAT returns" to assess the risk vulnerability of tax returns filed, - the task of "selecting the tax liabilities to be audited," selecting the tax liabilities to be audited on the basis of certain criteria, - the task of "MIAS," which allows tax officials access to the data provided by the other EC Member States.
The task "MIAS" enables, among other things, the following: - verification of the validity of the VAT ID of taxpayers from other Member States, - confirmation of the value of the goods delivered to a Czech taxpayer, as indicated in the ZM by all suppliers of the taxpayer in question from other Member States, - preparation of a list of taxpayers who have not surrendered a ZM, - formal control of the information provided by taxpayers in the Czech Republic before this information is transmitted to other Member States, - preparation of a list of taxpayers in whose VAT returns the information on deliveries of goods to other Member States does not correspond to the information in the ZM, - preparation of a list of taxpayers in whose VA
As part of their tasks to combat tax evasion, tax officials have access to the data from state authorities such as commercial registers, land registry, motor vehicle registers, trade registers, etc.
More detailed information can be found in section 4.4.1 Submission and processing of summary notifications in the Czech Republic.
Risk management in Germany
Because of their federal structure, both the federal finance authorities (in particular the CLO) and the financial administrations of the 16 federal states are involved in the development and introduction of an RMS in the Federal Republic of Germany.
Although there are joint working groups for development, neither the CLO nor the financial administrations of the federal states fully have a uniform database.
At the level of the CLO, Unit ST I 2 (hereinafter "KUSS" - Coordination Office for VAT Special Audits and Tax Investigation Measures) collects the audit findings on fraud cases in the OPUS database.
In cooperation with the countries, another database called ZAUBER has been set up at KUSS, where the tax offices can enter and query the names of discovered missing traders or VAT fraudsters.
The KUSS coordinates both related cases of VAT fraud at national level and cases of cross-border VAT fraud.
The experiences of the KUSS are contributed to the development of the RMS through their cooperation in the working groups.
In addition, experts from several other organisational units of the CLO and the BMF are also involved.
The formal review of the composition of VAT No. of other Member States appearing in the ZM of German tax obligations is carried out by the CLO.
This formal review takes place prior to the transmission of the CM to other Member States in order to improve the reliability of the MIAS data and thus its benefits (see 4.4.2).
The validity of the VAT ID number mentioned in the ZM is checked on the basis of the O _ MCTL identifiers transmitted by the other Member States (for the procedure of correcting invalid VAT ID No., see also 4.4.2).
In addition, the CLO's RMS relies on the MIAS data transmitted by the other Member States and generates various types of communications to detect suspected missing traders. Certain characteristics that usually occur in carousel transactions are used as clues.
The FÄ of the federal states are instructed to process these communications and have to forward the outcome of their investigations to the CLO in certain cases.
The audit by the BRH has confirmed that all available characteristics must be included in order to conclude with sufficient probability a case of tax fraud (instead of focusing mainly on a company's turnover).
Accordingly, the BRH has recommended that the BMF work with combinations of different clues in the preparation of the communications.
The risk management system should also take into account other indications, e.g. the payment behaviour of the taxpayer, the industry or the shareholding relationships of the company.
A second level of risk management exists with the financial administrations of the federal states and concentrates on the processing of VAT pre-registrations and annual declarations.
For example, the system creates a list of those tax liable persons who have indicated intra-community deliveries in their VAT pre-registration or annual declaration.
This list is sent to the CLO to monitor the complete delivery of the ZM.
Furthermore, in this type of risk management, the acquisitions indicated by the taxpayer in his annual VAT return are compared with the data in the MIAS.
The financial administrations of the federal states avoid a comparison of the quarterly data, as these would result in too many discrepancies due to factors other than tax evasion or tax fraud; e.g.:
- Supplier and purchaser assume different times for the execution of intra-Community turnover;
- different accounting recording and tax declaration of discounts and discounts.
In addition to comparing the information from the VAT returns with the MIAS data, many federal states have certain risk management mechanisms based on information in the VAT returns and certain other indications (e.g. company wording, age of the owner / shareholder, number of employees and method of payment of the tax subject).
Bavaria has introduced a risk management system based on fixed rules that enables a team of specialists in the fight against tax fraud (hereinafter "risk managers") to program their own rules in such a way that suspected tax fraudsters are filtered out.
This system is used in the processing of VAT pre-registrations by the FÄ.
As a result, the responsible FA receives the information from the RMS before the VAT is fixed.
Since this system is not capable of learning, risk managers must adapt the rules according to feedback from the FÄ.
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has developed an adaptive neural network based on the data of uncovered evasion cases.
Based on this data, the RMS is able to learn the characteristics of tax evasion.
The system draws up a monthly list of tax cases where there is evidence of tax evasion.
On the basis of this list, the competent FÄ decide on the examination of the taxpayers concerned.
After the audit, the tax auditors must report their results so that the RMS can learn from the results of the audits it proposes.
In North Rhine-Westphalia, an adaptive neural network is used in combination with a rule-based fuzzy system.
Based on a lot of data from processed VAT returns and some other clues, this neuro-fuzzy system (also called datamining system) calculates how likely it is that a tax liable person is involved in tax fraud.
It then draws up a monthly list of suspected tax fraudsters.
Based on this list, the FÄ select the tax liable persons concerned for examination and report the audit results to the data center concerned.
The introduction of these three RMS is underway in the federal states.
Since each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three anti-fraud systems seems effective.
Whether the hoped-for effects will occur during the actual use remains to be seen.
Comparison and evaluation
Although it is not possible in this report to deal with the specific criteria of the RMS in the Czech and German, the NKò and the BRH have found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.
Like the different approaches in the three aforementioned German federal states, the RMS of each European state has its special strengths and weaknesses.
There is currently an exchange of experience between the tax authorities of the European Member States on new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.
VAT fraud - especially carousel fraud - has proved to be not a national but a European problem.
People involved in fraud coordinate their actions not only in one Member State, but in several Member States.
A Member State alone cannot develop an effective RMS.
Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each EC Member State. If this does not happen, fraudsters choose the Member State with the weakest RMS for their crimes.
The tax losses caused by Europe-wide VAT fraud do not necessarily affect the Member State in which the initiator is based.
Any other Member State involved in the fraud may be affected.
That is why there should be a European exchange of experience on the RMS.
Selected results from the audit of individual sales As part of the parallel audits, the NKò and the BRH examined the quality and usability of information on selected deliveries.
Acquisitions that were the subject of the international exchange of information between the financial administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.
In addition, the two accounting courts jointly examined the handling of several deliveries, about whose implementation there were doubts, or which the tax liabilities of both states explained differently in the tax returns or ZM.
At the request of the BRH, the NKò examined a total of eight business transactions between eight Czech and eight German tax obligations.
In addition, the NKò examined in 43 cases on the basis of communications from the BRH the values of intra-community transactions with Germany, which Czech tax liabilities had indicated in their tax returns and ZM.
At the request of the NKò, the BRH reviewed a total of 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech tax liabilities.
The relevant information was exchanged exclusively on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 on the CLO.
The examination of the selected cases revealed, inter alia, that the different registration procedures in the EC Member States lead to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:
1.
According to the MIAS data, a Czech tax liable acquired goods worth €60,500 from a German tax liable in the third quarter of 2004.
When the Czech tax liable declared an acquisition of only €29,869, the Czech financial administration sent a request for information to Germany to verify the value of the delivered goods.
In its response to the Czech request for information, the German side stated that the German tax liable in question had delivered goods worth €27,381 to its Czech business partner in the second quarter of 2004, goods worth €31,997 in the third quarter and €10,276 in the fourth quarter.
Furthermore, it emerged from the answer that the VAT ID number of the German tax liable was only valid from 28 September 2004. However, the German CLO had granted a further application of the German tax liable and brought forward the validity of the VAT ID number retroactively to 1 May 2004.
The German tax liable corrected the ZM.
On the basis of this information, it was an (intra-Community) acquisition of goods by the Czech tax liable.
Through a request to the competent tax office in the Czech Republic, the NKò found that in 2004 the Czech tax liable had filed supplementary VAT returns for the individual (during the year) taxation periods in which he declared a higher value of the acquisitions from other Member States and at the same time requested the deduction of input tax from the acquisitions from the other Member States.
On the basis of these additional VAT returns, the responsible clerk of the Czech tax office could not clearly determine whether the declared acquisitions also included the value of the deliveries of the aforementioned German supplier.
In response to a request for information from the NKò, the BRH determined that the German supplier had been registered as subject to VAT in September 2003.
At the time of registration, he had not applied for the allocation of a VAT ID number, but only for a tax number valid exclusively for Germany.
Although it is usually not possible in Germany to retroactively allocate a VAT ID to a tax liable person, the responsible clerk of the German financial administration did so in 2006 retroactively as of 1 May 2004.
The German CLO assigns a VAT ID number retroactively if the German entrepreneur did not cause the delayed allocation; e.g. if the CLO caused the delay after the request of the tax obligation to issue a VAT ID number.
In this case, the CLO grants the VAT ID number retroactively, because the entrepreneur does not require a valid VAT ID number for an intra-community delivery according to § 6 UStG.
Conversely, a German purchaser does not need the (valid) VAT ID of its supplier to declare the intra-community acquisition.
Because of these procedural differences between the Member States, the German CLO issued the VAT ID retroactively in this particular case.
2.
As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech tax official requested a review of the VAT registration of the German entrepreneur.
The MIAS data show the date of registration as 5 March 2005, while a registration certificate issued by the local German FA indicates 1 October 2004.
The German authorities stated in their reply that the German tax liable had been registered on 1 October 2004, but for organisational reasons had not been assigned a VAT ID number in Germany until 16 February 2005.
Through a request from the local Czech tax official, the NKò learned that the tax official had carried out a VAT audit with the Czech tax officer for the taxation periods from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.
During this audit, the tax office found that the Czech tax liable had declared services worth CZK 9,897 in his VAT return, which he had provided to the German tax liable before his VAT registration (i.e. before 1 October 2004).
The (Czech) tax office set a tax liability of CZK 1,880 against the Czech tax liable for the third quarter of 2004.
Based on the request of the NKò, the BRH determined that the German tax liable had only been assigned the VAT ID when he registered his company founded in 2004 with the FA on 16 February 2005.
In addition, the FA registered it retroactively from 1 October 200415 for VAT purposes in order to monitor the filing of the VAT return for 2004.
In this VAT return, the tax liable stated intra-Community acquisitions from the Czech Republic worth €160 (approx. CZK 5,000).
3. In his VAT return for September 2004 and in his ZM for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech tax liable stated deliveries of goods worth CZK 114,615 to a German tax liable.
When checking the registration of the German tax liable in the MIAS system, the Czech tax official determined that this registration was only valid from 11 November 2004 and thus after the deliveries of goods to Germany.
The Czech tax liable issued a supplementary VAT return in which he declared sales from domestic deliveries worth CZK 114,615 and VAT of CZK 21,777, which he paid.
Through an inquiry with the local FA in the Czech Republic, the NKò found that the Czech tax liable subsequently filed an application for the resumption of the taxation proceedings in the matter of the supplementary VAT return. As evidence, he submitted a confirmation from the German financial administration that the German tax liable had been registered since 1 January 2000.
Accordingly, the Czech tax official checked the validity of the registration of the German tax liable in the context of the international exchange of information.
The German information revealed that the German tax liable had only been assigned a VAT ID number on 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods.
As a result, the Czech tax official rejected the request for a resumption of the taxation procedure.
The BRH stated that in this case no intra-Community acquisition of goods had taken place because the German tax liable had only received a VAT ID on 11 November 2004.
However, the German recipient declared both the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and the VAT on it and also demanded the reimbursement of input taxes of the same amount.
Because this did not lead to a change in the amount of the tax liability of the German tax liable, the German tax official did not correct the information in the VAT return.
Furthermore, the BRH noted that the company of the German tax obligation mentioned in the request for information was changed during the processing of the answer in Germany, which led to confusion between two German tax obligations.
This name change in the German tax obligation also confused the Czech tax official.
4.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax official reviewed the acquisition of goods in the first quarter of 2005 by a Czech tax liable from a German tax liable worth €22,686.
Through an inquiry with the local tax official in the Czech Republic, the NKò found that the Czech tax official had examined in the context of an external audit with the Czech tax liable whether the intra-community delivery had actually taken place and whether the Czech tax liable had booked and paid the invoice for the delivery of the goods.
The Czech tax liable did not declare the intra-community acquisition in his VAT return, because the German supplier did not specify his VAT ID number in the invoice but only his tax number intended for transactions within Germany.
According to the MIAS data, the German tax liable is only registered for VAT in connection with intra-Community turnover from 21 April 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech tax liable.
The Czech tax official also requested that the German tax administration send a copy of the registration certificate of the German tax obligation so that he could initiate a corresponding taxation procedure if necessary.
The Czech FA regarded this transaction as the acquisition of goods from a non-entrepreneurial (private) person in Germany and therefore did not set VAT for the purchase of the goods from Germany.
The BRH found that under German law, a tax liable person who delivers goods to other Member States does not have to have a VAT ID for intra-Community deliveries in order to be able to claim the VAT exemption for such a delivery.
The supplier must only have the VAT number of the purchaser in the other Member State and be able to prove the transport of the goods in question to the other Member State.
In this case, turnover under German tax law is a (tax-exempt) intra-Community delivery, which should be subject to acquisition taxation in the Czech Republic.
In any case, it is important that the Czech tax official took note of this transaction because the delivery of a machine of this value was not part of the core business of the German supplier.
As described in Section 4.6.2, the German CLO rejects requests for information on intra-Community sales if they are below the minimum amount limit of €15,000: 5.
According to the MIAS data, a Czech tax liable acquired goods worth €12,561 from a German tax liable in the third quarter of 2004.
The Czech tax official carried out an audit for this taxation period.
Within the framework of intergovernmental assistance, the Czech financial administration requested the examination of this delivery of goods by means of an SCAC form.
The Czech tax liable declared that he had not received the goods, had never had a business relationship with the German company and that the purchase of the goods in question had not been booked with him.
The German financial administration rejected the request for the transmission of documents - contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents - because the turnover was less than €15,000 and no other justification had been given.
Since the Czech tax official did not receive any documents for subsequent taxation of the purchased goods, the tax audit remained inconclusive and the original tax fixing was valid.
On the basis of a request from the NKò, the BRH determined that the German tax liable acted as "fiscal representative 17" (§ 22 (a) - (e) UStG).
The German tax liable declared these deliveries in his VAT return and in the ZM.
His right to tax exemption was recognised.
On the basis of the notification by the BRH, the German FA will send the documents required for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods to the Czech Republic.
Section 4.6.1 showed that the responses of the German financial administration to requests for information exceeded the three-month period more frequently than the answers of the Czech financial administration:
6. During its audit, the NKò found that on 5 October 2005, the Czech Financial Administration had sent a request for information on the value of goods deliveries to Germany in the fourth quarter of 2004.
In the ZM for this quarter, the German tax liable had reported a delivery of goods to the Czech tax liable worth €86,307; however, the Czech tax liable only declared the purchase of goods worth €35,314 in his VAT return for the same period.
In response to the request for information received by the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, i.e. after the expiry of the maximum processing period laid down in Art. 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003, the German side informed that the request for information could not be processed since the German company had been dissolved at the end of 2005.
Because the German tax administration did not meet the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech tax administration did not have the documents necessary for taxation in the Czech Republic.
7. In 2005, a Czech tax official used an SCAC form to review a delivery of motor vehicles to a German tax liable worth €1,265,554 in the third and fourth quarters of 2004, with evidence of carousel fraud.
The NKò noted that a German response to the request for information had not yet been received at the time of its examination.
Through an inquiry with the local tax official, the NKò determined that the Czech tax liable had not declared in his VAT return the delivery of new motor vehicles to these German tax liable persons worth 11,816,103 CZK.
The Czech tax official corrected the information in the tax return and the Czech tax liable issued a corrected ZM.
Due to technical problems, the German CLO did not forward this request for information to the local FA for examination.
Following the notification by the BRH, a special VAT audit was carried out at the German acquirer in Germany. It was determined that the acquisition of all motor vehicles in question had been taxed correctly and that the vehicles were sold on to other tax obligations in Germany.
8. According to the MIAS data, the Czech tax liable acquired a car worth €48,500 from a German tax liable in the fourth quarter of 2004.
However, the Czech tax liable did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.
By inquiry with the local tax official in the Czech Republic, the NKò determined that the Czech tax liable had not filed a VAT return since August 2004.
The Czech tax liable did not file any tax returns even at the request of the tax official. As a result, the FA set the VAT liability for the period October to December 2004 at zero on 23 May 2005.
On 2 June 2005, the CLO issued an instruction to examine the aforementioned delivery from the German tax liable.
Since the Czech tax officer did not cooperate with the tax official, he directed a request for information on the above-mentioned delivery to Germany.
Since the answer to the request for information was not received until 7 February 2007, it was not known until the conclusion of the audit of the NKò how the Czech tax official used the information obtained in the international exchange of information.
Due to non-fulfilment of the obligations under the Czech VAT Act, the VAT registration of the Czech tax obligation was deleted with effect from 23 August 2005.
In some cases, only a partial answer was sent because at the time of the examination of the NKò and the BRH, the competent FA had not yet completed the external examination:
9.
In 2005, the Czech tax official used an SCAC form to review a delivery of motor vehicles to a German tax liable worth €16,991 in the third quarter of 2004, with evidence of carousel fraud.
In his reply to the request for information, the German tax official stated that he had only the invoices issued by the Czech tax obligation for deliveries worth €16,335.
Due to the request of the NKò, the BRH determined that the external audit carried out by the German FA at the acquirer in Germany had not yet been completed.
The German acquirer declared the purchase of goods worth €16,335 twice in its VAT pre-registrations for the months of August and September 2004.
10. In 2005, a Czech tax official used an SCAC form to review the deliveries of motor vehicles to a German tax liable worth €198,167 in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, with signs of carousel fraud.
The German financial administration sent a partial answer to the request for information to the Czech Republic, in which it confirmed that the German tax liable had acquired several motor vehicles and that the investigation in Germany had not yet been completed.
The NKò found that the local FA had carried out several external audits with the Czech tax liable in order to check the deduction of above-average input taxes.
However, no unjustified claim was found.
The BRH found that the German tax liable had declared in its VAT returns the purchase of goods from other Member States with a total value of €579,114 for the period in question, and that the audit of the German FA with the acquirer in Germany has not yet been completed.
Section 4.4.1 describes the reasons for discrepancies between the declaration of intra-Community acquisitions in the recipient's VAT return and the information in the supplier's ZM.
In the cases examined, it emerged that periodic discrepancies 18 or the incorrect declaration of a turnover as an intra-Community delivery of goods were not the most frequent reasons for the differences:
11.
According to data from MIAS, the Czech tax liable acquired goods worth €35,716 from the German tax liable in the first quarter of 2005; however, the Czech tax liable did not declare this acquisition.
Since the Czech tax officer did not cooperate with the tax official and no business activity took place at the company's legal headquarters, the Czech tax official requested a review of how the German tax officer had communicated with the Czech one as part of the international exchange of information.
The German response to the request for information revealed that according to the findings of the German financial administration, the Czech tax liable was unknown at the indicated address and the goods were picked up by an agreed freight forwarder.
The total value of the order was €155,000, but the German tax liable only delivered goods worth €21,659.
The Czech tax liable sent the German tax liable an incorrect payment confirmation of the amount of €155,153 in favor of the German tax liable.
Following the discovery of the fraudulent behaviour of the Czech acquirer, the German tax liable, with the support of his other Czech customers, managed to get back the delivered material with the exception of a part worth €7,916.
Through a request to the local FA in the Czech Republic, the NKò found that, on the basis of the information received, the financial administration subsequently taxed the turnover of goods deliveries from other Member States in the amount of CZK 388,522.
Due to a request from the NKò, the BRH confirmed that after corrections, the German supplier had only reported a delivery of goods to the Czech tax liable worth €7,916.
In accordance with German legislation, the German tax liable declared the reversal of the delivery and the reduction of the tax base in the quarter of the reversal.
His ZM contained the following information concerning the Czech tax obligations:
12.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German financial administration requested the review of a delivery of goods and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005 by means of an SCACform.
According to the request for information, the Czech tax liable had delivered goods with a total value of €396,126 to the German tax liable during the period in question and provided services worth €11,885.
The NKò found that the Czech financial administration had carried out an audit with the Czech tax liable to investigate this delivery.
In response to the request for information, the Czech financial administration announced that the Czech tax liable had supplied and assembled a production plant to the German one.
The Czech tax liable supplied the individual parts of the production plant before the accession of the Czech Republic to the EC and the production plant was assembled on the basis of the order after 1 May 2004.
The German tax liable did not take down the assembled production plant and claimed defects.
In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech tax liable calculated the German production plant for €107,100 and €11,885 for services.
The German tax liable received the invoices, but did not recognize them and did not pay them.
By inquiry with the local tax official in the Czech Republic, the NKò determined that all invoices in the books of the Czech tax payer had been properly recorded.
The VAT returns for the third quarter of 2005 contained only the amounts documented by the Czech tax liable and related to invoices invoiced after the first of May 2004.
The BRH noted that on the basis of the response of the Czech financial administration, the local FA came to the conclusion that these turnover was a uniform (goods) delivery of the Czech tax liable to the German, including the assembly carried out.
In this particular case, the place of fulfilment of this so-called factory delivery is the place where the production plant is assembled.
The German recipient of the factory delivery owes the VAT in accordance with the German VAT Act.
At the same time, the recipient can claim an input tax deduction of the same amount.
Since the German tax liability remained unchanged, the German FA did not prompt a correction of the VAT return.
13. According to the MIAS data, the Czech tax liable A acquired a machine worth €58,000 from the German tax liable C. in February 2005.
The Czech tax official sent a request to Germany to verify this information.
In response to the request for information, the German side announced that the German tax liable C had delivered this machine to the Czech tax liable B in 2004, who had returned it to the German tax liable C in October 2004.
According to the German financial administration, the aircraft was not transported back to Germany, but to the branch of the German tax liable C in the Czech Republic.
The answer to the request for information also revealed that the German tax liable C had delivered the machine to the Czech tax liable A in February 2005.
He received the machine at the headquarters of the branch of the German tax liable in the Czech Republic.
Since this delivery (from C to A) took place only within the Czech Republic, there was no internal delivery of goods.
By inquiry with the local tax official responsible for tax liable B, the NKò determined that according to the MIAS data, the German tax liable C had delivered goods (another machine) worth €88,027 to the Czech tax liable in the third quarter of 2004.
Tax liable B declared that he had not received these goods, so the local Czech tax official addressed a request for information to Germany.
The answer was that the machine had been delivered.
In the course of further investigations into the tax liable B, the tax official determined that the machine worth €88,027 had not been booked with the tax liable B and that it could be the same type of machine as the branch of the German tax liable C had delivered to the Czech tax liable A in February 2005.
The NKò also noted that the Czech tax official responsible for the tax liable A had carried out an audit on it.
The tax official had the invoice of the German tax liable C of 7 February 2005, in which the tax liable A is indicated as the recipient of the machine.
The Czech tax official noted that the tax liable A had not recorded this invoice.
Tax liable A had concluded a leasing contract with another Czech company whose object was a machine of the same kind.
The leasing company delivered the aircraft on 9 February 2005 and also took care of the transport.
The Czech FA did not use the information provided in the reply to the request for information to determine the tax liability of the tax liable A.
The BRH stated that the German tax liable C had delivered the machine worth €88,027 not to the Czech Republic, but to another German tax liable D.
Accordingly, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods, but a tax-liable delivery within Germany.
Consequently, the German tax official did not recognize the claim of the German tax liable C to VAT exemption and corrected the information in his tax return.
The German tax liable D delivered the machine to the Czech tax liable B.
Under German law, this delivery was not subject to tax in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.
The BRH also noted that the German tax liable C had indicated in its ZM for the first quarter of 2005 the delivery of a machine worth €58,000 to the Czech tax liable A.
This delivery was not checked during the tax audit carried out by the German FA.
The figure below represents the contractual relationships between the business partners involved in the above-mentioned transactions.
14.
When examining requests for information received, the NKò found that the Czech financial administration had received a request for information from Germany on 4 October 2005, in which a German tax official requested the inspection of intra-Community deliveries of a German tax liable worth €879,680,625 to a Czech tax liable.
The German tax official stated that there was a suspicion that this was a fictitious intra-Community delivery of goods.
The German tax liable has not exercised any active business activity since 1999.
The NKò noted that the Czech tax official had carried out an external audit of the Czech tax liable.
The head of the Czech company explained that this was probably a claim of the German tax liable vis-à-vis the German financial administration, which the Czech tax liable had asserted as a shareholder in the German company with the German FA.
According to the information provided to the NKò, the Czech tax official has so far no information that the German financial administration is handling the case with regard to the Czech tax liable.
The available information shows that it was not a delivery of goods; nevertheless, the amount in question is still stored in the MIAS as an intra-Community delivery of goods from Germany to a Czech tax obligation.
The main reason for these discrepancies was the failure to indicate the intra-Community acquisition in the tax returns of the recipients (see section 4.4.1):
15. According to the MIAS data, a German tax liable delivered goods with a total value of €33,205 to a Czech tax liable in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005.
However, the Czech tax liable did not declare the intra-Community acquisition.
The Czech tax official requested an examination of the delivery of goods from Germany as part of the intergovernmental exchange of information.
In its response to this request for information, the German side stated that the German tax liable had sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech tax liable, and that the remaining goods had been collected personally.
By inquiry with the local Czech Fi- nance official, the NKò determined that the Czech tax liable had submitted a supplementary VAT return for the period in question before receiving a reply to the request for information.
Nevertheless, the differences regarding the values of the acquisitions could not be clarified, so the Czech tax official recommended a tax audit with the Czech tax liable.
This examination has not yet been carried out.
16. According to the MIAS data, a German tax liable had delivered goods worth €46,854 to a Czech tax liable in the third quarter of 2004.
For the same period, a Czech tax liable declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only €14,856.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech tax official asked for a verification of the actual value of the delivery.
With the German response to this request, three invoices were sent showing a total value of the delivered goods of €31,999, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech tax liable and the MIAS data.
By inquiry with the local Czech tax official, the NKò determined that after receiving the answer from Germany, he had contacted the accountant of the Czech tax officer and remained with her in such a way that, after checking the invoices, she wanted to talk together with the company owner about filing a supplementary VAT return for the third quarter of 2004.
Until now, no supplementary VAT return has been filed.
The Czech tax official informed the NKò that he would proceed in such a way that the deadlines for a retroactive VAT fixing for the relevant taxation period would be met.
17.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German tax liable delivered goods worth €11,600 to the German tax liable.
Within the framework of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the German tax official requested to check whether the aforementioned Czech tax liable actually existed, since the alleged capital owner of the German tax liable had founded a number of bogus figures in Germany.
In the course of the FA's review of the transaction, the Czech tax liable confirmed the purchase of the goods.
According to the Czech tax liable, however, the goods were not delivered from Germany to the Czech Republic, but were resold in Germany in 2005.
The Czech tax liable presented evidence for the sale in January 2005.
The Czech tax liable was not registered as subject to VAT in Germany and had not taxed the sale of the goods in question in the Czech Republic or in Germany.
All these facts pointed to tax evasion within Germany and the Czech tax official transmitted this information to the German financial administration in his reply to the request for information.
By inquiry with the local Czech tax official, the NKò found that the Czech tax liable had filed a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004 on the basis of a tax audit, in which he declared, among other things, the value of the goods he had acquired from a German tax liable and at the same time asserted the right to deduct input tax for the acquisition from other Member States.
In his Czech VAT return, he did not file a VAT on the sale of goods in Germany.
Due to a supplementary VAT return filed after the external audit, the Czech tax official set the VAT liability unchanged.
Under Czech law, there was no purchase of goods from other Member States in this case, as the goods were not shipped or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.
Thus, the Czech tax official drew the wrong conclusion during the external audit.
The BRH noted that immediately after receiving the reply to the request for information, which showed that the goods had not left Germany, the German tax official corrected the tax return of the German tax liable and demanded the payment of VAT worth €1,600.
In addition, the competent FA sent a control notice to the FA responsible for the actual recipient of the goods to ensure that the resale of these goods is properly taxed.
In the following cases, entrepreneurs declared intra-Community deliveries that may not have been carried out:
18.
The Czech tax official received a request for information from the German tax administration on the question of whether the Czech tax liable had acquired a car worth €47,400 from the German tax liable in February 2005.
An imprint of the VAT registration certificate of the Czech tax obligation was attached to the request for information.
Another attachment was a photocopy of the passport of the person who was supposed to have transferred the vehicle.
In the course of his investigation, the Czech tax official found that the passport had been stolen, that the person named therein had not imported a vehicle into the Czech Republic and stated that she had no contacts with a German tax liable.
The VAT registration certificate, the imprint of which had been sent by the German side, had not been issued by the Czech financial administration.
With this information, the Czech tax official answered the request for information and at the same time declared that he could not confirm the purchase of the car.
By inquiry with the local Czech tax official, the NKò determined that the Czech tax liable does not have his registered office at the address indicated in the Commercial Register and that the managing director of the company is not available.
Following a tax complaint procedure for the taxation period February 2005, the Czech tax official set the tax liability of the Czech tax liable at zero.
In the course of a further investigation, the Czech finance official found that the vehicle in question had been sold to another Czech person who had acquired it on the basis of an internet advertisement.
The BRH found that the local German tax official had rejected the claim of the German tax obligation to exempt this delivery from VAT on the basis of the Czech response to the request for information.
19. In the course of an external audit, a German FA was unable to clarify a difference of €3,000 between the value of the goods purchased in the VAT return and the reported values from other Member States.
A Czech tax liable should have delivered goods worth €89,424 to a German tax liable in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005.
Since the acquisition declared by the German tax obligation did not correspond to the MIAS data, the German tax official requested the verification of the deliveries and their payment as part of the intergovernmental exchange of information.
In his reply to the request for information, the Czech tax official stated that the only managing director of the Czech company had been deleted from the commercial register on 8 July 2005 and that a new managing director had not yet been registered.
The German recipient of the goods was presumably a relative of the shareholder of the Czech company.
The Czech tax liable issued a VAT return and a ZM, which had been signed after the deletion of the managing director in the commercial register by an unauthorized person, namely this shareholder of the company.
The accountant of the Czech tax liable informed the tax official that the capital owner had paid the payment received for the invoiced goods in euros into the company's account.
Cash receipts were not issued.
By inquiry with the local Czech FA, the NKò found that the tax official had recognised the Czech tax official's right to VAT exemption for deliveries of goods to other Member States worth CZK 1,326,307 in the first quarter of 2004 and CZK 1,416,180 in the first quarter of 2005.
The BRH found that the German tax official did not correct the VAT return of the German acquirer, since in the meantime a German court had confirmed the insolvency of the German tax liable.
Since the earlier external audit showed no signs of tax fraud, there was no prospect of actually being able to levy a fixed VAT liability.
20. According to the MIAS data, a German tax liable acquired goods from the Czech Republic worth €4,251,196 in 2005, after which he had purchased goods worth €43,274 in the previous year.
The German tax liable declared the intra-Community acquisitions neither in his VAT return in 2004 nor in the one for 2005.
In addition, he did not declare any corresponding initial sales in terms of value.
Because of these discrepancies, the German FA submitted a request for information regarding the fourth quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006.
In the ZM for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-community deliveries of goods with a total value of CZK 167,246,083.
On 6 September 2006, the request for information was received, in which the German side requested to check whether the delivery reported by the Czech tax liable had actually taken place.
In response to this request for information, the Czech financial administration stated that the German request could not be complied with because the Czech company did not have a managing director (or other legal representative).
The documents provided to the NKò by the responsible tax official show that, together with the managing director of the Czech tax liable, a protocol on the start of the VAT audit for the fourth quarter of 2004 and the period January to December 2005 had been drawn up on 30 March 2006.
At the same time, the tax officer was asked by the tax officer to submit all accounting and tax documents for this period, but failed to do so.
According to the Commercial Register, the term of office of the only managing director expired on 16 May 2005 without a new managing director being appointed.
The Czech tax liable has not issued any turnover tax returns since April 2006.
As part of the parallel audit, the NKò, in cooperation with the BRH, investigated several cases of intra-Community deliveries between the Czech Republic and Germany, which were not the subject of a prior exchange of information between the two countries.
The two Court of Auditors exchanged information on the audited cases through the CLO of both countries.
21. A Czech company (UCR), which is not based in Germany, informed the responsible FA (Chemnitz-Süd) that it wanted to conduct tax-liable business in Germany.
Based on this information, the company was registered as of June 2005, but did not receive a German VAT ID.
The (UCR) accepted an order from a Danish company (UDK) for the production of wind turbines and their delivery to Austria on behalf, at the risk and for the account of the Danish customer.
Due to insufficient own production capacities, the Danish company passed on part of the contract to a German tax liable (UDE) based in Germany.
The following figure shows the contractual relationships and the transport route of the wind turbines:
According to German law, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as described below:
- The Danish company (UDK) sent the wind turbines to Austria for assembly in its name, at its risk and for its own account.
Because of the assembly, its delivery takes place in Austria, i.e. the delivery of the wind turbines is controllable in Austria.
- Because the freight forwarder was commissioned by the Danish company (UDK) and the latter had the transport carried out in his own name, at his own risk and for his own account, the place of delivery of the German sub-entrepreneur (UDE) is where the transport started, i.e. in Germany.
Although the wind turbines were delivered to another EC Member State (AU) and the recipient is registered as subject to tax in an EC Member State (CR), no tax exemption could be claimed for the delivery of the German sub-entrepreneur (UDE), since the EC Member State for which the delivery was intended is different from the home state of the Czech company19.
Accordingly, the delivery is duly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (UCR) claimed the input tax deduction in its VAT returns.
The place of delivery of the Czech company (UCR) also depends on the place where the transport started.
However, some of the wind turbines were transported from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.
- The delivery of wind turbines manufactured in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.
- The delivery of the other wind turbines manufactured in Germany took place in Germany.
Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) provided both intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-Community deliveries from Germany to Austria.
The BRH noted that the Czech company (UCR) did not declare intra-community deliveries in its German tax returns or in its ZM submitted to the German CLO.
Thus, the Czech company may have treated all its intra-Community supplies uniformly as intra-Community supplies from the Czech Republic.
The NKò noted that (UCR) did not report intra-Community deliveries to Austria, but intra-Community deliveries to Denmark.
To ensure the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in Austria, cooperation between at least four financial administrations (Austrian, Czech, Danish and German) would be required, although in this case there is no evidence of tax fraud or tax evasion.
In addition, the NKò and the BRH examined case designs in order to show the size of the differences caused by the different legislation of 2004 between the information in the VAT returns and the MIAS data.
The cases examined also show that it takes some time for the taxpayers and the FÄ to apply the new legal regulations:
22. In its ZM for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2004, a Czech tax liable reported deliveries of goods with a total value of CZK 792,977,452 to a German tax liable.
During the same period, another Czech tax liable reported intra-Community deliveries to another German tax liable with a total value of CZK 18,157,265 in his ZM.
The information transmitted by the BRH to the NKò revealed that both cases involved electricity supplies.
Both Czech tax obligations took into account the above-mentioned deliveries in accordance with the Czech Law No. 235 / 2004 in force in 2004 in their ZM.
During a further examination of these transactions, an audit group of the NKò found that in 2004 different legal regulations on the supply or acquisition of electrical energy applied between the Czech Republic and Germany.
While in the Czech Republic the taxpayers declared the deliveries of electrical energy in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 235 / 2004 valid in 2004 as intra-Community deliveries of goods, according to the German statutory provisions applicable in 2004, it was not an intra-Community acquisition of goods, but taxable and tax-liable turnover in Germany.
The differences in legal regulations were eliminated in the Czech Republic by the adoption of Act No. 635 / 2004, which amended some tax provisions with effect from 1 January 2005.
23. During the examination of intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions in cooperation with the BRH, it was further determined that a Czech tax liable in his ZM for the first and fourth quarters of 2005 declared intra-Community deliveries to a German tax liable with a total value of CZK 240,411,163 and another Czech tax liable in his ZM for the same period intra-Community deliveries to another German tax liable worth CZK 263,470,776.
Information transmitted by the BRH to the NKò revealed that in both cases it had been supplies of electrical energy.
According to the wording of Law No. 235 / 2004, which applies from 1 January 2005, the place of performance for the supply of electrical energy is the place of performance at which the purchaser has his legal registered office, registered office or permanent establishment for which this delivery takes place.
Therefore, the Czech tax obligations should not have indicated the electricity supplies in their ZM for 2005.
The fact that both taxpayers treated the supply of electrical energy in their ZM as intra-Community supplies led to a difference of CZK 503,881,939 in MIAS.
Concluding remark
Through the cooperation, the goals of the BRH and the NKò were achieved.
Both courts of auditors gained in-depth knowledge of the VAT administration systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The cooperation revealed differences in the two systems and in the legal regulations relevant to VAT administration.
During the parallel tests, interesting cases of intra-community deliveries or acquisitions came to light.
Some of them are worth further observation.
On the basis of the audit results, both courts of auditors drew up recommendations on the management of VAT.
The follow-up of these recommendations in the form of a control review should be part of the further observation.
The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of the two Court of Auditors is the basis for the successful implementation of future audits in the field of VAT administration.

Public procurement of construction services and corruption prevention
Joint report by the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKò) and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on their parallel audits
Introduction and overview
The award of services by public contracting authorities is of great importance for both the state and the economy.
The task of the state is to use public funds as economically and economically as possible and to ensure fair and regulated competition.
In the European Union (EU), the procurement of services by public contracting authorities is an important part of the creation of a single economic area.
In order to ensure largely unrestricted competition across borders, public contracting authorities must comply with EU requirements in their awards above certain value limits (thresholds).
To this end, EU member states must transfer and apply EU public procurement law into national law.
This has already happened in both the Czech Republic and Germany.
Below the EU thresholds, it is up to individual countries to regulate the award of public contracts themselves.
The allocation of benefits is also an area at risk of corruption.
Because of the generally high potential for damage, public contracting authorities must therefore implement appropriate measures to prevent and prevent corruption and inadmissible benefits when awarding their contracts.
In January 2011, the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKò) and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed to carry out parallel audits on both the EU-wide award of construction services and the prevention of corruption.
The audits focused on the application of EU public procurement law transposed into national regulations as well as the prevention of corruption in the award of construction services in building construction, road construction and transport infrastructure.
Awards below the EU thresholds were also included in the considerations with regard to the prevention of corruption.
The audit results of both Court of Auditors are summarised in this Joint Report.
The report will also be addressed to international institutions, such as the International Organization of Supreme Audit Authorities (INTOSAI).
Audit areas and audited bodies The evaluations of the Federal Court of Auditors on the listed topics are mainly based on cross-sectional audits, which it carried out in 2011 / 2012 at the construction administrations, which are responsible for the road and building construction of the federal government in Germany.
He examined, for example, the construction of motorways and large building projects.
In addition, the Federal Court of Auditors drew on results from previous investigations.
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic based its evaluations on audit findings from 2008 to 2011. The tests included construction measures in road construction, rail infrastructure construction, hydraulic engineering, building construction (hospitals, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc.) as well as other construction areas in the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the award of federal public contracts is mainly carried out by the building administrations of the federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the State Building Administration is centrally responsible for procurement in the field of transport infrastructure.
In building construction, awards are carried out decentrally by those bodies that use state budgetary resources.
In both countries, freelancers are also involved in some areas of the procurement procedures.
When comparing the evaluations, differences in public procurement law and the market structure for construction services in both countries must be taken into account.
Structure of public procurement law in both countries
In Germany, the implementation of EU-wide procurement procedures is laid down in laws and regulations.
Procurement procedures limited to the national sector are regulated by budgetary law and the administrative rules based on it.
For both EU-wide and national contracts, many supplementary individual regulations are also provided for by internal administrative provisions,
such as the so-called "procurement manuals" of the federal government, in which the legal requirements are supplemented or formulated in more detail in compliance with public procurement law.
In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure is subject exclusively to the Procurement Act and other statutory provisions that apply to both above and below the EU thresholds.
Procurement law was significantly amended in 2012.
The new regulation strengthened transparency in the handling of public funds, enabled greater competition and limited the possibilities for corruption in the procurement process.
Broad outlines of public procurement law in both countries
In both countries, EU-wide contracts are subject in particular to the open procedure, the non-open procedure and the negotiated procedure.
In Germany, measures below the EU threshold apply to national procurement types (public tender, restricted tender, hands-free procurement), which largely correspond to the aforementioned EU-wide procurement types.
Public procurement law in Germany is characterized by the principle of the priority of the open procedure (for contracts to be carried out across the EU) and the public tender (for national contracts).
Any interested company can submit an offer in the open procedure and in the public tender process.
Another essential feature of German public procurement law is the promotion of medium-sized enterprises.
Above all, the division of an overall construction project into specialist and partial lots serves this purpose.
The individual award of these lots is intended to enable as many companies as possible to participate in the competition.
Both of the aforementioned characteristics of German public procurement law are proven instruments for achieving economic results.
More than 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees work in Germany.
In the Czech Republic, EU-wide procurement procedures also apply to construction projects below the EU threshold.
An exception here is the simplified procedure, in which a less stringent procedure may be applied below the thresholds and under certain conditions.
In accordance with EU law, Czech public procurement law contains provisions to conclude contracts if competition is guaranteed and a favourable price is achieved.
The current legal provisions in the Czech Republic allow the contracting authorities to choose between the open and the non-open procedure.
There are over 85,000 construction companies in the Czech Republic, including about 1,900 companies with 20 or more employees.
Construction volume of public contracting authorities and shares of award types in both countries
In Germany, the total construction volume in 2011 amounted to 307 billion euros.
Of this, 45.5 billion euros were attributable to public construction (15%), which includes, in addition to federal construction, in particular the construction measures of the federal states and municipalities.
The construction volume of the federal government in building construction and highway construction (excluding rail infrastructure construction and hydraulic engineering) amounted to 8.5 billion euros.
The volume of contracts for construction work in the construction and highway construction of the federal government was distributed among the award types in 2011 as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public tenders, 12.7% non-open procedures and restricted tenders and 6.6% negotiation procedures and hands-free awards.
Of these, 33.2% were Europe-wide awards.
The volume of public construction projects in the Czech Republic amounted to 4.7 billion euros in 2011, which corresponded to about 25% of the total volume of all construction projects in the Czech Republic.
In 2009, the volume was 7.8 billion euros, which corresponded to 37% of the total construction volume.
Breakdown by type of award for 2011: 65.1% open procedures 14.3% non-public procedures 9.5% Negotiation procedures 8.4% simplified procedures for contract volumes below the threshold 2.7% Other procedures
The data relate to all public contracts for deliveries, services and construction services awarded by public procurement bodies in 2011.
The above data show that the parallel audits of both countries are directed at a significant proportion of public procurement, the prevention of corruption to be observed in all awards is of great financial importance and that the open procedure and the public tender are of outstanding importance in the award of contracts.
Summary of the results of the parallel tests
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKò) and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have carried out parallel audits in their countries on the EU-wide award of construction services and corruption prevention.
In this context, the working groups of both Court of Auditors compared the corresponding legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and Germany as well as the results of their parallel audits, which they carried out in particular in the fields of building construction and road construction.
They essentially stated:
The EU directives on the award of construction services by public contracting authorities have been transposed into national law in both the Czech Republic and Germany (points 1 and 3.1).
In addition to the EU requirements, the procurement regulations of both countries also serve to prevent corruption, some of which differ in their priorities and details (No. 3.2).
In both countries, an essential requirement for the award documents is that they must contain all the information required for the proper preparation of bids.
The performance descriptions must be neutral and must not have any restrictive requirements.
In Germany, the award documents have largely met these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, it remains a problem to sufficiently determine the subject of the contract.
In Germany, construction work must be divided into lots if possible in order to promote competition.
According to the findings of the BRH, this requirement was largely implemented in Germany.
During its audits, especially in the field of road construction, the NKò found that the award of extensive services without lots or with only very large lots can affect competition and lead to a restriction to only a few large companies.
Restrictions in market potential can result in significant cost increases and carry the risk of price or other agreements.
Under the provisions of both countries, under certain conditions, the contracting authorities may in principle agree with the companies already commissioned additional or modified services that prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (No. 4.1).
The respective requirements for determining the type of award were largely followed in both countries.
According to the regulations of the Czech Republic, procurement bodies are free to choose between open and non-open procedures.
In Germany, on the other hand, the statutory and budgetary priority of the open procedure applies to EU-wide awards or public tenders, which corresponds to the open procedure for national awards.
This allows more companies to submit offers.
This reduces the risk of corruption, makes price fixing between bidders more difficult and leads to the most economical results.
For the construction projects whose estimated total contract values reached or exceeded the EU threshold, the audited construction administrations generally awarded the construction work throughout Europe.
The correct estimation of the expected contract value is an essential basis for choosing the correct type of award.
In Germany, cost databases are used for the cost calculations of public buildings, especially in building construction,
which are based on the evaluations of completed construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, a database is used in the field of road construction, but it is not yet an effective instrument (No. 4.2).
For construction work to be awarded throughout Europe, preliminary information and announcements must be published. This is intended to strengthen competition by enabling interested companies to adapt to the planned awards at an early stage.
The audited building administrations usually adhered to this requirement.
In individual cases, incorrect information, incorrect applications or lack of controls may have affected competition (No. 4.3).
The selection of applicants to participate in non-public procurement procedures is particularly susceptible to manipulation.
Under EU law, the number of invited applicants must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not discriminate and must be announced beforehand.
In addition to the EU requirements, the procurement bodies in both countries should switch as frequently as possible among the companies to be requested when selecting applicants.
In order to counter the risk of manipulation, there are sometimes very detailed specifications in Germany.
The audited administrations did not take these requirements into account in some cases.
In the Czech Republic, the decisions on the selection of applicants were not always comprehensible (No. 4.4).
In both countries, in the interest of equal competition, it is necessary to ensure that companies interested in submitting a bid receive the same information during the bid phase.
Contact between these companies and with freelancers who were involved in drawing up the service description must be prevented as far as possible in order to avoid anti-competitive agreements.
The corresponding regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.
However, some of the audited building administrations in Germany did not comply with these requirements (No. 4.5).
When opening up offers, the multi-eye principle and the principle of transparency must be observed in both countries.
The requirements for the labelling, documentation, custody and secrecy of the offers are intended to restrict scope for manipulation and are particularly thoroughly defined in Germany.
The tests in both countries revealed only a few complaints (No. 4.6).
Examination and evaluation of the offers are defined in both countries by specifications for the structure and process organisation.
The regulations in Germany are more comprehensive, but have not been consistently observed by the audited procurement bodies.
For example, contracting agencies handed over offers for examination to third parties without reviewing the offers beforehand and sufficiently documenting abnormalities.
As a result, the offers were insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulation (No. 4.7).
At the conclusion of the EU-wide procurement procedures, the companies involved in the competition will be informed of the intended contract prior to the award of the contract.
This legal protection option also has a preventive function against corruptive behaviour.
The Czech Republic also provides for a judicial review option for non-EU procurement procedures.
Only in a few cases did the award bodies not meet the specified deadlines when awarding orders or deviate from the content of the bidders' offer (No. 4.8).
The documentation of the award procedures was not always complete or comprehensible by the audited construction administrations in both countries.
In this respect, the EU-wide transparency requirement was not sufficiently implemented in the award notes of some procedures.
Some of the deficiencies identified also reduced the corruption-preventive function of the documentation.
The public contracting authorities of both countries largely complied with their reporting and reporting obligations (No. 4.9).
Basics of EU public procurement law and corruption prevention
EU public procurement law
In order to ensure unrestricted competition within the European Union with the free movement of services and goods, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, among other things, the Procurement Coordination Directive and the Remedies Directive, which had to be transposed into national law by the Member States 8.
The general procurement principles of the European Union are in particular the competition requirement, the equal treatment requirement or the prohibition of discrimination as well as the transparency requirement.
To enforce these objectives, the Procurement Coordination Directive contains special rules for construction work to be awarded across the EU for construction projects.
For this purpose, their estimated order sums must reach or exceed a current volume of 5,000,000 euros.
The regulations concern in particular the content of the award documents, the publication of certain information before, during and after the award, compliance with deadlines, including for receipt of tenders, the documentation of the award procedure, the requirements that can be placed on the qualifications of applicants and the Remedies Directive forms the basis for the legal protection of applicants and bidders.
In the event of possible violations of public procurement law, affected companies can have the decisions of public contracting authorities reviewed in review proceedings.
Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the directives of the European Union into national law.
Prevention of corruption
Importance of corruption prevention
In both countries there is no legal definition of the concept of corruption.
In general, corruption is the abuse of a position of trust for private benefit,
which is usually initiated by the beneficiaries of these decisions.
Corruption can hinder competition and cause significant economic damage.
It is estimated that the global cost of corruption is 5% of global economic output.
For the area of the European Union, the amount of these costs is estimated at 1%.
In the case of public contracting authorities, restrictive agreements or unfair behaviour can call into question confidence in the integrity and functioning of the administration.
Preventing corruption is therefore one of the fundamental tasks of public contracting authorities.
They have to review the organisation of their administrations in areas particularly vulnerable to corruption in order to take appropriate safeguards against corruption.
Preventive measures and effective controls can significantly reduce the vulnerability of decision-making processes to corruptive abuse.
The award of public works is generally regarded as a particularly corruption-prone area of work.
Corruption prevention measures
In Germany, corruption - in particular bribery and corruption as well as acceptance and approval of benefits - is prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
In order to prevent corruption, the Federal Government has issued a directive and recommendations on corruption12 prevention in the Federal Administration. According to this, in addition to risk analysis, the following principles must be observed for the procurement sector: priority of public tenders and open procedures, multi-eye principle and transparency, fundamental separation of planning, award and billing, accurate and complete documentation of procurement procedures.
Furthermore, further corruption-preventive requirements have been incorporated into the public procurement rules.
For example, the responsible Federal Ministry for Procurement in the area of federal highways introduced an electronically supported control system in 2011,
with the award data - such as the estimated costs and the order sums - as well as information on the freelancers involved are collected nationwide and evaluated for abnormalities.
In the Czech Republic, corruption is also prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
The statutory requirements of transparency and equal treatment of bidders, as well as the prohibition of all discrimination, form the most important foundations of the prevention of corruption.
For public procurement, the Czech government has defined anti-corruption measures in a strategy paper on the fight against corruption for the years 2011 to 2012 and updated them for the years 2013 to 2014.
Some of the measures recommended therein have already been transposed into national public procurement law and corresponding administrative regulations14.
The new legislation essentially contains the following rules: reduction of the thresholds for smaller contracts, obligation to prior notification of awards by the award authority, including mention of the grounds for tendering, prohibition of restriction of the number of bidders in non-open proceedings and thus abolition of the possibility of selecting bidders by lottery, introduction of the obligation to publish the contract documents and all annexes, introduction of the obligation to publish the actual price and the list of subcontractors.
Examination results on the individual phases of the award procedure
Award documents
Award documents The award documents must contain all the information that the bidders need for a proper bid preparation.
In particular, the award documents must enable an accurate calculation.
No risks may be transferred to the bidders that cannot be calculated for them.
The award documents consist in particular of the service description and the contract conditions.
In addition, they contain the requirements for proving the qualification (suitability) of the bidders as well as the criteria that are decisive for the selection of the most economical offer.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
The requirements of EU law for procurement documents are aimed in particular at the technical specifications.
These must be equally accessible to all bidders and should restrict competition as little as possible.
The service description must in principle be product-neutral.
Therefore, information on products or manufacturers as part of the service description is only permitted under narrow conditions.
Avoiding restrictive requirements in the procurement documents is also a fundamental principle of preventing corruption.
In addition, unclear or incorrect information in the award documents must be avoided, as they open up scope for speculation in the preparation of the offers as well as for manipulation in their evaluation.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations In both countries, the EU legal requirements on technical specifications have been transposed into national law.
The services are basically product-neutral without brand specifications to tender.
In the service descriptions, the individual services must usually be divided into performance units with respective quantities in detail.
Prices must be agreed on the basis of performance units (e.g. euros per m ² or per piece).
Only in exceptional cases may services be defined by functional targets.
The service descriptions must in any case be complete and unambiguous.
They must contain precise quantities and must not include services for which it is not clear whether they are needed.
Remuneration according to lump sums or time expenditure must be avoided as far as possible.
These provisions are intended to prevent speculation and manipulation based on indefinite requirements in the award documents.
The service descriptions must enable bidders to prepare their offers safely and without extensive preparatory work.
The invitation to tender will not be announced until the award documents have been completed.
Different regulations
There is no obligation to tender for construction work in lots in the Czech Republic.
If it is possible according to the type of service to be commissioned, the public procurement agencies can divide construction services into several lots.
In Germany, construction work is generally divided into lots, separated by quantity (partial) and / or by type or specialist area (specialist).
This is intended to enable medium-sized enterprises to participate in the competition, expand the number of possible providers and make price fixing more difficult.
This type of award is usually considered the most economical.
In the Czech Republic, evaluation criteria must be indicated in the award documents for both EU-wide and national procedures.
This should make it completely and conclusively clear to the applicants according to which criteria their offers should be evaluated.
In Germany, the indication of evaluation criteria in EU-wide announcements, but at the latest in the award documents, is only mandatory for EU-wide procurement procedures.
In the case of national procurement procedures, the evaluation criteria must only be recorded in an internal administrative award note.
Award documents prepared by commissioned freelancers may not contain any references to these offices or planners or experts involved in the building construction and some road construction administrations in Germany.
This is to prevent individual companies from obtaining additional information or other inadmissible competitive advantages through contact with these freelancers without the knowledge of the client.
This is also the reason why freelancers are not allowed to send award documents or interpret planning documents for inspection.
The contact person for the companies is the client alone.
There is currently no regulation on this in the Czech Republic.
Additional or modified services, which prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (supplements), are almost always incurred in large construction projects.
In both countries, the statutory provisions allow, to a certain extent, the award of supplements to the already commissioned company without a procurement procedure having to be carried out with public notice.
According to EU regulations and German regulations, the remuneration of supplementary benefits may not exceed half of the main contract.
In addition, the additional services must not be separated from the main order without significant disadvantages or must be absolutely necessary.
In the Czech Republic, a narrower limit of 20% applies to such awards without public announcement.
However, this may increase the risk of delayed completion of the construction project or the need to involve an additional contractor in the ongoing construction work.
If supplementary services are also transferred to the already commissioned company, an arbitrary price increase for these services by the contractor is generally not possible according to the regulations in Germany.
When determining the remuneration for the additional services, the agreed prices and the basis for determining the price of the contract already awarded must be assumed.
In addition to supplementary services, there may also be a reduction in the scope of services.
In the Czech Republic, reduced quantities cannot be offset against additional supplementary benefits.
Key audit results
BHR
Technical specifications and product-neutral tender
In individual cases, the service descriptions contained references to national technical approvals or standards that had already been replaced by Europe-wide standards.
Some service descriptions also contained product-related specifications - for example for graffiti protection, joint tapes or noise protection panels - without this being necessary.
In some cases, performance requirements were described so precisely that only one product was eligible.
Performance lists subdivided by partial services
In none of the examined proceedings has the BRH found any violations of the bid to tender services in principle in a list of services subdivided according to partial services.
Completeness of the service descriptions
In the vast majority of proceedings, the award documents were completed before the start of the tenders.
In some proceedings, the award documents had to be corrected during the offer phase, as some positions or deadlines had changed.
Occasionally, the performance lists contained positions where it was not clear whether they were needed.
A list of services for demolition work even consisted of almost half of such demand positions.
Lots and evaluation criteria
Many awards lacked the prescribed justification why the services advertised predominantly according to skilled persons were not further divided into partial lots.
There were no complaints when specifying the criteria to be used in the evaluation of the offers.
References to freelancers
A small part of the service descriptions contained references to the freelancers involved.
Their names were partly on the covers or in attached plans or expert opinions.
In one case, the registry even explicitly requested applicants to contact the architect "on questions of the tender."
Especially in the building construction sector, the contracting authorities attributed the complaints pointed out mainly to failures of the freelancers commissioned with the preparation of the service descriptions.
The construction services pointed out the lack of capacity in order to be able to sufficiently control the performance descriptions.
NKò
Technical specifications and product-neutral tender In the public procurement for the construction of a residential building with 12 residential units, a supplier and a specific product brand were specified in the service description.
The contracting authority did not allow the use of comparable products without justifying this.
During the construction of several university buildings, suppliers and products were also specified in the tender.
Performance descriptions with performance units
In the case of construction projects in some industrial areas, the contracting authority did not clearly specify the scope and type of services required in the service descriptions.
As performance units, it only specified the converted space of the individual buildings in cubic metres.
Completeness of the service descriptions
During the construction of a motorway bypass, the service descriptions were changed four times in the period August to September 2009 as part of a non-open procedure,
since the scope of services had increased significantly and the technical requirements had changed.
Tender documents for social buildings contained inaccurate location information, inadequate preliminary structural investigations and incomplete design drawings, which required additional services to be commissioned.
During the construction of a large library building, the performance description of the interior did not contain any requirements for product quality.
As a result of these missing specifications, some subcontractors installed overpriced and unreasonably high-quality equipment.
Lots and suitability criteria
In the Czech Republic, the division of construction measures into partial lots or the award of partial contracts is not mandatory.
An examination of the three large sections of the construction of a motorway ring showed that with a loose allocation of selected parts, savings of up to 31.6 million euros would have been possible with a total cost of 620.3 million euros.
For example, six different buildings alone, which were the subject of a single contract, could have saved 2.5 million euros (25%) with a loose award.
With a loose award of the construction of 20 bridges, savings of 11.5 million euros (25%) would have been possible compared to a total award.
When awarding construction services in road construction, the central contracting authority specified very extensive reference requirements as suitability criteria.
During the construction of part of a motorway, the contracting authority demanded from the bidders in an open procedure, among other things, the proof of at least three road construction projects carried out worth 28 million euros each from the last five years.
In the Czech Republic, a maximum of nine providers met these requirements.
The public award of another section of a motorway comprised six separate construction projects in which the award authority had specified an annual construction volume of at least 480 million euros in the last three years as a suitability criterion for the companies.
Two thirds of the funds raised for road construction projects in 2008 and 2009 (i.e. 2.5 billion euros out of a total of 3.7 billion euros) were commissioned by a total of five companies that carried out the contracts alone or as a working group.
In 46 award procedures with a contract volume of 528 million euros, only two or even only one bidder made an offer.
The NKò showed that a narrowing of the market potential can result in significant cost increases.
Additional services
During the construction of a motorway bypass, the contracting authority did not apply any of the statutory procedures when awarding additional services in two cases and did not conclude any written contracts for the additional services.
Due to unclear quantity and quality specifications, supplements were incurred in the first case of up to 63.7 million euros (net) and in the second case up to 165.4 million euros (net), which increased the respective order volume by 21% and 91% respectively.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
For several university buildings, some achievements were not listed in the award documents, although their necessity was already known when awarding the contract.
Although the scope of these additional benefits exceeded the limit of 20% of the original contract value laid down in national public procurement law, the contracting authority conducted negotiation proceedings with the contracted companies without award notice.
During the construction of a large courthouse, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional construction work in negotiated proceedings without a tender.
During the construction period, the award office expanded the scope of the work by 2 million euros.
The unit prices for the additional construction work awarded without competition were significantly higher than comparable services provided by the same company.
Further findings
Based on a random examination of construction projects, the NKò found that the average cost of building a four-lane motorway kilometre in the Czech Republic was up to 14.6 million euros.
In Germany, on the other hand, according to an evaluation of long-term data from the Federal Building Ministry, the average cost of a four-lane motorway kilometre is up to 10.4 million euros.
This comparison indicates that motorway construction in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.
Summary findings
The basic rules on procurement documents are largely consistent in both countries and take into account EU requirements.
They serve both comprehensive and fair competition and the prevention of corruption.
For example, the requirement for the sufficient determination of the service descriptions should enable bidders to calculate and prepare their offers properly,
protect the client from additional services to be agreed subsequently and also curb scope for speculation.
In Germany, the common basic requirements for award documents are supplemented by regulations aimed at further reducing restrictions on competition and possibilities for manipulation.
There are no requirements to this extent in the Czech Republic, but transparency is increased by publishing the evaluation criteria for non-EU procurement procedures.
The requirements for the performance description have been largely complied with in both countries.
In some cases, however, deviations had to be objected to, which may also have led to restrictions on competition.
The existing requirement for the formation of lots in Germany promotes competition and leads to economic results.
In the Czech Republic, according to the audit findings of the NKò, the award of extensive services without lots or with only very large lots may result in restrictions on the field of providers to only a few large companies.
The extensive reference requirements imposed in road construction in the Czech Republic have meant that public contracts are only awarded to a narrow circle of suppliers and that small and medium-sized enterprises are not allowed to participate in the competition.
Also, a limited number of competitors often lead to higher prices and increases the risk of price or other agreements.
The regulatory approaches in both countries differ in the award and remuneration of additional or modified benefits.
According to EU regulations and German regulations, supplementary benefits with a value of up to half of the main contract can be awarded under certain conditions without award procedures with public announcement.
In the Czech Republic, a narrower limit of 20% applies, up to which additional benefits can be awarded to the original contractor in the negotiated procedure without notice.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
This limit is often crossed,
since the scope of services for public contracts is often inadequately determined.
If the exceedance is greater than 20%, the additional benefits must be advertised with public announcement.
By dividing benefits into lots, restrictions on competition and the resulting adverse consequences can be avoided.
Defining the type of award and taking into account the EU threshold
By determining the type of award, the client determines the extent of the number of companies participating in the competition.
It can leave the circle of potential candidates and bidders largely unlimited, for example by choosing an open procedure, or by limiting non-public procurement procedures.
For construction projects where a threshold set by the EU is reached or exceeded, Europe-wide procurement procedures must be applied.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
When choosing the type of award, the public contracting authority must take into account in particular the requirements of European law on competition and transparency.
If the estimated total contract value of the construction work of a project is at or above the EU threshold of currently 5,000,000 euros, the construction work must in principle be awarded throughout Europe according to open or non-open procedures.
In exceptional cases, negotiation procedures or competitive dialogue are also possible.
For construction projects that reach or exceed the EU threshold, the public contracting authority may deviate to a limited extent from the principle of Europe-wide procurement and award construction work in national procurement procedures, provided that the estimated contract value of the respective lot is less than EUR 1,000,000 and the sum of these lots does not exceed 20% of the estimated total contract value of all construction contracts.
A uniform construction project must not be divided into individual measures without compelling reason or deliberately estimated at too low cost values in order to deprive it of the obligation to award construction services across Europe in principle.
Since restrictions on competition significantly increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of type of award is of great importance in the prevention of corruption.
The detailed justification of the chosen type of award and the examination of the obligation to apply EU procurement regulations are important components of the documentation of the award procedure.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have fully transposed EU law on procurement procedures and the threshold into national law.
Different regulations
The Czech Republic has also transferred the fundamental equality of open and non-open procedures contained in the EU Directive to its construction contracts, which are not subject to EU requirements.
There is freedom of choice between the open and the non-open proceedings without documenting or justifying the decision. Other proceedings, on the other hand, are only possible under certain legally defined conditions.
In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure or - in the case of national contracts - the public tender has priority in principle. This is laid down by budgetary and public procurement law as well as by the directives on the prevention of corruption.
Other types of award - such as the non-open procedure or the restricted invitation to tender - are only possible in exceptional cases, which are finally regulated in public procurement law.
The existence of an exceptional case must be comprehensibly justified and documented.
The principle of primacy of the open procedure or public tender is intended to ensure as unlimited competition as possible, to exclude possibilities of manipulation by fixing on certain bidders and to make possible price fixing among bidders more difficult.
The principle of public tendering is a central element of corruption prevention in Germany.
The correct estimation of the expected contract value is an essential basis for choosing the correct type of award.
The construction services in Germany can use planning and cost databases of public administrations and other organisations to determine the estimated costs in the area of public buildings.
These databases are based on evaluations of completed construction projects. The databases contain, among other things, cost indicators for building categories, usage units, components or individual construction services.
On the basis of such cost characteristics, the estimated contract value of a planned advance or a construction work to be awarded can be determined.
Only a few construction administrations in Germany have corresponding cost databases for road construction.
However, a nationwide introduction for all road construction administrations is planned.
Procurement agencies in the Czech Republic cannot rely on central databases or average price determinations of comparable construction measures to determine the estimated costs of construction work.
In most cases, the cost calculations are based on estimates of the financing body or result from the amount of funds made available to the construction service.
Measures to standardize cost calculation procedures are still in their infancy.
As part of the anti-corruption plan for 2011 - 2012, the responsible ministries were commissioned to create a database for standardised building materials and materials.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
This database is intended to collect information on material expenditure and construction and expansion trades as well as other cost-relevant data in order to enable cost calculations and determinations of unit prices.
The Czech Ministry of Transport has also published a data collection for construction projects to improve cost control,
which is intended to serve as a benchmark for price fixing in the financing plan and is currently being updated.
Key test results BRH
Choice of award procedure
The audited contracting bodies tendered the construction work largely in open proceedings or in public tenders and thus followed the budgetary and public procurement requirements.
In 2011, 59.5% of the federal construction work in building construction was tendered publicly or in open proceedings.
In road construction, this proportion was 94.8%.
The choice of non-public procurement types partly lacked detailed justifications as to why the procurement bodies had to deviate from the principle of open procedure or public tender.
In a cross-sectional investigation, the BRH found, on the basis of more than 16,000 procurement procedures, that the non-public procurement types have significant disadvantages in competition compared to open procedures and public tenders and increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.
In building construction, more than twice as many tenders were submitted to public tenders as for restricted tenders and almost three times as many tenders as for free-handed tenders.
The study also showed that offer prices for restricted tenders and hands-free tenders were on average 6% and 10% higher than for public tenders, respectively.
Parallel investigations by the Federal Building Ministry and a State Audit Office confirmed the differences in profitability between public and non-public procurement types.
As a result of its studies on profitability, the Federal Building Ministry even found twice as high differences between public and non-public procurement procedures.
Taking into account the EU threshold
For the construction projects for which they had determined an estimated total contract sum of more than 5,000,000 euros, the audited procurement bodies usually drew up award plans in which they determined the construction work to be awarded according to EU-wide and national procurement procedures.
According to the award plans, more than 80% of construction work was always to be awarded across the EU.
It was not possible to circumvent the obligation to award EU-wide contracts through too low cost estimates.
However, partly as a result of incorrect calculations, the minimum proportion of EU-wide procurement procedures actually fell below.
During the construction, some contracting bodies inadmissibly changed the definitions of their award plans.
They did not justify these changes and did not demonstrate that the minimum proportion of EU-wide procurement procedures continued to be complied with.
For most of the construction measures audited, the proportion of EU-wide contracts according to the settlement results was usually lower than envisaged under the award plan.
In some cases, for construction projects above the EU threshold, the procurement bodies breached the requirement to tender all 1,000,000 euros and more comprehensive individual lots in EU-wide procedures,
and chose national procedures instead.
NKò
Choice of type of award
In several major construction projects, such as the construction of some motorway sections, construction projects as part of a major sporting event and housing projects, the contracting authorities divided construction work into several partial contracts, although these services were similar or comparable.
Due to these divisions, the individual benefits were no longer above the threshold and were subsequently awarded in simplified procedures or even in defiance of legal requirements.
Calculation methods for the estimated order value
In road construction, the existing price databases for this area were only an insufficient instrument to determine the expected order values.
The data were based on just completed construction projects, in which, however, there were indications of a lack of profitability, unnecessary additional performance expenditure or excessive profits of the contracted companies.
For three sections of a motorway ring, actual prices were about 37% below the expected order values determined with the help of the database.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Transport revised the databases in order to take into account not only the offer prices of recent years, but also comparable market prices and price increase indices in the construction sector.
In building construction, the expected order values were based on cost values estimated by the project architects or on investor estimates.
The actual order values deviated greatly from the estimates.
The estimated price for the conversion or expansion of a large library was twice as high as the later agreed contract value, but eight supplements in the course of the construction led to a cost increase of 2.1 million euros or 27%.
Similarly, the actual contract value for the construction of a library depot was 33% lower than the estimated price, with cost increases in the construction phase.
In other cases, offer prices exceeded estimates and increased during construction.
During the construction of a large library, the estimated price was exceeded by 16 million euros or 22%. During the construction of a judicial building, the costs rose disproportionately at 139%, as the usable area had expanded by only 12%.
Summary findings
Both countries have transposed the EU rules on determining the type of award and taking into account the EU threshold into national law. Therefore, the respective regulations are largely in line.
However, the priority of the open procedure or public tender in Germany goes beyond the EU requirements and the regulations applicable in the Czech Republic.
Compared to non-public procurement procedures, more companies have the opportunity to compete in public procedures or public tenders.
Public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of bids and the most economical results.
The risk of corruption is significantly improved by not restricting the field of applicants by manipulation-prone determinations of the client and making price fixing between bidders more difficult.
The investigations have confirmed the advantage of the priority of the open procedure or the public tender in Germany.
Under Czech legislation, contracting bodies can award contracts in open or non-open proceedings.
According to the latest changes in public procurement law, the number of bidders may no longer be restricted in proceedings with previous participation competition.
Thus, the non-open procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.
In Germany, the procurement bodies have largely complied with the requirements for the priority of the open procedure or the public tender. In the Czech Republic, some services have been inadmissibly divided in order to circumvent the requirements for choosing the type of award.
When taking into account the EU threshold, errors had to be identified in Germany that resulted in falling below the minimum proportion of benefits advertised across the EU.
In the Czech Republic, there is still no satisfactory solution to accurately determine the estimated costs of construction and construction projects.
Construction administrations should, if necessary, ensure through further controls that the requirements for the choice of the type of award as well as the scope of services to be tendered throughout the EU are complied with or that the prerequisites for accurate cost determinations are created.
Preliminary information and announcement
In the case of construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe, the public client must inform interested companies about the planned awards in advance of the tender.
Preliminary information and announcements form an important basis for Europe-wide competition.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
The preliminary information should contain the essential public procurement information on the planned construction projects.
They are necessary for those construction projects where the estimated total contract value reaches or exceeds the EU threshold and where the client wants to shorten the offer periods of open or non-open procedures.
In announcements, the client must provide binding details of the planned construction contracts to be awarded throughout Europe.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Among other things, he has to make known the scope of services, the procedure and execution dates, the special requirements as well as the evaluation criteria and their weighting.
The Europe-wide standardized vocabulary of the Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV codes) must be used to describe the subject of the contract.
Preliminary information and announcements will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the procurement profile of the client.
In order to prevent discrimination against foreign interested parties, announcements at national level may not contain additional information and may only be published after the text of the announcement has been sent to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union.
Incomplete or incorrect information in the announcement may affect competition and may even support manipulation.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have fully transposed the EU legal requirements for preliminary information and notification into national law.
Different regulations
In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and announcements must also be published for construction work not to be awarded throughout Europe.
Procurement procedures may begin at the earliest one month after the preliminary information has been sent to the EU Official Journal (for EU-wide awards) or to the National Official Journal (for all awards).
Only in exceptional cases can the publication of preliminary information be waived.
In Germany, no preliminary information is required for non-EU procurement procedures.
In the case of national procurement procedures, announcements for public tenders and participation competitions before restricted tenders must be published on the Federal Internet portal and, if necessary, in newspapers or magazines.
In the case of restricted tenders without participation competition, announcements of services to be awarded from 25,000 euros are mandatory (ex-ante transparency).
All planned lots of the construction projects are to be listed in the preliminary information.
In Germany, this is of particular importance because of the small-scale nature of the loose construction contracts.
In the Czech Republic, this scheme has only a small impact, as significantly fewer construction work is divided into lots.
Key audit results
BRH
Preliminary information
The procurement agencies examined published preliminary information on all audited construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe.
In some open proceedings, however, they shortened offer periods, although the 52-day period necessary between the sending of the preliminary information and the announcements had not yet expired.
Other shortened procedures were only tendered after the twelve-month period of validity of the preliminary information had already expired and before it had been extended.
Many published preliminary information lacked evidence of the planned division of construction work into lots.
Notices
The announcements of the audited bodies partly contained CPV codes that deviated from the information provided in the preliminary information or which did not accurately record the required services.
In individual cases, announcements at national level were published earlier or contained more information - e.g. on the implementation deadlines - than the announcements in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Ex-ante transparency
The contracting bodies of an audited building administration had commissioned a service company to publish the national procurement procedures.
This published the reports on its own paid award platform.
However, the contracting authorities did not check whether the company had forwarded the notifications to the free internet portal of the federal government as prescribed.
Random samples showed that only one third of the reports from the audited administration were published on this portal.
NKò
Notices
During the construction of a sewage treatment plant, the contracting authority did not specify in its announcement the criteria on which it wanted to select the bidders.
The award authority could not prove how the bidders were selected.
The restriction of the number of bidders was permissible under the law in force at the time.
During the construction of a motorway ring, the award office did not specify in more detail in the announcement or in the documentation of the award procedure, according to which it wanted to evaluate the qualifications of the applicants and how many applicants it wanted to admit to the competition.
In its assessment, the award office came to the conclusion that all six applicants met the qualification requirements, but excluded the applicant with the worst ratings from the further procedure.
The procedure of the contracting authority was not transparent because it had not disclosed information on the qualification criteria and the evaluation procedure at any time in the procedure.
Publication of the announcements
During the renovation of the former military site, the award office did not publish the tender.
Summary findings
The two-stage teaching system with preliminary information and announcement is an important component in implementing the transparency requirement for Europe-wide contracts, strengthening competition and thus also preventing corruption.
Both countries have implemented EU requirements and increased the transparency of their procurement procedures in the national procurement sector:
Selection of applicants for non-public award types
In contrast to public procurement procedures, not every company interested in carrying out the services to be awarded can participate in the competition in non-public procurement procedures.
In the case of non-public procurement procedures, the contracting authority must make a selection in advance as to which companies should be invited to submit bids.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption EU rules allow a limit on the number of applicants for EU-wide non-public procurement procedures.
In the case of non-open proceedings, however, at least five companies must be invited to submit bids.
At least three companies must be invited to negotiate proceedings with award notice.
In any case, the number of invited applicants must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be announced beforehand.
The selection of companies to be requested is a process within the award procedure that is highly vulnerable to manipulation, for example by giving unilateral preference to certain companies.
In addition, restricting competition to a few companies also favours possible agreements between applicants.
In both cases, the award result can be significantly impaired at the expense of the client.
The procurement bodies must therefore take special precautions against possible manipulation, carry out sufficient controls and, in particular, ensure the transparency and traceability of this procedural step.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
The rules for selecting candidates are similar in both countries.
In addition to the EU requirements, the award bodies should switch as frequently as possible among the companies to be requested when selecting applicants.
Nor must competition be restricted to companies based in certain regions.
The award bodies must justify the selection of applicants and document the course of the selection process in their award notes.
Different regulations
In Germany, at least three suitable candidates are to be invited to tender for restricted tenders and several suitable candidates for free-handed tenders.
Under the new Czech rules, apart from two special areas, it is inadmissible to limit the number of bidders in non-open proceedings and negotiation procedures.
In Germany, the multi-eyes principle must be observed when selecting companies.
For example, if an employee has proposed a number of companies for a non-public procurement procedure, the management level of the construction service or a representative from the contracting authority must usually amend this proposal, for example by removing a proposed company and / or supplementing a new company.
This is to prevent a single person from finally determining the circle of companies to participate in the competition.
Otherwise, in the event of manipulative intentions, this could enable far-reaching agreements among stakeholders.
The list of companies to be requested must be treated confidentially - also vis-à-vis freelancers - and not made generally accessible.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In the Czech Republic, there are no corresponding regulations for drawing up and keeping lists of applicants secret.
According to the German regulations, freelancers are not allowed to determine the companies to be requested, but can only submit proposals to the contracting authority.
There is a regulatory gap in Czech legislation.
Key audit results
BRH
Number of applicants
The requirement to require a minimum number of companies to submit bids for non-public contracts was met, with a few exceptions.
An evaluation by the BRH of almost 7,000 non-Europe-wide award procedures for construction services in building construction revealed that the award bodies requested an average of 6.6 companies for restricted tenders by the federal government in Germany and an average of 4.4 companies for free-handed contracts.
Change of companies and regional restrictions
Especially in the case of trades with few providers, the registrations did not always change the circle of selected applicants.
Above all, they took into account companies already known to them and, from their point of view, proven.
As a reason for this, they stated that in non-public proceedings they had to ensure the suitability of the companies requesting competition even before the invitation to submit an offer.
The BRH did not find an inadmissible restriction to regional bidders in the non-public procurement procedures, but a higher proportion of regionally based companies than in public tenders.
The procurement bodies attributed this primarily to the fact that the scope of services in non-public procurement procedures was on average significantly lower and therefore, for example, longer journeys were more important than in public tenders.
More-eyes principle and suggestions Freelancer
Contrary to the regulations, the contracting bodies largely failed to have the proposed list of requested companies amended by an independent person.
They justified this in particular with a lack of processing capacities, deadline pressure or insufficient knowledge of alternative suitable companies.
It was also often not documented who had proposed the companies requested to submit bids.
Some random samples showed that freelancers had drawn up the lists of applicants and that these proposals had been adopted unchanged by the award bodies.
Thus, the contracting authorities did not protect themselves to the extent necessary from possible manipulation.
Confidential treatment of bidding lists
At a registry, the lists of the companies to be requested were recorded in a data processing system that could be viewed by all employees of this department.
In the case of manipulative intentions, the names of the intended or authorised companies could have been passed on unauthorised and, for example, enabled agreements among these companies.
Documentation
The documentation of the award procedures contained only in a few cases justifications for the selection of applicants.
NKò
Selection of applicants
During the construction of a motorway ring, the bidders received no information on the evaluation criteria and the evaluation procedures.
In the non-open procedures for the expansion and modernisation of waterways and ports, the announcements did not specify how the selection of candidates should be carried out.
In one procedure, all eight participating applicants fulfilled the qualification requirements, exceeding the specified maximum number of companies to be admitted.
The award committee then carried out a lottery procedure for the selection of companies.
However, this approach, which was generally permissible at the time, should have been cited as one of the criteria in the announcement.
Summary findings
Due to the high risk of manipulation in the selection of applicants in non-public procurement procedures, both countries have taken special precautions to prevent inadmissible restrictions on competition.
With the multi-eyes principle, the secrecy of the bidding lists and the sole authority of the contracting authorities to propose the companies to be requested, the German requirements restrict such possibilities of abuse.
In the case of Czech regulations, the newly introduced requirement of the largely unlimited number of bidders in non-public proceedings can counteract possible manipulative restrictions.
However, the audit findings have shown that some of these requirements have been inadequately implemented and that the potential for manipulation for abusive restriction of the field of participants has not been sufficiently reduced in these cases.
Public contracting authorities should completely eliminate the deficits identified.
Offer phase
With the announcement of the award or with the invitation to submit an offer, the offer phase begins, in which the companies can prepare bids on the basis of the award documents sent to them.
Applicants can submit their offers until the expiry of the offer period set by the registry.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
There are no separate EU legal requirements for this phase of the award procedure.
The procurement bodies must observe the national regulations aimed at counteracting the possibilities of manipulation that exist during the offer phase.
These are mainly organisational guidelines and controls.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
The award documents, on the basis of which the companies are to prepare their offers, must in principle only be sent by the award authority.
Freelancers involved in the award procedure are not allowed to perform this task.
The registry must ensure that all applicants receive the same information during the offer phase.
In case of ambiguities in the award documents or other questions relating to the tender, only the award office may provide information to the applicants.
Freelancers commissioned with the preparation of the award documents may not provide any information.
During the entire offer phase, contact between the commissioned freelancers and the applicants must be prevented.
Freelancers must not become a hub of the award procedure through which contacts with anti-competitive consequences can be established.
Offers submitted by post or directly must be submitted in a sealed envelope.
Electronically transmitted offers have technical encryption.
Different regulations
In Germany, the registry can also commission external service companies with the printing and dispatch of the award documents, whose employees are obliged to maintain the secrecy of the offers and to conscientiously fulfil the contractual obligations.
The offers received must be marked with an entrance stamp in Germany and forwarded immediately, immediately and unopened to an employee responsible for custody.
This employee may not be involved in the award.
The received offers must be kept under wraps until the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, the offers received are marked with a file number.
The registry records the offer data including order numbers as well as the preparation and receipt information in a protocol.
The custody of offers is not specified in the Czech Republic.
Key audit results
BRH
The audits for the offer phase concentrated primarily on the award procedures of a building administration.
Dispatch of award documents
The contracting offices of the audited building administration sent the award documents themselves or had them printed and sent by an external service company.
Freelancers did not send out any award documents.
Information to applicants
The audited building administration largely did not comply with the requirements for the separation of planning and award when appointing the contact persons for inquiries and information.
In the service descriptions, contrary to the specifications, she did not specify employees from the registration office, but from the project management as contact persons.
Some award documents even contained the names of the freelancers who had prepared the performance descriptions.
In some cases, not all applicants received the same information for inquiries during the offer phase.
Labelling of offers
At the audited building administration, all received offers were marked with entrance stamp and entrance note.
With some free-handed contracts, however, the offers were received by freelancers, which contradicted the requirements for the prevention of corruption.
Storage of offers
After their marking, not all offers were immediately and immediately sent to the employee responsible for custody, who included the offers in a steel cabinet.
In the meantime, the offers were stored in an open compartment of the post office, to which every employee had access.
Another office had hung up a mailbox in a not constantly monitored hallway, in which the offers thrown in there sometimes even remained overnight.
Since the insertion slot of this mailbox was large and unsecured, not only employees but also visitors to the office would have had the opportunity to take received offers and, if necessary, manipulate them.
NKò
No shortcomings were objected to on the Czech side.
Summary findings
During the offer phase, contacts between interested companies and freelancers involved in the procurement process are to be prevented in both countries.
By providing all bidders with the same information, the principle of equal treatment should also be respected.
The regulations on the receipt, custody and secrecy of the offers appear suitable to counteract manipulation and corruption.
The corresponding requirements in Germany are somewhat more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
The results of the investigation in Germany have revealed violations of the regulations in some areas.
These shortcomings could be eliminated with little effort.
Opening of offers
Opening of offers
During the opening date, the previously closed offers will be opened and their contents will be read out and thus made known.
From the opening date, the bidders are bound to their offers until the expiry of the award period specified by the award office.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
There are no separate EU regulations for the opening of the offers.
However, the national rules on corruption prevention contain extensive requirements for the protection of offers and competition for this highly sensitive phase of the award procedure.
The multi-eye principle as well as the transparency and traceability of the offer opening are intended to prevent manipulation and changes to the submitted offers.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
The opening date must be carried out by several persons to be determined by the registry.
The multi-eyes principle is intended to prevent individuals from uncontrollably manipulating the offers when opening the offers.
In most award procedures, bidders can participate in the opening date.
Only offers submitted to the chief negotiator when the first offer was opened are admitted to the opening.
In principle, offers received late may no longer be taken into account.
In order to ensure the transparency of the opening date, the actions taken and the results of the opening of the offer must be recorded in a protocol recording, among other things, the names of the bidders and the offer prices.
The Minutes must be read out and signed by the chairman of the negotiations.
It can also be signed by the bidders present.
Different regulations
In the Czech Republic, a committee carries out the opening of offers.
Freelancers can also participate.
The Committee may also be entrusted with further phases of the award procedure, such as the evaluation of the bids.
In Germany, a negotiator and a secretary carry out the opening of the offer.
The chief negotiator must be an employee of the tendering body.
The head of negotiation and in the case of awards in building construction also the secretary should not be involved in the processing of the award documents as well as in the award and execution of the contract.
According to the German regulations, in addition to the offer prices, information on discounts and discounts as well as special features - such as damaged or late received offers - must be recorded in the minutes of the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, in addition to the offer price, only the language of the offer and the applicant's signature authority are recorded.
The German regulations stipulate that the open offers must be marked in all parts in such a way that subsequent changes and additions are prevented.
The offers are usually marked by perforations with the date of the opening date. They must be kept secret after the opening date and may only be made accessible to persons directly commissioned with the processing.
There are no corresponding Czech regulations.
If only one offer is received in a procurement procedure in the Czech Republic, it may not be opened and must be returned unvalued.
There is no such regulation in Germany. If only one offer is received here, it must be opened and then evaluated.
Key audit results
BRH
More-eyes principle
The audited award bodies implemented the specifications for the multi-eye principle at the opening dates.
They conducted the opening dates with negotiators and secretaries who were not charged with any other award procedures.
In the case of free-handed contracts with a lower scope of services, however, there were occasional cases in which freelancers opened offers sent to them without the participation of the registry.
Minutes
In the minutes of the opening dates, the opening of the offers was not always fully documented.
In some cases, for example, the late submitted offers were not registered, in individual cases even signatures were missing.
Labelling of offers
The award bodies examined in the context of the cross-sectional inspection marked the offers in accordance with the specifications by a perforation with the date of the opening date.
In recent audits of some grant recipients, inadequate labelling had been found.
However, these contracting bodies changed their labelling practice after the complaint by the BRH.
NKò
Offer period
When awarding road maintenance measures, an offer was received by the registry only one month after the expiry of the offer period. Nevertheless, the registry accepted this offer.
Summary findings
The regulations of both countries on the opening of offers coincide in significant parts. They take into account both the multi-eye principle and the principle of transparency. This can significantly limit the risks of corruption and manipulation in the opening of offers.
The requirements in Germany are more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
In particular, the requirements for the exact documentation of the procedure as well as for the labelling, secure custody and secrecy of the offers significantly restrict manipulation possibilities such as subsequent changes to the offers.
In addition, those commissioned with the opening of the offers may not perform any other tasks in connection with the service to be awarded.
The altogether only a few complaints prove the high acceptance of the specifications for the opening of offers.
Examination and evaluation of the offers
Examination and evaluation of the offers The client must examine and evaluate the offers available at the opening date.
It must determine the offer for the award of the contract, which best meets the requirements according to the specified award criteria.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
The EU's guidelines provide for a multi-stage procedure:
First of all, the suitability of the bidders must be determined.
Bidders must be economically and financially efficient and have the necessary professional and technical expertise.
Companies that are legally convicted of bribery or fraud offences, for example, must be excluded from participation in the award procedure.
The offers of the non-excluded bidders must be checked mathematically, technically and economically and evaluated on the basis of the previously announced award criteria.
The client has to determine the most economically favourable offer. The client has to examine offers with unusually low prices in particular.
The examination and evaluation of the tenders is a particularly manipulation-prone phase of the award procedure.
For example, bidders can be unjustifiably excluded or offers that do not meet the requirements can be left in competition.
By preferring or disadvantaging bidders, the valuation result can be inadmissibly impaired and thus the determination of the most economically favourable offer can be prevented.
The registry must therefore take special precautions to ensure that the persons charged with the examination and evaluation meet the requirements for integrity and expertise.
It must also ensure the transparency and traceability of the procedure and the decisions taken.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
In accordance with EU requirements, the offers in both countries must be examined and evaluated in multi-stage procedures.
The requirements for the companies' proof of suitability to be submitted as well as the award criteria to be taken into account in the evaluation and their weighting are laid down in the announcements or in the award documents and can no longer be changed during the proceedings.
After checking the bidding suitability, the suitability criteria may no longer be used in the evaluation of the offers.
The classification must be limited to the award criteria.
The submitted offers must first be formally checked immediately to determine whether they are complete and whether they contain, for example, abnormalities that could indicate possible intentions to manipulate.
If bidders are excluded from further examination and evaluation of their offers, they must be informed immediately.
If the valuation of the offers results in an unreasonably low price, the bidder must be given the opportunity to comment before a possible exclusion of his offer.
The decisions made during the examination and evaluation of the offers must be documented in a comprehensible manner.
Different regulations
In Germany, the offers to be kept secret may only be made accessible to persons directly commissioned with the processing.
Only the registry may carry out the review of the offers as well as the mathematical examination of the offers.
It must only appoint employees who are not involved in the award decision or the implementation of the measure.
The exercise of further examination and evaluation tasks is not specified.
If freelancers are commissioned with the examination and evaluation, they must treat the offers confidentially.
They may only make proposals for the decisions to be taken by the contracting bodies.
In the Czech Republic, award committees must be formed to examine and evaluate the bids.
The committees prepare evaluation reports with award proposals.
Ultimately - as in Germany - only the procurement bodies have to decide on the award of contracts.
If evidence or declarations requested for tender are only incompletely submitted in Germany, the contracting authority must give the bidders the opportunity to submit the missing documents within six days.
Only if the documents are still not available after the deadline, the offer must be excluded from the evaluation.
In the Czech Republic, it is at the discretion of the contracting authority whether it gives bidders the opportunity to complete missing evidence or declarations.
If a bidder fails to do so, he must be excluded.
In Germany, in addition to the total price, the unit prices (prices for partial services) of the offers must also be examined.
If, due to the price structure of the offer, there are indications of too low or too high prices for partial services, the bidder must be requested to dispel these ambiguities.
If he does not succeed in this and the registry can provide proof of a mixed calculation of the prices, this offer must be excluded.
This is to prevent bidders from speculating on significant volume changes in partial services when calculating their offer, whereby significant cost increases in the construction projects can be achieved.
In the Czech Republic, the total price is evaluated, but not the adequacy of the prices for partial services.
A mixed calculation cannot justify the exclusion of an offer.
A surcharge may not be awarded in Germany for offers with unreasonably high or low prices.
If one or more offers fall below the correct price determination of the client or the offer sums of the other bidders by 10% or more, the bidders must prove the proper calculation of their offers.
If this is not possible for them, the registry may exclude the offers in question.
In the Czech Republic, the tender may be cancelled after the profitability assessment if only offers with unjustifiable at low prices are available.
In contrast to German public procurement law, the contract cannot be refused for offers with prices significantly higher than the client's calculation for this reason.
If there is a suspicion of restrictive behaviour in Germany, the contracting authority must immediately report to its leading level of specialist supervision.
It has to decide which measures to take and whether the antitrust authority or the public prosecutor's office should be informed.
The leading level of specialist supervision must, for example, also agree to construction work over 50,000 euros if a surcharge is to be awarded freehand, a surcharge is not to be awarded to the offer with the lowest price or the tender is to be cancelled.
There are no such regulations in the Czech Republic.
Key audit results
BRH
Suitability and evaluation criteria
The vast majority of audited procurement procedures met the requirements listed.
For some companies proposed by freelancers, the contracting bodies did not check the suitability of the companies themselves.
A grant recipient commissioned companies without the required proof of suitability being fully available.
In some proceedings, it was not understandable whether the award authority took into account all the announced award criteria in its selection decision or whether it had merely based its award decision on the criterion "price."
Selection of persons involved and secrecy of offers
Some contracting bodies used unauthorised persons to examine the offers.
For example, freelancers or employees of the department involved in the planning or execution of a construction project carried out tasks that could only be performed by employees of the registry.
The construction services justified this with insufficient personnel capacities in the respective areas.
In some cases, the freelancers commissioned to examine the offers also involved employees who were not obliged to maintain the secrecy of the offers and to conscientiously fulfil the contractual obligations.
For the construction services, it was usually not understandable whether the offers of the freelancers were only accessible to the persons directly commissioned with the processing.
Review and mathematical examination of the offers
Some registrations handed over the open offers to freelancers for further examination, without having previously carried out the prescribed review of the offers and the mathematical examination themselves and documented their results.
In the case of manipulative intentions, third parties could have made changes to the offers without this being understandable for the contracting authorities.
In the audited documents, abnormalities or missing price or product information were partly not or only insufficiently marked.
Performance audits
In a random sample in a building administration, the cheapest offers for three quarters of the audited award procedures deviated more than 10% from the previously determined estimated costs.
Every twentieth award procedure was lifted due to unreasonable offer prices.
Not all offer checks and clarification discussions with the bidders were comprehensible or sufficiently documented.
In many cases, more detailed information was lacking, such as the unit prices of the most important positions.
Often the deviations were only generally justified, e.g. by indications of changed market prices or increased material costs.
The construction services explained that the detection and proof of mixed calculations was difficult.
In the case of a tender by an institution under public law, the offer price of the cheapest offer was 66% below the previously determined estimated value of these services.
Further calculation checks or investigations into the causes of this deviation were not documented.
In a clarification interview, the award office found no evidence of price dumping of the then commissioned company.
Thus, it remained unclear whether the estimated value was excessive or the offer price was too low.
Later, the client evaluated the commissioned company as a "cheap company" that could keep neither quality nor deadlines.
In another tender, a construction service awarded the contract for an offer whose price was 35% higher than the value of the cost calculation.
She did not cancel the tender and cited the extraneous justification that an adequate calculation could be inferred from this company.
Suspicion of irregularities
In an audited building administration, there were two cases of irregularities, both of which were reported to the specialist supervisory level.
In one of the cases, the calculation of two bidders was identical in a tender, so that the award authority excluded both bids from the procedure.
When applying the other regulations, the audits did not reveal any significant complaints.
NKò
Aptitude test
In many of the audited construction projects, including university construction, road construction and the expansion of the railway network, the contracting authorities did not exclude bidders from the procedure, although they did not meet the requirements stated in the tender documents or could not prove their suitability to the prescribed extent. On the other hand, in one case, a contracting authority could neither prove nor explain why it had excluded a bidder who had fulfilled the requirements.
Scoring
When awarding construction services for a water treatment plant, the award authority did not take into account the specified evaluation criteria when examining and evaluating the offers.
In a construction project for the expansion of the railway network, the award authority determined the weighting of the evaluation criteria only at the beginning of the evaluation.
In the case of road maintenance measures, the specified criterion "shortening the construction phase" was misjudged in a procedure.
As a result, the offered shortening was insufficiently taken into account by the bidders in second and third positions.
Documentation of the offer selection
In three award procedures within the framework of the housing promotion, the award authority did not document which criteria it had applied and on what basis it had selected the successful bidder.
During the construction of a motorway, the registry selected the companies for smaller orders up to 20,000 euros solely on the basis of telephone surveys on prices and delivery conditions.
Examinations of this selection were not possible because the surveys were not documented.
Summary findings
The regulations for the examination and evaluation of bids in both countries comply with EU requirements.
However, for details of the procedure and the selection of the persons involved, the respective regulations differ from each other.
In Germany, the procedure is more strongly regulated by detailed requirements, in particular for the implementation of the multi-eyes principle and for the protection of offers, than in the Czech Republic.
The same applies to the specifications on the basis of which the adequacy of the prices offered must be checked.
In both countries, some of the audited procurement procedures found that essential procedural steps in the examination and evaluation of the bids were not or only insufficiently documented.
Without traceability and transparency of the audit and evaluation decisions, however, possible manipulative interventions are favoured.
A particularly serious defect was the handover of all offers to third parties without the public contracting authority having sufficiently reviewed and documented the offers beforehand, thereby protecting them from possible manipulation in further proceedings.
If public contracting authorities have tasks carried out in the examination and evaluation of the offers by third parties, sufficient precautions and an increased control effort are required to counter the increased risk of manipulation.
When checking the adequacy of prices, the audited services in Germany did not always make full use of the specified instruments and insufficiently examined the price structure of the offers.
In the Czech Republic, complaints arose mainly in the aptitude test and in the application of the evaluation criteria.
Conclusion of the award procedure
After examining and evaluating the bids, the award procedure will be concluded by awarding the contract or by cancelling the proceedings.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
In the case of EU-wide procurement procedures, all bidders must be informed in advance of the planned award decision.
Companies have the option of checking the intended award for information by electronic means or by fax within 10 days or for other means of communication within 15 days and, if necessary, to initiate a review procedure.
A contract may not be concluded before this information period expires.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
If a bidder submits a request for review within the information period, the conclusion of a contract is only possible after the final decision in the review procedure.
Companies can also have the award decision reviewed by an independent court as part of this review procedure.
The review procedure is intended to ensure the legal protection of companies and to encourage the client to comply with public procurement law throughout the award procedure.
For this purpose, he must sufficiently document the procedure.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have implemented EU rules on information and verification procedures.
In both countries, the award authority has to decide on the award of the contract.
However, it must not arbitrarily deviate from the result of a proper examination and evaluation of the offers.
The client shall award the contract within the announced award period,
also because the bidders are no longer bound by their offers after the deadline.
In the case of open and non-open proceedings or public and limited tenders, the client may in principle not deviate from the content of the offer when concluding the contract.
The losing bidders must be informed promptly about the award decision and the reasons for not taking their offers into account.
Procurement procedures may only be lifted under certain conditions, e.g. if the offer prices are excessive or the offers do not meet the requirements of the tender.
Different regulations
In the Czech Republic, there is also a 10 or 15-day obligation to provide information and waiting before awarding a contract for construction services not to be awarded throughout Europe.
In Germany, these requirements only apply to the area of EU-wide procurement.
In the case of other proceedings in Germany, bidders can only be informed of the award decision after the award has been awarded.
In the Czech Republic, a procurement procedure must be lifted if only one offer has been received or only one offer could be evaluated.
In Germany, the contract must also be awarded in the case of only one valuable offer, provided that it complies with the conditions of the tender and is economical.
Key audit results
BRH
In the case of the audited awards, there were only a few complaints at the conclusion of the award procedures.
In some cases, companies received letters of order for EU-wide contracts before the expiry of the information deadlines, which may result in the ineffectiveness of the contract.
Letters of order according to open proceedings also contained content deviating from the content of the offer in individual cases, such as changed dates.
In several cases, the clients did not comply with the award deadlines.
In an open procedure, a contracting authority therefore awarded the contract for the second cheapest offer, as a company with a 50% cheaper offer was no longer prepared to carry out the services at the originally offered price after the award period expired.
NKò
In the case of a construction project in the university sector, the contracting authority deviated from the bidder's offer in terms of content.
In some contracts, for example in the construction of road maintenance, in the construction of a motorway and a bypass, the contracting authorities concluded the contracts after the expiry of the statutory deadline.
When awarding construction work for the rehabilitation of former military premises, the award authority forwarded the notification of the award of the contract to all bidders only after the expiry of the statutory deadline.
Summary findings
Both countries have implemented the EU's guidelines for the conclusion of the award procedure.
The legal protection of losing candidates or bidders increases the tools for preventing corruption.
The scope of legal protection in Czech public procurement law is also extended to contracts below the EU thresholds.
In both countries, the deadlines for awarding contracts were exceeded.
This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of manipulation.
Construction administrations should avoid the shortcomings identified in the completion of their procurement procedures in future.
Documentation, reporting and reporting obligations
The award procedures must be documented in a comprehensible manner during their individual stages with regard to the relevant findings and the justifications of the individual decisions.
In EU-wide procedures, the contracts awarded must be made known.
The order data are also recorded in EU statistics.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption The documentation of procurement procedures implements a fundamental requirement of the EU-wide transparency requirement.
A carefully and promptly prepared documentation only enables the traceability of the award decisions.
In particular, it also serves the effective legal protection of bidders when awarding contracts above the EU thresholds.
Proper documentation is also an essential part of avoiding corruption, as the compulsion to justify award decisions in detail significantly restricts scope for manipulation.
The notice of a contract awarded in an EU-wide procurement procedure must be submitted by the respective procurement authority to the EU Official Publications Office within 48 days.
The Office publishes the announcements in the Official Journal of the EU and thus also implements the transparency requirement.
The procurement bodies must also collect the essential data of their procurement procedures and report them to the competent national ministries of the EU Commission.
On this basis, the EU Commission produces annual EU statistics through which it can obtain an overview of the development of the internal market in construction services.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have fully transposed EU documentation and reporting requirements into national law.
The rules on documentation and reporting for EU statistics are largely the same in both countries.
Different regulations
In the Czech Republic, the publication obligation for contracts awarded is not limited to EU-wide contracts, but also extends to other procurement procedures.
The notice period is shortened to 15 days.
In Germany, in addition to EU-wide awards, there is a publication obligation only for restricted tenders and for free-handed awards from value limits of 25,000 euros or 15,000 euros without VAT (so-called ex-post transparency).
Below these value limits and in the case of public tenders, only the companies involved in the competition procedure receive information on the award of contracts.
Key audit results
BRH
Documentation
A large number of the audited award procedures were not fully documented.
The award notes did not contain all the necessary information, such as the justification of product specifications or references to national regulations.
In a procurement procedure, the award authority did not justify why it awarded the contract to a company, although its offer did not contain mandatory evidence.
In a few cases, the documents of the award bodies did not contain all the evidence required for the documentation of the award procedure.
Announcements about order awards
In some EU-wide procurement procedures, procurement bodies failed to make the award of contracts known.
Further award procedures lacked evidence that the award bodies had announced the contracts awarded.
Reporting and reporting obligations
The statistical statements viewed contained the required minimum information. They had been prepared and sent on schedule.
Ex-post transparency
In most cases, the audited construction administrations published the contract data of the completed procurement procedures.
However, a building administration did not publish this data due to a transmission error.
The building administration only noticed this error after half a year,
so that the contract data of the award procedures completed so far have not been published.
NKò
Documentation
In the case of construction measures for the organisation of a major sporting event, the documentation of the award procedures showed considerable deficiencies, mainly incorrect information, such as incorrect offer prices in the minutes of the evaluation commissions.
In addition, some minutes of the offer openings were not signed.
Announcements about order awards
In several road construction projects, announcements about awarded contracts were only published late or not at all.
Summary findings
The regulations on documentation and reporting and reporting obligations are largely consistent in both countries and implement EU requirements.
In principle, this ensures the transparency of procurement procedures, including the award of contracts.
The regulations to be applied for publication in the Czech Republic go slightly further than the requirements in Germany.
The deficiencies in documentation and announcements identified significantly restricted the corruption-preventive effect of these instruments in the respective procurement procedures.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Construction administrations should further improve the transparency of their procurement procedures and contract awards and fully comply with their reporting and reporting obligations.
Summary evaluation and recommendations
The parallel audits of the NKò and the BRH have focused on two priorities that are essential in the Czech Republic and Germany for the award of construction services by public contracting authorities: the application of EU procurement rules and the prevention of corruption.
EU law enables cross-border competition to create a European internal market.
Corruption prevention measures not only serve to avoid or at least reduce corruption, but also to avert economic damage and a possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the state.
The audit findings of the two Court of Auditors on the application of public procurement regulations in both countries and the comparison of these regulations provide information on similarities and differences that can be helpful for both countries in the further development of their public procurement law and its application.
Application of EU procurement rules
Both countries have transposed the EU's requirements for the award of construction services into national law.
This gives the Czech Republic and Germany an important common basis for awarding construction services and taking into account the essential requirements of competition, equal treatment of the companies involved and the transparency of procurement procedures.
The construction administrations of both countries have partly supported these bids very extensively by further administrative regulations.
The Czech Republic has largely transferred the requirements for construction work to be awarded across the EU to its nationally regulated procurement procedures below the EU threshold.
However, the investigations by the Court of Auditors have shown that the construction administrations have not fully complied with the requirements of EU law in all areas.
The building administration in Germany should further improve the quality of its procurement procedures in order to be able to eliminate the complaints identified when implementing the EU requirements.
The audits in the Czech Republic have mainly highlighted risks that affect the profitability of the contracts.
For example, incomplete service descriptions made additional services necessary, which were often awarded in violation of legislation. Moreover, the cost calculations were usually inadequately prepared. Excessive qualification requirements also reduced the number of possible bidders and restricted competition, especially in the case of transport buildings.
Prevention of corruption
The investigations did not aim to uncover cases of corruption,
also because the Court of Auditors do not have the appropriate instruments for this.
However, the Court of Auditors can examine the extent to which the administrations of both countries have taken precautions against corruption and manipulation in the award of construction services and how these requirements are applied.
Both countries have set different priorities when it comes to preventing corruption.
Above all, the German regulations provide for largely unlimited competition as well as transparency and controls as central elements of the prevention of corruption.
The Czech regulations are primarily aimed at increasing the transparency of procedures.
BRH
In Germany, general principles of corruption prevention apply, which the entire federal administration has to apply.
These principles are also implemented in the specifications for the award of construction services and are geared towards their special requirements.
In some cases, the relevant regulations specify very precisely how the requirements for the prevention of corruption must be taken into account in the course of the procurement procedures and in the selection of the persons involved.
In the opinion of the BRH, in particular, the primacy of the principle of open procedure or public tender is a suitable instrument for significantly reducing the risk of corruption in the award of construction services. Restrictions on competition, on the other hand, increase the risk of manipulative intervention.
Risk analyses and sufficient controls (especially the multi-eyes principle), the requirements for transparency and documentation of procurement procedures as well as various organisational measures are also effective precautions to prevent corruption and manipulation.
The BRH therefore sees no fundamental need to change the corresponding requirements of the administrations in the award of construction services.
The rules on the prevention of corruption are largely taken into account in practice.
The shortcomings identified in some areas have highlighted shortcomings in the implementation of some benchmarks.
Construction administrations should further train their employees on the requirements for corruption prevention and raise their awareness of this problem even more.
A substantial part of the complaints related to tasks that the building administrations had delegated to freelancers.
Without controls and sufficient safeguards, however, the risk of abuse increases when delegating tasks.
Tasks at risk of manipulation and corruption should therefore only be transferred to third parties if the administration can ensure a sufficient level of protection against inadmissible interventions.
NKò
The Czech Republic adopted a strategy against corruption at government level, in which the area of public procurement is the most important component.
The Procurement Act and the associated implementing provisions have been substantially amended.
The audits of the NKò took place during the implementation of this strategy.
The adopted strategy and the new legal provisions should be effective improvement measures, as the procurement bodies must justify the profitability of the contract awards, the calculation of the expected prices, the adequacy of the qualification requirements, the essential evaluation criteria and the nature of the evaluations, and properly document and publish all these aspects.
Recommendations
The NKò and the BRH generally assess the implementation of the EU guidelines positively.
The widespread acceptance in practice has confirmed that the EU imperatives of competition, equal treatment and transparency are an appropriate basis for the award of construction services within the European Union.
The supranational model implemented in the European Union can also serve as a basis for similar projects aimed at enabling and promoting cross-border competition.
In view of the enormous material and ideological damage potential caused by manipulation and corruption in the award of construction services, both courts of auditors see the construction administrations in their countries demanded to continue their measures against corruption and manipulation and, if necessary, to improve them.
In particular, the organisation and procedures of the procurement procedures should be continuously examined for weaknesses and risks in order to identify the need for action and to take appropriate countermeasures.
The comparison of procurement practices in both countries suggests that the proportion of open proceedings in the Czech Republic should be increased, as open procedures can provide a broader area for competition and significantly reduce the risk of corruption.
A stronger division of construction services into lots can also have a favourable impact on offer prices, provided that it achieves greater competition with a higher number of bidders.
Ensuring the correct implementation of procurement procedures is an essential basis for the efficient procurement of public contracting authorities.
In Germany, the procurement procedures are carried out by the specialised construction administrations. In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, these tasks - with the exception of transport construction projects - are carried out by the departments themselves or contractors commissioned by them.
The Court of Auditors of both countries intend, even after the completion of their joint project, to further develop the findings that are important to them and, if necessary, to bring them to the parliament and government of their country.
Both Court of Auditors are also convinced that the principles of public procurement law set out in this report and its implementation are also of interest at international level to the International Organization of Supreme Audit Authorities (INTOSAI), because the principles and findings set out are of general importance in order to effectively counter corruption and to ensure the economic procurement of construction services in a well-functioning and fair competition.
Annexes
Administration of VAT in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany
Report on the audit
Preface
Taxes are the main source of income for public budgets.
One focus of the activities of the Court of Auditors should therefore be on examining this area.
This applies in particular to VAT fraud.
This alone creates annual tax losses of an estimated 100 billion euros1 in the European Union.
Already at the VI. EUROSAI Congress 2005 in Bonn, the participants pointed out the need for enhanced cooperation.
This enables the Court of Auditors, for example, to exchange audit approaches and optimise audit practice.
VAT (VAT) is particularly suitable for cooperation as it is harmonised within the European Union.
In 2006, the Court of Auditors of both countries audited for the first time in parallel in the area of VAT.
The corresponding audit report was published in 2008.
Since VAT fraud is a widespread phenomenon in the European Union, close cooperation between the Court of Auditors is needed, enabling a comprehensive assessment of whether the measures taken are suitable for effectively countering VAT fraud.
The two Court of Auditors decided to continue their cooperation and carried out a second parallel audit. Administration of VAT in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany Report on the audit
1. Induction
Examination number: (CZ) 09 / 11 (D) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892
Subject of audit: (CZ) Administration of VAT (D) Bilateral audit with the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic (hereinafter NKò), audit
Examination objective:
(CZ) The VAT administration and the treatment of selected transactions between entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic (hereinafter CZ) and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter Germany) should be examined. Furthermore, the procedures applied by the tax authorities in intergovernmental assistance should be examined.
(D) The audit was intended to evaluate how the financial administration has implemented the recommendations made by the Court of Auditors.
In addition, further examination fields - linked to the VAT - should be processed.
The findings made should be compared to determine whether taxation procedures can be optimised.
The examination period was the years 2006 to 2008, including relevant information from the period before the examination period until the conclusion of the examination.
2. Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel examination
The Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have agreed on a control audit for the administration of the VAT.
In the previous parallel audit, they had uncovered suspected cases involving intra-Community turnover,
which made a repeated examination appear appropriate.
Based on the audit findings, the two courts of auditors made recommendations on the administration of the VAT.
The aim of the review was to evaluate how these recommendations were implemented and to investigate the suspected cases identified.
The audit also dealt with other issues, including selected cases of high-risk intra-Community turnover, mutual administrative assistance in the recovery of VAT claims and the VAT audit of large enterprises.
The Court of Auditors found:
1. Recommendations made on the basis of the previous examination
• Recommendation 1: Regulations for the registration of taxpayers should be harmonised within the EU
During the first audit, the Court of Auditors compared the registration procedures for VAT in the two states and found differences that caused problems.
The Court of Auditors therefore recommended harmonising the registration of taxpayers within the EU.
This has also been taken up at EU level.
The draft amendment to Council Regulation No 1798 / 2003 provides for the extension of the current databases in the EU, including a database with the identification number of VAT obligations.
The draft also provided for common rules for the registration of taxpayers and their possible deletion.
The Court of Auditors expected Member States, in accordance with their decision in principle, to agree on appropriate arrangements to remove unreliable entrepreneurs from the VAT system as early as possible.
Member States reached political agreement on the final version of the draft in ECOFIN.
The aforementioned common rules are no longer included, and the two Court of Auditors regret that.
They still consider such regulations to be important in order to prevent VAT fraud.
• Recommendation 2: Monthly submission of summary notifications As a result of the first audit, the Court of Auditors recommended to Member States that summary notifications (CMs) should be submitted monthly in future.
The amounts of intra-Community turnover could then be reviewed more promptly.
Council Directive 2008 / 117 / EC amending Directive 2006 / 112 / EC on the common VAT system for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-Community transactions has reduced the deadline for surrendering the ZM to one month.
In the CZ, this requirement was implemented by an amendment to the VAT Act, which came into force on 1 January 2010.
In Germany, the implementation did not enter into force until 1 July 2010. It has thus not transposed the obligation to submit the ZM monthly into national law on time.
• Recommendation 3: Data comparison of VAT pre-registrations and the ZM in Germany for more reliable MIAS data and proposal to examine the merging of the procedures for VAT pre-registrations and ZM The German financial administration has taken up the recommendation made by the Federal Court of Auditors and set up a working group to develop possible solutions.
The work has not yet been completed.
The Federal Court of Auditors will monitor further developments.
• Recommendation 4: Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level In the course of the initial audit, the two Court of Auditors agreed that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by one Member State alone.
Successful criteria as well as elements or approaches of a risk management system must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State.
If this does not happen, fraudsters will focus on the Member State with the weakest risk management system.
The Court of Auditors found that the two Member States apply different risk management systems with both strengths and weaknesses.
The NKU examined the system of information exchange within the EU - EUROCANET, while the Federal Court of Auditors focused on German participation in the "Platform for Risk Management."
2. Control audit of selected intra-Community transactions
During the first audit, the Court of Auditors had jointly examined turnover in which it was doubtful whether they had actually been executed or which had been declared differently by the taxpayers of the two states in the VAT pre-registrations (or VAT declarations) or ZM.
The Court of Auditors selected nine cases of intra-Community deliveries of goods between the CZ and Germany for the audit.
The audits by the tax offices (FÄ) of both states had not yet been completed at the conclusion of the first parallel audit.
The audit revealed that the tax procedures for these selected sales have now been completed. The respective financial administrations had taken appropriate measures to this end (including subsequent VAT fixes or the prevention of pre-tax refunds).
3. Examination of selected, particularly risky intra-Community turnover
The audit also included highly risky intra-Community transactions between taxpayers in the EU covered by the EUROCANET system.
EUROCANET serves to identify risky taxpayers.
Member States can participate in this system on a voluntary basis.
The CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET. Germany has a passive status, i.e. it does not participate in the data exchange within the framework of EUROCANET.
From the point of view of an active participating state, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to participate actively.
As a result, no information could be obtained about which suppliers with German VAT ID would have been classified as highly risky cases.
The NKU found both normal business transactions and those with suspicion of VAT fraud, including carousel fraud, in the selected sales.
The FÄ were only able to examine high-risk sales to a limited extent. This applied in particular to so-called "missing traders," whereby an examination of the documents alone is hardly sufficient to prove fraud to the taxpayer.
In case of suspected carousel fraud in imports and exports
It is recommended that customs and tax authorities work more closely together to track the identity of goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final customer.
Germany and a number of other countries have rejected active participation in EUROCANET because, from their point of view, there is no sufficient legal basis.
The Federal Court of Auditors found that the German financial administration uses other instruments to identify risky taxpayers.
Nevertheless, there is a need for communication and exchange of experience between all EU Member States.
The Council of the EU agreed on a draft regulation:
was created by EUROFISC.
The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should be incorporated into the planned network to combat VAT fraud.
4.Mutual administrative assistance in the recovery of claims
Intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims is subject to the same European legislation in all Member States.
Therefore, requests for intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in the CZ and Germany are processed in the same way.
The Federal Court of Auditors and the NKU compared the statistics that both Member States submitted to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.
These statistics contained discrepancies.
The two Court of Auditors consider a renewed discussion on statistics at EU level to be useful in order to avoid any discrepancies that still exist in the future.
If this does not happen, the statistics cannot be used adequately for comparisons.
In addition, the statistics should contain more information on VAT.
An analysis of detailed data can make it easier for the Commission to support Member States in their efforts to combat VAT fraud.
Both Court of Auditors believe that Member States with a low recovery rate should strive to achieve at least the average recovery rate.
The Commission should assist Member States in this if desired.
5. VAT testing for large enterprises
The Court of Auditors analysed the legal situation regarding the VAT audit of large enterprises in both countries.
In addition, they used a questionnaire to collect information from the financial administrations that they considered important in this context.
It became clear that the situation in both countries is different.
The CZ has a system for selecting risky cases that incorporates a large amount of relevant data (including information on VAT audits, balance sheet data and profit and loss statements).
Overall, VAT control can be effectively controlled and analysed.
A special tax office for large enterprises is to be set up in 2012.
There is no comparable system in Germany yet. This makes it difficult to control and analyse VAT control as a whole.
The German financial administration focuses more on the selection of relevant individual cases and relies in particular on data from the VAT pre-registrations or VAT declarations and the ZM.
Various risk management components, which are to be improved, support the evaluation of this data.
3. Examination procedure
3.1 Examination proceedings in the Czech Republic
Department II - State Budget Revenue and Regional Departments IX Pilsen, X České Budějovice, XIII Brno and XV Ostrava audited between May 2009 and February 2010.
Audited bodies were the Czech Ministry of Finance and 25 FÄ: Tax Office (FA) Brno II, FA Brno III, FA Brno IV, FA in Břeclav, FA in Domažlice, FA in Hodonín, FA in Hradec Králové, FA in Cheb, FA in Jablonec nad Nisou, FA in Karlovy Vary, FA in Kralupy nad Vltavou, FA in Kraslice, FA Ostrava I, FA Ostrava III, FA in Písek, FA in Pilsen, FA Prague 1, FA Prague 4, FA Prague 8, FA in Rakovník, FA
The Senate of the Czech Court of Auditors approved the audit findings on 27 April 2010.
3.2 Examination proceedings in Germany
The examination area traffic taxes and employees of the assigned PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt / Main and Munich examined from February 2009 to February 2010.
After selecting the example cases, they announced the examination in several countries:
• Bavaria, • Hamburg, • Hesse, • North Rhine-Westphalia, • Saxony. They also conducted interviews at the Federal Ministry of Finance (Federal Ministry of Finance).
Tax files from the following FÄ were included in the audit: • Erlangen, Zentralfinanzamt München, Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Grafenau; • Hamburg-Nord, Hamburg-Hansa, Sonderfinanzamt Hamburg for large companies; • Wiesbaden I, Wiesbaden II, Darmstadt; • Essen-NordOst, FA Essen for tax audits at large companies and corporations, Lüdenscheid; • Chemnitz-Süd.
In addition, talks were held with the FÄ Mühlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-Süd and the OFD Frankfurt / Main, Chemnitz and Münster.
The Federal Court of Auditors informed the Federal Ministry of Finance of the audit results in April 2010.
3.3 Cooperation between the two Court of Auditors
Prior to the parallel audit, the representatives of both Court of Auditors met in September 2008 to discuss and define the audit topics.
In December 2008, the Presidents of both Court of Auditors signed the agreement on cooperation in the parallel audit.
At a meeting in June 2009 in Bonn, the examination teams briefed on the initial results obtained during the exam preparation, discussed possible examination approaches and agreed on how to proceed.
A second meeting took place in Prague from 2 to 4 December 2009.
The audit teams exchanged the audit findings obtained so far and agreed on the schedule for the preparation of the joint audit report.
The two Court of Auditors identified the following topics for their parallel audit: • Evaluation of the recommendations made in the previous report; • Review of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between taxpayers from the CZ and Germany, which could not be fully clarified during the first parallel audit; • Review of selected intra-Community transactions classified as risky between taxpayers from the CZ and Germany; • Examination of the procedures of the two tax administrations regarding intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of VAT claims; • VAT audits at large companies.
The report on the results of the parallel audit was prepared during a working meeting in June 2010.

4.1 Implementation of the recommendations from the first joint examination
4.1.1 Implementation of recommendations in the Czech Republic
Recommendation 1
Harmonisation of the conditions for the registration of taxpayers within the EU Supported
on the results of the first audit, the Czech Court of Auditors has recommended adjusting the requirements for VAT registration and introducing new rules for the cancellation of registration in the CZ.
These amended rules should more effectively reduce the risk of possible tax evasion.
In certain cases, it was found that the FÄ did not delete the VAT registration of taxpayers if they did not comply with their obligations under Czech Law No. 235 / 2004 (hereinafter referred to as the "VAT Act").
So far, the Czech Ministry of Finance has not submitted an amendment to oblige the FÄ to cancel if taxpayers repeatedly do not submit VAT declarations.
According to the Czech VAT Act, the FA may ex officio delete the registration of a taxpayer if a) the taxpayer has not made any turnover for twelve consecutive months and has not informed the FA of the reasons for this; b) the taxpayer has not fulfilled his obligations under the VAT Act; c) the taxpayer no longer meets the requirements for the tax liability.
The first audit revealed that due to the existing legal situation, FA Prague 1 must delete the VAT registration of "foreign taxpayers" 3 with effect from 31 January of the following calendar year if they were not obliged to register and pay VAT in the current calendar year.
The FA Prague 1 often did not delete the VAT registration of these taxpayers because the relevant provision of the deadline could not be adequately implemented in practice.
The problem was solved by the amendment of the VAT Act, which came into force on 1 January 2009.
Accordingly, the FA is authorised to delete the registration of a foreign taxpayer if he has not provided taxable or tax-exempt deliveries of goods or services entitled to input tax deduction in the previous calendar year.
Recommendation 2
Monthly levy of the ZM
Based on the initial audit, the Court of Auditors had recommended that the monthly levy of ZM be introduced.
The Council Directive, which shortened the cycle for the surrender of the ZM to one month, was implemented in the CZ by the VAT Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.
The ZM must now be delivered electronically.
In addition, a ZM must be surrendered if services whose place of performance is to be determined in accordance with § 9 (1) VAT Act are provided for a person registered as subject to VAT in another Member State.
The prerequisite is that the recipient is obliged to declare and pay the VAT for these services. This obligation arises from Council Directive 2008 / 8 / EC amending Directive 2006 / 112 / EC regarding the place of service.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of the data of the VAT pre-registrations and the ZM to increase the reliability of the MIAS data This recommendation related to the German financial administration.
In its ATIS4 system, the Czech financial administration automatically compares the data on intra-Community turnover from the VAT declarations and the ZM.
Recommendation 4
Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level
The proper collection of VAT is an indispensable prerequisite for the smooth functioning of the EU Single Market.
That is why the fight against VAT fraud is of primary interest and has received considerable attention in recent years.
The importance of this is demonstrated, among other things, by a study published by the European Commission in October 2009.
In it, an external expert estimated the VAT loss incurred for the 25 Member States between 2000 and 2006. After evaluating the available data, the tax loss for the aforementioned period was estimated at 90 to 113 billion euros, based on the fact that the EU-25 lose an average of 12% of their VAT each year.
The estimated tax loss for the CZ in 2006 was 18%.
The first audit found that a Member State alone cannot develop an effective risk management system (RMS).
Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each Member State.
In relation to the RMS, the Czech Court of Auditors has examined the system for the exchange of information within the EU (EUROCANET).
For this purpose, risky intra-Community transactions exported by taxpayers within the EU and recorded in EUROCANET were selected (see Chapter 4.3).
The EUROFISC network aims to optimise mutual assistance in tax matters and to combat VAT fraud more effectively. Cooperation between the competent authorities is to be improved in order to detect fraud as early as possible.
Later, EUROFISC could be used as a tool to estimate the risk potential of intra-Community sales.
The ECOFIN Council 6 already approved EUROFISC on 7 October 2008 and at the same time adopted the principles for the functioning of the system.
EUROCANET, developed by the Belgian Financial Administration in cooperation with the other Member States and with the support of the European Commission and OLAF7, serves as a model for EUROFISC.
The purpose of the system is to detect risky sales and identify entrepreneurs involved in organised VAT fraud.
4.1.2 Implementation of recommendations in Germany
The assessment of the recommendations from the first report led to the following findings:
Recommendation 1
Harmonisation of the conditions for the registration of taxpayers within the EU
The German financial administration has developed a well-functioning system for the registration of taxpayers on the basis of a detailed questionnaire.
The Federal Ministry of Finance presented this system to the Commission in October 2007.
The system itself is constantly being improved.
The data provided in the questionnaire is now recorded electronically and will later be available for investigation. They are therefore part of the risk management during registration.
The Commission had made a proposal 8 amending Regulation 1798 / 2003, which provided, among other things, for common standards for the registration and deletion of taxpayers.
The Member States still needed clarification and clarification.
The Federal Court of Auditors had recommended to the Federal Ministry of Finance not to fall short of the standards already achieved.
Recommendation 2
Monthly levy of the ZM
On 8 April 2010, a law 9 transposing EU directives into national law was adopted.
It contains, among other things, provisions on the monthly levy of the ZM for intra-Community deliveries
and enters into force on 1 July 2010.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of the data of the VAT pre-registrations and the ZM for more reliable MIAS data and considerations for merging the previously separate procedures for submitting the VAT pre-registrations and the ZM
A joint federal-state working group has been set up,
which has developed a concept for the automatic comparison of data from the VAT pre-registrations and the ZM.
The concept is still being discussed with the countries.
This working group has also dealt with a concept for optimising the control procedure for intra-Community turnover.
Recommendation 4
Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level Relevant information is exchanged at EU level.
Germany participates in the risk management platform.
The European Commission supported the initiative and initiated the establishment of a risk management platform within the Fiscalis 2006-2007 Action Plan in the written procedure of 18 October 2006.
The members of the platform dealt with the following topics in 4 subgroups: • Risk management tools, • Influencing the behaviour of taxpayers, • Evaluation, • Updating the Risk Management Guide.
New reports from the subgroups "Risk Management Instruments" and "Update of the Risk Management Guide" were published in early 2010.
4.1.3 Evaluation
Registration
The question of the conditions for VAT registration and its deletion in various countries has been dealt with at EU level.
The draft amended Council Regulation 1798 / 2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT and repealing Regulation (EEC) 218 / 92 provides for the extension of current databases within the EU, including a database of VAT identification numbers.
This proposal also contains common standards for the registration and deletion of taxpayers.
The issues of registration and deletion are reserved for the time being for the national legislation of the EU Member States.
The Member States still needed clarification and clarification.
The Federal Court of Auditors had recommended to the Federal Ministry of Finance not to fall short of the standards already achieved.
The Member States reached political agreement on the last version of the draft in ECOFIN on 8 June 2010.
It no longer contains common rules for the registration and deletion of taxpayers.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The two Court of Auditors regret this, and they still consider such regulations to be important in order to prevent VAT fraud.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Monthly levy of the ZM
With regard to international cooperation, as a result of the previous audit, it was recommended that all Member States introduce the monthly levy of the ZM in order to allow an earlier audit of the amounts of intra-Community turnover.
Council Directive 2008 / 117 / EC amending Directive 2006 / 112 / EC on the common VAT system for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-Community transactions has shortened the cycle for the surrender of the corresponding ZM to one month.
In the CZ, this requirement was implemented by the amendment to the VAT Act, which came into force on 1 January 2010.
Germany did not implement the obligation to pay the monthly ZM levy until 1 July 2010 and thus not on time, while the CZ complied with the requirements of the EU.
Comparison of the data of the VAT pre-registrations and the ZM for more reliable MIAS data and considerations for merging the previously separate procedures for submitting the VAT pre-registrations or the ZM
The German financial administration has taken up the recommendations of the Federal Court of Auditors and set up a working group to develop possible solutions.
The Federal Court of Auditors will monitor further developments.
Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level
Germany and the CZ use different approaches to identify risky entrepreneurs.
The Czech Court of Auditors examined the application of the EUROCANET system in CZ (see section 4.3).
The Federal Court of Auditors focused on German participation in the risk management platform.
4.2 Control audit of selected intra-Community transactions
The first audit jointly examined transactions where there were doubts as to whether they had actually been executed or whether inconsistencies had been identified in the notifications of taxpayers in both Member States.
For the audit, the two Court of Auditors selected nine cases of intra-Community deliveries of goods between the CZ and Germany in which the tax audit by the FÄ of the Member State concerned had not yet been completed at the time of the previous joint audit.
1)
In the first quarter of 2005, a Czech taxpayer acquired goods worth 22 686 euros from a German taxpayer.
The Czech taxpayer did not declare the acquisition in his VAT declaration, whereas the German tax liability period did not have a VAT identification number, but only a tax number for domestic German sales.
Through international administrative assistance in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the competent Czech FA had received information that, according to German VAT law, the supplier of intra-Community goods does not require a VAT identification number in order to be able to claim the tax exemption for intra-Community deliveries of goods.
The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors revealed that - according to the audit of the competent Czech FA - the Czech taxpayer filed an additional VAT declaration declaring the purchase of goods of the above value and at the same time asserting his right to deduct input tax of the same amount.
2)
A Czech taxpayer is said to have purchased goods worth 12,561 euros from a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004.
However, he stated that he had not acquired the goods and therefore did not declare them in his VAT declaration.
The German financial administration, citing a provision of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, refused to process the request because the turnover associated with the acquisition did not exceed the threshold of EUR 15 000.
Since the Czech FA could not obtain any documents, the tax audit remained inconclusive and the original tax fixing was in place.
The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors revealed that the Czech FA received two spontaneous information from Germany in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, according to which the German taxpayer had invoiced the delivery of goods in question to a Slovak addressee.
The Czech taxpayer acquired the goods from the Slovak taxpayer and stated the acquisition in his regular VAT declaration for the month of October 2004.
3)
A Czech taxpayer is said to have purchased a car worth 48,500 euros from a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004.
However, he did not declare an intra-community acquisition.
In addition, he had not issued a VAT declaration since August 2004. Therefore, the FA set the VAT for the quarter in question at 0 CZK.
Based on information transmitted from Germany in the course of the international exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the FA requested the taxpayer to submit a subsequent tax return in March 2007, but the taxpayer failed to do so.
The inspection found that the FA had carried out further audit actions in this tax case in 2007, finding that the car in question had been sold by the taxpayer to a used car dealer in the CZ.
The Czech FA carried out an assessment for the December 2004 taxation period, imposing additional taxes of CZK 295 379 on the purchase and resale of goods from another Member State.
The competent Czech court decided to open insolvency proceedings over the assets of the Czech taxpayer; an insolvency administrator was appointed.
In the absence of significant assets, the outstanding tax liability is likely to be irrecoverable.
4)
A Czech taxpayer is said to have delivered new vehicles (passenger cars) with a total value of 198 167 euros to Germany in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005.
In response to a request for information under Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, it was stated that tax criminal proceedings were pending against the German taxpayer in Germany.
The audit of the Federal Court of Auditors revealed that after the conclusion of the proceedings there was evidence of the German taxpayer's involvement in fraud.
The intra-Community acquisition of goods was subject to acquisition taxation in the amount of EUR 182 424 (for 2004) and EUR 369 690 (for 2005).
The audit of the Czech Court of Auditors revealed that the Czech taxpayer was involved in carousel fraud involving new vehicles.
On the basis of information from the German financial administration, a VAT audit of the Czech taxpayer took place for the taxation periods of April, May and June 2005.
Based on the audit findings and information from the international exchange of information, the FA set an additional VAT of CZK 703 031 for May 2005 and CZK 726 551 for June 2005.
5)
The Czech taxpayer A is said to have purchased a machine with a total value of 58,000 euros from a German taxpayer in February 2005.
The German taxpayer is said to have delivered a machine worth 88,027 euros to the Czech taxpayer B in the third quarter of 2004. However, B denied the acquisition.
The audit of the Czech Court of Auditors revealed that B had acquired the machine from a German company with a branch in the CZ.
The Czech taxpayer A did not indicate the purchase of the goods from the aforementioned German taxpayer in his VAT declaration.
The German FA's response to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 revealed that the German taxpayer had not made an intra-Community delivery of a machine worth 58 000 euros, but a delivery within the CZ.
In the audit, the Federal Court of Auditors found that the intra-Community delivery of the machine was classified as a domestic delivery after completion of an audit and the VAT exemption was subsequently refused.
6)
A German taxpayer is said to have delivered goods worth 11 600 euros to a Czech taxpayer in the third quarter of 2004.
The goods were acquired and later sold in Germany, i.e. in 2005.
The audit of the Czech Court of Auditors revealed that the Czech FA had made its assessment on the basis of a supplementary VAT declaration, which inadmissibly reported acquisitions from another Member State, including acquisitions in the above amount.
The Federal Court of Auditors found that after receiving a reply to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the German FA corrected the VAT declaration of the German taxpayer and set an additional VAT of EUR 1 600.
Because of the resale of the goods in Germany and the corresponding VAT assessment there, an audit is ongoing.
The ZM of the German taxpayer has not yet been corrected, since in Germany only the taxpayer who has surrendered the ZM can correct it.
7)
The competent Czech FA received a request for information from the German financial administration in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 on the question of the acquisition of a car worth EUR 47 400 by a Czech taxpayer in February 2005.
After an audit for the taxation period 2005, the Czech FA set the tax liability of the Czech taxpayer at 0 CZK and informed the German FA that it could not confirm the acquisition of the car by the Czech taxpayer.
The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors revealed that the registration of the Czech VAT obligation had been deleted because he had not fulfilled his tax obligations.
The Czech FA had forwarded the documents to the Czech police.
The German taxpayer has not yet corrected his information in the ZM, but has appealed against the tax assessment.
8)
According to MIAS10, between the third quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, a German taxpayer delivered goods with a total value of EUR 33 205 to a Czech taxpayer, which he did not declare as an intra-Community acquisition.
The audit of the Czech Court of Auditors found that the Czech FA investigated the reasons for the discrepancies.
The Czech taxpayer repeatedly issued subsequent VAT declarations for the first quarter of 2005.
Nevertheless, the Czech FA was unable to clarify the difference in the amount of acquisitions amounting to CZK 134 273 in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005. It justified this on the grounds that sales could not be accurately allocated for individual quarters and accepted the VAT declarations issued.
9)
In the third quarter of 2004, a German taxpayer delivered goods worth 46 854 euros to a Czech taxpayer.
For the same period, the Czech taxpayer declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only EUR 14 856.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the Czech FA reviewed the actual value of the delivery.
With the German response to this request, three invoices were sent showing a total value of the delivered goods of EUR 31 998, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech taxpayer and the MIAS data.
According to the result of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors, following repeated warnings from the FA, the Czech taxpayer filed a subsequent VAT declaration for the July 2004 taxation period in January 2007.
With this declaration, the taxpayer simultaneously asserted his right to deduct input tax. His tax liability for the relevant taxation period therefore remained unchanged.
The audit confirmed that most of the tax procedures on the turnover selected for the audit had been completed and that the financial administrations in the CZ and Germany had taken appropriate measures (including subsequent VAT fixing or prevention of input tax refunds).
4.3 Examination of selected cases of risky intra-Community turnover
4.3.1 Findings in the Czech Republic
EUROCANET can be an important source of information to identify risky taxpayers in the Member State of acquisition.
In the CZ, the early warning information obtained from EUROCANET is checked by the responsible FA with the acquirers.
Since the first quarter of 2008, CZ has included information on sales and taxable suppliers considered risky in the EUROCANET system.
Nine Czech taxpayers were selected for the audit,
which had been entered into EUROCANET by the financial administrations of other Member States either as suppliers or acquirers.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Since the German financial administration did not participate in the data exchange via EUROCANET, it could not be determined whether suppliers with a German VAT identification number were classified as risky by the German financial administration.
The audit identified both normal business transactions and those suspected of carousel fraud or other VAT fraud.
In the cases concerned, the FÄ exchanged information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003,
e.g.:
• When checking the early warning information, the FÄ found no suspicion of risky sales.
The taxpayers concerned were constantly monitored because their data was stored in EUROCANET.
• During the reviews of risky turnover, the FÄ failed to prove violations of the rules on the calculation of the tax base and the VAT on the basis of the accounting documents submitted, even though they found inconsistencies in the transport and storage of the goods or revealed business relationships with letterbox companies from other Member States.
• The review of individual transactions was complicated because certain taxpayers did not cooperate with the FÄ and could not be contacted.
The responsible FÄ reviewed most of the risky taxpayers and turnover mentioned in early warning reports from EUROCANET.
However, their possibilities for checking risky sales, especially so-called "missing traders," are limited.
In particular, a mere examination of the documents can hardly provide evidence of fraudulent action by the taxpayer.
Stricter requirements for the registration of taxpayers for VAT purposes and greater flexibility in deleting registrations would be helpful to combat VAT fraud.
Taxpayers involved in fraudulent carousel transactions can be registered for VAT purposes in order to fake fictitious deliveries of goods across the EU or to issue formally correct tax documents to other taxpayers, with which they then assert unjustified claims for input tax deduction.
In the event of suspected carousel fraud in connection with imports and exports, it is recommended that customs and tax authorities work more closely together to track the identity of goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final customer.
Member States can participate in EUROCANET on a voluntary basis.
The fact that three major Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not participate was regarded by the European Parliament at the end of 200811 as a weakness of the system, which should be remedied by setting up a EUROFISC network with compulsory participation.
4.3.2 Findings in Germany
The Federal Court of Auditors evaluated data available to the Federal Central Tax Office, including data from EUROCANET.
They served as the basis for the selection of six German taxpayers whose files were reviewed.
Both Germany and a number of other countries refused to participate actively in EUROCANET.
That is why Germany has a passive status, i.e. it does not send data to Brussels itself, but is only a recipient of EUROCANET data.
This is justified by the fact that "from the point of view of the Federal Government
no unambiguous legal basis [exists] that would allow the existing tax secrecy in Germany to be broken.
In addition, the Federal Government has no reliable information on how information sent by the Member States is processed within the framework of EUROCANET. "12 Since October 2007, the Federal Central Tax Office has been evaluating the EUROCANET data and transmitting it to the federal and state tax authorities on the basis of a coordinated procedure.
The German FÄ receive control notifications about the direct business relationships of the taxpayers registered with them with companies from other EU countries recorded in EUROCANET.
However, the respective German FA does not receive any information as to whether the company from the aforementioned other EU Member State has business relationships with a company based in another Member State, which is also in business relationship with the German company from the control notice.
4.3.3 Evaluation
The CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has only a passive status.
From the point of view of an active participant, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to participate actively.
Accordingly, the examination in this area had to be carried out differently.
However, there were no significant differences in the success of detecting VAT fraud, due to the fact that EUROCANET is only one component of the risk management system.
However, the financial administrations of both countries have a variety of other tools at their disposal to detect fraudulent transactions. Nevertheless, it is necessary to develop a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.
The Council of the European Union agreed on a draft regulation13 creating EUROFISC, a network to combat VAT fraud.
The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should be exchanged by Member States at European level and incorporated into this network.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The cases brought to court at national and European level show that there is a need for discussion between the Member States and the Commission on the conditions for the tax exemption of intra-Community transactions.
4.4 Mutual support in the recovery of claims
4.4.1 Intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic
Legislation on intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of certain claims in the EU is essentially based on
Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to measures forming part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as skimming and customs duties;
Council Directive 2001 / 44 / EC amending Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to measures forming part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as skimming and customs duties and VAT and certain excise duties, and
Commission Directive 2002 / 94 / EC laying down detailed implementing provisions for certain articles of Directive 76 / 308 / EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to certain levies, customs duties, taxes and other measures.
The CZ implemented Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC by Act No. 252 / 2000 on intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of certain claims.
Following the adoption of Council Directive 2001 / 44 / EC, it also had to be transposed into Czech law. At the same time, an amendment to the aforementioned law was necessary.
In this context, Amendment No. 191 / 2004 on intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of certain claims was adopted.
A new relevant legislation was adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1179 / 2008 of 28 November 2008.
The annexes to this Regulation contain new application forms to be used from 1 January 2009. Furthermore, the Regulation makes electronic transmission compulsory and obliges the requesting authority to certify the conformity of all documents sent with the respective original.
Key principles of international mutual assistance for the recovery of claims are:
1. The principle of reciprocity applies;
2. Administrative assistance must always be provided only upon request and upon fulfilment of all conditions;
3. Mutual assistance does not extend to claims that are considered a criminal sanction in the requested State;
4. The procedure of intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of claims must be carried out in accordance with the national law of the requested State;
5. In the recovery procedure, foreign claims do not take precedence over domestic claims;
6. Mutual assistance is provided only for the recovery of undisputed claims;
7. The principle of exhaustion applies: the requesting state must use all means entitled to it under national law to recover the claim.
Law No. 191 / 2004 provides for three forms of administrative assistance: the provision of information, the notification of legal acts and the actual recovery.
Procedure for outgoing requests to other EU member states
The competent FA must transmit the request for information, the request for notification of legal acts or the request for recovery together with the relevant documents electronically via the respective Finance Directorate to the Ministry of Finance of the CZ.
The Ministry of Finance of the CZ arranges the translation of the request into the language concerned, scans it with all attachments and sends it via the communication network or the common interface CCN / CSI to the competent tax authority of the state concerned.
A request for recovery assistance must meet the following requirements: the claim must exceed EUR 1 500 and must not be older than five years.
The requested authority may refuse recovery if the requirements are not met.
Procedure for incoming requests from other Member States
The receipt of requests from other Member States must be confirmed by the Ministry of Finance of the CZ as soon as possible, within seven days at the latest.
If it decides not to grant the request, it must inform the requesting authority of the reasons for the refusal, specifying the specific provisions of the directive on which it is based.
The corresponding communication must be sent no later than three months after the date of receipt of the confirmation of receipt of the request.
Upon receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance will examine whether the request meets all legal requirements.
Thereafter, it shall submit the request to the competent FA via the financial directorate concerned. If the request for recovery is granted, the FA must, among other things, determine the financial circumstances of the debtor, e.g. by means of excerpts from the land register, inquiry about existing bank accounts and registration of motor vehicles with the registration office.
After six months from the date of receipt of the confirmation of receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ shall inform the requesting authority of the outcome of the investigation.
The requesting authority must also be informed if the taxpayers concerned are not available and the claim cannot therefore be recovered.
All successfully recovered sums must be transferred to the requesting authority within one month of collection.
The Czech FA dealing with the recovery may, with the consent of the requesting state, agree on the claim hours or payment in installments.
The interest or default surcharges imposed on the debtor for the default period in accordance with Act No. 337 / 1992 concerning the administration of taxes and fees
belong to the requesting state.
Particularly in 2006 and 2007, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ delayed forwarding the requests for recovery to the responsible FA.
The same applied to the forwarding of the requests for recovery submitted by the Czech FÄ to the competent authority in the requested state.
The audit revealed that the Ministry of Finance had breached the Act on Intergovernmental Assistance for the Recovery of Claims. It had failed to inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State of the state of play of the recovery procedure within six months of confirmation of receipt of the request.
The situation has improved since 2008.
Statistical data
In accordance with § 13 (4) of Law 191 / 2004, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ compiles statistics for the European Commission by 15 March of each year. This contains the number of requests for information, notification of legal acts and recovery received in the previous year, including the amount of the respective claims.
Based on the data transmitted by the Member States, the European Commission prepares its report to the Council and the European Parliament on the application of the provisions on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims.
The audit revealed that in 2008 the Ministry of Finance of the CZ stated the claims by 5 250 000 euros too low. The reason was the incorrect indication of the amount of a VAT claim submitted in 2008 (caused by the postponement of a decimal point in the conversion of the claim from Czech crowns to euros).
The error was subsequently reflected in the statistics of the European Commission.
Information on mutual recovery assistance is shown in the table below.
4.4.2 Intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in Germany
The legal basis for intergovernmental assistance in tax matters is the Community standards Directive 2008 / 55 / EC of the Council of 26 May 2008 (EC Recovery Directive) 14 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1178 / 2008 of 28 November 2008 (EC Implementing Directive).
In order to improve readability and clarity, the EC Recovery Directive codified Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC of 15 March 197616, the provisions of which had been substantially amended on several occasions.
It regulates, among other things, the collection of VAT and taxes on income and assets, including the associated interest, fees and default surcharges.
The EC Recovery Directive was transposed into German law by the Recovery Act (EC) 17 of 3 May 2003.
The enforcement procedure in Germany is regulated in the Tax Code (AO).
§ 117 (2) AO stipulates that the tax authorities may provide intergovernmental legal and administrative assistance by virtue of international treaties and legal norms of the European Communities applicable in national law as well as by virtue of the EC Mutual Assistance Act.
Part Six of the AO (§ § 249-346) contains the legislation for enforcement proceedings.
The administrative actions of the tax authorities regulate in particular the enforcement and enforcement instructions.
The Federal Ministry of Finance agreed with the representatives of the Supreme Tax Authorities of the Länder on the principles of administrative assistance in tax matters and transferred its own responsibility in this area to the Federal Central Office for Taxes18.
General conditions for the admissibility of a request for recovery assistance are:
• The legal requirements must be fulfilled (§ § 251, 254 AO).
• All domestic recovery funds have been exhausted.
• The claims for which mutual assistance is requested are indisputable.
• The period between the issuance of the enforcement title or the date on which the claim or title became incontestable and the date of the request may not exceed five years.
• The claim must be at least 1 500 euros.
Procedure for outgoing requests to other EU member states The German requests for the recovery of arrears taxes are forwarded by the enforcement bodies of the FÄ via the competent middle authority and the Federal Central Tax Office of the foreign authority concerned, e.g. the Czech CLO.
The details are regulated in the Leaflet on Intergovernmental Administrative Assistance in Tax Collection (Recovery) of 19 January 200419.
This leaflet is currently being revised by a federal-state working group and adapted to the new recovery directive.
In addition to annexes, the request will be forwarded electronically by the FA to the middle authority.
The latter checks whether it is correct in terms of content and formality.
If not, the request will be returned to the FA concerned.
Otherwise, it will be forwarded to the Federal Central Tax Office.
The Federal Central Tax Office then takes over the necessary communication with the foreign authority concerned.
Procedure for incoming requests from other EU Member States
Requests for recovery from other Member States are recorded in the Federal Central Tax Office, which sends a confirmation of receipt within ten days.
It also checks whether the formal requirements are fulfilled.
In principle, the Federal Central Tax Office forwards these requests to the middle authority, which forwards them to the FA concerned and monitors the execution.
The Federal Central Tax Office also sends interim and final reports.
If the processing of a request takes longer than six months, it reminds the Central Authority of the obligation to submit an interim report under Article 16 of Commission Directive 2002 / 94 / EC.
After examining the formal and factual conditions for the admissibility of the request, the enforcement bodies announce relevant measures.
All collected amounts must be transferred to the bank account indicated in the request within one month of receipt.
Statistical data
Information on mutual recovery assistance between Germany and the CZ for the years 2006 to 2008 (as of 31 December 2008).
4.4.3 Examination of selected recovery cases
A total of 21 intergovernmental recovery requests between the CZ and Germany were selected for the examination. Ten cases are listed below, including:
The following was found:
1.
On 20 October 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German request for recovery of VAT debts of a Czech taxpayer from 2004 and 2005 totalling EUR 3 883 (CZK 109 820).
It was not until 26 February 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the responsible FA.
In order to secure the claim to be recovered, the Czech FA charged a property belonging to the taxpayer with a land lien.
Since the burdened property was not sufficient to settle the entire tax liability, an installment payment agreement of at least CZK 2 000 per month was reached with the debtor.
On 31 August 2009, an interim report was forwarded to the German FA. Accordingly, the taxpayer had in the meantime settled tax debts of CZK 49 600 (as of 25 August 2009).
The amount was transferred to Germany. Shortly afterwards, on 28 August 2009, another 3,000 CZK were transferred.
2.
On 7 January 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for recovery of tax debts (VAT, income tax) as well as interest and fees of a Czech taxpayer totalling 180 869 euros (= 4 434 915 CZK).
It was not until 27 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the responsible FA.
After reviewing bank deposits, securities, real estate, motor vehicles and other movable assets, the FA found that the debtor did not have attachable assets.
Investigations on the ground also revealed that the debtor had been absent from his permanent residence for almost a year.
His whereabouts in the CZ were unknown.
This announcement was received by the Czech Ministry of Finance on 6 April 2009 and forwarded to the German Financial Administration on 16 April 2009.
3.
On 21 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for VAT along with interest and fees totalling 3 139 euros (= 84 846 CZK).
It was not until 6 August 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the responsible FA. On 18 February 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance was informed from Germany that the Czech tax debtor had meanwhile settled the debt.
On 9 December 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance informed the Czech FA that the case had been closed because the Czech tax debtor had fully settled his debt in Germany.
However, the debt was also settled in the CZ as part of the recovery procedure and the corresponding amount was transferred to Germany on 27 October 2008.
Because of the long time it took the Czech Ministry of Finance to pass on the information to the FA, the tax liability was paid twice - by the taxpayer himself in Germany and by means of collection by the responsible Czech FA.
In cooperation with the Federal Court of Auditors, it was determined that the amount recovered will be offset against the tax liability from another procedure, which amounts to EUR 6 649 and should be transferred to the CZ in September 2008.
In the documents of the Czech Ministry of Finance, there was only a request for recovery of EUR 3 139 for the company concerned. The request for recovery of EUR 6 649 was not to be found there.
4.
On 15 September 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for income tax, VAT, interest and fees totalling 39 957 euros = 956 654 CZK.
It was not until 19 December 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the responsible FA.
The recovery procedure was initiated on 1 June 2009 and a decision was taken to attach the Czech bank balance and the debtor's salary (CZK 7 000).
During the negotiations with the FA, the debtor disagreed with the amount of the tax liability and the amount was disputed.
According to the Czech FA, the debtor had been willing to pay 250 euros a month in the past, but the responsible German FA did not agree with this.
The taxpayer agreed to discuss his matter with the German FA in order to agree on another amount.
The recovery procedure had not yet been completed at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.
5.
On 19 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German request for recovery for income tax in 2005 and VAT for the years 2003 to 2007 along with interest and fees totalling 113 444 euros = 3 116 304 CZK.
It was not until 14 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to FA Prague 1, which is authorised to handle tax cases of taxpayers not resident in the CZ; on the basis of the available address, a local FA could not be determined.
During its investigation, the FA received information and documents on 19 September 2008, according to which the debtor's income amounted to 4 704 euros. However, it could not issue an enforcement order because the request for recovery had been received after that date.
On 26 January 2009, the Czech FA initiated the recovery procedure and issued an enforcement order attaching the debtor's assets to credit institutions.
The recovery procedure had not yet been completed at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.
6.
On 3 October 2006, the competent Czech FA requested intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of a VAT debt and procedural costs totalling CZK 146 223 742.
It was not until 13 May 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the German financial administration.
On 8 September 2008, the responsible German FA transferred the amount of 17 700 euros = 439 226 CZK to the Czech authorities via the Bundesbank.
A conversion error was discovered when checking the recovered amounts.
The amount to be recovered of 146 223 742 CZK was converted at the exchange rate of 1 euro = 25.065 CZK, but a comma error resulted in an amount of 583 378 euros.
The correct amount to be recovered amounted to EUR 5 833 782.
As a result, a request for recovery was too low by EUR 5 250 404.
7.
On 1 March 2007, the competent Czech FA requested recovery because of a VAT debt along with interest and fees of a Czech taxpayer totalling 1 970 632 CZK = 79 847 euros.
It was not until 10 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the German financial administration.
The German FA requested the debtor to pay the arrears on 4 February 2009.
Taking into account the substantial reduction in the company's turnover in the second half of 2008 and in particular in the first half of 2009 as well as the corresponding liquidity situation, the following payments were made to settle the overdue tax liability. On 8 April 2009 - 4 600 euros, on 6 May 2009 -3 000 euros and on 16 June 2009 - 2 500 euros.
These payments were transferred to the account of the responsible FA in the Czech Republic.
On 23 June 2009, a further payment of 2,500 euros was agreed between the debtor and the FA until 30 June 2009.
8.
On 22 May 2008, the competent Czech FA requested the recovery of tax debts totalling 398 653 euros = 9 832 779 CZK, including real estate transfer tax.
It was not until 2 October 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the German financial administration.
In a letter from the German Finance Administration to the Czech Ministry of Finance dated 3 April 2009, the request was returned.
The German financial administration justified this on the grounds that the real estate transfer tax was not a tax within the meaning of Article 2 e), f), g) and h) of Directive 2008 / 55 / EC.
In addition, Article 2 g) concerns liabilities arising from taxes on income and assets.
Accordingly, Article 3 of Directive 2008 / 55 / EC applies to taxes on income and assets not mentioned in Articles 1, paragraphs 3 and 4 of Directive 77 / 799 / EEC.
The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed to send a new request for recovery to the German financial administration, which should no longer include the real estate transfer tax arrears of CZK 61 759, but the arrears in VAT, corporation and income tax.
The Czech Ministry of Finance received a new request from the competent FA for the recovery of tax debts of the same taxpayer in the amount of CZK 7 079 735.
9.
On 6 February 2006, the responsible Czech FA submitted a request for recovery of income tax and VAT totalling CZK 3 445 782 = EUR 123 328 to the Czech Ministry of Finance.
The VAT debt was 1 133 967 CZK.
It was not until 18 April 2007 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the German financial administration
and only on 11 November 2008 the Czech Ministry of Finance sent the Czech FA the response of the German Financial Administration of 9 July 2007,
according to which the German FA had issued an enforcement order for the attachment of the bank account on 11 June 2007. The bank announced that it was not in business relationship with the aforementioned taxpayer.
Thus, the request for the German financial administration was considered settled.
10.
On 26 September 2005, the competent Czech FA submitted a request for recovery of VAT debt totalling CZK 1 296 845 = EUR 43 591 to the Czech Ministry of Finance.
The responsible Finance Directorate submitted the request to the Ministry of Finance on 10 October 2005.
The Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request to the German financial administration on 15 December 2005.
Before submitting the request, the Czech FA executed the tax claim by attaching the accounts to banks and salary attachment as well as by charging a property.
Before the request for recovery, a request for information was sent to the German financial administration on 16 March 2005.
According to a letter of reply dated 16 September 2005 to the Czech FA, the Czech taxpayer had his residence in Germany and had income from non-self-employed activities in the amount of 8 437 euros. On 20 April 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a reply to the request for recovery and only forwarded this to the responsible Czech FA on 12 February 2008.
According to this, the tax liability in Germany was irrecoverable due to the insolvency of the debtor.
No assets had been identified, the income from non-self-employed activity was already the subject of other enforcement measures.
The German financial administration thus regarded the request as settled.
4.4.4 Comparison and evaluation
In the case of recovery, the requirements of EU law apply to all EU Member States for intergovernmental assistance.
The procedures for processing requests are therefore similar in the CZ and Germany.
The Federal Court of Auditors and NKò compared the statistics submitted by the two Member States to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.
There were disagreements.
In its report from 200620, the European Commission recommended that Member States prepare their statistics with greater care.
In 200921, the Commission concluded that, despite a larger number of requests for mutual assistance, discrepancies in the statistics had decreased.
Both Court of Auditors consider a renewed discussion at EU level on the statistics to be useful so that the remaining discrepancies can be avoided in the future.
If this does not happen, the statistics are conditionally meaningful and cannot be used for comparisons.
Furthermore, the Court of Auditors considers that the statistics should show both the annual number of requests and the type of claims (e.g. VAT, income tax) and the amount collected per Member State.
Through a more detailed analysis of the statistics provided by Member States, the Commission could help Member States assess their measures to combat VAT fraud.
Since the recovery rate can be calculated per Member State, the Court of Auditors advocates that low-quota Member States should at least aim for the average recovery rate within the EU.
At the request of a Member State, the Commission could play an active role in this.
The foreign recovery requests received by the Ministry of Finance CZ were forwarded to the responsible FÄ with a delay, especially in 2006 and 2007.
The same applies to the requests for recovery made by the Czech FÄ.
The audit revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance violated Law No. 191 / 2004 on intergovernmental recovery assistance insofar as it did not inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State of the progress of the recovery measures within the six-month period from the confirmation of receipt of the request.
4.5 VAT audit for large enterprises
4.5.1 VAT audit for large companies in the Czech Republic
General
The taxation procedure for large enterprises is subject to the same rules that apply to other taxpayers.
The audit of large enterprises is regulated by Czech Act No. 337 / 1992, the "Tax and Fee Administration Act."
The Czech Ministry of Finance defines large enterprises as natural persons who have established a business or legal persons who have been established to carry out a business and whose net turnover for the relevant taxation period amounts to at least CZK 2 billion according to the income or corporate tax return.
The taxpayer is classified as a large enterprise on the basis of the turnover level according to income or corporate tax return in the respective taxation period; for the first time for the year 2003.
A natural or legal person is no longer managed as a large enterprise for the purposes of turnover taxation if, in three consecutive assessment periods, its net turnover in the taxation period amounts to less than CZK 2 billion. The period begins at the end of the taxation period for which the conditions were fulfilled for the first time according to the tax return.
A taxpayer can only be removed from the list of large enterprises if at least one type of tax has been checked beforehand for a taxation period.
By the end of 2009, all large companies had been audited at least every five years.
Since 2010, taxpayers have to be assessed in writing at least every two years. Subsequent control measures are intended to eliminate tax risks and their negative effects on proper tax fixing and collection.
The audits by the FÄ should focus on at least one type of tax; they usually cover several taxation periods.
The taxable large enterprises were audited by the special audit bodies or audit services of the competent FÄ set up at a total of 13 FÄ.
A Special Audit Office carried out audits in its local area of responsibility in accordance with the instructions of the Head of the Finance Directorate.
In addition, she also checked
taxpayers with unusual and special business activities and
those whose examination required a high degree of expertise and time.
Taxpayers with complex location distribution and organisational structure are also examined,
Taxpayers suspected of large-scale tax evasion
as well as taxpayers belonging to chains and networks suspected of extensive tax evasion and unjustified input tax deduction.
Information on the number of audits carried out by the Special Audit Bodies of the FÄ and the additional tax results of these audits are shown in Table No. 3.
The Czech Ministry of Finance has submitted a proposal to amend Law No. 531 / 1990 for the regional tax authorities. In particular, it proposes the establishment of a special tax office with nationwide jurisdiction for selected taxpayers (legal entities established for the purpose of economic activity with a turnover of at least CZK 2 billion).
4.5.2 VAT audit for large companies in Germany
General
The VAT audit of large companies is not particularly regulated in Germany. The general regulations • the Tax Regulations (AO), • the Financial Administration Act (FVG) and • the Audit Regulations (BpO) apply to audits.
There are also work aids.
Tax regulations
The provisions of § § 193 to 203 AO "Section 4 External Audit" contain in particular rules for the admissibility of an external audit and its factual scope, distribution of responsibilities, form and content of the audit announcement, audit principles, obligations of the taxpayer to cooperate and prerequisites for final interviews as well as for the transmission of the audit report.
External inspections are carried out by the responsible FÄ (§ 195 AO).
Financial Administration Act According to § 5 paragraph 1 No. 1 in conjunction with § 19, it is incumbent on the Federal Central Office for Taxes to participate in external audits of the FÄ.
The nature and scope of this participation will be agreed between the authorities involved.
In addition, the Federal Central Tax Office may require that certain companies named by it be audited at a certain time.
In this case, it may lay down rules for the external audit of these taxpayers.
Audit Regulations In accordance with Article 108 (7) GG, the Audit Regulations (BpO 2000) were issued with the consent of the Federal Council.
It applies to external audits of the state finance authorities and the Federal Central Office for Taxes.
According to § 3 BpO, companies are regularly classified in size classes.
Large enterprises must be subjected to a follow-up inspection (paragraph 4.2 BpO).
According to paragraph 33.1 BpO, each competent tax authority must maintain a consolidated directory within the meaning of the provision.
Working aids for the administration
In addition, the following working aids were issued for the administration:
• "Uniform manual for the VAT special audit";
• VAT-Countries-Online - USLO (= dialogue system in the intra-Community VAT control procedure) with guidance on the use of the data contained in the MIAS on intra-Community business relations;
• Working aids for difficult and special issues.
• Central database for the storage and evaluation of VAT fraud cases and development of risk profiles -ZAUBER;
Taxpayers are classified in size classes based on criteria such as turnover and profit, whereby the limit values vary depending on the branch of business.
The figures are published by the Federal Ministry of Finance.
The values are reviewed every three years and set for the following three years.
The number of companies - not only large enterprises - is regularly determined (last deadline: 1 January 2010).
In general, large enterprises must be checked completely.
The tests are announced and usually also extend to the VAT,
i.e., the audit covers all relevant taxes, namely income or corporation tax as well as trade and VAT.
VAT can be audited either by auditors or VAT special auditors.
The practice varies and depends on the administrative structure of the individual countries.
The number of taxation periods covered by an audit usually varies between three and five years.
The BpO 2000 assumes three years.
The audit is subject to all taxes to which a company has been assessed.
4.5.3 Management of VAT audit for large enterprises
According to the agreement, both courts of auditors did not examine individual cases. They investigated the question of how the financial administrations proceed with the VAT audit of large enterprises.
Using a questionnaire, they collected information from the financial administrations that is essential for the audit of large enterprises.
• Which statistical records and evaluations for the VAT audit of large enterprises are available to the management of the tax administration?
In particular:
• Are there statistics or records of the extent to which a distinction is made between VAT fraud control and general VAT testing?
CZ: No, the current version of the ATIS system does not allow such a distinction.
Germany: The financial administration does not distinguish between audits to combat VAT fraud and general VAT audits.
• Are there statistics or records of the timeliness of the exams?
CZ: Information on the timeliness of audits of intra-Community acquisitions of selected VAT obligations is recorded in the ATIS system;
the same applies to information about the start and end of the FA's examination.
Germany: No, the statistics for auditors summarized at the federal level only contain information about the so-called average last audit period (year).
This figure does not provide an overview of the audit periods selected for individual companies.
VAT special auditors concentrate on the last VAT assessment periods and are also authorised to audit large enterprises.
The statistics kept at the federal level for VAT special auditors do not contain any information on the size class of the audited operation.
• Are there statistics or records of the type of surplus result; e.g. divided by:
i. real additional result (e.g. application of a reduced rate instead of the general VAT rate)
ii. incorrect additional result (e.g. relocation / postponement of facts not objectionable under VAT law to another taxation period)
iii. Cash effectiveness (payment of the fixed additional result)
CZ:
The Czech Financial Administration monitors the number of tax audits carried out, the amount of additional tax income broken down by type of tax, the number of taxpayers audited and the number of audited taxation periods.
Other tax procedures (on-site investigations, dunning procedures) are monitored in the same way.
Regardless of this, the amount of additional payments and receipts of payments are recorded.
Statistics on tax liabilities are broken down by tax type. However, there is no distinction between tax liabilities incurred by a tax return and those resulting from audit actions of the FA.
Germany: No, the statistics for auditors and VAT special auditors summarized at the federal level do not distinguish according to the above criteria.
Most tax authorities, where local surveys were carried out, also did not differentiate in this regard.
• Are high-result examination fields recorded?
CZ: Yes, the FA can select examination cases based on criteria linked to selected indicators stored in the ATIS system.
Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for auditors and VAT special auditors do not provide such information.
However, the finance ministries of the federal and state governments have agreed on a common approach.
Accordingly, auditors and tax investigators of the federal states must enter the additional tax result they achieve if a certain threshold is exceeded in ZAUBER.
In this case, supplementary information must be provided, e.g. on the origin of the additional VAT result achieved.
• What are the most common findings?
CZ:
- Large taxable enterprises have unjustifiably claimed input tax deduction for purchased deliveries and services,
• which were not used for an entrepreneurial activity according to § 72 (1) CZ UStG;
• which were used for representation expenses according to § 75 (3) CZ UStG;
• due to invoices that do not meet the requirements of § 73 (1) CZ UStG
- Large taxable enterprises have omitted the registration of VAT to be paid in § 21 (1) CZ UStG.
Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for auditors and VAT special auditors do not provide such information.
Findings on VAT from audits of large enterprises are not recorded separately by the countries.
However, the Federal Central Tax Office can evaluate the ZAUBER database into which auditors and tax investigators of the federal states have to enter the additional tax result they achieve if a certain threshold is exceeded.
• Does the financial administration analyse high-results audit fields and draw consequences for strategic management?
CZ: Yes, for example, nationwide audits are carried out with regard to risky goods and industries.
Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for auditors and VAT special auditors do not provide information on particularly "productive" audit fields.
With regard to the analysis of such information, the benefits and manner of its further use, there were different views among the survey bodies.
Some Chief Financial Directorates provide such information to the FÄ, but the FÄ are free to use it or not.
4.5.4 Comparison and evaluation
As a result, large amounts of information are processed automatically in the CZ. Among other things, data from VAT audits, as well as key figures from balance sheets, profit and loss statements are processed in the system.
The CZ is able to manage the selection of risky cases based on a wide range of information.
The same applies to the evaluation and management of VAT tests in general.
In the CZ, the establishment of a special tax office for large enterprises is planned for 2012.
In Germany, the financial administration does not collect comparably large amounts of data.
Accordingly, it is more difficult to fulfil these tasks in the same way.
The emphasis is more on the selection of relevant individual cases.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
On the basis of the information in VAT pre-registrations or VAT declarations as well as test instructions, qualified auditors select the cases to be examined and ensure the correct taxation.
In order to reduce VAT revenue losses and at the same time increase the risk of being detected for unreliable entrepreneurs, appropriate management processes and risk management systems must be introduced.

5. Conclusions
The cooperation between the two Court of Auditors has proved its worth.
This made it possible to gain necessary insights into the systems applied in both countries: in particular: • Intra-Community turnover, • Risk management at VAT in particular with regard to the selection of risky turnover, • Recovery of VAT receivables and • VAT audit of large enterprises.
The audit revealed differences in strategies for detecting VAT fraud and in the systems explained above.
These findings can be used to improve existing procedures.
They can also be used to initiate a discussion among interested bodies on which audit approaches and strategies can be used to combat fraud, such as the relationship within and between the Member States and the EU Commission.
The experience and insights gained should encourage us to continue to jointly examine the administration of VAT in the future.
6. Communique
The report was prepared in Czech, English and German and signed by the Presidents of the Czech Court of Auditors and the Federal Court of Auditors.
Status of information: June 2010.
