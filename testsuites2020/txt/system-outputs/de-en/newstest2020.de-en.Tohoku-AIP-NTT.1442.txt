Joint report on the parallel audits of expenditure for the construction of the Prague – Dresden motorway Preliminary remarks Without trans-European motorways, modern, united Europe would only be able to cope with the high volume of traffic between the partner countries with considerable restrictions and loss of quality.

High-quality transport networks are essential for maintaining and raising living standards in Europe.
Ensuring fast, safe, reliable and economic passenger and freight transport is an important task for the state.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
It requires a high level of organisational, technical and financial effort.
When setting up and developing a sustainable European transport infrastructure, difficult compromises often have to be made with European and national policy objectives, such as the preservation of the environment.
Precisely because of the necessary environmental protection measures, the construction of the transport infrastructure is complex.
When planning and awarding the construction of transport routes, administrations can save considerable financial resources and use them for other useful purposes through careful action and decision-making.
One of the tasks of state audit authorities is to identify deficiencies that stand in the way of optimum economy, cost-effectiveness and effectiveness in spending on the construction of transport facilities.
The audit authorities should not only inform the administrations of the shortcomings identified, but also provide them with suggestions for improvement for the benefit of citizens and for the benefit of Europe.
Summary
In 2005 and 2006, the two Supreme Audit Institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic, the Federal Audit Office (BRH) and Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad (NKÚ), carried out parallel audits of expenditure for the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway (D8 motorway in the Czech Republic and A17 motorway in the Federal Republic of Germany).
The two highways are connected by a border bridge jointly financed by the two states.
The cooperation with the NKÚ enabled the BRH to carry out an in-depth assessment of the cost-effectiveness of the use of funds in the construction of the border bridge.
In the course of cooperation with the BRH, the NKÚ received data from German bridges and tunnels for its own cost comparisons.
In 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany signed a contract for the construction of the border bridge.
In line with the planning progress, the date of completion was finally set for the end of 2006.
However, during the award procedure, the Road and Highway Administration of the Czech Republic (RMD) made mistakes that delayed the procedure and shortened the available construction time.
The contract with the contractor was therefore concluded later than planned.
The contractor secured the accelerated construction of the bridge by the end of 2006.
For this, however, the RMD had to accept considerable additional costs.
As part of the joint audit work, the prices of motorway bridges on the D 8 and the A 17 were compared. The benchmark for the price comparison of the bridges was the size of the bridge area.
A price analysis using statistical methods identified bridges with high costs per square metre.
The analysis showed that the border bridge under the major bridges with lengths of over 100 m was the most expensive.
This was also due to the increase in prices as a result of the delays in awarding contracts.
The comparison of the prices of the tunnel structures showed that the prices of the tunnels in the course of the D 8 are considerably higher than the prices of comparable tunnels in Germany.
In future audits of the cost-effectiveness of transport infrastructure expenditure, both BRH and NKÚ will be able to rely on a data collection of bridge and tunnel prices.
Both courts of auditors recommend that bridge constructions be standardised and that steel composite and special constructions only be carried out where prestressed concrete constructions are unsuitable.
The examination process was characterised by teamwork and an open approach.
During the parallel examination, the examiners from both sides exchanged their expertise and skills.
Introduction
This report deals with the parallel audits of expenditure on the construction of the motorway from Dresden to Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and A 17 in Germany).
The focus of the audit was on economy, cost-effectiveness and effectiveness of the use of funds.
The parallel tests were carried out by BRH in Germany and NKÚ in the Czech Republic
In the years 2005 and 2006.
The NKÚ examined the economy, cost-effectiveness and effectiveness of expenditure on the cross-border section 0807 of the D8 motorway amounting to approx. CZK 20 billion gross (approx. € 690 million).
Of this amount, €64 million will come from EU Structural Funds (ISPA).
The BRH had already examined the planning and construction of the A 17 motorway independently of the parallel tests with the NKÚ in the years 2003 to 2005.
Of the financial volume for the construction of all three sections of the A17 of approx. €670 million, €277 million will be co-financed by the European Fund (ERDF).
The Prague-Dresden motorway is part of the Pan-European Transport Corridor IV Dresden – Central and Southeastern Europe – Istanbul.
The D 8 runs from Prague via Usti nad Labem to the Czech/German border,
The A 17 from the border to Dresden.
At the time of the inspection, the sections of the motorways near the border were under construction.
Both sections were opened to traffic on 21 December 2006.
While the motorway is thus completed on the German side to Dresden, the D 8 remains incomplete on the Czech side, as section 0805 over a length of 16.4 km between Rehlovice and Lovosice is still in the planning phase.
Here the crossing of a landscape protection area in the Bohemian Central Uplands is planned.
According to Czech forecasts from 2001, the volume of traffic in 2008 on section 0807 of the D8 motorway near the border will amount to 22,940 vehicles per day.
German forecasts estimate the volume of traffic on the A 17 at the Czech border in 2010 at around 25,000 vehicles per day.
In 2000, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic concluded an agreement on the merger of the German A 17 motorway and the Czech D 8 motorway at the common state border through the construction of a border bridge.
Since both states are involved in the construction of this bridge, this individual construction measure represented an important aspect of the parallel audits of both courts of auditors.
Cooperation between BRH and NKÚ
From mid-2005, the two courts of auditors jointly considered cooperation in the examination of the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway.
Both sides had important reasons for this cooperation:
1.
Germany is partly financing the construction of the border bridge.
Planning and construction are the responsibility of the Czech Road Construction Administration.
There was no possibility for the BRH to examine this construction project itself.
2.
The NKÚ had no comparative data to assess whether the funds were used sparingly in view of the overall construction costs of the bridges and tunnels on the D8.
3.
The NKÚ also had to assess the effectiveness of the expenditure by examining the essential technical parameters of the bridges and tunnels, which should ensure the same quality of use on both sides of the border.
Following preparatory negotiations, the Presidents of the two Courts of Auditors concluded an agreement on the coordination of inspections of the Prague-Dresden motorway on 4 January 2006.
The auditors of both Courts of Auditors met in the course of 2006 at intervals of about six to eight weeks.
They dealt with current problems and tasks. They developed a uniform methodology for checking bridge and tunnel prices, exchanged test results on the construction of the border bridge and prepared joint reports.
A key aspect of the cooperation was the ongoing exchange of information.
While the BRH mainly focused on the comparison of the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels as well as the procurement procedures, the NKÚ mainly developed the methodology for the analysis of bridge and tunnel prices.
In Germany and the Czech Republic, the legal bases for financial control differ, as does the way in which the two courts of auditors complete their audits.
For this reason, both authorities drew up separate national reports on their audit results.
This report takes into account the results of the two parallel audits.
The cooperation will end with the signing of a final communiqué in the first half of 2007.
Construction of the border bridge
In the 2000 treaty, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed to complete the border bridge if possible in 2005.
They later postponed the date by mutual agreement until the end of 2006.
The RMD acted as the client of the construction project.
Germany is co-financing the bridge construction to 42.13%.
Initially, the RMD envisaged a prestressed concrete construction for the border bridge.
In 1999, however, the RMD agreed with its German partner on the construction of a steel composite structure.
They justified this decision with the possible reduction in the number of pairs of pillars from seven to five and the associated environmental benefits for the floodplain.
In addition, a comparative calculation of the RMD had shown the steel composite construction as the more cost-effective solution.
However, this was due to a calculation error.
The calculation was based on a length of the new steel composite construction of only 397 m,
In fact, it is 5% longer.
Serious errors were made by the RMD during the award procedure,
By insufficiently preparing the award documents and inaccurately describing both evaluation criteria and sub-criteria.
These errors led to subjective and ambiguous assessments by the Evaluation Commission and the Director General of the RMD.
A losing bidder challenged the outcome of the tender process.
The subsequent investigation by the Czech Cartel Office delayed the signing of the construction contract for the border bridge.
As a result, the following summer construction season in 2004 was lost and the total construction time available was shortened.
The contractor agreed to build the bridge in a shorter time, which led to a significant price increase.
The measures offered included the double assembly of the superstructures, the change of the pillar shape and the construction of an assembly hall.
In addition, the contractor was unable to procure the originally intended type of steel.
The new steel grade – whose higher costs of around €4 million were borne by the client alone – made it possible to shorten the construction time planned for corrosion protection and thus the overall construction time.
Compared to the offer price of around €18.3 million net, the acceleration measures and further additions will significantly increase the overall construction costs of the border bridge.
The shortened construction period alone led to a price increase of around €5.9 million.
Without price guidance, costs are currently around € 25.9 million net (as of October 2006).
Comparison of prices of bridges and tunnels
Both courts of auditors examined the bridge prices on the D 8 and the A 17 in order to identify the bridges that were characterised by particularly high prices and to compare the bridge prices on the German and Czech sides.
The study was based on mathematical statistical methods.
The tunnels on the D 8 were compared with similar tunnels on the German motorways A 71, A 38 and A 4, as there were no comparable tunnels on the A 17.
When preparing this part of the examination, a precise definition of the price concept was important.
For the comparison of the bridge prices, both courts of auditors agreed on detailed specifications, for example: to use the current price paid for the bridge without VAT.
(VAT rates in the Czech Republic and Germany are different and may change.) not to take into account the costs of special start-up measures, to use the exchange rate of the European Central Bank of 30.12.2005 for currency conversion. (29 CZK = 1 €).
Bridges of various types (reinforced concrete, prestressed concrete, steel composite and steel) and of various sizes are available on both the D 8 and the A 17.
In order to ensure the comparability of the tested bridge structures, the bridges were grouped according to their design.
The analyses also took into account the bridge size within these groups.
By far the most common were concrete bridges on both sides of the border (20 bridges on the D 8 and 36 bridges on the A 17).
The study focused on this type of bridge, as the size of the sample allowed the application of mathematical statistical methods and improved the reliability of the results.
The study showed that the m2 price of the concrete bridges on the D 8 / A 17 depends on the bridge size (length, road surface): the larger the bridge, the lower the price per square metre.
For German bridges, the correlation between price and size is more pronounced than for Czech bridges (see figures below).
Two bridges with a significantly higher price could be found on the A 17 and four on the D 8.
These bridges were determined partly by a method for determining significant deviations within a sample and partly by regression analysis of the correlation between bridge price and size (based on the distance to the regression curve, atypically expensive bridges can be identified).
However, the atypically high price of these bridges should only serve as an indication of which bridges to focus on.
In order to draw definitive conclusions, the causes of the respective high price must be determined in each individual case.
This could be due, for example, to uneconomic administrative action, but also to the requirements for the protection of the environment or other legitimate reasons.
Taking into account the larger average length of Czech concrete bridges compared to the German ones (see Table 1), the proven negative correlation between the bridge price and the length expected the Czech concrete bridges to be cheaper.
This was also supported by the lower labour costs in the Czech Republic compared to Germany.
However, the evaluation of the results showed that the price of the concrete bridges on the D 8 is higher than on the A 17.
During joint discussions, two reasons for this situation were identified:
1.
In Germany, construction contracts for bridges are mainly awarded separately.
This also enables medium-sized companies to participate in the award competition.
In the Czech Republic, many bridge constructions are awarded as part of larger contracts for the construction of several kilometres of motorway sections.
Orders of this magnitude cannot be handled by medium-sized companies.
2.
The variety of bridge structures built in the Czech Republic is greater than in Germany.
In this context, the NKÚ noted that the construction of bridges is determined long before the start of construction,
And already with the submission of the application for planning approval by the RMD.
At this point in time, it selects a specific bridge construction variant from several alternatives. However, cost-effectiveness plays a subordinate role in this decision.
Only by means of a thorough analysis of the construction sectors of both countries would it have been possible to reach a final conclusion with regard to bridge prices in the Czech Republic and Germany. However, this would have gone beyond the scope of this examination.
The border bridge is the most expensive steel composite bridge on the D 8 and A 17.
The prices for the tunnels on the D 8 are about twice as high as in Germany.
However, a comparison of the technical parameters between the tunnels on the D 8 and the tunnels in Germany showed no significant difference.
The significant price differences may be the result of under-developed competition for tunnelling in the Czech Republic.
However, the small number of tunnels did not allow any general conclusions.
Economic efficiency and effectiveness of the Dresden – Prague motorway
The independent Czech Republic was founded in 1993.
In the same year, the government adopted the plan for the expansion of the motorway network.
It was planned to gradually extend the D 8 from Prague to the border with Germany.
Section 0805 was to be built through the Bohemian Central Uplands before section 0807 near the border.
The Czech Republic is financing D8 as part of the programme financing.
The programme number 327 220 “Construction of the D 8 motorway Prague – Ústí nad Labem – Czech German state border” defines two objectives:
1.
As a national objective: to improve the connection between Prague and Ústi nad Labem;
2.
As an international destination: the connection between Prague and Berlin as part of the Pan-European Transport Corridor IV BerlinIstanbul.
The programme provided for the construction of the section through the Central Bohemian Mountains to be completed in June 2008 and the construction of section 0807 near the border to be completed in June 2007.
It should be noted that the end of the construction work is not identical with the time of commissioning.
The NKÚ noted that the planning approval decision had already been issued for the construction of the section leading through the Bohemian Central Mountains.
Environmental groups have taken legal action against this decision.
A final judgment is still pending.
Compared to the timetable provided for in the programme documentation, a delay of several years in the completion of section No. 0805 could therefore not be ruled out.
In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed that the completion date of section 0805 be postponed to 2010.
As a result, the construction of the section near the border did not achieve the national goal of improving the connection between Prague and Usti nad Labem.
The RMD carried out an economic assessment of section No. 0807 of the D 8 near the border and section No. 0805 through the Bohemian Central Uplands between 1999 and 2001.
The investment cost was approximately € 639 million for both sections No. 0805 and No. 0807.
Table 2: Results of the profitability analysis (EIRR = internal rate of interest)
Variant Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.
Traffic volume in the northern part of the border section 18,000 vehicles per day in 2010.
Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.
Traffic volume in the northern part of the section near the border was 22,000 vehicles per day in 2010.
Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.
Traffic volume in the northern part of the border section 25,000 vehicles per day in 2010.
The economic feasibility study from 2001 was based on the assumption that the section near the border and the section running through the Bohemian Central Uplands would be subject to traffic at the same time.
At the time of the examination, it was obvious that the section through the Central Bohemian Mountains would not be opened on the original date.
This reduces the aforementioned EIRR values.
The costs of both sections as at 31 December 2005 were €897 million excluding VAT and thus 27.4 % higher than in the economic assessment of 2001.
In addition, there is a risk that section 0805 will have a different, more complex domestic route, which would affect the economic viability of the project.
The economic analysis showed that the construction of both motorway sections is economically justified with a daily traffic volume of at least 18,000 vehicles per day in 2010.The forecast for 2008 had predicted 22,940 vehicles per day.
However, a study on diversion routes as an alternative to the missing section through the Central Bohemian Mountains assumes a traffic volume of 12 600 to 13 750 vehicles per day in 2007.
A higher volume of traffic on the routes, which are to replace the missing section with the Bohemian Central Uplands, is highly likely to result in congestion and thus increased external costs, which were not taken into account in the original economic feasibility study.
The aforementioned reduction in revenue and increase in costs means that the already low EIRR for the construction of the section of the D 8 near the border will not be achieved.
The construction of the section of the D 8 near the border is therefore uneconomical.
The construction of the A 17 also led to cost increases, as with the construction of the two above-mentioned sections of the D 8.
As part of the overall economic assessment for the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan 1992, the Federal Ministry of Transport assumed investment costs of around €320 million.
It thus determined a benefit/cost ratio of 4.6.
In the meantime, costs have increased to around €670 million and the benefit/cost ratio has been reduced by more than half.
The BRH had examined the cost-effectiveness of the planning and construction of the A 17 motorway independently of the parallel tests with the NKÚ in the years 2003 to 2005.
He noted that the authority responsible for the approval requested an unnecessary landscape tunnel for the third section of the A 17.
In the course of the examination, the BRH succeeded in convincing the Federal Ministry and the Road Construction Administration of the superfluousness of the landscape tunnel.
This avoided €10 million in construction costs and €150,000 in annual operating costs.
When examining the first section of the A 17, the BRH found that the construction project was insufficiently prepared.
The following example illustrates this:
In the planning phase, the road construction administration refrained from recording the condition of the rock on the surface of the Dölzschener Wand, as it was difficult to access.
Only when the tunnelling reached the wall did she catch up.
This showed that the rock was more weathered than assumed in the tender.
Complex measures such as moorings, injections and rockfall protection nets for around €3.3 million were necessary.
The road construction administration not only bore the costs for additional, already necessary services such as securing the Dölzschener Wand, but also for those that would not have been necessary for proper construction preparation.
These include expenses due to disrupted construction processes (€3.2 million), additional training of the tunnelling team (€0.5 million) and increased wages and material prices due to the extension of the construction period (€7 million).
This additional expenditure of around €10.7 million is not offset by any lasting added value.
The BRH took these and other measures as an opportunity to call on the Federal Ministry to make better use of its specialist supervision for major road construction measures.
In this context, it should be urgent for the road construction administrations to introduce quality assurance systems.
Advantages of the cooperation for BRH and NKÚ The cooperation met the expectations of both courts of auditors.
The BRH received findings on the planning, procurement and implementation of the construction of the border bridge.
Both courts of auditors developed a database on bridge and tunnel prices, which will be helpful in future audits.
The NKÚ noted that the most important structural parameters for bridges, tunnels and roadway of the D 8 do not differ from those of the A 17.
The auditors of both Courts of Auditors involved in the cooperation gained valuable experience which will be useful in future audits.
Report on the results of the parallel audit of the VAT administration of the Czech Republic and Germany
Preface
The Lima Declaration, adopted in 1977, emphasises that the Courts of Auditors have the power to audit all public finances.
The declaration requires that the Court of Auditors must have the power to examine tax collection to the greatest extent possible.
The Organisation of European Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers taxes to be an important part of public revenue.
The thematic focus of the 6th EUROSAI Congress, which took place in Bonn in 2005, was the audit of public revenues by the courts of auditors.
One of the most important steps towards optimising the audit activities of a Court of Auditors is the development of a specific strategy for auditing public revenue.
This is especially true for taxes as the largest source of public revenue with a high risk of default.
As national economies become increasingly interconnected and interdependent, a situation may arise in which national audit institutions can only carry out their audit work in cooperation with the audit institutions of other states.
An example could be the examination of internationally organised fraud, which can lead to a significant loss of revenue in many countries.
Cooperation between the authorities is necessary in the fight against such crimes.
Court of Auditors that audit in this area must be prepared to cooperate closely with each other.
The idea for an audit of VAT and the MIAS system originated at the 6th EUROSAI Congress in Bonn. This audit was carried out in cooperation between the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Audit Office.
In the course of thorough preparation, the participating courts of auditors first had to familiarize themselves with the legal framework and procedures of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.
Based on the evaluation of the available information, we made the selection of the examination subjects for the examination planning.
Achieving the efficient and effective management of VAT is a long-standing problem and individual states (in particular the EC Member States) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify the collection of VAT and create greater transparency in this area.
We are convinced that the results of our audit can not only contribute to improving the work of the financial administration, but also form the basis for a proposal for an improved system of international exchange of information.
Report on the results of the parallel audit of the VAT administration of the Czech Republic and Germany
Introduction
File number: CZ) 06/27 (EN) VIII 2 – 2005 – 1215
Subject of the examination:
(CZ) Administration of VAT after the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union
(DE) Examination of administrative cooperation in the field of VAT in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and 1925/2004
The Commission's audit objective:
(CZ) The aim of the audit in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedures applied by the financial administration in the field of VAT following the integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter “EC”) with the free movement of goods and services, as well as the use of MIAS1, in particular the control of the use of the VAT exemption for intra-Community supplies.
(DE) The aim of the audit was to examine the system of intra-Community VAT control with a focus on mutual assistance in the field of VAT in accordance with the above-mentioned regulations.
As a result of the audit, weaknesses should be identified and recommendations made to remedy them.
VAT Information Exchange System The audits were carried out jointly by the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic (“NKÚ”) and the Federal Court of Auditors (“BRH”) of the Federal Republic of Germany on the basis of an agreement concluded on 8 June 2006.
The cooperation focused on the review of selected business transactions between entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the exploitation of information obtained through international administrative assistance between tax administrations and the comparison of VAT management systems in the two countries.
A joint final report on the results of the audits was prepared in accordance with European Guideline No. 31 for the implementation of the INTOSAI audit standards.
The audited period covered the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005.
Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel audit
The parallel audit of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two courts of auditors.
In addition to the focus on the exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2004, other closely related aspects were also examined, such as the registration of taxable persons, tax returns and summary notifications.
The audit also covered the legal situation with regard to cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach and the comparison of statistical data.
When comparing the systems of VAT administrations in the two countries, differences were found in the following areas:
1) Registration for VAT purposes.
While in Germany, entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, among others, the main criterion for registration is exceeding the turnover threshold laid down in the Value Added Tax Act.
In the Czech Republic, taxpayers only receive a single tax identification number, which they also use for intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, the taxable person receives a tax number that is only valid for domestic transactions for VAT purposes.
If the German taxpayer wants to make intra-Community transactions, he must apply for a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID number.
As problems arise from the different registration procedures, the rules should be harmonised within the EC (see 4.1).
2) Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach.
In the Czech Republic, cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach is free of VAT, but there is a right to deduction of input tax.
In Germany, the transport service, insofar as the route passes through Germany, is subject to VAT.
Efforts should be made at EC level to harmonise the situation in accordance with Article 393 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common VAT system (see 4.2).
3) Tax returns.
Whereas in the Czech Republic, taxable persons only have to file VAT returns for tax periods during the year (month or quarter), taxable persons in Germany (monthly or quarterly)
Pre-register for sales tax and submit an annual sales tax return after the end of the calendar year.
In contrast to the Czech Republic, taxable persons in Germany must submit their VAT pre-registration electronically.
The introduction of the obligation to file VAT returns electronically in the Czech Republic would improve the efficiency of the Czech financial administration (see 4.3).
4) Summary messages.
While taxpayers in the Czech Republic must submit their Summary Reports to the tax offices (FÄ), German taxpayers must submit the Summary Reports to the ClO2.
Accordingly, the FAs in the Czech Republic have access to the information from the summary notifications as soon as they have been filed.
For German FÄ, the data from the Summary Reports are only available after they have been processed by the CLO.
In order to combat VAT fraud, updated information on intra-Community transactions is needed as soon as possible.
The monthly submission of summary reports would shorten the period between the time of the turnover and the update of the MIAS data.
This would allow a timely assessment of taxation in the purchaser's Member State (see 4.4), but only if all EC Member States introduce the same time limits.
5) International exchange of information in the field of VAT.
In the case of incoming requests for information, the Czech CLO monitors compliance with the three-month deadline.
The German CLO does not monitor processing times.
As a result, the German financial administration dealt with a significantly lower percentage of the requests for information received within the specified period.
Because of these problems, the BRH has recommended constant monitoring of the deadlines to the German CLO (see 4.6).
6) Risk management.
Each of the two Member States is in the process of developing its own risk management system (RMS) with corresponding strengths and weaknesses.
The NKÚ and the BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by one Member State alone.
Successful criteria, elements or approaches of an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in all EC Member States. Otherwise, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5.).
As part of the cooperation, the two courts of auditors examined selected cases of intra-Community transactions between Czech and German tax entities.
Of these, 31 cases were reviewed jointly using the legal possibilities of the CLO, in which there were doubts about the correct taxation or the suspicion of VAT fraud.
The Court of Auditors found that:
In some cases, the FÄ used the information obtained in the international exchange of information and redefined the VAT liability of the taxable persons concerned.
In these cases, the taxable persons had either unlawfully claimed the VAT exemption or had not reported the purchase of goods in their VAT return.
In some cases, the FÄ could not use the information obtained in the exchange of information because it was incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be used because of different legal provisions in the two Member States.
In some cases, the financial administration of another Member State refused to provide the requested information.
A number of cases have been uncovered in which taxpayers misreported transactions in their summary reports.
As a result, the data in the MIAS were accordingly incorrect, so that the clerks (of the FÄ) had to investigate in these cases (see 6).
Examination procedure
Examination procedures in the CR
The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by Department II – “State Budget Revenue” and the Territorial Audit Departments of Central Bohemia, North-West Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.
Audited bodies were: The Ministry of Finance and the 10 FÄ Humpolec, Jihlava, Kadaň, Liberec, Nymburk, Otrokovice, Prague 1, Prague 4, Sokolov and Třinec.
The NKÚ College approved the audit findings on 23 April 2007.
Examination procedures in Germany
The examination was carried out in the period July 2006 to February 2007 by the examination area traffic taxes and employees of the assigned PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt/Main and Munich.
It was part of the work plan for 2006 and was therefore announced to the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2006.
After a test phase, the actual testing began in the fourth quarter of 2006.
In accordance with the cases selected by the BRH and later by the NKÚ, the BRH had to announce the examination in several federal states.
Apart from interviews in the BMF and the CLO, the examination was conducted in the following federal states:
Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.
Tax files from the following cases were included in the audit:
Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, München-Körperschaften, Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-Nord and Hamburg for large companies, Hannover-Nord, Winsen-Luhe, Bonn-Innenstadt, Köln-Mitte, Köln-Porz, Köln-Süd, Sankt Augustin, Pirmasens, Bautzen, Chemnitz-Süd, Dresden II, Freiberg, Leipzig I and Zschopau.
Talks were also held with FÄ Augsburg-Stadt, Aurich, Düsseldorf-Altstadt, Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.
The results of the audit were communicated to the BMF in May 2007.
Cooperation between the two Courts of Auditors
Several meetings of representatives of both courts of auditors took place in the run-up to the parallel audit.
The participants in these meetings familiarized themselves with the organization of the financial administration, the legislation on sales tax and the system of sales tax administration in the respective other country.
The subject of the test phase was agreed at the meeting in May 2006.
The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.
At this meeting, a timetable for the further procedure was drawn up and the following examination topics were determined for the parallel examinations: 1.
Registration of taxable persons.

An entrepreneur with a registered office, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic whose turnover exceeds CZK 1,000,000 in the last 12 consecutive calendar months is obliged to pay on the first day of the third month after the month in which he has exceeded the threshold (Section 94 (1) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., on value added tax; hereinafter “Act No. 235/2004”).
The person concerned must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he/she has exceeded the registration threshold.
Current legislation does not allow the retroactive registration of a taxpayer if he has exceeded the application deadline for registration.
An entrepreneur with a registered office, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic who provides services subject to VAT or services exempt from VAT with the right to deduct VAT must register for VAT even if his turnover does not exceed CZK 1 million but meets other requirements specified in Act No. 235/2004.
An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic who does not meet any of the requirements specified in the law may voluntarily apply for VAT registration.
Upon receipt of the registration application by the local tax officer, the registration procedure begins in accordance with Act No. 337/1992.
Anyone who wants to register voluntarily for value added tax must indicate in his application the cut-off date from which he applies for registration as a person subject to value added tax.
The tax official must check the information provided by the entrepreneur, i.e. the completed application for registration with all attachments.
If he has doubts about the information provided therein, he must ask the applicant to explain, supplement or substantiate the information provided.
If the tax official has determined by verification that the entrepreneur meets the requirements for registration, he must issue a written opinion on the registration and the allocation of a tax number.
In the notification, the tax officer must indicate the date of entry into force of the registration for value added tax and the assessment period for value added tax.
The assessment period is the calendar quarter; unless the entrepreneur's turnover for the previous calendar year has reached the amount of at least CZK 10,000,000.
If this is the case, the assessment period is the calendar month.
An entrepreneur whose turnover reached at least CZK 2,000,000 in the previous calendar year is entitled to choose the calendar month as the assessment period and must inform the tax officer of this change.
The issue of a tax number in the registration notice always has a constitutive character.
The taxpayer must provide the tax number in any communication (including payments) with the tax officer, as well as in cases where this is required by a special law (e.g. Act No. 235/2004, concerning the issuance of tax documents)3.
The tax number contains the coding "CZ" and a basic component in the form of a general identifier.
In the case of natural persons, this is the number of the birth certificate or another general identification mark, insofar as this is determined by a special law. In the case of legal persons, the general identification mark is the company identification number (in accordance with the provisions in § 33 (12) of Act No. 337/1992).
If the entrepreneur has not fulfilled his obligation despite being requested to do so by the tax official, the local tax official has to register him ex officio.
A notification will also be issued, which will be sent to the taxpayer.
In the Czech Republic, every entrepreneur authorised to conduct a business receives a tax number for any type of tax when they register for the first time.
This also applies to registration as a VAT payer.
In accordance with Law No. 235/2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, in the event of non-compliance with the obligation to register VAT, the tax officer may require the taxable person to collect up to 10% of the proceeds from the taxable turnover, which the person concerned has made unlawfully without taxation, for the period from the date on which the entrepreneur should have been registered as a taxable person, up to the date on which the registration as a taxable person was made by order of the tax officer (Section 98 (1) of Law No. 235/2004).
The payment of the amount fixed in this way is considered a tax payment within the meaning of § 98 (3) of Law No. 235/2004, i.e. it is not a fine or penalty.
If the legal requirements are met, the registration of a person subject to VAT can be deleted for two reasons:
1)
Cancellation of the registration at the request of the taxpayer, i.e. mainly for the reason that the turnover does not reach the threshold for registration (§ 106 (1) of Law No. 235/2004).
A taxpayer may request the cancellation of his registration no earlier than one year after the effective date specified in the registration notice.
2) Deletion of the registration ex officio (§ 106 (7) of Act No. 235/2004), if: a) the taxable person has not performed for a period of 12 consecutive months and has not informed the tax official of the reasons for this, b) the taxable person has not fulfilled his obligations under Act No. 235/2004, c) the previous taxable person no longer meets the requirements for tax liability.
B) Taxpayers without legal domicile, place of business or business premises in the Czech Republic A person who is registered for tax purposes in another Member State and does not have his legal domicile, place of business or place of business in the Czech Republic, or a taxable foreigner who provides services in the Czech Republic and has to file a tax return and pay taxes for these services or deliveries in accordance with § 108 of Act No. 235/2004 (“non-resident entrepreneur”) becomes liable to tax when providing the service in question.
He must submit an application for registration with FA Prague 1 no later than the day of the delivery in question.
He is obliged to indicate in this application all VAT numbers allocated to him in other Member States or third countries.
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration later than on the day of the first taxable service provision in the Czech Republic, the FA Prague 1 must register him retroactively, as he became liable for VAT on the day of the first taxable service provision in the Czech Republic in accordance with Act No. 235/2004.
In the event of retroactive registration, FA Prague 1 shall require the companies concerned to provide proof (invoices or written explanations) as proof of performance.
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration in the Czech Republic before the first performance of a service, FA Prague 1 must request the presentation of the performance-related contract documents.
As of 31 December 2004, 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered with FA Prague 1, of which 124 were from Germany. As of 31 December 2005, a total of 951 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered, of which 233 were from Germany.
In accordance with the provisions of § 106 (9) of Act No. 235/2004, the tax officer is entitled to cancel the registration of a non-resident entrepreneur on 31 January of the following calendar year if the latter does not accept the obligation to file tax declarations or declarations and to pay tax.
When examining the NKÚ, it turned out that if a tax return was filed by post and sent abroad on 25 January, i.e. in accordance with the mandatory cut-off date for filing a tax return, this declaration had not yet been received by the FA by 31 January.
In cases where these facts, which are decisive for the possibility of deletion of the registration, become known to the FA later than 31 January, it is no longer possible to delete the registration of the non-resident entrepreneur for VAT in the Czech Republic in the calendar year in question.
Registration of taxable persons in Germany
In accordance with the provisions of the tax regulations (§§ 137, 138 AO), every business must be registered with the municipality and/or the responsible tax office.
This registration must be made no later than one month after commencement of business.
The municipality forwards the application to the tax authorities.
If the competent tax office determines that a business activity has been started but not registered, it can also retroactively register the taxpayer ex officio.
In Germany, taxable persons, regardless of whether they are resident or non-resident, are obliged to register VAT for Zwekke if they meet the requirements in § 2 of the German Value Added Tax Act (UStG).
This does not depend on the amount of revenue generated.
There is no voluntary registration in Germany.
Special departments are responsible for entrepreneurs based abroad.
For example, the FA ChemnitzSüd is responsible for those entrepreneurs who are based in the Czech Republic.
A total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered with it as of 30 April 2004; as of 1 March 2006, 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered there.
According to the findings of the BRH, these FAs with special competences often refused the registration of so-called sham self-employed persons residing in the new Central and Eastern European Member States of the EC.
Since the free movement of workers is still restricted after the accession of these ten countries to the EC, these self-employed workers tried to circumvent these restrictions by setting up their own business.
These (sham) self-employed persons do not meet the conditions specified in § 2 UStG for recognition as entrepreneurs, since they are usually dependent on a single client, who determines their working time and the type of work execution.
In order to be registered, the entrepreneur must complete a questionnaire from the responsible FA and provide information about the company and the business activities carried out.
The questionnaire is a binding form for all FÄ in Germany.
It is processed either in special organisational units within the FÄ or in the organisational units generally responsible for tax assessment.
This form is used to carry out a risk assessment for the individual taxpayer prior to the allocation of a tax number.
The structure of the tax number for domestic sales is based on certain requirements:
The first three digits are the identification number for the responsible FA, The following three (or four) digits indicate which department is responsible within the FA, The following five (or four) digits are the identification feature for the taxpayer, the last digit is always a control number.
If an entrepreneur wants to participate in intra-Community trade, he needs a VAT number in order to be able to make tax-free intra-Community deliveries.
This is allocated by the CLO on request if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany for VAT purposes.
The VAT number is automatically allocated by the CLO if the taxpayer declares intra-Community deliveries in his prior VAT declarations or in his annual VAT declaration.
The VAT number consists of the country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.
The registration of an entrepreneur can be deleted: 1. On request (e.g. if he ceases business), but only after completion of all tax transactions (investment of all financial years) or 2. if the financial administration determines that he no longer operates a business.
As a rule, the validity of the VAT number depends on the validity of the VAT number.
In these cases, the FÄ must inform the CLO of the deletion of the VAT number so that the validity of the VAT number can be terminated there at that time.
According to the Value Added Tax Act (§ 19 (1) UStG), domestic taxpayers do not have to pay value added tax in the following cases: 1. the turnover of the previous calendar year plus the resulting value added tax has not exceeded the amount of 17,500 € and 2. will probably not exceed the amount of 50,000 € in the following year.
The so-called small entrepreneurs are not entitled to charge other entrepreneurs VAT, nor to deduct input tax.
Although they do not have to pay VAT, small business owners are obliged to register with the tax office and file an annual VAT return.
A small business owner can declare the non-application of § 19 (1) UStG.
This declaration is binding for the following five years.
He may then invoice the VAT and deduct the input tax.
Non-resident taxpayers can appoint a fiscal representative (§ 22a UStG).
The prerequisite for this is that they only make tax-free sales and waive the input tax deduction.
The fiscal representative fulfils the tax obligations of the foreign entrepreneur, so that he does not have to register for VAT purposes.
The invoices must indicate that a fiscal representative has been appointed.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation in the two countries is different.
While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the first requirement for registration (among others) is to exceed the threshold specified in the Value Added Tax Act.
If an entrepreneur does not exceed this threshold, he can register voluntarily.
The registration procedure in Germany is standardised, but differences may occur due to different organisational structures in the individual federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the taxable person receives a tax number for any tax at the time of his first registration.
In the case of its registration for VAT, this tax number also applies to intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, an entrepreneur who registers for VAT purposes receives a tax number exclusively for intra-German transactions.
If the German entrepreneur wants to carry out intra-Community transactions, he must specifically request the allocation of a VAT number.
Both the NKÚ and the BRH found that the German two-stage registration system can lead to significant misunderstandings in other Member States, such as the Czech Republic, which issue a single identification number both for national VAT registration and for intra-Community transactions.
On the other hand, the two-stage system allows for retroactive (national registration) in cases where the taxpayer does not register his business activities with the municipality or the competent FA.
This retroactive registration enables an accurate assessment of value added tax for previous assessment periods, in particular an accurate estimate of the value added tax liability.
As the different registration procedures lead to problems, the rules should be harmonised for the whole EC.
The German Parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number.
This is to be allocated by the Federal Central Tax Office to each natural person after birth.
This number applies to natural persons resident in Germany for life.
If a natural person takes up a business activity, the responsible FA applies for a commercial tax identification number, which serves as a VAT number.
In future, there should therefore be no delay between the national registration of a taxable person and the allocation of the VAT number.
Work on implementing an IT procedure for managing the numbers has not yet been completed.
Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach
Legal regulations in the Czech Republic
In accordance with the provisions of § 70 of Law No. 235/2004, since 1 May 2004, the carriage of passengers between individual Member States and between Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic has been exempt from VAT and is entitled to deduct input tax.
The exemption from VAT also applies if the transport is carried out by persons who are registered as taxable persons in other Member States or by foreigners who are taxable in their own country.
The return journey is regarded as a separate transport process.
If non-resident entrepreneurs do not carry out any economic activity in the Czech Republic other than the cross-border transport of passengers by bus and coach, they are not obliged to register as subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.
Cross-border passenger transport has been exempted from VAT in the Czech Republic by virtue of the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, Annex V, Chapter 5(1)(b), which reads as follows:
"For the purpose of applying Article 28(3)(b) of Directive 77/388/EEC, in accordance with point 17 of Annex F of the Directive, the Czech Republic may maintain the tax exemption for cross-border passenger transport either until the requirement of Article 28(4) of the Directive is met or for as long as the same tax exemption is applied by any of the current Member States."
The legal regulations in Germany
In accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006, as implemented in Germany by § 3b (1) UStG, a transport service is carried out where the transport is effected.
Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and cross-border passenger transport.
Only the domestic part of the transport service is subject to tax in Germany.
German taxation also does not distinguish between resident and non-resident (bus) entrepreneurs.
If a non-resident taxable person travels through Germany, the part of the transport attributable to Germany is deemed to be taxable transport.
Before providing his services in Germany, the non-resident entrepreneur must report his intention to provide passenger transport services to the competent FA.
The latter registers it for tax purposes (see 4.1.2) and issues a special certificate for each bus and coach named in the taxable person's registration.
The entrepreneur must state his taxable transport services in a German VAT return.
As of 1 March 2006, 741 Czech bus operators were registered with FA Chemnitz-Süd.
If the transport service is provided for an entrepreneur resident in Germany, the non-resident taxpayer does not have to pay the VAT to the FA himself.
In its place, the domestic purchaser of the services must pay VAT to the tax office and the net amount invoiced to the non-resident taxpayer, which is known as the ‘displacement of tax liability’ and is in line with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC.
In addition to the registration by a non-resident taxpayer and his income tax return, the German tax administration has several means of checking the accuracy of the tax return with regard to taxable personal transport:
Mobile customs control groups check the certificates of buses and coaches registered abroad that are used to transport passengers through Germany.
After each inspection, the mobile control groups transmit an inspection protocol to the responsible FA.
If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group can require the bus driver to pay VAT before continuing his journey.
The non-resident taxpayer can deduct the VAT paid in this way from the tax liability stated in his VAT return.
If the FA has doubts about the accuracy of a VAT return, it may order an audit to be carried out in the FA or may use the means of administrative assistance referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 (see point 4.6).
Even if the foreign taxpayer refuses to pay the legally established VAT, the FA may request administrative assistance in accordance with Council Directive 76/308/EEC.
The BRH considers these means of administrative assistance in tax matters to verify the VAT return or compliance with the tax obligation by a non-resident bus operator to be too costly in relation to the low income from VAT on taxable passenger transport.
In particular, the examination of the books of a non-resident taxpayer causes disproportionately high costs for the taxpayer himself and for the financial administration.
The latter must check the foreign books, which requires knowledge not only of the foreign language, but also of foreign accounting principles.
Accordingly, a higher expenditure of time is to be expected for such an examination than for a resident taxpayer, although the examination is limited to passenger transport taking place in Germany.
On the other hand, the non-resident taxpayer must accept not only the audit rights of his national financial administration, but also those of the other Member States, insofar as he carries out passenger transport there.
Furthermore, for each Member State in which even a single passenger transport is carried out, the taxable person must fulfil all existing tax obligations in the various languages and on the basis of the forms of the financial administrations of the EC Member States concerned.
This means that the correct taxation of cross-border passenger transport services leads to a disproportionate administrative burden.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation is different in the two countries.
In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between different EC Member States and between Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT under the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic to the EC.
In Germany, the transport service is subject to VAT in accordance with the transport route applicable on German territory.
If a non-resident taxpayer provides such a transport service for the first time, he must notify the competent FA in advance.
This registers the taxpayer, who must declare the taxable portion of the transport service in a tax return in Germany.
Law enforcement in Germany is very time-consuming.
At least three out of four Czech taxpayers registered with FA Chemnitz-Süd have passenger transport as their business purpose.
The tax revenue in question is quite low in relation to the administrative burden.
Member States – which levy VAT in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common VAT system – have a high administrative burden in relation to the relevant tax revenue.
In order to avoid the disproportionate costs of VAT assessment, cross-border passenger transport should only be taxable in one Member State.
This could be the state in which the transport begins or in which the service provider is located.
This type of taxation would require an amendment to Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006.
VAT returns
Filing and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic
Unless otherwise stipulated by law, even if no tax liability has been incurred, the entrepreneur is obliged to file a VAT return on the form provided by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days of the end of the tax period.
The tax liability arises upon expiry of the deadline for submitting the value added tax return. Excluded from this regulation is the value added tax on the import of goods in accordance with Act No. 235/2004. Here, the due date of the tax is determined according to the customs regulations.
If there is a refund claim as a result of above-average deductible input taxes, this amount will be refunded to the taxpayer within 30 days of the establishment of this deduction, without an application having to be made.
The time limit is not applied in cases where the tax officer initiates tax proceedings with regard to the taxpayer's tax liability.
In accordance with § 73 (11) of Act No. 235/2004, the right to deduct input tax can be asserted at the latest with the regular tax return for the last tax period of the calendar year in which the right to deduct input tax arose.
After expiry of this period, the deduction of input tax can still be claimed within three years after the end of the tax period in which the claim would have been possible for the first time.
However, this requires the submission of a supplementary VAT return.
An amendment to Act No. 235/2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, allows the filing of a supplementary VAT return only for the period in which the right to deduct input tax could have been claimed for the first time.
A taxable person must file a supplementary VAT return if: a) the sum of the corrections leads to an increase in the tax liability, b) he makes corrections by which the last known tax liability is not changed, but only previous information is changed, c) he makes corrections to the VAT rate and the tax liability in accordance with § 49 of Act No. 235/2004.
A taxable person can file a supplementary VAT return if the sum of the corrections reduces the tax liability.
The taxpayer must file the supplementary tax return by the end of the month following the month in which the relevant facts were established.
The sales tax declaration can be submitted electronically either via the Internet or by means of a data carrier.
Submission via the Internet can be made with or without a certified electronic signature.
If it is carried out without an electronic signature, it must also be submitted on data carriers.
The form for the VAT return contains separate lines indicating the value of intra-Community deliveries and purchases.
The value of purchased services must be stated in separate lines of the VAT return.
Some sections are used for automated primary controls as part of the ATIS system.
The value of goods delivered to other EC Member States to persons registered there as taxable persons is compared with the data provided by Czech taxpayers in their Summary Reports.
The value of purchases of goods from other Member States from persons registered there as taxable persons is compared, with the help of MIAS, with the information provided in the summary declarations of taxable persons from other EC Member States.
As part of the ATIS system, the FA carries out a credibility check of the VAT returns.
This is done automatically, as the VAT return cannot be processed without the prior check.
The credibility check includes a calculation of the criteria for credibility and an assessment of the risks of VAT returns.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 37 (1) of Act No. 337/1992, the FA may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 million on persons who fail to comply with their non-monetary obligations under this or a special tax law or a decision under this Act.
Automated tax information system – Automated tax information system used by Czech tax offices to provide technical support for tax collection.
During its examination, the NKÚ found that the FÄ rarely made use of the possibility of imposing a fine on the taxable person concerned in the event of non-delivery of the VAT return.
Filing and processing of VAT returns in Germany
In Germany, a distinction is made between monthly or quarterly VAT pre-registration and the annual VAT return.
Those taxpayers who are obliged to file VAT pre-registrations must nevertheless file an annual VAT return.
Even small business owners who are not obliged to pay VAT must file an annual VAT return.
Taxable persons are generally obliged to submit a pre-registration for value added tax by the 10th day after the end of the calendar quarter in which the value added tax arises (§ 18 (2) UStG).
However, if the VAT liability amounted to more than €6,136 in the previous year or if it is a newly founded company, the entrepreneur is obliged to submit monthly VAT pre-registrations at the latest by the 10th day after the end of the respective month.
The taxpayer can also decide to submit monthly VAT pre-registrations if he has been reimbursed an amount of €6,136 in the previous year (§ 18 (2a) UStG).
If the annual value added tax does not amount to more than 512 €, neither VAT pre-registrations nor VAT returns must be submitted.
A resulting VAT liability is payable 10 days after the end of the tax period.
A refund can lead to a more thorough audit by the financial administration.
(statutory) deadlines for the processing of VAT returns and for the refund of VAT overpayments do not exist.
In order to receive a timely refund, a security for the refund amount can be offered.
In principle, VAT returns, including refunds, must be processed quickly.
The German Value Added Tax Act allows an extension of these (delivery or payment) deadlines (§ 18 (6) UStG).
The extension of the deadline must be requested separately.
If it is granted, the VAT pre-registration and the corresponding payments may be made one month later. In the case of monthly notifications, however, a special advance payment must be made.
This payment will be offset against the VAT liability established for the pre-registration period in December.
If an error is discovered, the entrepreneur must submit a corrected VAT pre-registration.
There is no “supplementary” VAT return.
If the VAT return to be submitted by 31 May of the following year is once submitted to the tax office, the entrepreneur can no longer correct an incorrect VAT pre-registration, but only the incorrect annual VAT return.
Corrections to this VAT return to the advantage or disadvantage of the taxpayer are possible within four years after the end of the year in which the first VAT return was filed.
After this four-year period, a VAT return can usually only be corrected in cases of a frivolous tax reduction or tax evasion.
Taxpayers must file the VAT pre-registration electronically.
The FÄ can grant exceptions to this rule in order to avoid undue hardship.
The annual VAT return can be submitted either in paper form or via the Internet with or without certification.
If the submission is made without certification, the taxpayer must additionally submit the declaration on paper and with his personal signature.
If no VAT pre-registrations or declarations are submitted, the financial administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the turnover generated by the taxpayer6.
In the event of late delivery, the taxpayer may be subject to a late payment surcharge (up to 10% of the tax liability or up to an amount of € 25,000).
In an earlier examination, the BRH found that the FÄ often do not charge this late fee.
In the cases where the FÄ levied the late surcharges, the fixing of the amount was inconsistent and arbitrary.
The delay surcharge therefore fails to achieve its purpose of reducing the average delay, in particular when filing the annual VAT return.
The form of the VAT return contains separate lines for value information on intra-Community deliveries or purchases.
There are also separate lines for the purchase of services.
Non-taxable sales must be stated in a separate line of the VAT return.
The VAT returns submitted on paper must either be scanned or recorded electronically by specially designated personnel.
The data of electronically filed tax returns are directly available to the financial administration.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
After all data are collected electronically, they are subjected to a risk management procedure and a case selection is made on the basis of certain standards.
The VAT returns selected in this way must be checked by the responsible officer on the basis of the automatically generated audit notes (see 5.2).
Although the financial administration only has to make a rough estimate of the VAT liability, it still has to be as accurate as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, taxpayers must file their VAT returns no later than 25 days after the end of the tax period.
Depending on the turnover of the taxpayer, the tax period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
In Germany, taxpayers must file their pre-registrations no later than 10 days after the end of either the calendar quarter or the calendar month, depending on the amount of their tax liability in the previous year.
The annual VAT declaration must be submitted by 31 May of the following year at the latest.
The obligation to file an annual VAT return has several advantages and disadvantages:
+ After the end of the calendar year, the taxpayer can correct the errors in the monthly pre-registration by submitting a single VAT return;
– If the taxpayer corrects his information on intra-Community transactions, the correction cannot be attributed to a specific reporting period of the ZM;
– The federal states do not compare MIAS data on intra-Community purchases by German taxpayers until the annual VAT returns have usually been processed.
According to the registration (see 4.1.3), German entrepreneurs must submit a VAT return regardless of the amount of their turnover.
This levy obligation enables the German financial administration to verify compliance with the turnover ceiling for small entrepreneurs.
In addition, the responsible FA can compare the annual VAT declaration with the corresponding declarations for direct taxes and with the annual financial statements of the company concerned.
In the Czech Republic, the tax authorities can only check the amount of turnover on the basis of the submitted income tax return.
In contrast to the current regulations in the Czech Republic, German taxpayers are obliged to submit their VAT pre-registration electronically.
The introduction of the obligation to file a tax return electronically in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech financial administration.
Summary reports
Filing and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic
In accordance with the provisions of § 102 of Law No. 235/2004, an entrepreneur who delivers goods to a person registered in another Member State for tax purposes must submit corresponding summary notifications (hereinafter “ZM”).
The value of the delivered goods is always stated in the ZM in Czech currency, broken down according to the VAT ID no.7 of the individual taxable persons under which they are registered in the other Member State.
Information on services is not provided in the ZM.
Taxpayers with a calendar monthly or quarterly tax period must hand over the ZM to the local FA on the 25th day after the end of each quarter at the latest.
Incorrect data must be corrected in a correction ZM within 15 days after the error has been detected.
Incorrect data in the ZM is always replaced by the data from the correction ZM.
Similar to tax returns, taxpayers can also submit the ZM electronically.
If a taxable person does not surrender a ZM or amending ZM, although he is obliged to do so under Act No. 235/2004, the tax official must request him to surrender the relevant ZM, pointing out the consequences of the non-levy. In the event of non-fulfilment of non-monetary obligations, the tax official is entitled to repeatedly impose fines of up to CZK 2 million in accordance with Section 37 of Act No. 337/1992.
In its examination, the NKÚ found that the FÄ mostly did not use their power to impose fines on their defaulting taxpayers.
In particular, when handing over the ZM, taxpayers are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their obligations, as the failure to hand over a ZM does not affect the amount of their VAT liability.
According to § 102 (5) of Law No. 235/2004, the tax official is obliged to check the information in the ZM or Rectification ZM, to eliminate all ambiguities and to use the information to determine the tax liability.
In case of disagreement
8 of the information in the ZM with which The taxpayer corrects incorrect information in the ZM by submitting a correction ZM either on his own initiative or upon request.
The tax officer must correct the data on deliveries of goods to other Member States in the ATIS system if:
– the taxpayer does not prove the accuracy of the information reported in the ZM (or correction ZM) and therefore corrects it by submitting a correction ZM,
– the tax official has proved the inaccuracy of the information reported by the taxpayer in the ZM or Rectification ZM.
Corrections entered by the tax official, without a correction ZM being submitted by the taxpayer, do not replace the taxpayer's obligation to submit a correction ZM, but only lead to the correction of the data in the MIAS, so that they are up-to-date, complete and accurate.
The data from the CMs will be forwarded to the Member States concerned.
Only the national tax authority designated for cooperation with the other Member States in the field of VAT may transmit and receive this data.
This is the CLO (in the Czech Republic, this function is performed by the Department for International Administrative Assistance in the field of VAT in the Ministry of Finance). The CLO automatically receives the notification “O_MCTL” from the other Member States.
It contains all incorrect VAT ID numbers that were specified in the transmitted ZM lines.
If the incorrect VAT number is used in some of the transmitted lines of the ZM or the corrected ZM, an entry is made in the list of the incorrect VAT number.
The list contains a "Notice of doubt regarding VAT ID number".
The tax officer checks the data and enters the result of the check into the system.
When purchasing goods from another Member State, the taxable person must indicate this in his VAT return and enter the value of the purchase in the designated lines of the VAT return.
Selected cases of differences between the values of the purchases stated by the Czech taxpayer in his VAT return and the values for the delivery of goods specified by the supplier from the other Member State in his ZM will be forwarded by the CLO to the competent FA for inspection.
The clerks there have to examine the deviations.
Three different situations can then occur:
A) The value indicated by the Czech purchaser in the relevant sections of his VAT return is lower than the value of deliveries indicated by suppliers from other EC Member States.
In this case, the tax official checks the accuracy of the information.
B) The difference is zero.
This situation can result either from a change in the information within the EC (the foreign supplier corrects his ZM) or from a change in the information in the VAT return (the Czech taxpayer in the meantime submits a supplementary VAT return on his own initiative).
In this case, it is at the discretion of the tax officer to check the accuracy of the information in the VAT return anyway.
(c) The value of goods purchased from other Member States indicated by the Czech taxable person in his VAT return is higher than the value of their deliveries reported by the suppliers of the other EC Member States.
Here again, it is at the discretion of the tax officer to check the accuracy of the information.
After reviewing the differences and clarifying the reasons for their occurrence, the tax official enters the results of his review into ATIS.
These results will be forwarded to the CLO.
The number of transactions sent by the CLO for audit is shown in Graph No. 1 (source: Czech Ministry of Finance) for the individual quarters of 2005.
Graph 1 above shows that the number of cases submitted by the CLO to the FÄ for the individual quarters of 2005 has decreased.
The significant reduction in the number in the fourth quarter of 2005 is partly due to the fact that the Czech CLO has raised the threshold for case selection, taking into account the minimum amount limit for a request for information to the other EC Member States.
Deviations between the information in the VAT returns and the data from the EC do not always have to be based on an error by the domestic purchaser.
There may also be an error by the taxpayer in another Member State or an error caused by the fact that certain types of supplies are indicated differently in the CMs in the different EC Member States.
The most common reasons identified in the audited cases for deviations in the value of reported transactions are shown in Table 1.
Submission and processing of summary reports in Germany
Entrepreneurs who make intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EC Member States or participate in triangular transactions must submit quarterly ZMs in which the intra-Community deliveries are listed by purchaser (§ 18a (1) UStG).
The ZM must be submitted no later than the 10th day of the month following the calendar quarter in question.
If a long-term extension is granted for the submission of VAT pre-registrations, this also applies to the ZM.
The ZM must be handed over to the CLO.
Electronic submission has been mandatory since 1 January 2007.
The competent FA can allow exemptions for individual taxpayers in order to avoid undue hardship.
If the taxpayer finds that the ZM was faulty, he is obliged to submit a correction ZM within one month.
In case of non-delivery of the ZM, the CLO initiates an enforcement procedure.
This includes the following steps: – first reminder – second reminder, combined with the threat that a penalty will be imposed and – fixing the penalty.
Although the German tax code allows the fixing of a penalty payment of up to 25,000 € (§ 329 AO), the CLO sets penalty payments of 125, 250 and 500 € in three stages.
In addition, § 26a (1) No. 5 UStG stipulates that the taxpayer acts improperly if he intentionally or recklessly does not deliver a ZM correctly, not completely or not in time or if he does not correct a ZM or not in time.
This violation is punishable by a fine of up to €5,000.
Data on intra-Community deliveries cannot be entered by the FÄ into the MIAS, because the CLO is exclusively responsible for processing the ZM.
The data of the ZM are only stored at the CLO.
The data from the summary reports are only available to the FÄ after they have been processed by the CLO.
The deadlines for processing ZM are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
The ZM data must be stored within three months of the calendar quarter in question (in MIAS).
In the case of incorrect VAT number in the ZM of German taxpayers, the German CLO receives a notification "O_MCTL" from the other Member State.
The CLO then turns to the entrepreneur and requests the right data.
If the CLO fails to obtain the correct information, the case will be handed over to the relevant FA.
It is then their task to request the correct information.
In the course of its audit, the BRH found that most entrepreneurs corrected the VAT number at the request of the CLO.
However, the reminder and the threat and fixing of up to three consecutive penalties takes too much time when a taxpayer may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud.
The cases that were ultimately reported to the competent authorities were usually closed within one to two months.
The competent FA refused tax exemption for notified intra-Community deliveries in 73% of these cases9.
If the taxpayer submitted the correct VAT number, the FA asked him to submit a corrected ZM to the CLO, because the FÄ cannot correct the MIAS data themselves.
The BRH found that neither the FÄ nor the CLO controlled the delivery of the corrected ZM.
Therefore, the taxpayers often did not comply with the request. Since the CLO does not have access to the data of the VAT returns, the information on goods deliveries made in the VAT declarations or the VAT return is not compared with the corresponding information in the ZM before this data is forwarded to the CLO of the other Member States.
This comparison can only be carried out by the FÄ. This is usually done during the preparation of a special VAT audit.
Data received from other Member States will be processed by the CLO.
Incorrect VAT numbers are detected and reported to the Member States concerned.
The data is used for the control of employment taxation in the FÄ.
As soon as they are available in the system, it compares the CLO with the data of previous calendar quarters.
If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control notifications are drawn up and sent to the relevant departments.
This is done on an ongoing basis, whereas a list of the acquisition data of all VAT taxable persons is compiled later and forwarded to the FÄ.
The risk management system (RMS) for the assessment procedure then compares this data with those relating to intra-Community purchases.
The system fully verifies (only) those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct input tax.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, taxable persons who have made intra-Community deliveries to a person registered for VAT in another Member State must submit a ZM to the local FA within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter.
The FÄ process the ZM and forward the data to the CLO.
The values of intra-Community supplies reported by the taxable persons in the CMs are compared with the values of intra-Community supplies indicated by the same taxable persons in their VAT returns.
The results of the comparison are taken into account as part of the tax determination.
In Germany, taxable persons who have made intra-Community deliveries are obliged to submit quarterly ZM within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter10.
Since 1 January 2007, taxpayers have been required to submit the ZM electronically to the CLO.
The FÄ only have access to the data from the ZM after it has been processed by the CLO.
In both the Czech Republic and Germany, taxable persons only indicate the delivery of goods in the ZM.
The provision of services is not specified in the ZM. Unlike the Czech FÄ, the German FÄ cannot correct incorrect information in individual lines of the submitted ZM themselves.
Due to this limited access to the German MIAS data, incorrect VAT ID numbers were not corrected even if the taxpayer communicated the correct VAT ID number to the FA.
The German tax administration does not compare the information on intra-Community deliveries made by German taxable persons in their VAT declarations with the information provided by the corresponding ZM.
Differences between the pre-registration data and the ZM are regularly not revealed before the German CLO forwards the MIAS data to other Member States.
Based on these findings of the BRH, it is obvious that a comparison would improve the reliability of the transmitted MIAS data.
The data provided by other Member States on deliveries of goods to Czech taxpayers will be compared in the Czech Republic with the data on purchases of goods provided by Czech taxpayers in their VAT returns.
The Czech CLO carries out the comparison separately for each calendar quarter.
The most serious cases of deviations are forwarded to the FÄ for examination.
Unlike the Czech financial administration, the German financial administration does not generally examine the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.
Such general control is only carried out in the case of taxable persons who are not fully entitled to deduct input tax.
In addition, the German tax administration only controls the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other taxable persons if the RMS has drawn up an audit report or if the taxable person has been selected for an audit anyway.
This procedure relieves the FÄ from clarifying the reasons for differences arising.
On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
In order to combat carousel fraud, updated information on intra-Community purchases must be available as early as possible.
The current system of the ZM, in particular MIAS, provides the financial authorities with information that may well be half a year old.
This delay could be reduced to up to four months if taxpayers had to hand over monthly ZM.
The monthly levy would only marginally increase the bureaucratic burden, since most taxpayers in the Czech Republic and Germany are obliged to submit monthly VAT returns or pre-registration anyway, and no more information is required for the ZM than for the VAT returns or pre-registration.
In order to avoid bureaucracy, the submission of the ZM could be combined with the submission of VAT returns or pre-registration.
An obligation to provide monthly CMs would, however, cause more periodic discrepancies between the information on intra-Community supplies and those on intra-Community purchases, and would increase data flows between CLOs.
In 2006, the federal government considered the general introduction of monthly ZM.
The implementation failed due to the concerns of the federal states.
They feared that a monthly transfer of MIAS data to the CLO of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In order for the obligation for the monthly levy of ZM to be effective, it is necessary to agree on the uniform monthly levy at European level, so that a monthly update of the MIAS data is possible.
Statistical information on goods deliveries and purchases between the Czech Republic and Germany
In foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the Czech Republic.
The total turnover of intra-Community trade in goods between the Czech Republic and Germany is shown in Table 2.
Both courts of auditors requested data on the number of incorrect tax numbers or VAT ID numbers in the O_MCTL reports exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany for the individual audited quarters.
These data can be found in the following tables.
They have significant differences.
The reason for the differences can be a different calculation basis for the number of O_MCTL messages.
While the Czech CLO refers the numbers to the calendar quarter for which the ZM was submitted, the German CLO refers its numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O_MCTL message was received.
International exchange of information at level 3
Implementation of the international exchange of information in the Czech Republic
The international exchange of information allows tax officials to obtain information from other Member States on intra-Community transactions and on the taxpayers who have carried them out.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on mutual assistance in the field of VAT, repealing Directive (EEC) No 218/92 (hereinafter “Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003”), distinguishes between two basic types of exchange of information: the exchange of information on request and the spontaneous exchange of information (without prior request).
The international exchange of information on request takes place by means of a request for information (RFI) using the standardised SCAC form.
Tax officials in the Czech Republic send their RFI or their responses to a received RFI through the Financial Directorate to the CLO, which ensures that the information provided in the standardised SCAC form is translated into the foreign language and forwarded to the other Member States.
In addition, the CLO receives requests for information (RFI) from other Member States and replies to requests sent. It ensures their translation into Czech and their distribution to the competent authorities for processing.
Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 sets a maximum period of three months from receipt of the request for its processing.
All RFIs exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany during the audited period were audited by NKÚ.
Out of the total of 94 RFIs received from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were processed within the three-month period; in a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) this processing period was exceeded.
In the remaining one case, no reply had been sent to Germany pending examination by the NKÚ. More detailed information on the time limits within which requests submitted by Germany were answered by the Czech Republic can be found in Figure 2.
The total of 335 requests for information (RFI) sent to Germany from the Czech Republic resulted in a reply within the three-month period in 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%); a further 179 (i.e. 53.4%) were processed after expiry of this period and, in 19 cases, no reply had been received from Germany at the time of the examination by the NKÚ (in the remaining one case, it was not possible to determine when Germany responded to the request for information on the basis of the declared information).
More detailed information on the deadlines within which the requests for information from the Czech Republic from Germany were answered can be found in Graph No. 3.
The percentages of intra-Community turnover stated in the requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in Graph No. 4.
The graph above shows that the sales examined in connection with requests for information usually had values of more than €60,000.
The international exchange of information without prior request takes place either automatically, structured automatically or in the form of spontaneous information.
The tax officials of other Member States are often provided with information without prior request, which is important for determining the VAT liability.
In the Czech Republic, all information is collected at the CLO.
The exchange of information between the individual Member States takes place electronically.
“automatic exchange” in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 means the systematic transmission of pre-defined information to other Member States at regular, pre-determined intervals without prior request.
“structured automatic exchange” means the systematic transfer of previously defined information to another Member State, without its prior request, as soon as the relevant information is available.
The Czech Republic shall inform the other Member States in the automatic exchange of information on deliveries of new vehicles.
The tax officer obtains this information from the form notification of the delivery of a new vehicle in accordance with § 19 of Act No. 235/2004 as well as from the copy of the invoice issued.
When processing this form, the tax officer enters the required data into the corresponding document template and forwards it directly to the responsible employee of the Financial Directorate, where this data is collected and sent to the CLO for further processing. Afterwards, this data is transmitted to the other Member States within the specified period, namely no later than two months after the end of the quarter in which it was obtained.
The Czech Republic also transmits information to the other Member States on mail order transactions that are tax-free in the country of origin, on intra-Community transactions that appear to be inadmissible and on potential “missing traders”.
This information is transmitted to the other Member States by means of a SCAC form in a spontaneous exchange of information.
Implementation of the international exchange of information in Germany
In Germany, the initiative for requests for information and spontaneous exchange of information comes from the locally responsible FA.
The FÄ send the completed form SCAC 2004 by e-mail directly to the German CLO, which forwards the SCAC forms to the foreign CLO.
The FÄ are instructed to write their requests for information or spontaneous information only in German, even the SCAC form used is monolingual.
Half of the German requests for information examined by the BRH were sent to ensure employment taxation in the other Member State or to prove the tax exemption of intra-Community deliveries from Germany to the other Member State.
If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it checks whether the value of the deliveries mentioned in the request exceeds the minimum amount limit of €15,000.
If there is no adequate justification for the request, the German CLO refuses to provide information regarding a turnover that is below the minimum amount limit.
In addition, the German CLO provides the translation of the freely formulated texts in SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)] if they are neither in German nor in English.
To answer the request for information, the CLO forwards it to the responsible FA and refers to the three-month period.
No further deadlines have been set at the various levels of the German financial administration.
Although the German CLO has the technical means to monitor compliance with the deadline, it does not have the necessary personnel capacity to remind the FÄ of the answer to the unfinished requests for information.
The FÄ receive the required information by letter from the taxable person or by carrying out an external audit.
The external auditors usually choose between two forms of audit: the VAT special audit, which covers all taxable transactions within a period of several months, or the so-called VAT review, which may only refer to a recent transaction.
This short and flexible form of audit does not require an announcement to the taxpayer and has proven itself in the investigation of an individual turnover.
In the case of automatic exchange of information, Germany will provide the other Member State with the following information: – on the VAT number allocated to companies established in other EC Member States – on the refund of input tax to entrepreneurs established in other EC Member States.
In addition, Germany has undertaken to provide the following information to the other EC Member States as part of the structured automatic exchange of information:
A. The delivery of new vehicles to entrepreneurs without a VAT number, b. distance sales (mail order) to other EC Member States that are not subject to VAT in Germany, c. Significant differences between the purchases reported by a taxable person and the MIAS data transmitted by other Member States, d. intra-Community deliveries of goods that have been incorrectly subject to taxation by the taxpayer in Germany, e. potential "missing traders" who have made intra-Community transactions, regardless of whether their VAT number is still valid or has already been deleted, and f. taxable persons who have made intra-Community deliveries to potential "missing traders" or to customers who have misused a VAT number.
Comparison and evaluation
Requests for information or spontaneous information are sent both in the Czech Republic and in Germany on the initiative of the locally responsible FÄ, who send the corresponding SCAC forms to the CLO.
While the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCAC forms (Czech-English) and translates given information into English or German, the German FÄ follow the instruction to write requests for information or spontaneous information on a monolingual form only in German.
The German CLO does not produce translations of German texts.
When examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany in the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005, the NKÚ found that the Czech financial administration dealt with 74.5% of the requests for information received within the three-month period, while the requests for information addressed to Germany were dealt with by the German financial administration only in 40.6% of cases within this period.
Although the German CLO refers the FÄ to the three-month deadline, it does not monitor its compliance.
Due to the lack of reminders, there is a high proportion of time-limited requests for information.
The BRH has therefore recommended a continuous reminder procedure to the German CLO.
The situation has now changed.
According to the information available to us, the German CLO is now reminding the tax offices to reply to the outstanding requests for information.
VAT risk management
Risk management in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, several organisational units at various levels of financial administration are involved in risk management in the area of value added tax.
Within the Czech Ministry of Finance, the following organisational units are responsible for risk management and combating VAT fraud:
The Department of Methodology and Economic Management of Value Added Tax and its Risk Management Unit deals with the identification of potential risk areas for tax revenue and evaluates the trends in these risks in domestic and intra-Community trade.
At the national level, this body coordinates the requirements for the criterion "credibility of VAT returns" and uses the MIAS data to detect possible tax evasion in the context of intra-Community deliveries and purchases.
Based on data on the Czech Republic's trade balance, it evaluates high-risk goods, prepares the concept of risk management in the field of VAT and cooperates in this field with the relevant EC institutions and the other Member States.
The department for international administrative assistance in the field of VAT ensures, among other things, the exchange of information, participates in the creation and maintenance of a relevant information database, evaluates the data of other Member States available in the MIAS system, carries out public relations work and is responsible for other forms of intergovernmental administrative assistance within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003.

Among other things, the Department of Methodology of Tax Audit and Tax Investigation carries out risk analyses as part of the methodological management of tax audits, sets priorities for the work planning of the financial directorates with regard to the selection of cases to be examined, prepares risk analyses to combat tax evasion and, in this context, collects information from the financial administration and other sources and makes proposals for measures to combat tax evasion.
Their tasks include searching for taxable persons and industries that are risky with regard to the frequency of tax evasion (e.g. Internet transactions, gold, the pharmaceutical industry), searching for non-registered taxable persons (e.g. in the sectors of Internet services, employment services, electronic and print media, etc.), investigating entanglements in cases of chain fraud and informing the local tax authorities.
Special examination units have been set up in 12 selected subjects.
These have regional competence and, on the basis of appropriate authorisation, also carry out tax audits outside the FÄ's local area of competence.
The need to set up the special audit units arose from the increase in identified new and “improved” forms of tax evasion, particularly in connection with chain transactions.
These special units audit according to the needs of the tax investigation agencies or focus on taxable persons with certain activities, multinational companies and taxable persons with a particularly high turnover.
The following mechanisms for reducing VAT risks have been integrated into the ATIS system: – the task of "credibility of VAT returns" to assess the riskiness of tax returns filed; – the task of "selection of taxable persons to be audited", whereby the taxable persons to be audited are selected on the basis of certain criteria; – the task of "MIAS", which gives tax officials access to the data provided by the other EC Member States.
The “MIAS” task allows, inter alia, the following: – Verification of the validity of the VAT number of taxable persons from other Member States; – Confirmation of the value of the goods delivered to a Czech taxable person as indicated in the ZMs by all suppliers of the taxable person concerned from other Member States; – Preparation of a list of taxable persons who have not submitted ZMs; – Formal control of the information provided by taxable persons in the Czech Republic in their ZMs before this information is transmitted to other Member States; – Preparation of a list of taxable persons in whose VAT returns the information on deliveries of goods to other Member States do not correspond with the information in the ZMs; – Preparation of a list of taxable persons in whose VAT returns the information on the value of the goods purchased from other Member States do not correspond with the information in the ZMs of all their suppliers from other Member States13.
As part of their duties to combat tax evasion, tax officials have access to data from public authorities such as commercial registers, land registers, motor vehicle registers, trade registers, etc.
More detailed information can be found in Section 4.4.1 Submission and processing of summary notifications in the Czech Republic.
Risk management in Germany
Due to their federal structure in the Federal Republic of Germany, both the federal financial authorities (in particular the CLO) and the financial administrations of the 16 federal states are involved in the development and introduction of an RMS.
Although there are joint working groups for development, neither the CLO nor the financial administrations of the federal states have a completely uniform database.
At the level of the CLO, Unit ST I 2 (hereinafter “Kiss” – Coordination Office for Special Sales Tax Audits and Tax Investigation Measures) collects the audit findings on cases of fraud in the OPUS database.
In cooperation with the countries, another database called ZAUBER has been set up at KUSS. There, the tax offices can enter the names of discovered missing traders or VAT fraudsters and also query them.
KUSS coordinates related cases of VAT fraud at national level as well as cases of cross-border VAT fraud.
The experiences of the KUSS are brought into the development of the RMS through their participation in the working groups.
Experts from several other organisational units of the CLO and the BMF are also involved.
The formal review of the composition of the VAT number of other Member States appearing in the CMs of German taxpayers is carried out at the CLO.
This formal review takes place prior to the transmission of the ZM to other Member States in order to improve the reliability of the MIAS data and thus its usefulness (see 4.4.2).
The examination of the validity of the VAT number mentioned in the ZM is carried out on the basis of the O_MCTL identifiers transmitted by the other Member States (for the procedure for correcting invalid VAT numbers, see also 4.4.2).
In addition, the RMS of the CLO is based on the MIAS data transmitted by the other Member States and generates various types of notifications for the discovery of suspected missing traders. As clues, certain characteristics are used, which usually occur in carousel transactions.
The departments of the federal states are instructed to process these communications and must forward the results of their investigations to the CLO in certain cases.
The BRH audit confirmed that all available characteristics must be taken into account in order to be sufficiently likely to conclude a case of tax fraud (rather than focusing mainly on a company's turnover).
Accordingly, the BRH has recommended that the BMF work with combinations of various clues when preparing the communications.
The risk management system should also take into account other indications, e.g. the payment behaviour of the taxpayer, the economic sector or the shareholding structure of the company.
A second level of risk management exists in the financial administrations of the federal states and focuses on the processing of VAT pre-registrations and annual returns.
For example, the system draws up a list of taxable persons who have indicated intra-Community supplies in their VAT pre-registration or annual declaration.
This list is sent to the CLO for the purpose of monitoring the complete delivery of the ZM.
Furthermore, in this type of risk management, the purchases indicated by the taxpayer in his annual VAT return are compared with the data in the MIAS.
The tax administrations of the federal states avoid a comparison of the quarterly data, as this would result in too many discrepancies due to factors other than tax evasion or tax fraud; e.g.:
– Supplier and purchaser assume different dates for the execution of the intra-Community turnover;
– different accounting recording and tax declaration of discounts and discounts.
In addition to comparing the information from the sales tax returns with the MIAS data, many federal states have certain risk management mechanisms that are based on information in the sales tax returns and certain other indications (e.g. company wording, age of the owner/partner, number of employees and method of payment of the taxpayer).
Bavaria has introduced a risk management system based on fixed rules that allows a team of specialists in the fight against tax fraud (hereinafter referred to as “risk managers”) to program their own rules in such a way that suspected tax cheats are filtered out.
This system is used in the processing of VAT pre-registration by the FÄ.
As a result, the responsible FA receives the information from the RMS before the VAT is set.
Since this system is not capable of learning, the risk managers have to adapt the rules according to the feedback from the FÄ.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has developed an adaptive neural network based on the data of detected evasion cases.
Based on this data, the RMS is able to learn the characteristics of tax evasion.
The system draws up a monthly list of tax cases where there is evidence of tax evasion.
On the basis of this list, the competent tax authorities decide on the examination of the taxable persons concerned.
After the audit, the tax auditors must report their results so that the RMS can learn from the results of the audits it proposes.
In North Rhine-Westphalia, an adaptive neural network is used in combination with a rule-based fuzzy system.
Based on a lot of data from processed sales tax returns and some other clues, this neuro-fuzzy system (also called data-mining system) calculates how likely a taxpayer is to be involved in tax fraud.
It then draws up a monthly list of suspected tax cheats.
On the basis of this list, the FÄ select the relevant taxable persons for examination and report the examination results to the relevant data centre.
The introduction of these three RMS is underway in the federal states.
Since each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three anti-fraud systems appears to be effective.
Whether the hoped-for effects will occur during actual use remains to be seen.
Comparison and evaluation
Although it is not possible in this report to deal with the specific criteria of the RMS in the Czech Republic and Germany, the NKÚ and the BRH have established that each Member State has developed its own RMS.
Just like the different approaches in the three German federal states mentioned above, the RMS of each European state has its particular strengths and weaknesses.
An exchange of experience is currently taking place between the financial authorities of the European Member States on new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.
VAT fraud – in particular carousel fraud – has proved to be not a national but a European problem.
The people involved in fraud coordinate their actions not only in one but in several Member States.
One Member State alone cannot develop an effective RMS.
Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each EC Member State. If this does not happen, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS for their crimes.
The tax losses caused by Europe-wide VAT fraud do not necessarily affect the Member State in which the initiator is based.
Any other Member State involved in the fraud may be affected.
That is why there should be a European exchange of experience on the RMS.
Selected results from the audit of individual sales As part of the parallel audits, the NKÚ and the BRH examined the quality and usability of information on selected deliveries, respectively.
Which were the subject of the international exchange of information between the financial administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.
In addition, the two courts of auditors jointly examined the processing of several deliveries, about the implementation of which there were doubts, or which the taxpayers of both states explained differently in the tax returns or ZM.
At the request of the BRH, the NKÚ examined a total of eight transactions between eight Czech and eight German taxpayers.
In addition, in 43 cases, based on notifications from the BRH, the NKÚ examined the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany that Czech taxpayers had indicated in their tax returns and ZM.
At the request of the NKÚ, the BRH checked a total of 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech taxpayers.
The relevant information was exchanged exclusively on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 on the CLO.
The examination of the selected cases showed, inter alia, that the different registration procedures in the EC Member States lead to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:
1.
According to the MIAS data, a Czech taxpayer purchased goods worth €60,500 from a German taxpayer in the third quarter of 2004.
When the Czech taxpayer declared a purchase of only €29,869, the Czech tax authorities sent a request for information to Germany in order to check the value of the delivered goods.
In its reply to the Czech request for information, the German side stated that the German taxpayer in question had delivered goods worth €27,381 to his Czech business partner in the second quarter of 2004, €31,997 in the third quarter and €10,276 in the fourth quarter.
Furthermore, it emerged from the answer that the VAT number of the German taxpayer was only valid from 28 September 2004. However, the German CLO had granted a further application by the German taxpayer and brought forward the validity of the VAT number retroactively to 1 May 2004.
The German taxpayer corrected the ZM.
On the basis of this information, it was an (intra-Community) purchase of goods by the Czech taxpayer.
Through a request to the competent tax office in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that in 2004 the Czech taxpayer had submitted supplementary VAT returns for the individual (sub-annual) tax periods in which he declared a higher value of the purchases from other Member States and at the same time sought the deduction of input tax from the purchases from the other Member States.
On the basis of these additional VAT returns, the responsible officer of the Czech tax office could not clearly determine whether the value of the deliveries of the above-mentioned German supplier was also included in the declared purchases.
In response to a request for information from the NKÚ, the BRH stated that the German supplier had been registered as subject to VAT in September 2003.
However, he had not applied for the allocation of a VAT ID number at the time of registration, but only for a tax number that was ultimately valid for Germany.
Although it is generally not possible in Germany to retroactively allocate a VAT number to a taxable person, the responsible clerk of the German tax administration did so in 2006 with retroactive effect from 1 May 2004.
The German CLO assigns a VAT number retroactively if the German entrepreneur did not cause the delayed allocation; e.g. if the CLO caused the delay after the taxpayer's application for a VAT number.
In this case, the CLO issues the VAT number retroactively because, according to § 6 UStG, the entrepreneur does not need a valid VAT number for an intra-Community delivery.
Conversely, a German buyer does not need the (valid) VAT number of his supplier to declare the intra-Community purchase.
Because of these procedural differences between the Member States, the German CLO issued the VAT number retroactively in this particular case.
2.
As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech tax official requested a review of the VAT registration of the German entrepreneur.
From the MIAS data, the date of registration is 5 March 2005, while a registration certificate issued by the locally competent German FA indicates 1 October 2004.
In their reply, the German authorities stated that the German taxpayer had been registered on 1 October 2004, but for organisational reasons had only been allocated a VAT number in Germany on 16 February 2005.
Through a request to the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ learned that the tax official had carried out a VAT audit on the Czech taxpayer for the tax periods from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.
During this audit, the tax office found that the Czech taxpayer had declared services worth CZK 9,897 in his VAT return which he had rendered to the German taxpayer prior to his VAT registration (i.e. before 1 October 2004).
The (Czech) tax office fixed a tax liability of CZK 1,880 to the Czech taxpayer for the third quarter of 2004.
In response to the request from the NKÚ, the BRH found that the VAT number had only been allocated to the German taxpayer when he registered his company founded in 2004 with the FA on 16 February 2005.
In addition, the FA registered it retroactively from 1 October 200415 for VAT purposes in order to be able to monitor the filing of the VAT return for 2004.
In this VAT return, the taxable person reported intra-Community purchases from the Czech Republic to the value of € 160 (approx. CZK 5,000).
3. In his VAT return for September 2004 and in his ZM for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech taxable person reported deliveries of goods worth CZK 114,615 to a German taxable person.
When checking the registration of the German taxpayer in the MIAS system, the Czech tax official found that this registration was only valid from 11 November 2004 and thus after the delivery of goods to Germany.
The Czech taxpayer filed a supplementary VAT return in which he declared sales from domestic deliveries to the value of CZK 114,615 and value added tax of CZK 21,777, which he paid.
Through a request to the locally competent FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxable person subsequently filed an application for the resumption of tax proceedings in respect of the supplementary VAT return. As evidence, he submitted a confirmation from the German tax administration that the German taxable person had been registered since 1 January 2000.
Accordingly, the Czech tax official checked the validity of the registration of the German taxpayer in the context of the international exchange of information.
The German information revealed that the German taxpayer had only been assigned a VAT number on 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods.
As a result, the Czech tax official rejected the request to reopen the tax proceedings.
The BRH stated that in this case no intra-Community purchase of goods had taken place because the German taxpayer had only received a VAT number on 11 November 2004.
However, the German recipient declared both the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and the value added tax on it and also demanded the reimbursement of input taxes in the same amount.
Because this did not lead to a change in the amount of the German taxpayer's tax liability, the German tax official did not correct the information in the VAT return.
Furthermore, the BRH found that the company of the German taxpayer named in the request for information was changed during the processing of the response in Germany, which led to confusion between two German taxpayers.
This change in the name of the German taxpayer also confused the Czech tax official.
4.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax official reviewed the purchase of goods in the first quarter of 2005 by a Czech taxable person from a German taxable person to the value of €22,686.
Through a request to the local competent tax officer in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ established that the Czech tax official had examined, as part of an external audit with the Czech taxpayer, whether the intra-Community delivery had actually taken place and whether the Czech taxpayer had booked and paid the invoice for the delivery of the goods.
The Czech taxpayer did not declare the intra-Community acquisition in his VAT return, because the German supplier did not state his VAT number in the invoice, but only his tax number intended for transactions within Germany.
According to the MIAS data, the German taxable person is not registered for VAT in connection with intra-Community transactions until 21 April 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech taxable person.
The Czech tax official also requested that the German tax administration send a copy of the German taxpayer's registration certificate so that he could, if necessary, initiate appropriate tax proceedings.
The Czech FA regarded this business as the purchase of goods from a non-entrepreneurial (private) person in Germany and therefore did not set a value added tax for the purchase of goods from Germany.
The BRH stated that under German law, a taxable person who delivers goods to other Member States does not have to have a VAT number for intra-Community deliveries in order to be able to claim the VAT exemption for such a delivery.
The supplier must only have the purchaser's VAT number in the other Member State and be able to prove the transport of the goods in question to the other Member State.
In this case, the turnover under German tax law is a (tax-exempt) intra-Community delivery, which should be subject to purchase taxation in the Czech Republic.
In any case, it is important that the Czech tax official took note of this transaction, because the delivery of a machine of this value was not part of the core business of the German supplier.
As described in Section 4.6.2, the German CLO rejects requests for information on intra-Community transactions if they are below the minimum limit of € 15,000: 5.
According to the MIAS data, a Czech taxable person purchased goods worth €12,561 from a German taxable person in the third quarter of 2004.
The Czech tax official carried out an audit for this tax period.
Within the framework of intergovernmental administrative assistance, the Czech financial administration requested the examination of this delivery of goods by means of a SCAC form.
The Czech taxpayer stated that he had not received the goods, had never had a business relationship with the German company and that the purchase of the goods in question had not been recorded with him.
The German financial administration rejected the request for the transmission of documents – contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents – because the turnover was less than €15,000 and no other justification had been given.
Since the Czech tax official did not receive any documentation for subsequent taxation of the purchased goods, the tax audit was inconclusive and the original tax determination stood.
In response to a request from the NKÚ, the BRH determined that the German taxpayer acted as “fiscal representative17” (§ 22 (a) – (e) UStG).
The German taxpayer declared these deliveries in his VAT return and in the ZM.
His right to tax exemption was recognised.
On the basis of the notification by the BRH, the German FA will send the documents required for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods to the Czech Republic.
In Section 4.6.1 it was shown that the answers of the German financial administration to requests for information exceeded the three-month period more often than the answers of the Czech financial administration:
6. During its examination, the NKÚ found that on 5 October 2005 the Czech financial administration had submitted a request for information on the value of goods delivered to Germany in the fourth quarter of 2004.
In the ZM for this quarter, the German taxable person had reported a delivery of goods to the Czech taxable person to the value of €86,307; however, the Czech taxable person only declared the purchase of goods to the value of €35,314 in his VAT return for the same period.
In response to the request for information received by the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, i.e. after expiry of the maximum processing period specified in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German side stated that the request for information could not be processed since the German company had been dissolved at the end of 2005.
Because the German tax administration did not meet the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech tax administration did not have the documents necessary for taxation in the Czech Republic.
7. In 2005, a Czech tax official, using a SCAC form, requested a review of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German taxpayer worth €1,265,554 in the third and fourth quarters of 2004, with evidence of carousel fraud.
The NKÚ noted that at the time of its examination a German reply to the request for information had not yet been received.
Through a request to the local tax official, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxable person had not declared the delivery of new motor vehicles to this German taxable person to the value of CZK 11,816,103 in his VAT return.
The Czech tax official corrected the information in the tax return and the Czech taxpayer submitted a corrected ZM.
Due to technical problems, the German CLO did not forward this request for information to the local FA for examination.
Following the notification by the BRH, a special VAT audit was carried out on the German purchaser in Germany. It was established that the purchase of all the motor vehicles in question had been correctly taxed and that the vehicles were resold to other taxable persons in Germany.
8. According to the MIAS data, the Czech taxpayer purchased a car worth €48,500 from a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004.
However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.
By contacting the local tax officer in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer had not filed a VAT return since August 2004.
Even at the request of the tax official, the Czech taxpayer did not file any tax returns. As a result, on 23 May 2005, the FA set the VAT liability for the period October to December 2004 at zero.
On 2 June 2005, the CLO issued an instruction for the examination of the aforementioned delivery from the German taxpayer.
Since the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the tax official, he sent a request for information on the above-mentioned delivery to Germany.
Since the reply to the request for information was not received until 7 February 2007, until the conclusion of the NKÚ audit, it was not known how the Czech tax official used the information obtained in the international exchange of information.
Due to non-compliance with the obligations under the Czech VAT Act, the VAT registration of the Czech taxable person was deleted with effect from 23 August 2005.
In some cases, only a partial reply was sent because, at the time of the examination of the NKÚ and the BRH, the competent FA had not yet completed the external examination:
9.
In 2005, the Czech tax official, using an SCAC form, requested a review of a €16,991 delivery of motor vehicles to a German taxpayer in the third quarter of 2004, with evidence of carousel fraud.
In his reply to the request for information, the German tax official stated that he only had the invoices issued by the Czech taxpayer for deliveries to the value of €16,335.
On the basis of the NKÚ's request, the BRH found that the external audit carried out by the German FA on the purchaser in Germany had not yet been completed.
The German purchaser declared the purchase of goods worth €16,335 twice in its VAT pre-registrations for the months of August and September 2004.
10. In 2005, a Czech tax official, using an SCAC form, requested a review of deliveries of motor vehicles to a German taxpayer worth €198,167 in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, showing signs of carousel fraud.
The German tax administration sent a partial response to the request for information to the Czech Republic, in which it confirmed that the German taxpayer had purchased several motor vehicles and that the investigation in Germany had not yet been completed.
The NKÚ found that the local FA had carried out several external audits on the Czech taxpayer in order to verify the deduction of above-average input taxes.
However, an unjustified claim has not been established.
The BRH found that the German taxpayer had declared the purchase of goods from other Member States with a total value of €579,114 in his VAT returns for the relevant period, and that the examination of the German FA with the purchaser in Germany has not yet been completed.
Section 4.4.1 describes the reasons for discrepancies between the declaration of intra-Community purchases in the recipient's VAT return and the information in the supplier's ZM.
In the cases examined, it was found that periodic inconsistencies18 or the incorrect declaration of a turnover as an intra-Community supply of goods were not the most frequent reasons for the differences:
11.
According to data from MIAS, the Czech taxpayer purchased goods worth €35,716 from the German taxpayer in the first quarter of 2005, but the Czech taxpayer did not declare the acquisition.
Since the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the tax official and there was no business activity at the company's legal headquarters, the Czech tax official requested a review of how the German taxpayer had communicated with the Czech as part of the international exchange of information.
The German response to the request for information revealed that, according to the findings of the German tax authorities, the Czech taxpayer was unknown at the specified address and the goods were picked up by an agreed freight forwarder.
The total value of the order was €155,000, but the German taxpayer only delivered goods worth €21,659.
The Czech taxpayer sent the German taxpayer an incorrect payment confirmation for the amount of €155,153 in favour of the German taxpayer.
After uncovering the fraudulent behaviour of the Czech acquirer, the German taxpayer, with the support of his other Czech customers, managed to get back the delivered material, with the exception of a part worth €7,916.
Through a request to the locally competent FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that, on the basis of the information received from the Czech taxpayer, the financial administration subsequently taxed the turnover of goods deliveries from other Member States in the amount of CZK 388,522.
In response to a request from the NKÚ, the BRH confirmed that, after corrections, the German supplier had reported only one delivery of goods to the Czech taxpayer worth €7,916.
In accordance with German legislation, the German taxpayer declared the cancellation of the delivery and the reduction of the tax base in the quarter of the cancellation.
His ZM contained the following information concerning the Czech taxpayer:
12.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German financial administration requested a review of the delivery of goods and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005 by means of a SCAC form.
According to the request for information, during the period in question, the Czech taxpayer had supplied the German taxpayer with goods with a total value of €396,126 and provided services worth €11,885.
The NKÚ found that the Czech tax authorities had carried out an audit on the Czech taxpayer in order to investigate this delivery.
In response to the request for information, the Czech tax authorities announced that the Czech taxpayer had supplied and assembled a production plant for the German.
The Czech taxpayer supplied the individual parts of the production plant before the accession of the Czech Republic to the EC and the production plant was assembled on the basis of the order after 1 May 2004.
The German taxpayer did not remove the assembled production plant and claimed defects.
In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech taxpayer charged the German the production plant for €107,100 and €11,885 for services.
The German taxpayer received the invoices, but did not recognise them and did not pay them.
By contacting the local tax officer in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that all invoices had been properly recorded in the Czech taxpayer's books.
The VAT returns for the third quarter of 2005 contained only the amounts documented by the Czech taxpayer and related to invoices invoiced after 1 May 2004.
The BRH noted that, based on the response of the Czech financial administration, the locally competent FA came to the conclusion that these sales were a uniform (goods) delivery of the Czech taxpayer to the German, including the performed assembly.
In this particular case, the place of performance of this so-called factory delivery is the place where the production plant is assembled.
The German recipient of the work delivery owes the value added tax in accordance with the German Value Added Tax Act.
At the same time, the recipient can claim an input tax deduction of the same amount.
Since the VAT liability of the German taxpayer remained unchanged, the German FA did not initiate a correction of the VAT return.
13. According to MIAS data, Czech taxpayer A purchased a machine worth €58,000 from German taxpayer C in February 2005.
The Czech tax official sent a request to Germany to verify this information.
In response to the request for information, the German side announced that the German taxpayer C had delivered this machine to the Czech taxpayer B in 2004, but that he had returned it to the German taxpayer C in October 2004.
According to the German tax authorities, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but to the branch office of the German taxpayer C in the Czech Republic.
The reply to the request for information also revealed that the German taxpayer C had delivered the machine to the Czech taxpayer A in February 2005.
The latter received the machine at the headquarters of the German taxpayer's branch in the Czech Republic.
Since this delivery (from C to A) only took place within the Czech Republic, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods.
By contacting the local tax official responsible for taxable person B, the NKÚ established that, according to the MIAS data, German taxable person C had delivered goods (another machine) worth €88,027 to the Czech taxable person in the third quarter of 2004.
Taxable person B stated that he had not received these goods, so the local Czech tax official sent a request for information to Germany.
The answer was that the machine had been delivered.
In the course of further investigations with the taxpayer B, the tax official found that the machine worth €88,027 had not been registered with the taxpayer B and that it could be the same type of machine as the branch of the German taxpayer C had delivered to the Czech taxpayer A in February 2005.
The NKÚ also found that the Czech tax official locally responsible for taxable person A had carried out an audit on him.
The tax official had the invoice of the German taxable person C dated 7 February 2005, in which the taxable person A is indicated as the recipient of the machine.
The Czech tax official found that taxable person A had not recorded this invoice.
Taxable person A had entered into a leasing agreement with another Czech company whose object was a machine of the same type.
The leasing company delivered the machine on 9 February 2005 and also took care of the transport.
The Czech FA did not use the information provided in the reply to the request for information to determine the tax liability of taxable person A.
The BRH stated that the German taxpayer C had delivered the machine worth €88,027 not to the Czech Republic, but to another German taxpayer D.
Accordingly, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods, but a taxable delivery within Germany.
Consequently, the German tax official did not recognise the claim of the German taxpayer C to VAT exemption and corrected the information in his tax return.
The German taxpayer D delivered the machine to the Czech taxpayer B.
Under German law, this delivery was not taxable in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.
The BRH also noted that the German taxpayer C had indicated in his ZM for the first quarter of 2005 the delivery of a machine worth € 58,000 to the Czech taxpayer A.
This delivery was not checked during the tax audit carried out by the German FA.
The figure below shows the contractual relationships between the business partners involved in the above-mentioned transactions.
14.
When examining requests for information received, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax administration had received a request for information from Germany on 4 October 2005, in which a German tax official requested the verification of intra-Community deliveries by a German taxpayer worth € 879,680,625 to a Czech taxpayer.
The German tax official stated that there was a suspicion that this was a fictitious intra-Community supply of goods.
The German taxpayer has not carried out any active business activities since 1999.
The NKÚ found that the Czech tax official had carried out an external audit on the Czech taxpayer.
The head of the Czech company explained that this was probably a claim of the German taxpayer against the German financial administration, which the Czech taxpayer had asserted as a shareholder in the German company with the German FA.
According to the information provided to the NKÚ, the Czech tax official so far has no information that the German tax administration is handling the case in relation to the Czech taxpayer.
It is clear from the available information that this was not a delivery of goods; nevertheless, the amount in question is still stored in MIAS as an intra-Community delivery of goods from Germany to a Czech taxpayer.
The main reason for these discrepancies was the failure to state the intra-Community acquisition in the tax returns of the recipients (see also Section 4.4.1):
15. According to MIAS data, a German taxable person delivered goods with a total value of €33,205 to a Czech taxable person in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005.
However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare the intra-Community acquisition.
The Czech tax official requested an examination of the delivery of goods from Germany as part of the intergovernmental exchange of information.
In its reply to this request for information, the German side stated that the German taxable person had sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech taxable person and that he had collected the remaining goods in person.
By contacting the local Czech financial officer, the NKÚ established that the Czech taxpayer had submitted a supplementary VAT return for the relevant period before receiving a reply to the request for information.
Nevertheless, the differences regarding the values of the acquisitions could not be clarified, so the Czech tax official recommended a tax audit with the Czech taxpayer.
This test has not yet been carried out.
16. According to the MIAS data, a German taxable person had delivered goods worth €46,854 to a Czech taxable person in the third quarter of 2004.
For the same period, a Czech taxpayer declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only €14,856.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech tax official asked for verification of the actual value of the delivery.
With the German response to this request, three invoices were sent showing a total value of the delivered goods of € 31,999, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech taxpayer and the MIAS data.
By asking the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ found that, after receiving the reply from Germany, he had contacted the accountant of the Czech taxpayer and stayed with her in such a way that, after checking the invoices, she wanted to talk with the company owner about filing a supplementary VAT return for the third quarter of 2004.
Until now, no supplementary VAT return has been filed.
The Czech tax official informed the NKÚ that he would proceed in such a way as to meet the deadlines for a retroactive VAT determination for the relevant tax period.
17.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer delivered goods worth €11,600 to the German taxpayer.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the German tax official requested to check whether the aforementioned Czech taxpayer actually existed, since the alleged capital owner of the German taxpayer had founded a number of bogus companies in Germany.
In the course of the review of the transaction by the FA, the Czech taxpayer confirmed the purchase of the goods.
According to the Czech taxpayer, the goods were not delivered from Germany to the Czech Republic, but were resold in Germany in 2005.
The Czech taxpayer presented evidence of the sale in January 2005.
The Czech taxpayer was not registered as liable for VAT in Germany and had not paid tax on the sale of the goods in question either in the Czech Republic or in Germany.
All these facts pointed to tax evasion within Germany and the Czech tax official provided this information in his response to the request for information to the German tax authorities.
In a request to the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ found that, following a tax audit, the Czech taxpayer had filed a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004, in which he declared, among other things, the value of the goods he had purchased from a German taxpayer and, at the same time, asserted the right of deduction for purchases from other Member States.
In his Czech VAT return, he did not declare any VAT on the sale of goods in Germany.
On the basis of a supplementary VAT return submitted after the external audit, the Czech tax official fixed the VAT liability unchanged.
According to Czech legislation, there was no purchase of goods from other Member States in this case, as the goods were not shipped or transported to the Czech Republic from another Member State.
Thus, the Czech tax official drew the wrong conclusion during the external audit.
The BRH found that immediately after receiving the reply to the request for information, which showed that the goods had not left Germany, the German tax official corrected the tax return of the German taxpayer and demanded the payment of VAT to the value of €1,600.
In addition, the competent FA sent a control notification to the FA responsible for the actual recipient of the goods to ensure that the resale of these goods is properly taxed.
In the following cases, traders declared intra-Community deliveries which may not have been carried out:
18.
The Czech tax official received a request for information from the German tax authorities on the question of whether the Czech taxpayer had purchased a car worth €47,400 from the German taxpayer in February 2005.
A copy of the VAT registration certificate of the Czech taxpayer was attached to the request for information.
As a further attachment, a photocopy of the passport was attached to the person who was supposed to have transferred the vehicle.
In the course of his investigation, the Czech tax official found that the passport had been stolen, that the person named in it had not brought a vehicle into the Czech Republic and stated that he had had no contact with a German taxpayer.
The VAT registration certificate, a copy of which had been sent by the German side, had not been issued by the Czech tax authorities.
With this information, the Czech tax official answered the request for information and at the same time stated that he could not confirm the purchase of the car.
By contacting the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ established that the Czech taxpayer does not have his registered office at the address indicated in the commercial register and that the managing director of the company is not available.
Following a tax complaint procedure for the February 2005 tax period, the Czech tax official set the Czech taxpayer's tax liability at zero.
In the course of a further investigation, the Czech tax official found that the vehicle in question had been sold to another Czech person who had purchased it on the basis of an Internet advertisement.
The BRH found that the locally responsible German tax official had rejected the claim of the German taxpayer to exempt this delivery from VAT on the basis of the Czech response to the request for information.
19. In the course of an external audit, a German FA was unable to clarify a difference of € 3,000 between the value of the purchased goods stated in the VAT return and the reported values from other Member States.
A Czech taxpayer should have delivered goods worth €89,424 to a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005.
Since the acquisition declared by the German taxpayer did not correspond to the MIAS data, the German tax official requested verification of the deliveries and their payment as part of the intergovernmental exchange of information.
In his reply to the request for information, the Czech tax official stated that the sole managing director of the Czech company had been deleted from the commercial register on 8 July 2005 and that a new managing director had not yet been registered.
The German recipient of the goods was presumably a relative of the shareholder of the Czech company.
The Czech taxpayer filed a VAT return and a ZM which, after the deletion of the managing director, had been signed in the commercial register by a person not authorised to do so, namely this shareholder of the company.
The accountant of the Czech taxpayer informed the tax official that the capital owner had paid the payment received for the invoiced goods in euros into the company's account.
Cash receipts were not issued.
In a request to the locally competent Czech FA, the NKÚ stated that the tax official had recognised the Czech taxpayer's right to VAT exemption for deliveries of goods to other Member States worth CZK 1,326,307 in the first quarter of 2004 and CZK 1,416,180 in the first quarter of 2005.
The BRH found that the German tax official did not correct the VAT return of the German buyer, since in the meantime a German court had confirmed the insolvency of the German taxpayer.
Since the earlier external audit showed no signs of tax fraud, there was no prospect of actually being able to collect a fixed VAT liability.
20. According to the MIAS data, a German taxpayer purchased goods from the Czech Republic to the value of €4,251,196 in 2005, after having purchased goods to the value of €43,274 in the previous year.
The German taxpayer did not declare the intra-Community purchases in his VAT return for 2004 or in the one for 2005.
In addition, he did not declare corresponding initial sales in terms of value.
Due to these discrepancies, the German FA submitted a request for information regarding the fourth quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006.
In the ZM for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-Community deliveries of goods with a total value of CZK 167,246,083.
On 6 September 2006, the request for information was received, in which the German side requested to check whether the delivery reported by the Czech taxpayer had actually taken place.
In response to this request for information, the Czech financial administration stated that the German request could not be complied with because the Czech company did not have a managing director (or other legal representative).
From the documents provided to NKÚ by the competent tax officer, it is clear that, together with the managing director of the Czech taxpayer, a protocol was drawn up on 30 March 2006 on the start of the VAT audit for the fourth quarter of 2004 and the period from January to December 2005.
At the same time, the taxpayer was asked by the tax officer to submit all accounting and tax documents for this period, but failed to do so.
According to the commercial register, the term of office of the sole managing director expired on 16 May 2005 without a new managing director being appointed.
The Czech taxpayer has not filed any VAT returns since April 2006.
As part of the parallel investigation, the NKÚ, in cooperation with the BRH, investigated several cases of intra-Community deliveries between the Czech Republic and Germany that were not the subject of a prior exchange of information between the two countries.
The two courts of auditors exchanged information on the cases examined via the CLO of both countries.
21. A Czech company (UCR), which is not based in Germany, informed the competent FA (Chemnitz-Süd) that it wanted to conduct taxable business in Germany.
Based on this information, the company was registered in June 2005, but did not receive a German VAT number.
The (UCR) accepted an order from a Danish company (UDK) for the production of wind turbines and their delivery to Austria in the name, at the risk and for the account of the Danish customer.
Due to insufficient own production capacities, the Danish company passed on part of the contract to a German taxpayer (UDE) based in Germany.
The following figure shows the contractual relationships and the transport route of the wind turbines:
According to German law, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as described below:
– The Danish company (UDK) sent the wind turbines to Austria for installation on its behalf, at its own risk and for its own account.
Because of the installation, its delivery takes place in Austria, i.e. the delivery of the wind turbines is controllable in Austria.
– Because the freight forwarder was commissioned by the Danish company (UDK) and the latter had the transport carried out in its own name, at its own risk and for its own account, the place of delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE) is where the transport started, i.e. in Germany.
Although the wind turbines were delivered to another EC Member State (AU) and the recipient is registered as taxable in an EC Member State (CR), no tax exemption could be claimed for the delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE), as the EC Member State for which the delivery was intended is different from the home country of the Czech company19.
Accordingly, this delivery is duly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (UCR) claimed the input tax deduction in its VAT returns.
The place of delivery of the Czech company (UCR) also depends on the place where the transport started.
However, some of the wind turbines were transported from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.
– Delivery of wind turbines manufactured in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.
– The delivery of the remaining wind turbines manufactured in Germany took place in Germany.
Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) supplied both intra-Community supplies from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-Community supplies from Germany to Austria.
The BRH found that the Czech company (UCR) did not declare intra-Community deliveries either in its German tax returns or in its ZM delivered to the German CLO.
Thus, the Czech company may have treated all its intra-Community supplies uniformly as intra-Community supplies from the Czech Republic.
The NKÚ found that (UCR) did not report intra-Community deliveries to Austria, but intra-Community deliveries to Denmark.
Ensuring the taxation of intra-Community purchases in Austria would require the cooperation of at least four financial administrations (Austrian, Czech, Danish and German), although in this case there is no evidence of tax fraud or tax evasion.
In addition, the NKÚ and the BRH examined case designs in order to show the size of the differences caused by the different legislation of 2004 between the information in the VAT returns and the MIAS data.
The cases examined also show that it will take some time for taxpayers and tax authorities to apply the new legal provisions:
22. In his ZM for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2004, a Czech taxable person reported deliveries of goods with a total value of CZK 792,977,452 to a German taxable person.
During the same period, another Czech taxable person reported intra-Community deliveries in his ZM to another German taxable person with a total value of CZK 18,157,265.
The information provided by the BRH to the NKÚ revealed that electricity was supplied in both cases.
Both Czech taxpayers took into account the above-mentioned deliveries in their ZM in accordance with Czech Law No. 235/2004 in force in 2004.
In a further examination of these transactions, an audit group of the NKÚ found that different legal provisions on the supply or purchase of electrical energy were in force between the Czech Republic and Germany in 2004.
Whereas in the Czech Republic, taxable persons declared supplies of electrical energy as intra-Community deliveries of goods in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 235/2004 in force in 2004, according to the German legal provisions in force in 2004, this was not an intra-Community purchase of goods, but taxable and taxable transactions in Germany.
The differences in legal provisions were eliminated in the Czech Republic by the adoption of Act No. 635/2004, which amended some tax provisions with effect from 1 January 2005.
23. When examining intra-Community deliveries or purchases in cooperation with the BRH, it was further established that a Czech taxable person declared intra-Community deliveries in his ZM for the first and fourth quarters of 2005 to a German taxable person to the total value of CZK 240,411,163 and another Czech taxable person declared intra-Community deliveries in his ZM for the same period to another German taxable person to the value of CZK 263,470,776.
Information provided by the BRH to the NKÚ revealed that both cases involved supplies of electrical energy.
In accordance with the wording of Act No. 235/2004 applicable from 1 January 2005, the place of performance for the supply of electrical energy is the place where the purchaser has his legal domicile, his place of business or his place of business for which this delivery takes place.
Therefore, the Czech taxpayers should not have indicated the electricity supplies in their ZM for 2005.
The fact that both taxable persons treated the supply of electrical energy in their CMs as intra-Community supplies resulted in a difference of CZK 503,881,939 in MIAS.
Closing remarks
Through the cooperation, the goals of the BRH and the NKÚ were achieved.
Both courts of auditors gained in-depth knowledge of VAT administration systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The cooperation revealed differences in the two systems and in the legal provisions governing VAT administration.
During the parallel tests, interesting cases of intra-community deliveries or purchases came to light.
Some of them are worth further observation.
On the basis of the audit results, both courts of auditors drew up recommendations for the administration of value added tax.
The follow-up of these recommendations in the form of a control review should be part of further monitoring.
The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation between the two courts of auditors form the basis for the successful implementation of future audits in the field of VAT administration.

Public procurement of construction services and prevention of corruption
Joint report of the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on their parallel audits
Introduction and Overview
The award of services by public contracting authorities is of great importance both for the state and for the economy.
The state has the task of using public funds as economically and sparingly as possible, as well as ensuring fair and regulated competition.
In the European Union (EU), the award of services by contracting authorities is an important element in the creation of a single economic area.
In order to ensure largely unrestricted competition across borders, contracting authorities must comply with EU requirements when awarding contracts above certain value limits (thresholds).
To this end, EU member states must transpose and apply EU public procurement law into national law.
This has already happened in both the Czech Republic and Germany.
Below the EU thresholds, it is up to individual countries to regulate the award of public contracts themselves.
The provision of services is also an area at risk of corruption.
Due to the generally high potential for damage, contracting authorities must therefore take appropriate measures to prevent and prevent corruption and undue favours when awarding their contracts.
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed in January 2011 to carry out parallel audits both for the EU-wide award of construction services and for the prevention of corruption.
The audits focused on the application of the EU public procurement law implemented in national regulations as well as the prevention of corruption in the award of construction services in building construction, road construction and transport infrastructure.
Awards below the EU thresholds were also taken into consideration with a view to preventing corruption.
The audit results of both Courts of Auditors are summarised in this Joint Report.
The report should also be addressed to international institutions, such as the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).
Audit areas and audited bodies The evaluations of the Federal Audit Office on the listed topics are mainly based on cross-sectional tests, which it carried out in the years 2011/2012 at the construction administrations, which are responsible for the road and building construction of the federal government in Germany.
In doing so, he examined, for example, the construction of motorways and major construction projects.
In addition, the Federal Audit Office used results from earlier investigations.
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic based its evaluations on examination findings from the years 2008 to 2011. The examinations included construction measures in road construction, railway track construction, hydraulic engineering, building construction (hospitals, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc.) as well as other construction areas in the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the awarding of federal public contracts is mainly carried out by the building administrations of the federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the State Construction Administration is centrally responsible for awarding contracts in the field of transport infrastructure.
In building construction, the awards are carried out decentrally by those bodies that use state budget funds.
In both countries, freelancers are also involved for parts of the procurement procedures.
When comparing the evaluations, differences in procurement law and the market structure for construction services in both countries must be taken into account.
Development of public procurement law in both countries
In Germany, the implementation of EU-wide procurement procedures is laid down in laws and regulations.
Procurement procedures limited to the national field are governed by budgetary law and the administrative provisions based on it.
In addition, many supplementary individual rules are laid down by internal administrative provisions for both EU-wide and national contracts.
Such as the so-called "procurement manuals" of the federal government, in which the legal requirements are supplemented or formulated in more detail in compliance with public procurement law.
In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure is governed exclusively by the Public Procurement Act and other statutory provisions that apply both above and below the EU thresholds.
The public procurement law was significantly amended in 2012.
The new rules increased transparency in the handling of public funds, enabled greater competition and limited the scope for corruption in procurement procedures.
Basic principles of public procurement law in both countries
In both countries, EU-wide awards are subject in particular to the open procedure, the non-open procedure and the negotiation procedure.
In Germany, for measures below the EU threshold, the national award types (public tender, restricted tender, hands-free award) must be applied, but these largely correspond to the EU-wide award types mentioned.
Public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of the primacy of the open procedure (for EU-wide contracts) and the public invitation to tender (for national contracts).
Any interested company can submit an offer in the open procedure and in the public invitation to tender.
Another key feature of German public procurement law is the promotion of medium-sized companies.
Above all, the division of an overall construction project into specialist and partial lots serves this purpose.
The individual allocation of these lots is intended to enable as many companies as possible to participate in the competition.
Both of the aforementioned features of German public procurement law are proven instruments for achieving economic results.
More than 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees are active in Germany.
In the Czech Republic, EU-wide procurement procedures also apply to construction projects below the EU threshold.
An exception here is the simplified procedure, in which a less stringent procedure may be applied below the thresholds and under certain conditions.
Czech public procurement law, in line with EU law, provides for contracts to be concluded when competition is guaranteed and a favourable price is achieved.
The current legal provisions in the Czech Republic allow contracting authorities to choose between open and non-open procedures.
There are over 85,000 construction companies in the Czech Republic, including about 1,900 companies with 20 or more employees.
Construction volume of public contracting authorities and shares of the types of contracts in both countries
In Germany, the total construction volume in 2011 amounted to 307 billion euros.
Of this, 45.5 billion euros went to public construction (15%), which includes, in addition to federal construction, in particular the construction measures of the federal states and municipalities.
The construction volume of the federal government in building construction and highway construction (excluding railway track construction and hydraulic engineering) amounted to 8.5 billion euros.
The volume of contracts for construction work in federal building construction and highway construction was distributed among the contract types in 2011 as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public tenders, 12.7% non-open procedures and restricted tenders and 6.6% negotiation procedures and hands-free contracts.
Of these, 33.2% were Europe-wide awards.
The volume of public construction projects in the Czech Republic amounted to EUR 4.7 billion in 2011, representing approximately 25% of the total volume of all construction projects in the Czech Republic.
In 2009, the volume amounted to 7.8 billion euros, which corresponded to 37% of the total construction volume.
Breakdown by type of award for 2011: 65.1% open procedures 14.3% non-public procedures 9.5% negotiated procedures 8.4% simplified procedures for contracts below the threshold 2.7% other procedures
The data relate to all public contracts for supplies, services and construction services awarded by public procurement authorities in 2011.
The above-mentioned data show that the parallel audits carried out by both countries are aimed at a significant proportion of public contracts, that the prevention of corruption, which must be observed in all contracts, is of great financial importance, and that the open procedure and the public tender play an outstanding role in the awarding of contracts.
Summary of the results of the parallel tests
The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have carried out parallel audits on the EU-wide award of construction services and the prevention of corruption in their respective countries.
In this context, the working groups of both courts of auditors compared the corresponding legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and Germany as well as the results of their parallel audits, which they carried out in particular in the areas of building construction and road construction.
In doing so, they essentially stated:
The EU directives on the award of works by public contracting authorities have been transposed into national law in both the Czech Republic and Germany (points 1 and 3.1).
In addition to the EU requirements, corruption prevention is also served by the procurement regulations of both countries, which partly differ in their priorities and their details (No. 3.2).
In both countries, an essential requirement for procurement documents is that they must contain all the information required for the proper preparation of tenders.
The performance specifications must be neutral and must not have any competition-limiting requirements.
In Germany, the award documents have largely met these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, it is still a problem to determine the subject of the contract sufficiently.
In Germany, construction work should preferably be divided into lots in order to promote competition.
According to the findings of the BRH, this requirement was largely implemented in Germany.
In its audits, particularly in the field of road construction, the NKÚ found that the award of extensive services without lots or with only very large lots could affect competition and lead to a restriction to only a few large companies.
Narrowing of the market potential can result in significant cost increases and entail the risk of price or other agreements.
According to the provisions of both countries, the contracting authorities may, under certain conditions, in principle agree with the already contracted companies additional or modified services that prove to be necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (No. 4.1).
The respective requirements for determining the type of award were predominantly followed in both countries.
According to the regulations of the Czech Republic, contracting authorities are free to choose between open and non-open procedures.
In Germany, on the other hand, the legal and budgetary priority of the open procedure for EU-wide awards or the public tender, which corresponds to the open procedure for national awards, applies.
This allows more companies to submit offers.
This reduces the risk of corruption, complicates price agreements between bidders and leads to the most economical results.
In the case of construction projects whose estimated total contract values reached or exceeded the EU threshold, the audited building authorities generally awarded the construction services throughout Europe.
The correct estimation of the expected contract value is an essential basis for choosing the right type of award.
In Germany, cost databases are used to determine the costs of public buildings, in particular in building construction,
The completed construction projects are based on the evaluations.
In the Czech Republic, a database is used in the field of road construction, but it is not yet an effective tool (No. 4.2).
In the case of construction works to be awarded throughout Europe, preliminary information and announcements must be published. This is intended to strengthen competition by enabling interested companies to prepare for the planned awards at an early stage.
The audited building authorities generally complied with this requirement.
In individual cases, incorrect information, incorrect applications or lack of controls may affect competition (point 4.3).
The selection of candidates for participation in non-public procurement procedures is particularly susceptible to manipulation.
Under EU law, the number of invited applicants must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not discriminate and must be announced in advance.
In addition to the EU requirements, the contracting authorities in both countries should change as often as possible among the companies to be invited when selecting applicants.
In order to counter the risk of manipulation, there are sometimes very detailed specifications in Germany.
In some cases, the audited administrations did not take these requirements into account.
In the Czech Republic, decisions on the selection of applicants were not always comprehensible (No. 4.4).
In both countries, during the offer phase, in the interests of equal competition, it must be ensured that the companies interested in submitting a bid receive the same information.
Contact between these companies with each other and with freelancers who were involved in the preparation of the service description must be prevented as far as possible in order to avoid anti-competitive agreements.
The corresponding regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.
However, some of the audited building authorities in Germany did not comply with these requirements (No. 4.5).
When opening up offers in both countries, particular attention must be paid to the multi-eyes principle and the principle of transparency.
The specifications for the labelling, documentation, storage and confidentiality of the offers are intended to limit the scope for manipulation and are laid down in particular detail in Germany.
The tests in both countries resulted in only a few complaints (No. 4.6).
Examination and evaluation of the offers are determined in both countries by specifications for the structure and process organization.
The regulations in Germany are more comprehensive, but have not been consistently observed by the audited awarding bodies.
For example, awarding bodies handed over offers for examination to third parties without first reviewing the offers and sufficiently documenting abnormalities.
The offers were thus insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulations (No. 4.7).
At the conclusion of the EU-wide procurement procedures, the companies involved in the competition are to be informed of the intended contract before the contract is awarded.
This possibility of legal protection also has a preventive function against corrupt behaviour.
The Czech Republic also provides for the possibility of judicial review for non-EU procurement procedures.
Only in a few cases did the contracting authorities fail to meet the specified deadlines or deviate from the content of the bidder's offer (No. 4.8).
The documentation of the procurement procedures was not always complete or comprehensible by the audited building administrations in both countries.
In this respect, the EU-wide transparency requirement was not sufficiently implemented in the award notices of some procedures.
Some of the shortcomings identified also reduced the corruption-preventive function of the documentation.
The contracting authorities of both countries largely complied with their reporting and reporting obligations (No. 4.9).
Fundamentals of EU public procurement law and the prevention of corruption
EU public procurement law
In order to ensure unrestricted competition with the free movement of services and goods within the European Union, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, among other things, the Procurement Coordination Directive and the Remedies Directive, which had to be transposed into national law by the 8 member states.
The general procurement principles of the European Union are, in particular, the principle of competition, the principle of equal treatment or the prohibition of discrimination and the principle of transparency.
In order to achieve these objectives, the Procurement Coordination Directive contains special rules for construction projects to be awarded throughout the EU.
For this purpose, their estimated order amounts must currently reach or exceed 5,000,000 euros.
The regulations concern in particular the content of the award documents, the publication of certain information before, during and after the award, the observance of deadlines, e.g. for the receipt of bids, the documentation of the award procedure, the requirements that can be placed on the qualification of candidates and The Remedies Directive forms the basis for the legal protection of candidates and bidders.
In the event of possible breaches of public procurement law, the companies concerned can have the decisions of the contracting authorities reviewed in review procedures.
Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the directives of the European Union into national law.
Prevention of corruption
Importance of Preventing Corruption
In both countries, there is no legal definition of corruption.
In general, corruption is the abuse of a position of trust for private gain,
Which is usually initiated by the beneficiaries of these decisions.
Corruption can hinder competition and cause considerable damage to the economy.
It is estimated that the global costs of corruption amount to 5% of world economic output.
For the European Union, the level of these costs is estimated at 1%.
In the case of contracting authorities, anti-competitive agreements or unfair practices may call into question confidence in the integrity and functioning of the administration.
Preventing corruption is therefore one of the fundamental tasks of contracting authorities.
They have to check the structural and operational organisation of their administrations for areas that are particularly at risk of corruption in order to put in place appropriate safeguards against corruption.
Preventive measures and effective controls can significantly reduce the vulnerability of decision-making processes to corrupt abuse.
The award of public works is generally regarded as a particularly corruption-prone area of work.
Measures to prevent corruption
In Germany, corruption – in particular bribery and bribery, as well as the acceptance and approval of benefits – is prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
In order to prevent corruption, the Federal Government has issued a directive and recommendations on corruption prevention in the Federal Administration. Thereafter, in addition to risk analysis, the following principles must be observed in the area of procurement: Priority of public tenders and open procedures, multi-eyes principle and transparency, Basic separation of planning, awarding and billing, Accurate and complete documentation of procurement procedures.
In addition, further anti-corruption provisions have been incorporated into the public procurement regulations.
For example, the Federal Ministry responsible for procurement in the area of federal highways introduced an electronically supported control system in 2011.
With the award data – such as the estimated costs and the order amounts – as well as information on the freelancers involved are collected nationwide and evaluated for abnormalities.
In the Czech Republic, corruption is also prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
The statutory requirements of transparency and equal treatment of bidders, as well as the prohibition of any discrimination, form the most important basis for preventing corruption.
For public procurement, the Czech government has defined anti-corruption measures in a strategy paper on the fight against corruption for the years 2011 to 2012 and updated them for the years 2013 to 2014.
Some of the measures recommended therein have already been incorporated into national public procurement law and corresponding administrative provisions UM14.
The new legislation essentially contains the following provisions: the lowering of the thresholds for smaller contracts, the obligation to give prior notice of the awards by the awarding body, including the indication of the reasons for the invitation to tender, the prohibition of the restriction of the number of bidders in undisclosed procedures and thus the abolition of the possibility of selecting bidders by lottery, the introduction of the obligation to publish the contract documents and all the annexes, the introduction of the obligation to publish the actual price and the list of subcontractors.
Examination results for the individual phases of the award procedure
Procurement documents
Award documents The award documents must contain all the information that the bidders need to prepare an appropriate tender.
In particular, the award documents must enable an accurate calculation.
No risks may be transferred to the bidders that are not calculable for them.
The award documents consist in particular of the service description and the terms and conditions of the contract.
In addition, they contain the requirements for proving the qualification (suitability) of the bidders as well as the criteria that are decisive for the selection of the most economical offer.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
The requirements of EU law for procurement documents relate in particular to the technical specifications.
These must be equally accessible to all bidders and should restrict competition as little as possible.
In principle, the service description must be product-neutral.
Therefore, information on products or manufacturers as part of the service description is only permitted under strict conditions.
The avoidance of competition-limiting requirements in the procurement documents is also a fundamental principle of preventing corruption.
In addition, unclear or incorrect information in the award documents must be avoided, as they open up scope for speculation in the creation of the offers as well as for manipulation in their evaluation.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations In both countries, the EU legal requirements for the technical specifications have been transposed into national law.
In principle, the services are to be advertised product-neutral without factory specifications.
In the service descriptions, the individual services must generally be subdivided in detail into performance units with respective quantity specifications.
The prices are to be agreed on the basis of service units (e.g. Euro per m2 or per piece).
Only in exceptional cases may performance be defined by functional targets.
In any case, the service descriptions must be complete and unambiguous.
They must contain exact quantities and must not include services for which it is not clear whether they are required.
Payments after lump sums or after expenditure of time are to be avoided as far as possible.
These provisions are intended to prevent speculation and manipulation based on unspecified specifications in the procurement documents.
The service descriptions must enable bidders to prepare their offers safely and without extensive preparatory work.
The invitation to tender shall not be announced until the award documents have been completed.
Divergent rules
There is no obligation to tender construction works in lots in the Czech Republic.
If it is possible according to the type of work to be carried out, the public contracting authorities can divide construction work into several lots.
In Germany, construction services are generally divided into lots, separated by quantity (partial lots) and/or by type or subject area (specialist lots).
The aim is to enable medium-sized companies to participate in the competition, expand the number of possible providers and make price fixing more difficult.
This type of award is generally considered to be the most economical.
In the Czech Republic, evaluation criteria must be specified in the award documents for both EU-wide and national procedures.
This should enable applicants to fully and conclusively identify the criteria according to which their offers are to be evaluated.
In Germany, the indication of evaluation criteria in EU-wide announcements, but at the latest in the award documents, is only required in the EU-wide award procedures.
In the case of national award procedures, the evaluation criteria must only be recorded in an internal administrative award note.
Procurement documents, which are prepared by commissioned freelancers, may not contain any references to these offices or involved planners or experts in Germany with the building construction and some road construction administrations.
This is to prevent individual companies from gaining additional information or other undue competitive advantages through contact with these freelancers without the client's knowledge.
This is also the reason why freelancers may neither send award documents nor interpret planning documents for inspection.
The only contact person for the companies is the customer.
There is currently no regulation on this in the Czech Republic.
Additional or modified services that prove to be necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (supplements) are almost always required for large construction projects.
In both countries, the legal provisions make it possible, to a certain extent, to award additional contracts to the company that has already been commissioned, without the need for a public procurement procedure.
According to the EU requirements and the German provisions, the remuneration of the supplementary services may not exceed half of the main order.
In addition, the additional services must not be separated from the main contract without significant disadvantages or must be absolutely necessary.
In the Czech Republic, a narrower limit of 20% applies to such an award without public notice.
However, this may increase the risk of delayed completion of the construction project or the need to involve an additional contractor in the ongoing construction work.
If supplementary services are also transferred to the already commissioned company, an arbitrary price increase for these services by the contractor is generally not possible according to the regulations in Germany.
Rather, the determination of the remuneration for the additional services must be based on the agreed prices and the basis for determining the price of the order already placed.
In addition to supplementary services, there may also be a reduction in the scope of services.
In the Czech Republic, small quantities cannot be offset against additional supplementary services.
Key audit results
BHR
Technical specifications and product-neutral tender
In individual cases, the service descriptions contained references to national technical approvals or standards that had already been replaced by Europe-wide standards.
Some performance specifications also contained product-related specifications – for example for graffiti protection, joint tapes or noise protection panels – without this being necessary.
In some cases, performance requirements were described so precisely that only one product came into question.
Lists of services subdivided according to partial services
In none of the examined proceedings has the BRH found any violations of the offer to tender services in principle in a list of services subdivided according to partial services.
Completeness of the service descriptions
In the vast majority of cases, the procurement documents were completed before the start of the tenders.
In some procedures, the award documents had to be corrected during the tender phase, as some positions or deadlines had changed.
In some cases, the performance lists contained positions for which it was not clear whether they were needed.
A list of services for demolition work even consisted of almost half of such demand positions.
Lots and evaluation criteria
Many awards lacked the prescribed reasons why the services, which were mainly advertised to non-qualified persons, were not further divided into partial lots.
There were no complaints when specifying the criteria to be used in the evaluation of the offers.
References to freelancers
A small part of the service descriptions contained references to the freelancers involved.
Their names were partly on the covers or in attached plans or reports.
In one case, the awarding authority even explicitly asked the applicants to contact the architect “on questions relating to the invitation to tender”.
In particular in the building construction sector, the contracting authorities attributed the complaints pointed out mainly to omissions of the freelancers commissioned with the preparation of the service descriptions.
The construction services pointed out the lack of capacity in order to be able to adequately control the performance specifications.
NKÚ
Technical specifications and product-neutral tendering In the public procurement for the construction of a residential building with 12 residential units, a supplier and a specific product brand were specified in the service description.
The contracting authority did not allow the use of comparable products without giving reasons.
Suppliers and products were also specified in the tender for the construction of several university buildings.
Performance descriptions with performance units
For construction projects in some industrial areas, the contracting authority did not clearly specify the scope and nature of the required services in the service descriptions.
As performance units, it specified only the converted space of the individual buildings in cubic meters.
Completeness of the service descriptions
During the construction of a motorway bypass, the performance specifications were changed four times as part of a non-open procedure between August and September 2009.
Since the scope of services had increased considerably and the technical requirements had changed.
Tender documents for social buildings contained inaccurate location information, insufficient preliminary structural engineering studies and incomplete construction drawings, which meant that additional services had to be commissioned.
During the construction of a large library building, the performance description of the interior did not contain any requirements for product quality.
As a result of this lack of specifications, some subcontractors installed overpriced and inappropriately high-quality equipment.
Lots and eligibility criteria
In the Czech Republic, the division of construction measures into partial lots or the award of partial contracts is not mandatory.
An examination of the three large sections of the construction of a motorway ring showed that with a loose allocation of selected parts, savings of up to 31.6 million euros would have been possible at a total cost of 620.3 million euros.
In the case of six different buildings alone, which were the subject of a single contract, EUR 2.5 million (25 %) could have been saved in the case of a loose award.
With a loose allocation of the construction of 20 bridges, savings of 11.5 million euros (25%) would have been possible compared to a total allocation.
When awarding construction services in road construction, the central contracting authority specified very extensive reference requirements as eligibility criteria.
During the construction of part of a motorway, the contracting authority required the bidders in an open procedure to prove, among other things, that at least three road construction projects had been carried out, each worth EUR 28 million over the last five years.
In the Czech Republic, a maximum of nine suppliers met these requirements.
The public procurement of another section of a motorway comprised six separate construction projects for which the contracting authority had specified an annual construction volume of at least EUR 480 million over the last three years as a suitability criterion for the companies.
Two thirds of the funds raised for road construction projects in 2008 and 2009 (i.e. 2.5 billion euros out of a total of 3.7 billion euros) were allocated to contracts from a total of five companies that carried out the contracts alone or as a working group.
In 46 procurement procedures with a contract volume of EUR 528 million, only two or even only one bidder submitted a bid.
The NKÚ showed that a narrowing of the market potential could lead to significant cost increases.
Additional services
During the construction of a motorway bypass, the contracting authority did not apply any of the statutory procedures for the award of additional services in two cases and did not conclude any written contracts for the additional services.
Due to unclear volume and quality specifications, supplements were incurred in the first case of up to EUR 63.7 million (net) and in the second case up to EUR 165.4 million (net), which increased the respective order volume by 21% and 91% respectively.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
For several university buildings, some achievements were not listed in the award documents, although their necessity was already known when the contract was awarded.
Although the scope of these additional services exceeded the limit of 20% of the original contract value set by national public procurement law, the contracting authority carried out negotiation procedures with the contracted companies without notice.
During the construction of a large courthouse, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional construction services in negotiation proceedings without a call for tenders.
During the construction period, the contracting authority expanded the scope of the work by 2 million euros.
The unit prices for the additional construction services awarded without competition were considerably higher than comparable services provided by the same company.
Other findings
Based on a random sampling of construction projects, the NKÚ found that the average cost of building a four-lane motorway kilometer in the Czech Republic is up to EUR 14.6 million.
In Germany, however, according to an evaluation of long-term data from the Federal Building Ministry, the average cost of a four-lane motorway kilometer is up to 10.4 million euros.
This comparison indicates that motorway construction in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.
Summary findings
The basic rules on procurement documents are largely the same in both countries and take EU requirements into account.
They serve both comprehensive and fair competition and the prevention of corruption.
For example, the requirement for sufficient determination of the service descriptions should enable bidders to properly calculate and prepare their offers,
Protect the client from additional services to be subsequently agreed and also limit the scope for speculation.
In Germany, the common basic requirements for the award documents are supplemented by regulations that are intended to further reduce restrictions on competition and opportunities for manipulation.
In the Czech Republic, there are no requirements to this extent, but transparency is increased by publishing the evaluation criteria for non-EU-wide procurement procedures.
The requirements for performance specifications have been largely met in both countries.
In some cases, however, deviations had to be objected to, which may also have led to restrictions on competition.
The existing requirement for the formation of lots in Germany promotes competition and leads to economic results.
In the Czech Republic, according to the audit findings of the NKÚ, the award of extensive services without lots or with only very large lots can result in restrictions of the provider field to only a few large companies.
The extensive reference requirements for road construction in the Czech Republic have meant that public contracts are only awarded to a narrow circle of suppliers and that small and medium-sized enterprises are not allowed to participate in the competition.
Also, a limited number of competitors often leads to higher prices and increases the risk of price or other agreements.
With regard to the award and remuneration of additional or modified services, the regulatory approaches in both countries differ from one another.
According to the EU requirements and the German provisions, supplementary services with a value of up to half of the main contract can be awarded without a public tendering procedure under certain conditions.
In the Czech Republic, a narrower limit of 20% applies, up to which additional services can be awarded in the negotiation process without notice to the original contractor.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
This limit is often exceeded,
As the scope of public contracts is often insufficiently determined.
If the excess is greater than 20%, the additional services must be advertised with public notice.
By dividing services into lots, restrictions on competition and the resulting adverse consequences can be avoided.
Determining the type of award and taking into account the EU threshold
By determining the type of award, the client determines the scope of the number of companies participating in the competition.
It can leave the circle of possible applicants and bidders largely unlimited, for example by choosing an open procedure, or by specifying non-public procurement procedures.
For construction projects where a threshold set by the EU is reached or exceeded, Europe-wide procurement procedures must be applied.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
When choosing the type of award, the contracting authority must in particular take into account the requirements of European law on competition and transparency.
If the estimated total contract value of the construction services of a project is at or above the EU threshold of currently 5,000,000 euros, the construction services are generally to be awarded throughout Europe according to open or non-open procedures.
In exceptional cases, negotiation procedures or competitive dialogue are also possible.
The contracting authority may deviate to a limited extent from the principle of Europe-wide procurement for construction projects that reach or exceed the EU threshold and award construction services in national contracts, provided that the estimated contract value of the respective lot is less than EUR 1,000,000 and the sum of these lots does not exceed 20% of the estimated total contract value of all construction contracts.
A uniform construction project must not be divided into individual measures without compelling reason or deliberately estimated at too low cost values in order to remove it from the obligation to award construction services on a Europe-wide basis.
Since restrictions on competition significantly increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of the type of award is of great importance in preventing corruption.
The detailed justification of the selected type of award as well as the examination of the obligation to apply the EU procurement rules are important components of the documentation of the award procedure.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have fully transposed the EU rules on procurement procedures and the threshold into national law.
Divergent rules
The Czech Republic has also transferred the fundamental equality of open and non-open procedures contained in the EUR Directive to its construction contracts, which are not subject to EU requirements.
There is freedom of choice between the open and the non-open procedure, without the decision having to be documented or justified. Other procedures, on the other hand, are only possible under certain conditions defined by law.
In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure or – in the case of national contracts – the public invitation to tender have priority. This is laid down by budgetary and public procurement law as well as by the guidelines for the prevention of corruption.
Other types of award – such as the non-open procedure or the limited invitation to tender – are only possible in exceptional cases, which are conclusively regulated by public procurement law.
The existence of an exceptional case must be substantiated and documented in a comprehensible manner.
The principle of the priority of the open procedure or the public tender is to ensure as unrestricted a competition as possible, to exclude possibilities of manipulation by fixing on certain bidders and to complicate possible price agreements among the bidders.
The principle of public tendering is a central element of corruption prevention in Germany.
The correct estimation of the expected contract value is an essential basis for choosing the right type of award.
The construction services in Germany can use the planning and cost databases of public administrations and other organisations to determine the expected costs in the area of public building construction.
These databases are based on evaluations of completed construction projects. The databases contain, among other things, cost parameters for building categories, units of use, components or individual construction services.
On the basis of such cost parameters, the estimated contract value of a planned project or a construction work to be awarded can be determined.
Only a few construction administrations in Germany have corresponding cost databases for road construction.
However, a nationwide introduction for all road construction administrations is planned.
Contracting authorities in the Czech Republic cannot rely on central databases or average price calculations of comparable construction measures to determine the estimated costs of construction work.
In most cases, the cost calculations are based on estimates by the financing body or result from the amount of funds made available to the construction site.
Measures to standardise cost assessment procedures are still in the early stages.
As part of the anti-corruption plan for 2011 - 2012, the responsible ministries were commissioned to create a database for standardised building materials and materials.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Information on the cost of materials and on construction and extension works as well as other cost-relevant data are to be recorded in this database in order to enable the determination of costs and the determination of unit prices.
The Czech Ministry of Transport has also published a data collection for construction projects to improve cost control.
Which is intended to serve as a benchmark for pricing in the financing plan and is currently being updated.
Key audit results BRH
Selection of the award procedure
The audited contracting authorities largely advertised the construction services in an open procedure or in a public call for tenders and thus followed the requirements of budgetary and public procurement law.
In 2011, 59.5% of the federal government's construction work in building construction was advertised to the public or in an open process.
In road construction, this share was 94.8%.
When choosing non-public types of procurement, there was a partial lack of detailed reasons why the awarding bodies had to deviate from the principle of the open procedure or the public invitation to tender.
In a cross-sectional investigation, the BRH found, on the basis of more than 16,000 procurement procedures, that non-public procurement methods have significant disadvantages in terms of competition compared to open procedures and public tenders and increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.
In building construction, more than twice as many tenders were submitted for public tenders as for restricted tenders and almost three times as many tenders as for hands-free contracts.
The investigation also showed that bid prices for restricted tenders and hands-off contracts were on average 6% and 10% higher than for public tenders.
Parallel investigations by the Federal Building Ministry and a State Audit Office confirmed the economic differences between public and non-public types of procurement.
As a result of its studies on economic efficiency, the Federal Building Ministry even found twice as high differences between public and non-public procurement procedures.
Taking into account the EU threshold
The audited contracting authorities usually drew up procurement plans for the construction projects, for which they had determined an estimated total contract amount of more than 5,000,000 euros, in which they determined the construction services to be awarded according to EU-wide and national procurement procedures.
According to the procurement plans, this always meant that more than 80% of the construction work had to be awarded across the EU.
It was not possible to circumvent the obligation to award contracts across the EU by means of cost estimates that were set too low.
However, partly as a result of incorrect calculations, it actually fell below the minimum share of EU-wide procurement procedures.
During construction, some contracting authorities impermissibly changed the specifications of their procurement plans.
They did not justify these changes and did not prove that the minimum proportion of EU-wide procurement procedures continued to be complied with.
For most of the construction measures examined, the proportion of EU-wide contracts awarded according to the accounting results was usually lower than provided for in the procurement plan.
In some cases, in the case of construction projects above the EU threshold, the contracting authorities breached the requirement to tender all individual lots totalling EUR 1,000,000 or more in EU-wide procedures;
And chose national procedures instead.
NKÚ
Choice of award type
In several major construction measures, such as the construction of some motorway sections, construction projects as part of a major sporting event and housing projects, the contracting authorities divided construction services into several partial contracts, although these services were similar or comparable.
As a result of these divisions, the individual benefits were no longer above the threshold and were subsequently awarded in simplified procedures or even in disregard of legal requirements.
Calculation methods for the estimated order value
In road construction, the existing price databases for this area were only an insufficient instrument to be able to determine the expected order values.
The data was based on just completed construction projects, in which, however, there were indications of a lack of cost-effectiveness, unnecessary additional effort or excessive profits of the commissioned companies.
For three sections of a motorway ring, the actual prices were about 37% below the estimated order values determined with the help of the database.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Transport revised the databases in order to be able to take into account not only the offer prices of recent years, but also comparable market prices and price increase indices in the construction sector.
In building construction, the expected order values were based on cost values estimated by the project architects or on estimates by the investors.
The actual order values differed greatly from the estimated values.
The estimated price for the conversion or expansion of a large library was twice as high as the later agreed order value, but eight supplements in the course of the construction led to a cost increase of 2.1 million euros or 27%.
Similarly, the actual order value for the construction of a library depot was 33% lower than the estimated price, which also led to cost increases in the construction phase.
In other cases, the offer prices exceeded the estimated values and increased during construction.
In the construction of a large library, the estimated price was exceeded by 16 million euros, or 22%. In the construction of a judicial building, the costs rose disproportionately by 139%, as the usable area had expanded by only 12%.
Summary findings
Both countries have implemented the EU regulations for determining the type of award and taking into account the EU threshold into national law. Therefore, the respective regulations correspond to a large extent.
However, the priority of the open procedure or public tender in Germany goes beyond the EU requirements and the regulations in force in the Czech Republic.
Compared to non-public procurement procedures, more companies have the opportunity to participate in public procedures or public tenders.
Public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of bids and the most economic results.
The risk of corruption is significantly improved by not restricting the field of applicants by provisions of the client that are susceptible to manipulation and by making price agreements between bidders more difficult.
The investigations have confirmed the advantage of the priority of the open procedure or the public invitation to tender in Germany.
Czech legislation allows contracting authorities to award contracts in an open or non-open procedure.
According to the latest changes in public procurement law, the number of bidders may no longer be restricted in proceedings involving a previous competition.
This means that the non-open procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.
In Germany, the awarding bodies have largely complied with the requirements for the priority of the open procedure or the public invitation to tender. In the Czech Republic, some services have been impermissibly allocated in order to circumvent the requirements for the choice of the type of award.
When taking into account the EU threshold, errors had to be detected in Germany which resulted in a falling short of the minimum proportion of services advertised throughout the EU.
In the Czech Republic, there is still no satisfactory solution to accurately determine the expected costs of construction work and construction projects.
The building authorities should, if necessary, carry out further checks to ensure that the requirements for the choice of the type of award and the scope of services to be put out to tender throughout the EU are complied with or that the conditions for appropriate cost assessments are established.
Preliminary information and announcement
In the case of construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe, the public client must inform interested companies about the planned contracts in advance of the call for tenders.
Preliminary information and announcements form an important basis for Europe-wide competition.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
The preliminary information should contain the essential information under public procurement law on the planned construction projects.
They are required for those construction projects where the estimated total contract value reaches or exceeds the EU threshold and where the client wants to shorten the offer periods of open or non-open procedures.
In announcements, the client must provide binding details of the planned construction contracts to be awarded throughout Europe.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In it, he has to make known, among other things, the scope of services, the process and execution dates, the special requirements as well as the evaluation criteria and their weighting.
When describing the object of the order, the Europe-wide standardised vocabulary of the Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV codes) must be used.
Preliminary information and announcements will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the purchaser's profile.
In order to prevent discrimination against foreign interested parties, announcements at national level may not contain any additional information and may only be issued after the text of the announcement has been sent to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union.
Incomplete or incorrect information in the announcement may affect competition and may even support manipulation.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have fully transposed the EU legal requirements for prior information and notification into national law.
Divergent rules
In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and announcements must also be published in the case of construction work not to be awarded throughout Europe.
Award procedures may be started no earlier than one month after the preliminary information has been sent to the EU Official Journal (for EU-wide awards) or to the national Official Journal (for all awards).
The publication of preliminary information can only be waived in exceptional cases.
In Germany, no preliminary information is required for non-EU-wide procurement procedures.
In national procurement procedures, announcements for public tenders and participation competitions prior to restricted tenders must be published on the Federal Government's Internet portal and, if necessary, also in newspapers or magazines.
In the case of restricted tenders without a competition, announcements of services to be awarded starting from 25,000 euros are required (ex-ante transparency).
All planned lots of the construction projects must be listed in the preliminary information.
In Germany, this is of particular importance because of the small-scale nature of the loose construction contracts.
This scheme has only a limited impact in the Czech Republic, where much less construction work is divided into lots.
Key audit results
BRH
Preliminary information
The contracting authorities examined published preliminary information on all audited construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe.
In some open procedures, however, they shortened offer periods, although the necessary period of 52 days between the sending of the preliminary information and the announcements had not yet expired.
Other shortened procedures were only put out to tender after the 12-month period of validity of the preliminary information had already expired and before it had been extended.
In many published preliminary information, there were no indications of the planned division of the construction work into lots.
Announcements
The announcements of the audited bodies partly contained CPV codes which differed from the information provided in the preliminary information or which did not accurately cover the required services.
In individual cases, notices at national level were published earlier or contained more information – e.g. on implementation deadlines – than the notices in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Ex-ante transparency
The contracting authorities of an audited building administration had commissioned a service provider to publish the national procurement procedures.
The latter published the reports on its own fee-based award platform.
However, the contracting authorities did not check whether the company had forwarded the reports to the federal government's free internet portal as required.
Random samples showed that only one third of the reports from the audited administration were published on this portal.
NKÚ
Announcements
For the construction of a sewage treatment plant, the contracting authority did not specify the criteria on the basis of which it wanted to select the bidders.
The awarding authority was unable to prove how the bidders were selected.
The restriction on the number of bidders was permissible under the law in force at the time.
During the construction of a motorway ring, the awarding authority did not specify in more detail in a non-open procedure, either in the announcement or in the documentation of the award procedure, according to which it wanted to evaluate the qualification of the applicants and how many applicants it wanted to admit to the competition.
In its evaluation, the awarding body came to the conclusion that all six applicants met the qualification requirements, but excluded the applicant with the worst ratings from the further procedure.
The awarding body's procedure was not transparent because it had not provided information on the qualification criteria and the evaluation procedure at any point in the procedure.
Publication of the announcements
During the renovation of the former military site, the contracting authority did not publish the tender.
Summary findings
The two-stage information system with preliminary information and notification is an important part of implementing the transparency requirement in Europe-wide procurement, strengthening competition and thus also preventing corruption.
Both countries have implemented the EU requirements and increased the transparency of their procurement procedures, including in the national procurement sector:
Selection of candidates for non-public award types
In contrast to public procurement procedures, in non-public procurement procedures, not every company interested in carrying out the services to be awarded can participate in the competition.
In the case of non-public procurement procedures, the contracting authority must select in advance which companies should be invited to tender.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption The EU regulations allow for a limit on the number of applicants in EU-wide non-public procurement procedures.
However, in the case of non-open procedures, at least five companies must be invited to tender.
In the case of negotiation procedures with notification of tenders, at least three companies must be invited.
In any case, the number of invited applicants must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be announced in advance.
The selection of companies to be requested is a process within the procurement procedure that is highly susceptible to manipulation, e.g. by giving unilateral preference to certain companies.
In addition, restricting competition to a few companies also favours possible agreements between the applicants.
In both cases, the award result may be significantly impaired at the expense of the customer.
The contracting authorities must therefore take special precautions against possible manipulation, carry out sufficient checks and, in particular, ensure the transparency and traceability of this procedural step.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
The rules for selecting applicants are similar in both countries.
In addition to the EU requirements, the awarding bodies should change as often as possible among the companies to be invited when selecting applicants.
Nor should competition be limited to companies established in certain regions.
The awarding bodies must justify the selection of applicants and document the course of the selection process in their award notes.
Divergent rules
In Germany, at least three suitable candidates must be invited to submit bids in the case of restricted tenders and several suitable candidates in the case of open tenders.
Under the new Czech rules, with the exception of two specific areas, it is inadmissible to limit the number of bidders in the case of non-open procedures and negotiation procedures.
In Germany, the multi-eyes principle must be observed when selecting companies.
For example, if an employee has proposed a number of companies for a non-public procurement procedure, the management level of the construction service or a contractor from the contracting authority must usually amend this proposal, for example by removing a proposed company and/or supplementing a new company.
This is to prevent a single person from being able to conclusively determine the group of companies to participate in the competition.
Otherwise, in the case of manipulative intentions, this could lead to far-reaching agreements between the parties involved.
The list of companies to be requested is – also with regard to freelancers – to be treated confidentially and not to be made generally accessible.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In the Czech Republic, there are no corresponding regulations for drawing up and keeping secret lists of applicants.
According to the German regulations, freelancers are not allowed to determine the companies to be invited, but can only submit proposals to the awarding body.
There is a regulatory gap in Czech legislation.
Key audit results
BRH
Number of applicants
The requirement to require a minimum number of companies to submit bids for non-public contracts has been met, with a few exceptions.
An evaluation by the BRH of almost 7,000 non-European procurement procedures for construction work in building construction showed that the contracting authorities requested an average of 6.6 companies to submit bids for restricted federal tenders in Germany and an average of 4.4 companies for free-hand contracts.
Change of companies and regional restrictions
Especially for trades with few suppliers, the awarding bodies did not always change the circle of selected applicants.
Above all, they took into account well-known and, from their point of view, proven companies.
As a reason for this, they stated that, in the case of non-public proceedings, they had to ensure the suitability of the companies to be invited to compete even before the invitation to tender.
The BRH did not find an impermissible restriction to regional bidders in the non-public procurement procedures, but a higher proportion of regionally based companies than in public tenders.
The contracting authorities attributed this primarily to the fact that the scope of services in non-public procurement procedures is significantly lower on average and therefore, for example, longer access routes are more important than in public tenders.
Multi-eyes principle and suggestions Freelancer
Contrary to the rules, the contracting authorities largely failed to have the proposed list of companies to be requested amended by an independent person.
They justified this in particular with a lack of processing capacity, deadline pressure or insufficient knowledge of alternative suitable companies.
It was also often not documented who had proposed the companies that had been invited to submit bids.
Some samples showed that freelancers had drawn up the lists of applicants and that these proposals had been accepted unchanged by the awarding bodies.
Thus, the contracting authorities did not protect themselves to the required extent from possible manipulations.
Confidential treatment of bidder lists
At a contracting authority, the lists of companies to be requested were recorded in a data processing system that could be viewed by all employees of this service.
In the case of manipulative intentions, the names of the designated or authorised companies could have been passed on without authorisation and could, for example, have facilitated agreements between these companies.
Documentation
The documentation of the award procedures contained only in a few cases reasons for the selection of applicants.
NKÚ
Selection of candidates
During the construction of a motorway ring, the bidders did not receive any information on the evaluation criteria and the evaluation procedures.
In the case of the non-open procedures for the development and modernisation of waterways and ports, the announcements did not indicate how the selection of candidates should be carried out.
In one procedure, all eight participating applicants met the qualification requirements, which exceeded the specified maximum number of companies to be admitted.
The procurement committee then carried out a lottery procedure to select the companies.
However, this approach, which was in principle permissible at the time, should have been cited as one of the criteria in the announcement.
Summary findings
Due to the high risk of manipulation in the selection of candidates in non-public procurement procedures, both countries have taken special measures to prevent undue restrictions on competition.
With the multi-eyes principle, the secrecy of the bidding lists and the sole authority of the contracting authorities to propose the companies to be requested, the German requirements restrict such possibilities of abuse.
In the case of the Czech regulations, in particular, the newly introduced requirement of a largely unlimited number of bidders in non-public proceedings can counteract possible manipulative restrictions.
However, the audit findings have shown that some of these requirements have been inadequately implemented and that the potential for manipulation for an abusive restriction of the field of participants has not been sufficiently reduced in these cases.
Contracting authorities should fully address the shortcomings identified.
Offer phase
With the announcement of the award or the invitation to tender, the tender phase begins, in which the companies can prepare tenders on the basis of the tender documents sent to them.
Candidates may submit their bids until the end of the offer period set by the awarding authority.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
There are no separate EU legal requirements for this phase of the procurement procedure.
The contracting authorities must comply with the national regulations, which are intended to counteract the possibilities of manipulation that exist during the tender phase.
These are mainly organisational requirements and controls.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
The award documents on the basis of which the companies are to prepare their bids must, in principle, only be sent by the awarding authority.
Freelancers involved in the award procedure are not allowed to perform this task.
The awarding authority must ensure that all applicants receive the same information during the bidding phase.
In the event of ambiguities in the award documents or other questions regarding the invitation to tender, only the awarding authority may provide information to the applicants.
Freelancers commissioned with the preparation of the award documents may not provide any information.
During the entire offer phase, contact between the commissioned freelancers and the applicants must be prevented.
Freelancers must not become a hub of the procurement process through which contacts with anti-competitive consequences can be established.
Bids submitted by post or directly must be submitted in a sealed envelope.
Electronically transmitted offers must have a technical encryption.
Divergent rules
In Germany, the registry can also commission external service companies with the printing and dispatch of the award documents, whose employees are obligated to the confidentiality of the offers and to the conscientious fulfillment of the contractual obligations.
The offers received must be marked with an entry stamp in Germany and forwarded directly, immediately and unopened to an employee responsible for safekeeping.
This employee may not be involved in the award.
The offers received must be kept under lock and key until the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, the offers received are marked with a file number.
The registry records the offer data, including order numbers, as well as the creation and receipt details in a log.
The safekeeping of offers is not regulated in detail in the Czech Republic.
Key audit results
BRH
The tests for the tender phase focused primarily on the procurement procedures of a building administration.
Dispatch of the award documents
The awarding bodies of the audited building administration sent the award documents themselves or had them printed and sent by an external service provider.
Freelancers did not send any award documents.
Information to applicants
For the most part, the audited building management did not comply with the requirements for the separation of planning and procurement when naming the contact persons for queries and information.
In the service descriptions, contrary to the specifications, she did not specify employees from the contracting authority, but from the project management as contact persons.
Some award documents even contained the names of the freelancers who had drawn up the performance descriptions.
In the case of inquiries during the offer phase, not all applicants received the same information in individual cases.
Marking of offers
At the audited building administration, all offers received were marked with an entry stamp and a notice of receipt.
In some hands-free contracts, however, the offers were received by freelancers, which contradicted the provisions to prevent corruption.
Safekeeping of offers
Once they had been labelled, not all offers were sent directly and immediately to the employee responsible for safekeeping, who enclosed the offers in a steel cabinet.
In a construction site, the offers were in the meantime stored in an open compartment of the post office, to which every employee had access.
Another office had hung up a mailbox in a hallway that was not constantly monitored, in which some of the offers thrown in there even remained overnight.
Since the throw-in slot of this mailbox was large and unsecured, not only employees, but also visitors to the office would have had the opportunity to extract and, if necessary, manipulate received offers.
NKÚ
No defects were objected to on the Czech side.
Summary findings
During the tender phase, contacts between interested companies and freelancers involved in the procurement process are to be prevented in both countries.
By providing all bidders with the same information, the principle of equal treatment should also be respected.
The regulations on the receipt, safekeeping and confidentiality of the offers appear to be suitable to counteract manipulation and corruption.
The corresponding requirements in Germany are somewhat more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
The results of the investigation in Germany have revealed violations of the regulations in some areas.
These shortcomings could be eliminated with little effort.
Opening of offers
Opening of offers
During the opening date, the previously closed offers will be opened and their contents read out and thus made public.
From the opening date, the bidders are bound to their bids until the end of the surcharge period specified by the awarding authority.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
No separate EU legal regulations are laid down for the opening of the offers.
However, the national regulations for the prevention of corruption contain extensive requirements for the protection of bids and competition for this highly sensitive phase of the procurement procedure.
The multi-eyes principle as well as the transparency and traceability of the offer opening are intended to prevent manipulations and changes to the submitted offers.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
The opening date is to be carried out by several persons to be determined by the awarding authority.
The multi-eyes principle is intended to prevent individuals from being able to manipulate the offers in an uncontrolled manner when opening the offers.
In most procurement procedures, bidders can participate in the opening date.
Only offers submitted to the negotiator when the first offer was opened are admitted to the opening.
Offers received late may in principle no longer be taken into account.
In order to ensure the transparency of the opening date, the actions taken and the results of the opening of the offer must be recorded in a protocol in which, among other things, the names of the bidders and the offer prices must be recorded.
The minutes must be read out and signed by the management of the negotiations.
It can also be signed by the bidders present.
Divergent rules
In the Czech Republic, a committee carries out the opening of tenders.
Freelancers can also participate.
The committee can also be tasked with further phases of the award procedure, such as the evaluation of bids.
In Germany, a negotiator and a secretary carry out the opening of the offer.
The negotiator must be an employee of the tendering body.
The negotiator and, when awarding contracts in building construction, also the secretary shall not be involved in the processing of the award documents as well as in the awarding and execution of the contract.
According to the German regulations, in addition to the offer prices, information on discounts and discounts as well as special features – such as damaged or delayed offers – must be recorded in the minutes of the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, in addition to the offer price, only the language of the offer and the signature authority of the applicant are recorded.
The German regulations provide that the opened offers are to be marked in all parts in such a way that subsequent changes and additions are prevented.
The offers are usually marked by perforations with the date of the opening date. They must be kept secret after the opening date and may only be made accessible to the persons directly commissioned with the processing.
Corresponding Czech regulations do not exist.
If only one offer is received during an award procedure in the Czech Republic, it may not be opened and must be returned unappreciated.
In Germany, there is no such regulation. If only one offer is received here, it must be opened and then evaluated.
Key audit results
BRH
Multi-eyes principle
The audited awarding bodies implemented the requirements for the multi-eyes principle at the opening dates.
They carried out the opening dates with negotiators and secretaries, who were not charged with any other award procedures.
In the case of hands-free contracts with a smaller scope of services, however, there were isolated cases in which freelancers opened offers sent to them without the participation of the contracting authority.
Minutes
In the minutes of the opening dates, the opening of the offers was not always fully documented.
In some cases, for example, the late-filed bids were not registered, in some cases even signatures were missing.
Marking of offers
The awarding bodies examined as part of the cross-sectional examination marked the offers in accordance with the specifications by a perforation with the date of the opening date.
In previous audits of some grant recipients, insufficient labelling had been identified.
However, these awarding bodies changed their labelling practice after the complaint by the BRH.
NKÚ
Offer period
When awarding road maintenance measures, an offer was not received by the awarding authority until one month after the end of the offer period. Nevertheless, the awarding authority accepted this offer.
Summary findings
The regulations of both countries on the opening of offers agree in significant parts. They take into account both the multi-eyes principle and the principle of transparency. As a result, the risks of corruption and manipulation in the opening of offers can be significantly limited.
The requirements in Germany are more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
In particular, the requirements for the exact documentation of the process as well as the labelling, secure storage and confidentiality of the offers significantly limit the possibilities of manipulation, such as subsequent changes to the offers.
In addition, the persons entrusted with the opening of the offers may not perform any other tasks in connection with the service to be awarded.
The total of only a few complaints prove the high acceptance of the requirements for the opening of the offer.
Examination and evaluation of the offers
Examination and evaluation of the offers The client must check and evaluate the offers available at the opening date.
He has to determine the offer for the award of the surcharge that best meets the requirements according to the specified award criteria.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
The EU requirements provide for a multi-stage procedure:
First of all, the suitability of the bidders must be determined.
Bidders must be economically and financially efficient and possess the necessary professional and technical expertise.
Companies that have been legally convicted of bribery or fraud, for example, must in principle be excluded from participating in the award procedure.
The offers of the non-excluded bidders are to be examined computationally, technically and economically and evaluated on the basis of the previously announced award criteria.
The client has to determine the most economically advantageous offer. Offers with unusually low prices have to be examined by the client in particular.
The examination and evaluation of bids is a phase of the award procedure that is particularly susceptible to manipulation.
For example, bidders can be unfairly excluded or offers that do not meet the requirements can be left in competition.
By favouring or discriminating against bidders, the valuation result can be impermissibly affected and thus the determination of the most economically advantageous offer can be prevented.
The awarding authority must therefore take special precautions to ensure that the persons entrusted with the examination and evaluation meet the requirements for integrity and expertise.
It must also ensure the transparency and traceability of the procedure and of the decisions taken.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
In accordance with EU requirements, the offers in both countries must be examined and evaluated in multi-stage procedures.
The requirements for the companies' proof of suitability to be submitted as well as the award criteria to be taken into account in the evaluation and their weighting are laid down in the announcements or in the award documents and can no longer be changed during the procedure.
After checking the bidder's suitability, the eligibility criteria may no longer be used in the evaluation of the bids.
The evaluation must be limited to the award criteria.
The submitted offers must first be formally examined immediately to determine whether they are complete and whether they contain, for example, abnormalities that could indicate possible manipulation intentions.
If bidders are excluded from further examination and evaluation of their offers, they must be informed immediately.
If the valuation of the offers results in a price that appears to be unreasonably low, the bidder must be given the opportunity to comment before a possible exclusion of his offer.
The decisions made during the examination and evaluation of the offers must be documented in a comprehensible manner.
Divergent rules
In Germany, the offers to be kept secret may only be made accessible to the persons directly commissioned with the processing.
The review of the offers as well as the arithmetical examination of the offers may only be carried out by the awarding authority.
It must only appoint staff who are not involved in the award decision or the implementation of the measure.
The performance of further examination and evaluation tasks is not regulated in detail.
If freelancers are commissioned with the examination and evaluation, they must treat the offers confidentially.
They may only make proposals for the decisions to be taken by the awarding bodies.
In the Czech Republic, award committees are to be formed for the examination and evaluation of bids.
The committees prepare evaluation reports with award proposals.
Ultimately, as in Germany, only the contracting authorities have to decide on the awarding of contracts.
If evidence or declarations required for the submission of bids in Germany are only incompletely submitted, the awarding authority shall give the bidders the opportunity to submit the missing documents within six days.
Only if the documents are still not available after the deadline, the offer is excluded from the evaluation.
In the Czech Republic, it is at the discretion of the awarding authority whether to give bidders the opportunity to complete missing evidence or declarations.
If a bidder fails to do so, he must be excluded.
In Germany, in addition to the total price, the unit prices (prices for partial services) of the offers must also be examined.
If, due to the price structure of the offer, there are indications of too low or too high prices for partial services, the bidder shall be requested to clarify these ambiguities.
If he does not succeed and the awarding authority can provide proof of a mixed calculation of the prices, this offer shall be excluded.
This is to prevent bidders from speculating on significant changes in the volume of partial services when calculating their offer, which can lead to significant cost increases for the construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, the total price is assessed, but not the appropriateness of the prices for partial services.
A mixed calculation cannot justify the exclusion of an offer.
A surcharge may not be awarded in Germany for offers with unreasonably high or low prices.
If one or more offers fall below the correct price determination of the client or the offer sums of the other bidders by 10% or more, the bidders must prove the correct calculation of their offers.
If they are unable to do so, the awarding authority may exclude the bids in question.
In the Czech Republic, the tender can be cancelled after the assessment of cost-effectiveness, if only non-reasonable offers at low prices are available.
In contrast to German public procurement law, the surcharge for offers with prices substantially above the calculation of the customer cannot be refused for this reason.
If there is a suspicion of anti-competitive behaviour in Germany, the contracting authority must immediately report to its supervisory authority.
The latter has to decide on the measures to be taken and whether the antitrust authority or the public prosecutor's office should be informed.
The supervisory authority at the leading level must, for example, also agree to construction work in excess of EUR 50,000 if a contract is to be awarded freehand, if a contract is not to be awarded to the bid with the lowest price or if the tender is to be cancelled.
There are no such regulations in the Czech Republic.
Key audit results
BRH
Suitability and evaluation criteria
The vast majority of the audited procurement procedures complied with the listed requirements.
For some companies proposed by freelancers, the awarding bodies did not check the suitability of the companies themselves.
A grant recipient commissioned companies without the required proof of suitability being complete.
In some cases, it was not clear whether the awarding authority had taken into account all the announced award criteria in its selection decision or whether it had merely based its award decision on the "prize" criterion.
Selection of the persons involved and confidentiality of the offers
Some contracting authorities used unauthorised persons in the examination of the offers.
For example, freelancers or employees of the department involved in the planning or implementation of a construction project carried out tasks that could only be performed by employees of the contracting authority.
The construction services justified this with insufficient personnel capacities in the respective areas.
In some cases, the freelancers commissioned with the examination of the offers also involved employees who were not obligated to the secrecy of the offers and to the conscientious fulfilment of the contractual obligations.
For the construction services, it was usually not clear whether the services offered by the freelancers were only accessible to the persons directly commissioned with the processing.
Review and computational review of offers
Some awarding bodies handed over the open offers to freelancers for further examination, without first having carried out the prescribed review of the offers and the computational examination itself and having documented their results.
In the case of manipulative intentions, third parties could have made changes to the offers without this being comprehensible to the contracting authorities.
In the examined documents, abnormalities or missing price or product information were partly not or only insufficiently marked.
Performance audits
In the case of a sample in a building administration, the most favourable offers deviated more than 10% from the previously determined estimated costs in three quarters of the audited procurement procedures.
Every 20th award procedure was cancelled due to inappropriate bid prices.
Not all bid reviews and clarification discussions with the bidders were comprehensible or sufficiently documented.
In many cases, more detailed explanations were lacking, such as on the unit prices of the most important positions.
The deviations were often only justified on a flat-rate basis, e.g. by references to changed market prices or increased material costs.
The construction services explained that the detection and verification of mixed calculations was difficult.
In the case of a tender by an institution under public law, the offer price of the cheapest offer was 66% below the previously determined estimated value of these services.
More detailed calculation tests or investigations into the causes of this deviation were not documented.
In a clarification meeting, the contracting authority found no evidence of price dumping by the then commissioned company.
Thus, it remained unclear whether the estimated value was excessive or the offer price was too low.
Later, the client rated the commissioned company as a "cheap company" that could not maintain quality or deadlines.
In another tender, a construction site awarded the contract for an offer whose price was 35% above the value of the cost calculation.
It did not lift the invitation to tender and cited the extraneous justification that this company could be concluded on an adequate calculation.
Suspected irregularities
In an audited building administration, there were two cases of irregularities, both of which were reported to the supervisory authority.
In one of the cases, the calculation of two bidders in a call for tenders was identical, so that the awarding authority excluded both bids from the procedure.
The tests did not raise any significant objections with regard to the application of the remaining provisions.
NKÚ
Aptitude test
In many of the examined construction projects, including university construction, road construction and the expansion of the railway network, the contracting authorities did not exclude bidders from the procedure, even though they did not meet the requirements specified in the tender documents or could not prove their suitability to the prescribed extent. On the other hand, in one case a contracting authority could neither prove nor explain why it had excluded a bidder who had fulfilled the requirements.
Scoring
When awarding construction services for a water treatment plant, the awarding authority did not take the specified evaluation criteria into account when examining and evaluating the bids.
In a construction project for the expansion of the railway network, the awarding authority determined the weighting of the evaluation criteria only at the beginning of the evaluation.
In the case of road maintenance measures, the specified criterion “shortening of the construction phase” was incorrectly evaluated in a procedure.
As a result, the reduction offered was not sufficiently taken into account by the bidders in second and third position.
Documentation of the offer selection
In three procurement procedures in the context of housing promotion, the contracting authority did not document which criteria it had applied and on what basis it had selected the successful bidder.
During the construction of a motorway, the contracting authority selected the companies for smaller contracts of up to 20,000 euros solely on the basis of telephone surveys on prices and delivery conditions.
Examinations of this selection were not possible because the surveys were not documented.
Summary findings
The regulations for the examination and evaluation of offers in both countries comply with the requirements of the EU.
However, the details of the procedure and the selection of the persons involved differ from each other.
In Germany, the procedure is more closely regulated than in the Czech Republic by detailed requirements, in particular for the implementation of the multi-eyes principle and for the protection of offers.
The same applies to the specifications on the basis of which the appropriateness of the prices offered must be checked.
In both countries, in some of the procurement procedures examined, it had to be established that essential procedural steps in the examination and evaluation of bids were not or only insufficiently documented.
Without traceability and transparency of the examination and evaluation decisions, however, possible manipulative interventions are encouraged.
A particularly serious defect was the handover of all offers to third parties without the contracting authority having previously sufficiently reviewed and documented the offers, thereby protecting them from possible manipulation in further proceedings.
If contracting authorities carry out tasks in the examination and evaluation of offers by third parties, sufficient precautions and an increased control effort are required to counter the increased risk of manipulation.
When assessing the adequacy of prices, the audited services in Germany did not always make full use of the specified instruments and did not sufficiently examine the price structure of the offers.
In the Czech Republic, complaints arose in particular with regard to the aptitude test and the application of the evaluation criteria.
Conclusion of the award procedure
After checking and evaluating the bids, the award procedure is concluded by awarding the surcharge or by cancelling the procedure.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
In the case of EU-wide procurement procedures, all bidders must be informed in advance of the planned award decision.
Companies have the opportunity to examine the intended award in the case of notification by electronic means or by fax within 10 days or, in the case of other means of communication, within 15 days and, if necessary, to initiate a review procedure.
A contract may not be concluded before the expiry of this information period.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
If a bidder submits a request for review within the information period, a contract can only be concluded after the final decision in the review procedure.
Companies can also have the award decision reviewed by an independent court as part of this review process.
The review procedure is intended to ensure the legal protection of companies and to encourage the client to observe procurement law throughout the procurement procedure.
In order to do so, he must document the procedure sufficiently.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have implemented EU rules on information and verification procedures.
In both countries, the awarding authority has to decide on the award of the contract.
However, it may not deviate arbitrarily from the result of a proper examination and evaluation of the offers.
The Customer shall place the order within the announced surcharge period,
Also because the bidders are no longer bound by their offers after the deadline.
In the case of open and non-open procedures or public and restricted tenders, the client may in principle not deviate from the content of the offer when concluding the contract.
The losing bidders must be informed promptly of the award decision and of the reasons for not taking their bids into consideration.
Award procedures may only be cancelled under certain conditions, e.g. if the bid prices are excessive or the bids do not meet the requirements of the tender.
Divergent rules
In the Czech Republic, there is a 10- or 15-day obligation to provide information and wait before awarding a contract, even for construction work not to be awarded throughout Europe.
In Germany, these requirements only apply to the area of EU-wide procurement.
In the other proceedings in Germany, bidders can only be informed of the award decision after the contract has been awarded.
In the Czech Republic, an award procedure must be cancelled if only one bid has been received or only one bid has been evaluated.
In Germany, the contract must also be awarded in the case of only one valid bid, provided that it complies with the conditions of the tender and is economically viable.
Key audit results
BRH
In the case of the audited awards, there were only a few complaints at the conclusion of the award procedures.
Some companies have already received order letters for EU-wide contracts before the expiry of the information deadlines, which may result in the invalidity of the contract.
In individual cases, order letters according to open procedures also contained content deviating from the content of the offer, such as changed dates.
In several cases, the client did not comply with the surcharge periods.
In an open procedure, a contracting authority therefore awarded the contract for the second cheapest offer, as a company with a 50% cheaper offer was no longer willing to carry out the services at the originally offered price after the end of the surcharge period.
NKÚ
In the case of a construction project in the higher education sector, the awarding authority deviated from the content of the bidder's offer in the contract.
For some contracts, such as construction work for road maintenance, the construction of a motorway and a bypass, the contracting authorities concluded the contracts after expiry of the legal deadline.
When awarding construction services for the renovation of former military sites, the awarding authority only forwarded the notification of the award of the contract to all bidders after expiry of the statutory period.
Summary findings
Both countries have implemented the EU requirements for the conclusion of the procurement procedure.
The legal protection of losing applicants or bidders increases the instruments for preventing corruption.
The scope of legal protection in Czech public procurement law is also extended to contracts below the EU thresholds.
In both countries, the deadlines for placing orders were found to have been exceeded.
This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of manipulation.
In future, building administrations should avoid the shortcomings identified in the completion of their procurement procedures.
Documentation, reporting and reporting obligations
The award procedures must be documented in a comprehensible manner during their individual stages with regard to the relevant findings as well as the reasons for the individual decisions.
In the case of EU-wide procedures, the contracts awarded must be made known.
The order data is also recorded in EU statistics.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption The documentation of procurement procedures implements a fundamental requirement of the EU-wide transparency requirement.
A carefully and promptly created documentation only enables the traceability of the award decisions.
In particular, it also provides effective legal protection for bidders when awarding contracts above the EU thresholds.
Proper documentation is also an essential part of preventing corruption, as the compulsion to justify award decisions in detail significantly reduces the scope for manipulation.
The announcement of a contract awarded in an EU-wide procurement procedure must be submitted by the respective contracting authority to the Office for Official Publications of the EU within 48 days.
The Office publishes the notices in the Official Journal of the EU and thus also implements the transparency requirement.
The contracting authorities also have to collect the essential data of their procurement procedures and report them to the EU Commission via the relevant national ministries.
On this basis, the EU Commission produces annual EU statistics through which it can obtain an overview of the development of the internal market in construction services.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have fully transposed the EU legal requirements on documentation and reporting obligations into national law.
The rules on documentation and reporting for EU statistics are largely the same in both countries.
Divergent rules
In the Czech Republic, the publication obligation for awarded contracts is not limited to EU-wide procurement, but also extends to other procurement procedures.
The notice period is shortened to 15 days.
In Germany, in addition to the EU-wide awards, there is a publication obligation only for limited tenders and for hands-free awards from value limits of 25,000 euros or 15,000 euros without value added tax (so-called ex-post transparency).
Below these value limits and in the case of public tenders, only the companies involved in the competition procedure receive information about the award of contracts.
Key audit results
BRH
Documentation
A large number of the audited procurement procedures were not fully documented.
The award notices did not contain all the necessary information, such as the justification of product specifications or references to national regulations.
In a procurement procedure, the contracting authority did not explain why it awarded the contract to a company, even though its offer did not contain mandatory evidence.
In a few cases, the documents of the awarding bodies did not contain all the evidence required for the documentation of the award procedure.
Announcements about the placing of orders
In some EU-wide procurement procedures, contracting authorities failed to publicise the award of contracts.
In the case of further procurement procedures, there was no evidence that the contracting authorities had announced the contracts awarded.
Reporting and reporting obligations
The statistical lists viewed contained the required minimum information. They had been prepared and sent on time.
Ex-post transparency
In most cases, the audited construction administrations published the contract data of the completed procurement procedures.
In the case of a construction management, however, this data was not published due to a transmission error.
The building administration noticed this error only after half a year,
This means that the contract data of the procurement procedures concluded up to then have not been published.
NKÚ
Documentation
In the case of construction measures for the organisation of a major sporting event, the documentation of the award procedures showed considerable shortcomings, mainly due to incorrect information, such as incorrect bid prices in the minutes of the evaluation committees.
In addition, some minutes of the offer openings were not signed.
Announcements about the placing of orders
In the case of several road construction projects, announcements about awarded contracts were only published late or not at all.
Summary findings
The regulations on documentation and reporting and reporting requirements are largely identical in both countries and implement the EU requirements.
In principle, this ensures the transparency of procurement procedures, including the award of contracts.
The regulations to be applied for publication in the Czech Republic go a little further than the requirements in Germany.
The deficiencies identified in the documentation and in the notices partially substantially limited the corruption-preventive effect of these instruments in the respective procurement procedures.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Construction administrations should further improve the transparency of their procurement procedures and award of contracts and fully comply with their reporting and reporting obligations.
Summary evaluation and recommendations
The parallel audits of the NKÚ and the BRH have focused on two main areas that are essential for the award of construction services by public contracting authorities in the Czech Republic and Germany: the application of EU procurement rules and the prevention of corruption.
The provisions of EU law enable cross-border competition to create a European internal market.
Anti-corruption measures serve not only to prevent or at least reduce corruption, but also to avert economic damage and a possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the state.
The audit findings of the two Courts of Auditors on the application of public procurement regulations in both countries and the comparison of these regulations reveal similarities and differences that can be helpful for both countries in the further development of their public procurement law and its application.
Application of EU public procurement rules
Both countries have transposed the EU requirements for the award of construction services into national law.
This gives the Czech Republic and Germany an important common basis for awarding construction services and taking into account the essential requirements of competition, the equal treatment of the companies involved and the transparency of procurement procedures.
The construction administrations of both countries have partly supported these bids to a very large extent by further administrative regulations.
The Czech Republic has largely transferred the requirements for construction works to be awarded throughout the EU to its nationally regulated procurement procedures below the EU threshold.
However, the investigations carried out by the Court of Auditors have shown that the building authorities have not fully complied with the requirements of EU law in all areas.
The construction administration in Germany should further improve the quality of its procurement procedures in order to be able to eliminate the objections raised when implementing the EU requirements.
In particular, the audits carried out in the Czech Republic have identified risks affecting the cost-effectiveness of awards.
For example, incomplete service descriptions necessitated additional services, which were often awarded in breach of legislation. In addition, cost assessments were usually insufficiently drawn up. Also, excessive qualification requirements reduced the number of potential bidders and restricted competition, particularly in the case of transport buildings.
Prevention of corruption
The investigations did not aim to uncover cases of corruption,
Also because the Court of Auditors do not have the appropriate instruments for this purpose.
However, the Court of Auditors can examine the extent to which the administrations of both countries have taken precautions against corruption and manipulation in the award of construction services and how these requirements are applied.
When it comes to preventing corruption, both countries have set different priorities.
Above all, the German regulations provide for largely unrestricted competition as well as transparency and controls as central elements in the prevention of corruption.
The main aim of the Czech regulations is to increase the transparency of procedures.
BRH
In Germany, general principles of corruption prevention apply, which must be applied by the entire federal administration.
These principles are also implemented in the specifications for the award of construction services and are geared to their specific requirements.
In some cases, the relevant regulations specify very precisely how the bids to prevent corruption are to be taken into account in the course of the procurement procedures and in the selection of the persons involved.
In the opinion of the BRH, in particular, the primacy of the principle of open procedure or public tendering is a suitable instrument for substantially reducing the risk of corruption in the award of construction services. Restrictions on competition, on the other hand, increase the risk of manipulative interventions.
Risk analyses and sufficient controls (especially the multi-eyes principle), the requirements for transparency and documentation of procurement procedures as well as various organizational measures are also effective precautions to prevent corruption and manipulation.
The BRH therefore sees no need for fundamental changes to the corresponding requirements of the administrations in the award of construction services.
The rules for preventing corruption are largely taken into account in practice.
The shortcomings identified in some areas have highlighted shortcomings in the implementation of some of the requirements.
The building authorities should continue to train their employees on the requirements for preventing corruption and make them even more aware of this problem.
A substantial part of the complaints related to tasks that the building authorities had delegated to freelancers.
However, without controls and sufficient safeguards, the risk of abuse increases when delegating tasks.
Tasks at risk of manipulation and corruption should therefore only be transferred to third parties if the administration can ensure a sufficient level of protection against impermissible interference.
NKÚ
At government level, the Czech Republic adopted a strategy against corruption in which public procurement is the most important component.
The Public Procurement Act and the associated implementing provisions have been substantially amended.
The audits of the NKÚ took place during the implementation of this strategy.
The strategy adopted and the new legal provisions are likely to be effective improvement measures, as the awarding bodies will have to justify the cost-effectiveness of the award of contracts, the calculation of the expected prices, the adequacy of the qualification requirements, the essential evaluation criteria and the nature of the assessments, and properly document and publish all these aspects.
Recommendations
The NKÚ and the BRH are generally positive about the implementation of the EU requirements.
The widespread acceptance in practice has confirmed that the EU requirements of competition, equal treatment and transparency are an appropriate basis for the award of construction services within the European Union.
The supranational model implemented in the European Union can also serve as a basis for similar projects aimed at facilitating and promoting cross-border competition.
In view of the enormous material and ideal potential for damage caused by manipulation and corruption in the awarding of construction services, both courts of auditors call on the building authorities in their countries to continue and, if necessary, improve their measures against corruption and manipulation.
In particular, the organisation and procedures of procurement procedures should be continuously examined for weaknesses and risks in order to identify the need for action and take appropriate countermeasures.
The comparison of procurement practices in both countries suggests that the proportion of open procedures in the Czech Republic should be increased, as open procedures offer a wider scope for competition and can significantly reduce the risk of corruption.
A greater division of construction services into lots can also have a favourable effect on bid prices, provided that this leads to greater competition with a higher number of bidders.
Ensuring the correct implementation of procurement procedures is an essential basis for efficient procurement by public contracting authorities.
In Germany, procurement procedures are carried out by specialised construction administrations. In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, these tasks – with the exception of transport construction projects – are carried out by the departments themselves or by contractors commissioned by them.
The courts of auditors of both countries have the concern, even after completion of their joint project, to further develop the findings that are important to them and, if necessary, to bring them to the parliament and government of their country.
Both Courts of Auditors are also convinced that the principles of public procurement law set out in this report and its implementation are also of interest to the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) at international level, because the principles and findings presented are of general importance in order to effectively combat corruption and to ensure the economic award of construction services in a well-functioning and fair competition.

Administration of VAT in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany
Report on the audit
Preface
Taxes are the most important source of income for public budgets.
The work of the Court of Auditors should therefore focus on the examination of this area.
This applies in particular to VAT fraud.
This alone results in annual tax losses in the European Union of an estimated EUR 100 billion1.
Already at the 6th EUROSAI Congress 2005 in Bonn, the participants pointed out the need for enhanced cooperation.
This enables the courts of auditors, for example, to exchange audit approaches and optimize audit practice.
Value added tax (VAT) is particularly suitable for cooperation, as it is harmonised within the European Union.
In 2006, the courts of auditors of both states audited for the first time in parallel in the area of VAT.
The corresponding audit report was published in 2008.
As VAT fraud is a widespread phenomenon in the European Union, there is a need for close cooperation between the Court of Auditors, which will allow a comprehensive assessment of whether the measures taken are appropriate to deal with VAT fraud effectively.
The two courts of auditors decided to continue their cooperation and carried out a second parallel audit. Administration of VAT in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany Report on the audit
1. Introduction
Examination number:(CZ) 09/11 (D) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892
Subject of audit: (CZ) Administration of VAT (D) Bilateral audit with the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic (hereinafter NKÚ), control audit
Aim of the examination:
(CZ) The VAT administration and the treatment of selected transactions between entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic (hereinafter CZ) and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter Germany) should be examined. In addition, the procedures used by the tax authorities for intergovernmental administrative assistance should be examined.
(D) The purpose of the audit was to evaluate how the financial administration has implemented the recommendations made by the Court of Auditors.
In addition, further examination fields - linked to the VAT - should be processed.
The findings made here should be compared in order to determine whether the taxation procedures can be optimised.
The audit period covered the years 2006 to 2008, including relevant information from the period prior to the audit period up to the conclusion of the audit.
2. Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel examination
The Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have agreed on a control audit for the administration of VAT.
In the previous parallel investigation, they had identified suspected cases of intra-Community transactions,
Which appeared for the purpose of a further examination.
On the basis of the audit findings, the two courts of auditors made recommendations on the administration of VAT.
The aim of the control review was to evaluate how these recommendations were implemented. In addition, the identified suspected cases should be investigated.
The audit also dealt with other matters. These included selected cases of high-risk intra-Community transactions, mutual assistance in the recovery of VAT claims and the VAT audit of large companies.
The Court of Auditors found that:
1. Recommendations made on the basis of the previous examination
• Recommendation 1: The rules for the registration of taxable persons should be harmonised within the EU
In the first audit, the Court of Auditors compared the registration procedures for VAT in the two states and found differences that caused problems.
The Court of Auditors therefore recommended that the registration of taxable persons within the EU be harmonised.
This has also been taken up at EU level.
The draft amendment to Council Regulation No 1798/2003 provides for the extension of the current databases in the EU, including a database with the VAT identification number.
The draft also provided for common rules for the registration of taxable persons and their possible deletion.
The Court of Auditors expected Member States to agree, in accordance with their decision in principle, on appropriate rules to remove unreliable traders from the VAT system as early as possible.
The Member States reached political agreement in ECOFIN on the latest version of the draft.
The above-mentioned common rules are no longer included, and the two Courts of Auditors regret this.
They still consider such regulations to be important in order to prevent VAT fraud.
• Recommendation 2: Monthly submission of summary notifications As a result of the first audit, the Court of Auditors recommended to Member States that summary notifications (CMs) should in future be submitted on a monthly basis.
The amounts of intra-Community transactions could then be reviewed more promptly.
The deadline for the surrender of CMs has been reduced to one month by Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-Community transactions.
In the CZ, this requirement was implemented by an amendment to the VAT Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.
In Germany, the implementation only entered into force on 1 July 2010. Thus, it has not transposed the obligation for the monthly submission of the ZM into national law in due time.
• Recommendation 3: Data comparison of the VAT pre-registrations and the ZM in Germany for more reliable MIAS data and proposal to examine the consolidation of the procedures for VAT pre-registrations and ZM The German tax administration has taken up the recommendation made by the Federal Court of Auditors and set up a working group to develop possible solutions.
The work is not yet complete.
The Federal Audit Office will monitor further developments.
• Recommendation 4: Exchange on successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level During the first audit, the two Court of Auditors agreed that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by one Member State alone.
Successful criteria as well as elements or approaches of a risk management system must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State.
If this does not happen, fraudsters will focus on the Member State with the weakest risk management system.
The Court of Auditors found that the two Member States apply different risk management systems, which have both strengths and weaknesses.
The NKU examined the system of information exchange within the EU - EUROCANET, while the Federal Court of Auditors focused on German participation in the “Platform for Risk Management”.
2. Control audit of selected intra-Community transactions
During the first audit, the Court of Auditors had jointly examined transactions for which it was doubtful whether they had actually been executed or which had been explained differently by the taxpayers of the two states in the prior VAT declarations (or VAT declarations) or ZM.
The Court of Auditors selected nine cases of intra-Community deliveries of goods between CZ and Germany for the inspection.
The audits by the tax offices (FÄ) of both states had not yet been completed at the conclusion of the first parallel audit.
The audit showed that the tax procedures for these selected transactions have now been completed. The respective tax administrations had taken appropriate measures to this end (e.g. subsequent fixing of VAT or the prevention of pre-tax refunds).
3. Examination of selected, particularly risky intra-Community transactions
The audit also included highly risky intra-Community transactions between taxable persons in the EU covered by the EUROCANET system.
EUROCANET is used to identify high-risk taxpayers.
Member States can participate in this system on a voluntary basis.
CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET. Germany has a passive status, i.e. it does not participate in data exchange within the framework of EUROCANET.
From the point of view of an active participating State, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to actively participate.
As a result, no information could be obtained about which suppliers with a German VAT ID would have been classified as high-risk cases.
In the selected sales, the NKU identified both normal business transactions and those with suspected VAT fraud, including carousel fraud.
The FÄ could examine sales with high risk only to a limited extent. This applied in particular with so-called „Missing Traders “, whereby an examination of the documents alone is hardly sufficient to prove fraud to the taxpayer.
Suspected carousel fraud in imports and exports
It is recommended that customs and tax authorities work more closely together to track the identity of the goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final consumer.
Germany and a number of other countries have rejected active participation in EUROCANET because, from their point of view, there is no sufficient legal basis.
The Federal Court of Auditors found that the German financial administration uses other instruments to identify high-risk taxpayers.
However, there is a need for communication and exchange of experience between all EU Member States.
The Council of the EU agreed on a draft Regulation:
Created by the Eurofisc.
The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should be incorporated into the planned network for combating VAT fraud.
4. Mutual assistance in the recovery of receivables
Intergovernmental mutual assistance in the recovery of claims is subject to the same European legislation in all Member States.
Therefore, requests for intergovernmental administrative assistance in the recovery of claims in the CZ and Germany are processed in the same way.
The Federal Court of Auditors and the NKU compared the statistics submitted by both Member States to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.
These statistics contained inconsistencies.
The two Court of Auditors consider it useful to have a renewed discussion on the statistics at EU level in order to avoid any remaining discrepancies in the future.
If this does not happen, the statistics cannot be used appropriately for comparisons.
In addition, the statistics should contain more information on VAT.
An analysis of detailed data can make it easier for the Commission to support Member States in their efforts to combat VAT fraud.
Both Court of Auditors consider that Member States with a low recovery rate should strive to achieve at least the average recovery rate.
The Commission should support the Member States in this, if so desired.
5. VAT testing at large companies
The Court of Auditors analysed the legal situation with regard to the VAT audit of large companies in both states.
In addition, they used a questionnaire to collect information from the financial administrations that they considered important in this context.
It became clear that the situation in both countries is different.
The CZ has a system for selecting high-risk cases that includes a large amount of relevant data (including information on VAT audits, data from balance sheets, and profit and loss statements).
The VAT control can thus be effectively controlled and analysed as a whole.
A special tax office for large enterprises is to be set up in 2012.
There is still no comparable system in Germany. This makes it difficult to control and analyse VAT control as a whole.
The German financial administration focuses more on the selection of relevant individual cases and relies in particular on data from the VAT pre-registrations or VAT declarations and the ZM.
Various risk management components, which are still to be improved, support the evaluation of this data.
3. Examination procedure
3.1 Examination procedure in the Czech Republic
Division II - State Budget Revenue and Regional Divisions IX Pilsen, X České Budějovice, XIII Brno and XV Ostrava audited in the period from May 2009 to February 2010.

3.2 Examination procedure in Germany
The examination area traffic taxes and employees of the assigned PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt/Main and Munich examined from February 2009 to February 2010.
After selecting the sample cases, they announced the examination in several countries:
• Bavaria, • Hamburg, • Hesse, • North Rhine-Westphalia, • Saxony. They also conducted interviews at the Federal Ministry of Finance (Federal Ministry of Finance).
Tax files from the following departments were included in the audit: • Erlangen, Zentralfinanzamt Munich, Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Grafenau; • Hamburg-Nord, Hamburg-Hansa, Sonderfinanzamt Hamburg for large companies; • Wiesbaden I, Wiesbaden II, Darmstadt; • Essen-NordOst, FA Essen for tax audits of large companies and corporations, Lüdenscheid; • Chemnitz-Süd.
In addition, discussions were held with the FÄ Mühlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-Süd and the OFD Frankfurt/Main, Chemnitz and Münster.
The Federal Court of Auditors informed the Federal Ministry of Finance of the audit results in April 2010.
3.3 Cooperation between the two Courts of Auditors
Prior to the parallel audit, the representatives of both Court of Auditors met in September 2008 to discuss and define the audit topics.
In December 2008, the Presidents of both Courts of Auditors signed the agreement on cooperation in the parallel audit.
At a meeting in Bonn in June 2009, the examination teams informed themselves about the initial results obtained during the preparation of the examination, discussed possible examination approaches and agreed on how to proceed.
A second meeting took place in Prague from 2 to 4 December 2009.
The audit teams exchanged the audit knowledge gained up to then and agreed on the schedule for the preparation of the joint audit report.
The two courts of auditors defined the following topics for their parallel audit: • Evaluation of the recommendations made in the previous report; • Review of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between taxable persons from the CZ and from Germany, which could not be fully clarified during the first parallel audit; • Review of selected intra-Community transactions classified as risky between taxable persons from the CZ and Germany; • Examination of the procedures of the two tax administrations with regard to intergovernmental administrative assistance in the recovery of VAT claims; • VAT audits of large companies.
The report on the results of the parallel audit was prepared during a working meeting in June 2010.
4. Examination of the administration of VAT in selected areas
4.1 Implementation of the recommendations from the first joint audit
4.1.1 Implementation of the recommendations in the Czech Republic
Recommendation 1
Harmonisation of conditions for the registration of taxable persons within the EU Supported
Based on the results of the first audit, the Czech Court of Auditors recommended adjusting the requirements for VAT registration and introducing new rules for the cancellation of registration in the CZ.
These amended rules should more effectively reduce the risk of possible tax evasion.
In certain cases, it was found that the FÄ did not delete the VAT registration of taxable persons if they did not comply with their obligations under Czech Law No. 235/2004 (hereinafter referred to as the “VAT Act”).
So far, the Czech Ministry of Finance has not submitted an amendment to require the FÄ to be cancelled if taxpayers repeatedly fail to file VAT returns.
According to the Czech VAT Act, the FA may ex officio cancel the registration of a taxable person if a) the taxable person has not made any transactions for twelve consecutive months and has not informed the FA of the reasons for this; b) the taxable person has not fulfilled his obligations under the VAT Act; c) the taxable person no longer fulfils the requirements for tax liability.
The first examination had shown that, due to the existing legal situation, FA Prague 1 must delete the VAT registration of “foreign taxable persons”3 with effect from 31 January of the following calendar year if they were not obliged to register and pay VAT in the current calendar year.
The FA Prague 1 often did not delete the VAT registration of these taxable persons because the relevant provision of the deadline could not be adequately implemented in practice.
The problem was solved by the amendment of the VAT Act, which came into force on 1 January 2009.
Accordingly, the FA is entitled to delete the registration of a foreign taxpayer if he has provided neither taxable nor tax-exempt deliveries of goods or services entitled to input tax deduction in the previous calendar year.
Recommendation 2
Monthly delivery of the ZM
On the basis of the first audit, the Court of Auditors had recommended that the monthly levy of ZM be introduced.
The Council Directive, which shortened the cycle for the delivery of the ZM to one month, was implemented in the CZ by the VAT Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.
The ZM must now be submitted electronically.
In addition, a ZM must be surrendered if services whose place of performance is to be determined in accordance with § 9 (1) VAT Act are provided for a person registered in another Member State as subject to VAT.
The prerequisite for this is that the recipient is obliged to declare and pay the VAT for these services. This obligation arises from Council Directive 2008/8/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC as regards the location of the service.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of the data of the VAT pre-registrations and the ZM to increase the reliability of the MIAS data This recommendation referred to the German financial administration.
In its ATIS4 system, the Czech financial administration automatically compares the data on intra-Community transactions from the VAT declarations and the ZM.
Recommendation 4
Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level
The proper collection of VAT is a sine qua non for the proper functioning of the EU internal market.
Therefore, the fight against VAT fraud is of primary interest and has received considerable attention in recent years.
The importance of this is demonstrated, among other things, by a study published by the European Commission in October 2009.
In it, an external expert estimated the VAT loss incurred for the 25 Member States in the period 2000 to 2006. After evaluation of the available data, the tax loss for this period was estimated at EUR 90 to 113 billion, on the basis that the EU-25 lose an average of 12% of the turnover taxes they are entitled to each year.
The estimated tax loss for the CZ in 2006 was 18%.
The first audit found that a Member State cannot develop an effective risk management system (RMS) on its own.
Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each Member State.
With regard to the RMS, the Czech Court of Auditors examined the system for the exchange of information within the EU (EUROCANET).
Risky intra-Community transactions carried out by taxable persons within the EU and recorded in EUROCANET were selected for this purpose (see Chapter 4.3).
The aim of the Eurofisc network is to optimise administrative assistance in tax matters and to combat VAT fraud more effectively. Cooperation between the competent authorities is to be improved in order to detect fraud as early as possible.
Later, Eurofisc could be used as a tool to assess the risk potential of intra-Community transactions.
The ECOFIN Council6 already approved Eurofisc on 7 October 2008 and at the same time adopted the principles for the functioning of the system.
EUROCANET, developed by the Belgian financial administration in cooperation with the other Member States and with the support of the European Commission and OLAF7, serves as a model for Eurofisc.
The purpose of the system is to detect risky transactions and to identify entrepreneurs involved in organised VAT fraud.
4.1.2 Implementation of the recommendations in Germany
The evaluation of the recommendations in the first report led to the following findings:
Recommendation 1
Harmonisation of conditions for the registration of taxable persons within the EU
The German tax administration has developed a well-functioning system for the registration of taxpayers on the basis of a detailed questionnaire.
The Federal Ministry of Finance presented this system to the Commission in October 2007.
The system itself is constantly being improved.
The data provided in the questionnaire are now collected electronically and are later available for research. They are therefore part of the risk management during registration.
The Commission had made a proposal8 to amend Regulation 1798/2003, which included common standards for the registration and cancellation of taxable persons.
There was still a need for clarification and clarification from the Member States.
The Federal Court of Auditors had recommended to the Federal Ministry of Finance not to fall short of the standards already achieved.
Recommendation 2
Monthly delivery of the ZM
On 8 April 2010, a law9 on the transposition of EU directives into national law was adopted.
It contains, inter alia, provisions on the monthly payment of CMs for intra-Community supplies.
And will enter into force on 1 July 2010.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of the data of the VAT pre-applications and the ZM for more reliable MIAS data and considerations for merging the previously separate procedures for filing the VAT pre-applications and the ZM
A joint federal-state working group has been set up,
Which has developed a concept for the automatic comparison of the data from the VAT pre-registration and the ZM.
The concept is still being discussed with the countries.
This working group has also dealt with a concept for optimising the control procedure for intra-Community transactions.
Recommendation 4
Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level Relevant information is exchanged at EU level.
Germany participates in the risk management platform.
The European Commission supported this initiative and, in the written procedure of 18 October 2006, initiated the establishment of a risk management platform within the "Fiscalis 2006-2007" action plan.
The members of the platform dealt with the following topics in 4 subgroups: • Risk management tools, • Influencing the behaviour of taxpayers, • Evaluation, • Updating the guide to risk management.
New reports from the subgroups “Risk Management Instruments” and “Updating the Risk Management Guide” were published at the beginning of 2010.
4.1.3 Evaluation
Registration
The question of the requirements for VAT registration and its deletion in different countries was dealt with at EU level.
The draft amended Council Regulation 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT and repealing Regulation (EEC) 218/92 provides for the extension of current databases within the EU, including a database of VAT identification numbers.
This proposal also includes common standards for the registration and deletion of taxable persons.
The questions of registration and deletion are reserved to the national legislation of the EU Member States until further notice.
There was still a need for clarification and clarification from the Member States.
The Federal Court of Auditors had recommended to the Federal Ministry of Finance not to fall behind the standards already achieved.
The Member States reached political agreement on the latest version of the draft in ECOFIN on 8 June 2010.
Common rules for the registration and deletion of taxable persons are no longer included.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The two courts of auditors regret this. They still consider such regulations to be important in order to prevent VAT fraud.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Monthly delivery of the ZM
With regard to international cooperation, as a result of the previous examination, it was recommended that all Member States introduce the monthly levy of CMs in order to allow an earlier examination of the amounts of intra-Community transactions.
Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax (VAT) for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-Community transactions has reduced the cycle for the payment of the corresponding CMs to one month.
In the CZ, this requirement was implemented by the amendment to the VAT Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.
Germany did not implement the commitment to the monthly ZM levy until 1 July 2010 and thus not on time, while the CZ complied with the requirements of the EU.
Comparison of the data of the VAT pre-applications and the ZM for more reliable MIAS data and considerations for merging the previously separate procedures for filing the VAT pre-applications or the ZM
The German financial administration has taken up the recommendations of the Federal Court of Auditors and set up a working group to develop possible solutions.
The Federal Audit Office will monitor further developments.
Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level
Germany and the CZ use different approaches to identify high-risk entrepreneurs.
The Czech Court of Auditors examined the application of the EUROCANET system in CZ (see Section 4.3).
The Federal Audit Office focused on German participation in the risk management platform.
4.2 Control audit of selected intra-Community transactions
The first audit jointly examined transactions where there were doubts as to whether they had actually been carried out or whether discrepancies had been found in the declarations made by taxpayers in both Member States.
The two Court of Auditors selected for the control examination nine cases of intra-Community deliveries of goods between CZ and Germany for which the tax examination by the tax authorities of the Member State in question had not been completed at the time of the previous joint examination.
1)
A Czech taxable person purchased goods worth €22,686 from a German taxable person in the first quarter of 2005.
The Czech taxable person did not declare the acquisition in his VAT declaration, as the German taxable person did not have a VAT identification number, but only a tax number for domestic German transactions.
Through international administrative assistance in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the competent Czech FA had received information that, according to German VAT law, the supplier of intra-Community goods does not require a VAT identification number in order to benefit from the tax exemption for intra-Community goods deliveries.
The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that, according to an audit by the competent Czech FA, the Czech taxpayer submitted an additional VAT declaration declaring the purchase of goods of the above-mentioned value and at the same time asserting his right to pre-tax deduction of the same amount.
2)
A Czech taxable person is alleged to have purchased goods worth EUR 12 561 from a German taxable person in the fourth quarter of 2004.
However, he stated that he had not purchased the goods and therefore did not declare them in his VAT declaration.
Citing a provision of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the German financial administration refused to process the request because the turnover associated with the acquisition did not exceed the threshold of EUR 15 000.
Since the Czech FA was unable to obtain any documents, the tax audit was inconclusive and the original tax determination remained in place.
The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech FA received two spontaneous reports from Germany in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, according to which the German taxpayer had invoiced the delivery of the goods in question to a Slovak addressee.
The Czech taxable person acquired the goods from the Slovak taxable person and stated the purchase in his regular VAT declaration for the month of October 2004.
3)
A Czech taxable person is alleged to have purchased a car worth EUR 48 500 from a German taxable person in the fourth quarter of 2004.
However, it did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.
In addition, he had not issued a VAT declaration since August 2004. Therefore, the FA set the VAT for the quarter in question at CZK 0.
On the basis of information transmitted from Germany in the course of the international exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the FA requested the taxpayer in March 2007 to file a subsequent tax return, but the taxpayer failed to do so.
As a result of the inspection, it was established that the FA had carried out further audit actions in this tax case in 2007. It had established that the car in question had been sold by the taxable person to a used car dealer in the CZ.
The Czech FA carried out an assessment for the December 2004 taxation period, setting additional taxes of CZK 295 379 for the purchase and resale of goods from another Member State.
The competent Czech court decided to open insolvency proceedings concerning the assets of the Czech taxpayer; an insolvency administrator was appointed.
In the absence of significant assets, the outstanding tax liability is likely to be irrecoverable.
4)
A Czech taxpayer is said to have delivered new vehicles (cars) with a total value of 198 167 euros to Germany in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005.
In response to a request for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, it was stated that tax criminal proceedings were pending against the German taxpayer in Germany.
The Federal Audit Office's audit showed that, after the conclusion of the proceedings, there was evidence of the German taxpayer's involvement in fraud.
The intra-Community purchase of goods was subject to employment taxation in the amount of EUR 182 424 (for 2004) and EUR 369 690 (for 2005).
The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech taxpayer was involved in carousel fraud involving new vehicles.
On the basis of information provided by the German tax authorities, a VAT audit of the Czech taxpayer took place for the tax periods of April, May and June 2005.
Based on the audit findings and the information from the international exchange of information, the FA fixed additional VAT in the amount of CZK 703 031 for May 2005 and CZK 726 551 for June 2005.
5)
Czech taxpayer A is alleged to have purchased a machine with a total value of EUR 58 000 from a German taxpayer in February 2005.
The German taxpayer is said to have delivered a machine worth EUR 88 027 to the Czech taxpayer B in the third quarter of 2004. B, however, denied the purchase.
The inspection by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that B had acquired the machine from a German company with a branch in CZ.
The Czech taxable person A did not specify the purchase of the goods from the German taxable person mentioned in his VAT declaration.
The reply of the German FA to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 showed that the German taxpayer had not made an intra-Community delivery of a machine worth EUR 58 000, but a delivery within the CZ.
In the audit, the Federal Court of Auditors found that the intra-Community delivery of the machine was classified as a domestic delivery after completion of an audit and that the VAT exemption was subsequently refused.
6)
A German taxable person is alleged to have delivered goods worth 11,600 euros to a Czech taxable person in the third quarter of 2004.
The goods were purchased and later sold in Germany, i.e. in 2005.
The audit of the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech FA had made its assessment on the basis of a supplementary VAT declaration which impermissibly showed purchases from another Member State, including purchases in the above-mentioned amount.
The Federal Court of Auditors found that after receiving a response to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the German FA corrected the VAT declaration of the German taxpayer and fixed additional VAT in the amount of 1,600 euros.
Due to the resale of the goods in Germany and the corresponding VAT assessment there, an examination is ongoing.
The ZM of the German taxable person has not yet been corrected, since in Germany only the taxable person who has surrendered the ZM can correct it.
7)
The competent Czech FA received a request for information from the German tax authorities in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 on the issue of the purchase of a car worth EUR 47,400 by a Czech taxable person in February 2005.
After an audit for the 2005 tax period, the Czech FA set the Czech taxpayer's tax liability at CZK 0 and informed the German FA that it could not confirm the acquisition of the car by the Czech taxpayer.
The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the registration of the Czech person obliged to pay VAT had been cancelled because he had failed to comply with his tax obligations.
The Czech FA had forwarded the documents to the Czech police.
The German taxpayer has not yet corrected his information in the ZM, but has appealed against the tax decision.
8)
According to MIAS10, between the third quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, a German taxable person delivered goods to a Czech taxable person with a total value of EUR 33 205, which he did not declare as an intra-Community purchase.
The audit of the Czech Court of Auditors found that the Czech FA investigated the reasons for the discrepancies.
The Czech taxpayer repeatedly made subsequent VAT declarations for the first quarter of 2005.
However, the Czech FA was unable to clarify the difference in the amount of purchases amounting to CZK 134 273 in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005. It justified this on the grounds that revenues for individual quarters could not be accurately allocated and accepted the VAT declarations made.
9)
A German taxable person had delivered goods worth 46 854 euros to a Czech taxable person in the third quarter of 2004.
For the same period, the Czech taxpayer declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only EUR 14 856.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the Czech FA checked the actual value of the delivery.
With the German response to this request, three invoices were sent showing a total value of the delivered goods of EUR 31 998, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech taxpayer and the MIAS data.
According to the results of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors, after repeated warnings from the FA in January 2007, the Czech taxpayer had submitted a subsequent VAT declaration for the July 2004 tax period.
With this declaration, the taxpayer simultaneously asserted his right to deduct input tax. Therefore, his tax liability for the relevant tax period remained unchanged.
The audit confirmed that most of the tax procedures relating to the sales selected for the audit had been completed and that the tax administrations in CZ and Germany had taken appropriate measures (e.g. subsequent fixing of VAT or prevention of pre-tax refunds).
4.3 Examination of selected cases of risky intra-Community transactions
4.3.1 Findings in the Czech Republic
EUROCANET can be an important source of information for identifying high-risk taxpayers in the Member State of acquisition.
In the CZ, the early warning information obtained from EUROCANET is checked by the responsible FA at the buyers.
Since the first quarter of 2008, CZ has included information on turnover and taxable suppliers deemed to be at risk in the EUROCANET system.
Nine Czech taxpayers were selected for the audit,
Which had been entered into EUROCANET by the financial administrations of other Member States, either as suppliers or purchasers.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Since the German financial administration did not participate in the data exchange via EUROCANET, it could not be determined whether suppliers with a German VAT identification number were classified as risky by the German financial administration.
The audit identified both normal business transactions and those in which there was a suspicion of carousel fraud or other VAT fraud.
In the cases concerned, the FÄ exchanged information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003,
For example:
• When examining the early warning information, the FÄ did not detect any suspicion of risky transactions.
The taxpayers concerned were constantly monitored because their data was stored in EUROCANET.
• In the audits of risky transactions, the FÄ did not succeed in using the submitted accounting documents to prove violations of the rules for calculating the tax base and VAT, even though they found inconsistencies in the transport and storage of the goods or revealed business relationships with shell companies from other Member States.
• The review of individual transactions was complicated because certain taxable persons did not cooperate with the FÄ and could not be contacted.
The competent authorities checked most of the risky taxable persons and transactions mentioned in EUROCANET's early warning reports.
However, their options for checking risky sales, especially so-called “missing traders”, are limited.
In particular, a mere examination of the documents can hardly provide evidence of fraudulent action on the part of the taxpayer.
Stricter requirements for the registration of taxable persons for VAT purposes and greater flexibility in the deletion of registrations would be helpful to combat VAT fraud.
The taxpayers involved in fraudulent carousel transactions can be registered for VAT purposes in order to fake fictitious deliveries of goods throughout the EU or to issue formally correct tax documents to other taxpayers, with which they then assert unjustified claims for deduction of input tax.
In the event of suspected carousel fraud in connection with imports and exports, it is recommended that customs and tax authorities cooperate more closely in order to trace the identity of the goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final consumer.
Member States can participate in EUROCANET on a voluntary basis.
The fact that three large Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not participate was seen by the European Parliament at the end of 200811 as a weakness of the system, which should be remedied by setting up a EUROFISC network with mandatory participation.
4.3.2 Findings in Germany
The Federal Audit Office evaluated data available at the Federal Central Tax Office, including data from EUROCANET.
They served as the basis for the selection of six German taxpayers whose files were reviewed.
Both Germany and a number of other countries refused to actively participate in EUROCANET.
That is why Germany has a passive status, i.e. it does not send data to Brussels itself, but is only the recipient of EUROCANET data.
This is justified by the fact that “from the point of view of the Federal Government
No clear legal basis [exists] that would make it possible to break the tax secrecy that exists in Germany.
In addition, the Federal Government has no reliable knowledge of how information sent by the Member States is processed within the framework of EUROCANET."12 Since October 2007, the Federal Central Office for Taxes has been evaluating the EUROCANET data and transmitting it to the financial authorities of the Federal Government and the Länder on the basis of a coordinated procedure.
The German tax authorities receive control notifications on the direct business relationships of taxpayers registered in EUROCANET with companies from other EU countries.
However, the respective German FA does not receive any information on whether the company from the aforementioned other EU Member State has business relations with a company based in another Member State, which also has a business relationship with the German company from the control notification.
4.3.3 Evaluation
CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has only a passive status.
From the point of view of an active participant, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to actively participate.
Accordingly, the examination had to be carried out differently in this area.
However, significant differences with regard to the success in detecting VAT fraud could not be detected. The reason for this is that EUROCANET is only one component of the risk management system.
However, the financial administrations of both countries have a variety of other tools at their disposal to detect fraudulent transactions. Nevertheless, it is necessary to develop a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.
The Council of the European Union agreed on a draft regulation13 establishing Eurofisc, a network for combating VAT fraud.
The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should be shared by the Member States at European level and incorporated into this network.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The cases brought before the courts at national and European level show that there is a need for discussion between the Member States and the Commission on the conditions for tax exemption for intra-Community transactions.
4.4 Mutual assistance in the recovery of receivables
4.4.1 Intergovernmental administrative assistance for the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic
Legislation on intergovernmental administrative assistance for the recovery of certain claims in the EU is essentially based on:
Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to measures forming part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as levies and customs duties;
Council Directive 2001/44/EC amending Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to measures forming part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as levies and customs duties and relating to VAT and certain excise duties; and
Commission Directive 2002/94/EC laying down detailed rules for the implementation of certain articles of Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to certain levies, duties, taxes and other measures.
The CZ implemented Council Directive 76/308/EEC through Act No. 252/2000 on intergovernmental administrative assistance for the recovery of certain claims.
Following the adoption of Council Directive 2001/44/EC, this too had to be transposed into Czech law. At the same time, the aforementioned law had to be amended.
In this context, Amendment No. 191/2004 on intergovernmental administrative assistance for the recovery of certain claims was adopted.
A new piece of relevant legislation was adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1179/2008 of 28 November 2008.
The annexes to this regulation contain new application forms to be used from 1 January 2009. Furthermore, the regulation makes electronic transmission mandatory and obliges the requesting authority to certify the conformity of all sent documents with the respective original.
The main principles of international mutual assistance for the recovery of claims are:
1. The principle of reciprocity applies;
2. Administrative assistance shall always be provided only on request and if all conditions are met;
3. Administrative assistance shall not extend to claims which constitute a criminal sanction in the requested State;
4. The procedure of intergovernmental administrative assistance for the recovery of claims must be carried out in accordance with the national law of the requested State;
5. In the recovery procedure, foreign claims do not take precedence over domestic claims;
6. Administrative assistance shall only be provided for the recovery of undisputed claims;
7. The principle of exhaustion applies: the requesting State shall use all means to which it is entitled under national law to recover the claim.
Law No. 191/2004 provides for three forms of administrative assistance: provision of information, notification of legal acts and actual recovery.
Procedure for outgoing requests to other EU Member States
The competent FA shall transmit the request for information, the request for notification of legal acts or the request for recovery together with the relevant documents electronically via the relevant Financial Directorate to the Ministry of Finance of the CZ.
The Ministry of Finance of the CZ arranges the translation of the request into the relevant language, scans it with all attachments and sends it via the communication network or the common interface CCN/CSI of the competent financial authority of the State concerned.
A request for recovery assistance must meet the following condition: the claim must exceed EUR 1 500 and must not be older than five years.
The requested authority may refuse recovery if the requirements are not met.
Procedure for incoming requests from other Member States
The receipt of requests from other Member States must be confirmed by the CZ Ministry of Finance as soon as possible, at the latest within seven days.
If it decides not to grant the request, it must inform the requesting authority of the reasons for the refusal, specifying the specific provisions of the directive on which it is based.
The corresponding notification must be sent no later than three months after the date of receipt of the confirmation of receipt of the request.
Upon receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance will check whether the request meets all legal requirements.
Thereafter, it shall transmit the request to the competent FA via the financial directorate concerned. If the request for recovery is granted, the FA shall, among other things, determine the financial circumstances of the debtor, e.g. by means of excerpts from the land register, information about existing bank accounts and registration of motor vehicles with the registration office.
After six months from the date of receipt of the confirmation of receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ shall inform the requesting authority of the outcome of the investigation.
The requesting authority must also be informed if the taxable persons concerned cannot be reached and the claim cannot therefore be recovered.
All sums successfully collected must be transferred to the requesting authority within one month of collection.
The Czech FA dealing with the recovery may, with the consent of the requesting State, agree on the claim for hours or payment in installments.
The interest or default surcharges imposed on the debtor for the period of default pursuant to Act No. 337/1992 on the Administration of Taxes and Fees
Belong to the requesting State.
In 2006 and 2007 in particular, the CZ Ministry of Finance delayed sending the requests for recovery to the competent FA.
The same applied to the forwarding of requests for recovery made by the Czech FÄ to the competent authority in the requested state.
The audit found that the Ministry of Finance had breached the Act on Intergovernmental Administrative Assistance for the Recovery of Claims. It had failed to inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State of the state of play of the recovery procedure within six months of confirmation of receipt of the request.
The situation has improved since 2008.
Statistical data
In accordance with § 13 (4) of Law 191/2004, the CZ Ministry of Finance prepares statistics for the European Commission by 15 March of each year. This includes the number of requests submitted in the previous year and received for information, notification of legal acts and recovery, including the amount of the respective claims.
On the basis of the data provided by the Member States, the European Commission is preparing its report to the Council and the European Parliament on the application of the provisions on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims.
The audit showed that in 2008 the CZ Ministry of Finance under-reported the claims by 5 250 000 euros. The reason was the incorrect indication of the amount of a VAT claim submitted in 2008 (caused by the postponement of a decimal point in the conversion of the claim from Czech crowns to euros).
The error was subsequently reflected in the statistics of the European Commission.
Information on mutual recovery assistance is shown in the table below.
4.4.2 Intergovernmental administrative assistance for the recovery of receivables in Germany
The legal basis for intergovernmental administrative assistance in tax matters is the Community standards Council Directive 2008/55/EC of 26 May 2008 (EC Recovery Directive)14 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1178/2008 of 28 November 2008 (EC Implementing Directive).
In order to improve readability and clarity, the EC Contributions Directive codified Council Directive 76/308/EEC of 15 March 197616, whose provisions had been substantially amended several times.
It regulates, among other things, the recovery of VAT and taxes on income and assets, including the associated interest, fees and default surcharges.
The EC Recovery Directive was transposed into German law by the Recovery Act (EC)17 of 3 May 2003.
The enforcement procedure in Germany is regulated in the Tax Code (AO).
§ 117 paragraph 2 AO provides that the financial authorities may provide intergovernmental legal and administrative assistance by virtue of international treaties and legal norms of the European Communities applicable in national law, as well as by virtue of the EC Official Assistance Act.
Part Six of the AO (§§ 249-346) contains the legal provisions for the enforcement procedure.
The administrative actions of the financial authorities regulate in particular the enforcement and enforcement instructions.
The Federal Ministry of Finance agreed with the representatives of the supreme financial authorities of the Länder on the principles of mutual assistance in tax matters and transferred its own responsibility in this area to the Federal Central Office for Taxation18.
General conditions for the admissibility of a request for recovery assistance are:
• The legal requirements must be fulfilled (§§ 251, 254 AO).
• All recovery funds available in Germany have been exhausted.
• The claims for the recovery of which administrative assistance is requested are incontestable.
• The period between the issue of the enforcement order or the date on which the claim or title became incontestable and the date of the request may not exceed five years.
• The claim must be at least 1,500 euros.
Procedures for outgoing requests to other EU Member States German requests for the recovery of outstanding taxes are forwarded by the FÄ's enforcement authorities via the competent central authority and the Federal Central Tax Office of the foreign authority concerned, e.g. the Czech CLO.
The details are set out in the leaflet on intergovernmental administrative assistance in tax collection (collection) of 19 January 200419.
This leaflet is currently being revised by a federal-state working group and adapted to the new Recovery Directive.
In addition to attachments, the request will be forwarded electronically by the FA to the funding authority.
The latter checks whether it is correct in terms of content and form.
If not, the request will be returned to the relevant FA.
Otherwise, it will be forwarded to the Federal Central Tax Office.
The Federal Central Tax Office will then take over the necessary communication with the relevant foreign authority.
Procedure for incoming requests from other EU Member States
Requests for recovery from other Member States are recorded in the Federal Central Tax Office, which sends a confirmation of receipt within ten days.
It also checks whether the formal requirements are met.
In principle, the Federal Central Tax Office forwards these requests to the funding authority, which forwards them to the relevant FA and monitors the completion.
The Federal Central Office for Taxes also sends interim and final reports.
If the processing of a request takes longer than six months, it reminds the funding authority of the obligation to submit an interim report in accordance with Article 16 of Commission Directive 2002/94/EC.
After examination of the formal and substantive conditions for the admissibility of the request, the enforcement bodies shall announce relevant measures.
All amounts collected must be transferred to the bank account specified in the request within one month of receipt.
Statistical data
Information on mutual recovery assistance between Germany and the CZ for the years 2006 to 2008 (as of 31 December 2008).
4.4.3 Examination of selected recovery cases
A total of 21 intergovernmental requests for recovery between the CZ and Germany were selected for the examination.
It was found that:
1.
On 20 October 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for VAT debts of a Czech taxpayer from the years 2004 and 2005 in the total amount of 3 883 euros (109 820 CZK).
It was not until 26 February 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the competent FA.
In order to secure the claim to be recovered, the Czech FA charged a property belonging to the taxpayer with a land lien.
Since the encumbered property was not sufficient to settle the entire tax liability, an installment payment agreement in the amount of at least CZK 2,000 per month was made with the debtor.
On 31 August 2009, an interim report was sent to the German FA. Accordingly, the taxpayer had in the meantime settled tax debts in the amount of CZK 49 600 (as of 25 August 2009).
The amount was transferred to Germany. Shortly thereafter, on 28 August 2009, a further CZK 3,000 was transferred.
2.
On 7 January 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for recovery of tax debts (VAT, income tax) as well as interest and fees of a Czech taxpayer totalling EUR 180 869 (= CZK 4 434 915).
It was not until 27 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the competent FA.
After checking the bank balances, securities, real estate, motor vehicles and other movable assets, the FA found that the debtor did not have any attachable assets.
On-site investigations also revealed that the debtor had been absent from his permanent residence for almost a year.
His whereabouts in the concentration camp were unknown.
This notification was received by the Czech Ministry of Finance on 6 April 2009 and forwarded to the German Finance Administration on 16 April 2009.
3.
On 21 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for VAT together with interest and fees amounting to a total of 3 139 euros (= 84 846 CZK).
It was not until 6 August 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the competent FA. On 18 February 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance was informed from Germany that the Czech tax debtor had in the meantime settled the debt.
On 9 December 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance informed the Czech FA that the case was closed because the Czech tax debtor had fully paid his debt in Germany.
However, the debt was also settled in the CZ as part of the recovery procedure and the corresponding amount was transferred to Germany on 27 October 2008.
Because of the long time it took the Czech Ministry of Finance to forward the information to the FA, the tax liability was paid twice - by the taxpayer himself in Germany and by means of collection by the competent Czech FA.
In cooperation with the Federal Court of Auditors, it was determined that the amount contributed will be offset against the tax liability from another procedure, which amounts to 6 649 euros and should be transferred to the CZ in September 2008.
In the documents of the Czech Ministry of Finance, there was only one request for recovery in the amount of EUR 3 139 for the company concerned. The request for recovery in the amount of EUR 6 649 could not be found there.
4.
On 15 September 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for income tax, VAT, interest and fees totalling EUR 39 957 = CZK 956 654.
It was not until 19 December 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the competent FA.
The recovery procedure was initiated on 1 June 2009 and a decision was taken on the attachment of the Czech bank balance and the debtor’s salary (CZK 7 000).
During the negotiations with the FA, the debtor did not agree with the amount of the tax liability and the amount was disputed.
According to the Czech FA, the debtor had in the past been willing to pay 250 euros a month, but the responsible German FA did not agree.
The taxpayer agreed to discuss his matter with the German FA to agree on a different amount.
The recovery procedure was not completed at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.
5.
On 19 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for income tax for the year 2005 and VAT for the years 2003 to 2007, together with interest and fees totalling EUR 113 444 = CZK 3 116 304.
Only on 14 November 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to FA Prague 1, which is authorised to deal with tax cases of taxable persons not resident in the CZ; on the basis of the available address, a locally competent FA could not be determined.
During its investigation on 19 September 2008, the FA received information and documents stating that the debtor’s income amounted to 4,704 euros. However, it was unable to issue an enforcement order because the request for recovery had been received after that date.
On 26 January 2009, the Czech FA initiated the recovery procedure and issued an enforcement order for the attachment of the debtor's assets to credit institutions.
The recovery procedure was not completed at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.
6.
On 3 October 2006, the competent Czech FA requested intergovernmental administrative assistance for the recovery of a VAT debt together with procedural costs totalling CZK 146 223 742.
It was not until 13 May 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German financial administration.
On 8 September 2008, the competent German FA transferred the amount of EUR 17 700 = CZK 439 226 to the Czech authorities via the Bundesbank.
When checking the amounts collected, a conversion error was discovered.
The amount to be recovered of 146 223 742 CZK was converted at the exchange rate of 1 euro = 25.065 CZK, but a comma error resulted in an amount of 583 378 euros.
The correct amount to be recovered amounted to 5 833 782 euros.
As a result, a request for recovery which was too low by EUR 5 250 404 was made.
7.
On 1 March 2007, the competent Czech FA requested recovery in respect of a VAT debt together with interest and fees of a Czech taxpayer totalling CZK 1 970 632 = EUR 79 847.
It was not until 10 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the German financial administration.
The German FA ordered the debtor to pay the arrears on 4 February 2009.
Taking into account the significant reduction in the company's revenues in the second half of 2008 and in particular in the first half of 2009 as well as the corresponding liquidity situation, the following payments were made to settle the overdue tax liability. On 8 April 2009 - EUR 4 600, on 6 May 2009 - EUR 3 000 and on 16 June 2009 - EUR 2 500.
These payments were transferred to the account of the responsible FA in the Czech Republic.
On 23 June 2009, a further payment of EUR 2 500 was agreed between the debtor and the FA by 30 June 2009.
8.
On 22 May 2008, the competent Czech FA requested the recovery of tax debts totalling EUR 398 653 = CZK 9 832 779, including real estate transfer tax.
It was not until 2 October 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the German financial administration.
The request was returned in a letter from the German financial administration to the Czech Ministry of Finance dated 3 April 2009.
The German tax authorities justified this on the grounds that the transfer tax was not a tax within the meaning of Article 2(e), (f), (g) and (h) of Directive 2008/55/EC.
In addition, Article 2(g) concerns liabilities arising from taxes on income and assets.
Accordingly, Article 3 of Directive 2008/55/EC applies to taxes on income and assets not referred to in Article 1, paragraphs 3 and 4 of Directive 77/799/EEC.
The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed to send a new recovery request to the German financial administration, which should no longer include the transfer tax arrears of CZK 61 759, but instead the arrears in VAT, corporate and income tax.
The Czech Ministry of Finance received a new request from the competent FA for the recovery of tax debts of the same taxpayer in the amount of CZK 7 079 735.
9.
On 6 February 2006, the competent Czech FA forwarded to the Czech Ministry of Finance a recovery request for income tax and VAT totalling CZK 3 445 782 = EUR 123 328.
The VAT debt amounted to 1 133 967 CZK.
It was not until 18 April 2007 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German tax authorities.
And it was not until 11 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance sent the reply of the German financial administration of 9 July 2007 to the Czech FA.
According to which the German FA had issued an enforcement order for the attachment of the bank account on 11 June 2007. The bank announced that it was not in a business relationship with the named taxpayer.
Thus, the request for the German financial administration was deemed to have been completed.
10.
On 26 September 2005, the competent Czech FA sent the Czech Ministry of Finance a request for recovery of VAT debts totalling CZK 1 296 845 = EUR 43 591.
The competent Finance Directorate submitted the request to the Ministry of Finance on 10 October 2005.
The Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request to the German financial administration on 15 December 2005.
Before submitting the request, the Czech FA enforced the tax claim by seizing bank accounts and salary attachments, as well as by debiting a piece of land.
Prior to the request for recovery, a request for information was sent to the German tax authorities on 16 March 2005.
According to the reply letter of 16 September 2005 to the Czech FA, the Czech taxpayer was resident in Germany and had income from non-self-employed activities amounting to 8 437 euros. On 20 April 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a reply to the request for recovery and did not pass this on to the competent Czech FA until 12 February 2008.
According to this, the tax liability in Germany is irrecoverable due to the insolvency of the debtor.
No assets had been found, the income from non-self-employment was already the subject of other enforcement measures.
The German financial administration thus regarded the request as settled.
4.4.4 Comparison and Evaluation
In the case of recovery, the provisions of EU law apply to all EU Member States for intergovernmental administrative assistance.
The procedures for processing requests are therefore similar in CZ and Germany.
The Federal Court of Auditors and NKÚ compared the statistics submitted by the two Member States to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.
There were disagreements.
In its 200620 report, the European Commission recommended that Member States prepare their statistics with greater care.
In 200921, the Commission concluded that, despite a greater number of requests for assistance, discrepancies in the statistics had been reduced.
Both Court of Auditors consider it useful to have a renewed discussion at EU level on the statistics so that the remaining discrepancies can be avoided in the future.
If this does not happen, the statistics are conditionally meaningful and cannot be used for comparisons.
In addition, the Court of Auditors consider that the statistics should show both the annual number of requests and the type of claims (e.g. VAT, income tax) and the amounts collected per Member State.
Through a more detailed analysis of the statistics provided by Member States, the Commission could help Member States to assess their measures to combat VAT fraud.
Since the recovery rate can be calculated per Member State, the Court of Auditors argue that Member States with low rates should aim for at least the average recovery rate within the EU.
At the request of a Member State, the Commission could play an active role in this.
The foreign recovery requests received by the Ministry of Finance CZ were forwarded to the competent authorities with a delay, in particular in 2006 and 2007.
The same applies to the requests for recovery made by the Czech FÄ.
The examination showed that the Czech Ministry of Finance violated Law No. 191/2004 on intergovernmental recovery assistance insofar as it did not inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State of the progress of the recovery measures within the six-month period from confirmation of receipt of the request.
4.5 Value Added Tax Examination for Large Enterprises
4.5.1 VAT audit of large companies in the Czech Republic
General
The taxation procedure for large companies is subject to the same rules that apply to other taxable persons.
The audit of large enterprises is regulated by the Czech Act No. 337/1992, the “Tax and Fee Management Act”.
The Czech Ministry of Finance defines large enterprises as natural persons who have established a business or legal persons who have been established to carry out a business and whose net turnover for the relevant tax period amounts to at least CZK 2 billion according to the income or corporate tax return.
The taxable person is classified as a large company based on the level of turnover according to the income or corporate tax return in the respective tax period; for the first time for the year 2003.
A natural or legal person is no longer managed as a large company for turnover tax purposes if in three consecutive assessment periods its net turnover in the tax period amounts to less than CZK 2 billion. The period begins at the end of the tax period, for which the requirements were met for the first time according to the tax return.
A taxable person can only be removed from the list of large companies if at least one type of tax has been previously assessed for a tax period.
By the end of 2009, all large companies had been audited at least every five years.
Since 2010, taxpayers have to be assessed in writing at least every two years. The subsequent control measures are intended to eliminate the tax risks and their negative effects on proper tax determination and collection.
The audits by the FÄ should focus on at least one type of tax; they usually cover several tax periods.
The taxable large companies were audited by the special audit bodies or audit services of the responsible FÄ, which were set up at a total of 13 FÄ.
A special audit office carried out audits in its local area of responsibility in accordance with the instructions of the Head of the Finance Directorate.
In addition, it also examined
Taxable persons with unusual and special business activities and
Those whose examination required a high degree of expertise and time.
Taxable persons with a complex distribution of locations and organisational structure are also examined,
Taxpayers suspected of large-scale tax evasion
As well as taxable persons belonging to chains and networks suspected of large-scale tax evasion and unjustified deduction of input tax.
Information on the number of audits carried out by the special audit bodies of the FÄ and the additional tax results of these audits are shown in Table No. 3.
The Czech Ministry of Finance has submitted a proposal to amend Law No. 531/1990 for the regional financial authorities. In particular, it proposes the establishment of a special tax office with nationwide jurisdiction for selected taxable persons (legal persons established for the purpose of economic activity, with a turnover of at least CZK 2 billion).
4.5.2 Examination of value added tax at large companies in Germany
General
The VAT audit of large companies is not particularly regulated in Germany. For company audits, the general regulations apply • the Abgabenordnung (AO), • the Finanzverwaltungsgesetz (FVG) and • the Betriebsprüfungsordnung (BPO).
There are also work aids.
Order of taxation
The provisions of §§ 193 to 203 AO "Section 4 -External Audit" contain in particular rules for the admissibility of an external audit and its substantive scope, distribution of responsibilities, form and content of the audit announcement, audit principles, the taxpayer's obligation to cooperate and requirements for final discussions as well as for the transmission of the audit report.
External inspections are carried out by the competent FÄ (§ 195 AO).
Financial Administration Act According to § 5 paragraph 1 No. 1 in conjunction with § 19, it is the responsibility of the Federal Central Office for Taxes to participate in external audits of the FÄ.
The nature and scope of this cooperation will be agreed between the authorities involved.
In addition, the Federal Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt für Steuer) may require that certain well-known companies be audited at a certain time.
In this case, it can lay down rules for the external audit of these taxpayers.
Audit Regulations Pursuant to Article 108 paragraph 7 GG, the Audit Regulations (BpO 2000) were issued with the approval of the Federal Council.
It applies to external audits of the state tax authorities and the Federal Central Tax Office.
In accordance with § 3 BPO, the companies are regularly classified into size classes.
Large companies are to be subjected to a follow-up inspection (Section 4.2 BPO).
In accordance with Section 33.1 BPO, each competent financial authority must maintain a group directory within the meaning of the regulation.
Working aids for the administration
In addition, the following work aids have been issued for the administration:
• “Unified Manual for the VAT Special Examination”;
• TurnoverTax-Country-Online - USLO (= dialogue system in the intra-Community VAT control procedure) with instructions on how to use the data contained in the MIAS on intra-Community business relations;
• Work aids for difficult and special situations.
• Central database for the storage and evaluation of VAT fraud cases and development of risk profiles -ZAUBER;
Taxpayers are classified into size classes based on criteria such as turnover and profit, although the limit values vary depending on the line of business.
The figures are published by the Federal Ministry of Finance.
The values are reviewed every three years and set for the following three years.
The number of companies - not just large companies - can be determined on a regular basis (last cut-off date: 1 January 2010).
In general, large companies have to be thoroughly checked.
The tests are announced and usually also extend to the VAT,
This means that the audit covers all relevant taxes, namely income or corporation tax as well as trade and VAT.
The sales tax can be checked either by company auditors or VAT special auditors.
The practice varies and depends on the administrative structure of each country.
The number of tax periods covered by an audit usually varies between three and five years.
The BPO 2000 assumes a period of three years.
All taxes to which a company has been assessed are subject to the audit.
4.5.3 Management of the VAT audit at large companies
In accordance with the agreement, both courts of auditors did not examine individual cases. They investigated the question of how the tax administrations proceed with the VAT audit of large companies.
With the help of a questionnaire, they collected information from the tax administrations that is essential for the audit of large companies.
• Which statistical records and evaluations for the VAT audit of large companies are available to the management of the tax administration?
In particular:
• Are there any statistics or records on the extent to which a distinction is made between VAT fraud control and general VAT testing?
CZ: No, the current version of the ATIS system does not allow such a distinction.
Germany: The financial administration does not distinguish between audits to combat VAT fraud and general VAT audits.
• Are there any statistics or records on the timeliness of the exams?
CZ: Information on the timeliness of audits of intra-Community purchases of selected VAT payers is recorded in the ATIS system;
The same applies to information about the start and end of the FA examination.
Germany: No, the statistics for auditors compiled at federal level only contain information on the so-called average last audit period (year).
This figure does not provide an overview of the audit periods selected for individual companies.
VAT special auditors concentrate on the last VAT investment periods and are also authorised to audit large companies.
The federal statistics for VAT special auditors do not contain any information on the size class of the audited company.
• Are there statistics or records of the type of surplus result; e.g. divided by:
I. genuine additional result (e.g. application of a reduced rate instead of the general VAT rate)
II. improper surplus result (e.g. relocation/postponement of a matter not objectionable under VAT law to another tax period)
III. Cash effectiveness (payment of the fixed surplus result)
CZ:
The Czech tax administration monitors the number of tax audits carried out, the amount of the tax surplus broken down by tax type, the number of taxable persons audited and the number of tax periods audited.
Other tax procedures (on-the-spot investigations, dunning procedures) are monitored in the same way.
Regardless of this, the amount of subsequent payments and incoming payments are recorded.
Statistics on tax debts are broken down by type of tax. However, no distinction is made between tax debts incurred as a result of a tax return and those resulting from the FA's audit activities.
Germany: No, the statistics compiled at federal level for auditors and VAT special auditors do not differ according to the above criteria.
Most financial authorities, where local surveys were carried out, did not differentiate in this respect either.
• Are the relevant examination fields recorded?
CZ: Yes, the FA can select test cases on the basis of criteria linked to selected indicators stored in the ATIS system.
Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for auditors and VAT special auditors do not provide such information.
However, the finance ministries of the Federal Government and the Länder have agreed on a common approach.
Accordingly, auditors and tax investigators of the Länder have to enter the additional tax result achieved by them in ZAUBER if a certain threshold value is exceeded.
In this case, additional information must be provided, e.g. on the origin of the additional VAT result obtained.
• What are the most common findings?
CZ:
- Taxable large companies have claimed unauthorized input tax deduction for purchased deliveries and services,
• which were not used for an entrepreneurial activity in accordance with § 72 (1) CZ UStG;
• which were used for representation expenses in accordance with § 75 (3) CZ UStG;
• due to invoices that do not meet the requirements of § 73 (1) CZ UStG
- taxable large companies have omitted the registration of VAT to be paid as provided for in § 21 (1) CZ UStG.
Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for auditors and VAT special auditors do not provide such information.
Findings on VAT from audits of large companies are not recorded separately by the countries.
The Federal Central Tax Office can, however, evaluate the ZAUBER database, into which auditors and tax investigators of the federal states have to enter the additional tax result achieved by them if a certain threshold value is exceeded.
• Does the financial administration analyse relevant audit areas and draw consequences for strategic management?
CZ: Yes, for example, nationwide inspections are carried out with regard to risky goods and industries.
Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at federal level for auditors and VAT special auditors do not provide any information on particularly “energetic” examination fields.
With regard to the analysis of such information, the benefits and the manner of its further use, there were different views among the survey bodies.
Some senior financial directorates provide such information to the FÄ, but the FÄ are free to use it or not.
4.5.4 Comparison and Evaluation
As a result, it should be noted that large amounts of information are processed automatically in the CZ. Among other things, data from VAT audits as well as key figures from balance sheets, profit and loss calculations are processed in the system.
The CZ is able to control the selection of high-risk cases based on a wide range of information.
The same applies to the evaluation and management of VAT audits in general.
In the CZ, the establishment of a special finance office for large enterprises is planned for 2012.
In Germany, the financial administration does not collect comparable amounts of data.
Accordingly, it is more difficult to perform these tasks in the same way.
The emphasis is more on the selection of relevant individual cases.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
On the basis of the information in VAT pre-applications or VAT declarations as well as examination instructions, qualified examiners select the cases to be examined and ensure the appropriate taxation.
In order to reduce VAT revenue losses and at the same time increase the risk of detection for unreliable entrepreneurs, appropriate management processes and risk management systems must be introduced.

5. Conclusions
The cooperation between the two courts of auditors has proved its worth.
In this way, it was possible to gain necessary insights into the systems used in both countries: This concerns in particular: • intra-community sales, • risk management at VAT, in particular with regard to the selection of risky sales, • recovery of VAT receivables and • VAT audit of large companies.
The audit revealed differences in the strategies for detecting VAT fraud and in the systems described above.
These findings can be used to improve existing procedures.
They can also be used to initiate a discussion among interested parties as to which audit approaches and strategies can be used to combat fraud. This applies, for example, to the relationship within and between the Member States and the EU Commission.
The experience and knowledge gained should encourage us to continue to examine the administration of VAT together in the future.
6th Communique
The report was prepared in Czech, English and German and signed by the Presidents of the Czech Court of Auditors and the Federal Court of Auditors.
State of information: June 2010.
