High-quality transport networks are essential for maintaining and improving living standards in Europe.
It is an important task for the state to ensure fast, safe, reliable and economic passenger and freight transport.
THIS segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
It requires a high degree of organizational, technical and financial effort.
When building and developing a sustainable European transport infrastructure, difficult compromises often have to be made with European and national political goals, such as protecting the environment.
It is precisely because of the necessary environmental measures that the construction of the transport infrastructure is costly.
When planning and allocating the construction of transport routes, administrations can save substantial financial resources by careful action and decision-making and use them for other useful purposes.
One of the tasks of state audit authorities is to identify deficiencies that prevent optimum austerity, profitability and effectiveness in transport infrastructure construction expenditure.
The audit authorities should not only inform the administrations of the deficiencies identified, but also present suggestions for improvement for the benefit of citizens and for the benefit of Europe.
Summary
In 2005 and 2006, the two Supreme Audit Authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic, the Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) and the Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad (NKÚ) carried out parallel audits of expenditure on the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway (Autobahn D 8 in the Czech Republic and motorway A 17 in the Federal Republic of Germany).
The two motorways are connected by a border bridge jointly funded by both states.
The cooperation with the NKÚ enabled the BRH to examine in depth the economic viability of the use of funds during the construction of the border bridge.
As part of its cooperation with the BRH, the NKÚ received data from German bridges and tunnels for its own cost comparisons.
In 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany signed a contract for the construction of the border bridge.
According to the progress of planning, the date of completion was finally set at the end of 2006
During the award procedure, however, the Road and Motorway Directorate of the Czech Republic (RMD) made mistakes that delayed the procedure and reduced the available construction time.
The contract with the contractor was therefore concluded later than planned.
The contractor assured the accelerated construction of the bridge until the end of 2006
However, the RMD had to accept significant additional costs.
As part of the joint examination activity, the prices of motorway bridges on the D 8 and the A 17 were compared. The scale of the price comparison of the bridges was the size of the bridge surface.
A price analysis using statistical methods identified bridges with high cost per square meter.
The analysis showed that the border bridge under the large bridges with lengths exceeding 100 m was the most expensive.
This was also due to the price increase resulting from the delays in the award.
The comparison of the prices of tunnels showed that the prices of tunnels in the course of the D 8 were considerably higher than the prices of comparable tunnels in Germany.
In future audits of the economic efficiency of transport infrastructure expenditure, both BRH and NKÚ can rely on a data collection of bridge and tunnel prices.
Both Court of Auditors recommend standardizing bridge constructions and only carrying out steel composite and special constructions where reinforced concrete constructions are inappropriate.
The exam course was characterized by teamwork and an open approach.
During the parallel examination, the examiners of both sides exchanged their expertise and skills.
Introductory
This report deals with parallel checks on expenditure on construction of the motorway from Dresden to Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and A 17 in Germany).
The focus of the exam was austerity, economy and effectiveness of the use of funds.
The parallel tests were carried out by the BRH in Germany and the NKÚ in the Czech Republic
in 2005 and 2006 through.
The NKÚ examined austerity, profitability and effectiveness of expenditure on the border section 0807 of the D 8 motorway at a rate of approx. CZK 20 billion gross (approx. 690 million €).
Of this amount, 64 million will be donated. € from EU Structural Funds (ISPA).
The BRH had already tested planning and construction of the A 17 motorway independently of the parallel tests with the NKÚ in the years 2003 to 2005
From the financial volume for the construction of all three sections of the A 17 of approx. 670 million € will be 277 million € co-financed from European Fund (ERDF).
The motorway Prague - Dresden is part of the Pan-European Transport Corridor IV Dresden - Central and Southeast Europe - Istanbul.
The D 8 runs from Prague via Usti nad Labem to the Czech / German border,
The A 17 from the border to Dresden.
At the time of the test, the border sections of the highways were under construction.
Both sections were opened for traffic on 21. December 2006
While the motorway is therefore completed on the German side to Dresden, the D 8 remains incomplete on the Czech side, as the section 0805 of the route is still in the planning phase over a length of 16,4 km between Rehlovice and Lovosice.
This is where the crossing of a landscape preserve in the Bohemian low mountain range is planned.
According to Czech forecasts from 2001, traffic in 2008 will be 940 22 cars per day in the border section 0807 of the D 8 motorway.
German forecasts estimate the volume of traffic on the A 17 at the Czech border in 2010 at around 2010 25 000 car per day.
In 2000, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic signed a contract for the merger of the German motorway A 17 and the Czech motorway D 8 at the common state border by establishing a border bridge.
As both states are involved in the construction of this bridge, this individual construction project was an important aspect of the parallel audits of both audits of the audit bodies.
Cooperation between BRH and NKÚ
From mid-2005, both auditors gave joint considerations on cooperation in the examination of the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway.
Both sides had important reasons for this cooperation:
1.
Germany partly finances the construction of the border bridge.
Planning and construction are the responsibility of the Czech road construction administration.
There was no way for the BRH to examine this construction project itself.
2.
The NKÚ did not have any comparative data to assess whether the funds were used sparingly in view of the total construction costs of the bridges and tunnels on the D 8
3.
The NKÚ also had to verify the effectiveness of spending. To this end, the essential technical parameters of the bridges and tunnels should be examined, which should ensure the same quality of use on both sides of the border.
After preparatory negotiations, the presidents of the two courtyards of auditors concluded an agreement on coordinating the audits of the Prague-Dresden motorway on 04. January 2006
The auditors of both auditors met at approximately six to eight weeks intervals during 2006
They dealt with current issues and tasks. They developed a uniform methodology for checking bridge and tunnel prices, exchanged test results for the construction of the border bridge and produced joint reports.
The ongoing exchange of information was essential to the cooperation.
While the BRH was mainly dedicated to comparing the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels as well as the procurement procedures, the NKÚ mainly developed the methodology for the analysis of bridge and tunnel prices.
In Germany and the Czech Republic, the legal basis of financial control differ and thus also the way in which the two auditors complete their audits.
That is why both authorities each produced separate national reports on their exam results.
This report takes into account the results of the two parallel tests.
Cooperation ends with the signing of a final SchlussKommuniqués in the first half of 2007.
Construction of the border bridge
In the 2000 treaty, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed to complete the border bridge if possible in 2005
Later they rescheduled the appointment to the end of 2006.
The RMD acted as the client of the construction work.
Germany finances bridge construction with 42,13 %
Initially, the RMD provided for a reinforced concrete construction for the border bridge.
In 1999, however, the RMD agreed with its German partner on the construction of a steel composite structure.
They justified this decision by reducing the number of pairs of pillars from seven to five and the ecological benefits to the talaue.
In addition, a comparative calculation of the RMD had shown the steel composite construction as the cheaper solution.
However, this was due to a calculation error.
The calculation was based on a length of the new steel composite construction of only 397 m,
actually it's 5 % longer though.
During the award procedure, the RMD made serious mistakes,
by insufficiently preparing the award documents and inaccurately describing both evaluation criteria and subcriteria.
These errors led to subjective and ambiguous assessments by the Evaluation Commission and the Director General of the RMD.
An inferior tenderer contested the outcome of the award procedure.
The subsequent investigation by the Czech cartel office delayed the signing of the construction contract for the border bridge.
This lost the summer construction season following the offer test in 2004 and the available total construction time was reduced.
The contractor agreed to build the bridge in less time. This led to a significant price increase.
The measures offered included the double assembly of the superstructures, the change of the pillar shape and the construction of an assembly hall.
In addition, the contractor was unable to procure the originally planned steel grade.
The new steel grade - the higher costs of approx. 4 million The customer alone carried € - made it possible to shorten the construction time planned for corrosion protection and thus the total construction time.
Compared to the offer price of approx. 18,3 million The acceleration measures and other additions will significantly increase the total construction costs of the border bridge.
The shortened construction period alone led to a price increase of about 5,9 million. €.
The costs are currently at around without pricing. 25,9 million € net (as of October 2006).
Comparison of bridges and tunnels prices
Both courtyards examined bridge prices on the D 8 and the A 17 in order to identify the bridges, which were characterised by particularly high prices and to compare bridge prices on the German and Czech side.
The study was based on mathematically statistical methods.
The tunnels on the D 8 were compared to similar tunnels on the German motorways A 71, A 38 and A 4 because there were no comparable tunnels on the A 17
When preparing this part of the exam, a precise definition of the pricing concept was important.
For the comparison of bridge prices, both auditors agreed detailed specifications, for example: to use the current price paid for the bridge without VAT.
(The rates of VAT in the Czech Republic and Germany are different and can change.), not to take into account the costs of special start-up measures, to use the rate of the European Central Bank from 30.12.2005 for currency conversion. (29 CZK CZK 1 €).
Bridges of different types (reinforced concrete, reinforced concrete, steel composite and steel) and different sizes are available on both the D 8 and the A 17
In order to ensure the comparability of the checked bridge structures, the bridges were grouped according to their design.
The analysis also took into account bridge size within these groups.
The most common were concrete bridges on both sides of the border (20 bridges on the D 8 and 36 bridges on the A 17).
The study focused on this type of bridge as the size of the sample allowed the use of mathematically statistical methods and improved the reliability of the results.
The investigation showed that the m2 price of the concrete bridges at D 8 / A 17 depends on the bridge size (length, road surface): the larger the bridge, the lower the square meter price.
For German bridges, the correlation between price and size is stronger than for Czech bridges (see illustrations below).
At the A 17, two bridges with a significantly higher price were recorded at the D 8
These bridges were partly determined by a method for detecting significant deviations within a sample and partly by regression analysis of the correlation between bridge price and size (atypically expensive bridges can be identified using the distance from the regression curve).
The atypical high price of these bridges, however, should only serve as an indication of which bridges to concentrate on.
In order to draw final conclusions, the causes of the high price should be determined in individual cases.
For example, this could be because of uneconomic administrative actions, but also because of the conditions to protect the environment or other legitimate reasons.
Taking into account the greater average length of Czech concrete bridges compared to the Germans (see Table 1), the proven negative correlation between the bridge price and the length led to the Czech concrete bridges being cheaper.
In addition, the lower labour costs in the Czech Republic compared to Germany spoke in favour of this.
However, when evaluating the results, the price of the concrete bridges on the D 8 was higher than the A 17
At joint meetings, two reasons for this fact were found:
1.
In Germany, construction contracts for bridges are mainly awarded separately.
This also enables medium-sized companies to participate in the award competition.
In the Czech Republic, many bridge buildings are awarded as part of larger contracts for the construction of several kilometres of motorway sections.
Orders of this magnitude cannot be managed by medium-sized companies.
2.
In the Czech Republic, the diversity of bridge constructions built is greater than in Germany.
In this context, the NKÚ noted that construction of bridges will be determined long before construction begins,
and already when the RMD submits the application for plan determination.
At this point, she selects a certain bridge construction variant from several alternatives. However, profitability plays a minor role in this decision.
Only through a thorough analysis of the construction industries of both countries would a final conclusion be possible with regard to bridge prices in the Czech Republic and Germany. However, this would have blown up the scope of this examination.
The border bridge is the most expensive steel composite bridge on the D 8 and A 17.
The prices for the tunnels on the D 8 are about twice as high as in Germany.
However, a comparison of the technical parameters between the tunnels on the D 8 and the tunnels in Germany did not make any significant difference.
The significant price differences can be the result of an underdeveloped competition for tunnel construction in the Czech Republic.
However, the small number of tunnels did not allow generalising conclusions.
Economy and effectiveness of the Dresden motorway - Prague
The independent Czech Republic was founded in 1993
That same year, the government passed the plan for the expansion of the motorway network.
The progressive expansion of the D from Prague to the state border with Germany was planned.
In doing so, the section 0805 was to be built by the Bohemian Low Mountains before the border section 0807
The Czech Republic finances the D 8 through programme financing.
Two goals are defined in the program number 327 220 ′′ Construction of the motorway D 8 Prague - Ústí nad Labem - Czech German state border
1.
as a national goal: to improve the link between Prague and Ústi nad Labem;
2.
as an international destination: the connection between Prague and Berlin as part of the Pan-European Transport Corridor IV BerlinIstanbul.
The program planned to complete the construction of the section leading through the Bohemian Midsummer Mountains in June 2008 and the construction of border section 0807 in June 2007
It should be noted that the end of the construction work is not identical to the time of commissioning.
The NKÚ noted that the plan approval decision had already been adopted for the construction of the section leading through the Bohemian low mountain range.
Environmental organizations have sued against this decision.
A final judgment is still pending.
Compared to the timetable set out in the programme documentation, there was therefore a delay in the completion of section No. 0805 not to rule out several years.
In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed a postponement of the completion date of construction phase No. 0805 to 2010
Due to this, construction of the border section did not reach the national goal of improving the link between Prague and Usti nad Labem.
The RMD subjected to border section No. 0807 of the D 8 and section no. 0805 by the Bohemian Low Mountains in the years 1999 to 2001 an economic analysis.
As investment costs, she set about 639 million € for both sections No. 0805 and No. 0807 on.
Table 2: Results of the economic analysis (EIRR EIRR internal interest rate foot)
Variant opening of all planned highways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.
Traffic volume in the northern part of border section 18 000 car per day in 2010.
Opening of all planned highways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.
Traffic volume in the northern part of border section 22 000 car per day in 2010.
Opening of all planned highways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.
Traffic volume in the northern part of border section 25 000 car per day in 2010.
The economic analysis of 2001 was based on the assumption that the border and the section leading through the Bohemian Low Mountains will go down simultaneously.
At the time of the exam it was obvious that the section through the Bohemian Midlands would not be opened at the original date.
This reduces the above mentioned EIRR values.
The costs of both sections as of 31.12.2005 were 897 million. € without VAT and thus 27,4 % higher than in the economic viewing 2001
There is also a risk that section 0805 will get another more elaborate invention, which would affect the profitability of the project.
The economic considerations revealed that the construction of both sections of motorway is economically justified with a daily volume of at least 18 000 cars per day in 2010 The forecast for 2008 had predicted 22 940 cars per day in 22
However, a study on diversion routes as an alternative to the missing section through the Bohemian Low Mountains assumes a traffic volume of 12 600 to 750 13 cars per day in 2007 The project is then below the profitability limit.
A higher volume of traffic on the routes intended to replace the missing section with the Bohemian Low Mountains is likely to result in congestion and thus increased external costs, which were not taken into account in the initial economic analysis.
The abovementioned reduction in revenue and increase in costs means that the already low EIRR for the construction of the border section of D 8 will not be achieved.
The construction of the border section of the D 8 is therefore uneconomic.
The construction of the A 17 also resulted in an increase in costs as in the construction of the two above-mentioned sections of the D 8.
As part of the macroeconomic assessment for the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan 1992, the Federal Ministry of Transport, which was responsible for the investment costs of approx. 320 million € off.
This resulted in a benefit / cost ratio of 4,6.
Meanwhile, the cost has risen to around 670 million € increased and the benefit / cost ratio decreased by more than half.
The BRH had checked the profitability of planning and construction of the A 17 motorway independently of the parallel tests with the NKÚ between 2003 and 2005
He found that the authority responsible for the approval demanded an unnecessary landscape tunnel for the third section of the A 17
During the course of the examination, the BRH managed to convince the Federal Ministry and the road construction administration of the superfluous landscape tunnel.
This enabled 10 million. € in construction costs and € 150 000 in annual operating costs.
During the examination of the first section of the A 17, the BRH found that the construction work was insufficiently prepared.
The following example shows this:
In the planning phase, the road construction administration did not provide a condition recording of the rock on the surface of the Dölzschener Wall, because it was difficult to access.
It wasn't until the tunnel drivage reached the wall that she made up for this.
It became apparent that the rock was more weathered than expected in the call for tenders.
Extensive measures such as anchorages, injections and rockfall protection nets for around 3,3 million. € became necessary.
The road construction administration not only borne the costs of additional, already necessary, such as securing the Dölzschener Wall, but also for those who would not have been necessary in the event of proper construction preparation.
This includes expenditure resulting from disrupted construction processes (3,2 million). €), additional training of the drivage team (0,5 million) €) and increased wages and material prices due to the extension of construction time (7 million €).
This additional spending of around 10,7 million. There is no permanent added value compared to €.
The BRH took these and other measures as an occasion to call on the Federal Ministry to better exercise the supervisory authority for large road construction measures.
In this context, it should be urged that road construction administrations introduce quality assurance systems.
Benefits of cooperation for BRH and NKÚ The cooperation fulfilled the expectations of both auditors.
The BRH received insights on planning, contracting and implementing the construction of the border bridge.
Both auditors developed a database at bridge and tunnel prices that will help with future audits.
The NKÚ noted that the most important structural parameters for bridges, tunnels and roadway of the D 8 are no different from those of the A 17
The auditors from both auditors involved in the cooperation gathered valuable experiences, which will be useful in future audits.
Report on the results of parallel audit of the administration of the sales tax of the Czech Republic and Germany
Forewords
The Lima Declaration adopted in 1977 emphasizes that the audit bodies are empowered to audit all public finances.
The statement demands that the courts of auditors must have the power to examine the tax collection as much as possible.
The organisation of European Supreme Audit Authorities (EUROSAI) considers taxes an important part of public revenue.
The thematic focus of VI. EUROSAI Congress, which took place in Bonn in 2005, was the audit of public revenue by the auditors.
One of the most important steps towards optimising the audit activity of a Court of Auditors is to draw up a special strategy for auditing public revenue.
This is particularly true for taxes as the largest source of public revenue with a high risk of default.
As national economies are increasingly interconnected and interconnected, there can be a situation in which national audit institutions can only carry out their audit activities in cooperation with other states.
Examples of internationally organized fraud can be considered, which can lead to significant revenue losses in many states.
Cooperation between the authorities is necessary to combat such crimes.
Court of Auditors that audit in this area must be prepared to cooperate closely.
The idea for an audit of turnover tax and the MIAS system is at VI. EUROSAI Congress was created in Bonn. This audit was carried out in cooperation between the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Court of Auditors.
In the course of thorough preparation, the audit institutions involved had to first familiarise themselves with the legal framework and the procedures of the sales tax administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.
Based on the analysis of the available information, we selected the exam items for the planning of the exam.
Achieving the efficient and effective management of turnover taxes is a long-standing problem and individual states (especially the EC Member States) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify the collection of turnover taxes and create greater transparency in this area.
We are convinced that the results of our audit can not only help to improve the work of the financial administration, but also form the basis for a proposal for an improved system of international exchange of information.
Report on the results of parallel audit of the administration of the sales tax of the Czech Republic and Germany
Introductory
Reference: CZ) 06/27 (DE) VIII 2-2005-1215
Subject of exam:
(CZ) Administration of turnover tax following the Czech Republic's entry into the European Union
(DE) Audit of administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax in accordance with Regulation (EC) No. Council 1798/2003 and 1925/2004
of the Commission audit target:
(CZ) The aim of the audit in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedures applied by the financial administration in the field of turnover tax following the integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter 'EC') with freedom of movement of goods and services and the Use of MIAS1, in particular the control of the use of the VAT exemption for intra-Community deliveries.
(DE) The aim of the examination was to examine the system of intra-Community turnover tax control with a focus on administrative assistance in the field of turnover tax in accordance with the abovementioned regulations.
As a result of the test, vulnerabilities should be highlighted and recommendations should be made to address them.
The audits were carried out jointly by the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic (′′ NKÚ ′′) and the Federal Court of Justice (′′ BRH ′′) of the Federal Republic of Germany due to an agreement concluded on 8. June 2006
The focus of the cooperation was on the verification of selected transactions between entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the exploitation of information obtained from international mutual assistance between the financial authorities and the comparison of VAT management systems in the two states.
A joint final report on the results of the examinations was published in accordance with European Guideline No. 31 created for the implementation of INTOSAI Exam Standards.
The period under review covered the period from 1. May 2004 to 31. December 2005.
Summary of results and evaluation of parallel audit
The parallel audit of the sales tax administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two audits.
In addition to the focus ′′ exchange of information ′′ under Regulation (EC) No. In 1798/2003 of the Council and 1925/2004 of the Commission, other closely related aspects were also examined, e.g. the registration of taxpayers, tax returns and summary reports.
In addition, the audit also covered the legal status of cross-border passenger transport by bus and the comparison of statistics.
Comparing the VAT administration systems in the two countries, differences were observed in the following areas:
1) Registration for sales tax purposes.
While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered independently of the level of turnover, among others, the essential criterion for registration in the Czech Republic is the exceeding of the turnover threshold set out in the Turnover Tax Act.
In the Czech Republic, taxable persons receive only one tax identification number, which they also use for intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, the taxable person receives a tax number that applies only to domestic transactions for purposes of turnover.
If the German taxable person wants to make intra-Community transactions, he must apply for the issue of a special identification number, the so-called VAT number.
As problems arise from the different registration procedures, the rules within the EC should be standardized (see 4.1).
2) Cross-border passenger transport by buses.
In the Czech Republic, cross-border passenger transport by bus is exempt from VAT, but there is a right to deduct VAT.
In Germany, the transport service, as far as the route passes through Germany, is subject to turnover tax.
Efforts should be made at EC level to harmonize the situation in accordance with Article 393 of Council Directive 2006/112 / EC of 28. November 2006 on the common turnover tax system (see 4.2).
3) Tax returns.
While in the Czech Republic taxable persons have to submit turnover tax returns only for under-year tax periods (month or quarter), taxable persons in Germany (monthly or quarterly)
Pre-registration of sales tax and after the end of the calendar year a turnover tax year statement.
Unlike the Czech Republic, taxpayers in Germany have to submit pre-registration electronically.
The introduction of the obligation to submit VAT returns electronically in the Czech Republic would improve the efficiency of the Czech financial administration (see 4.3).
4) Summary reports.
While taxpayers in the Czech Republic have to file their summary reports to the tax authorities (FÄ), German taxpayers have to submit the summary reports to the CLO2.
Accordingly, the information from the summary reports in the Czech Republic is available immediately after their submission.
The information from the summary reports is only available after the CLO has been processed.
Updated information on intra-Community transactions is needed as soon as possible to combat VAT fraud.
The monthly submission of summary reports would shorten the period between turnover and update of MIAS data.
This would enable a timely examination of taxation in the acquirer's Member State (see 4.4), but only if all EC Member States introduce the same deadlines.
5) International exchange of information in the field of sales tax.
When requests for information are received, the Czech CLO monitors compliance with the three-month deadline.
The German CLO does not monitor the processing times.
As a result, the German financial administration has completed a significantly lower percentage of the requests for information received within the prescribed time limit.
Because of these problems, the BRH has recommended that the German CLO be monitored continuously (see 4.6).
6) Risk management.
Each of the two Member States is developing their own risk management system (RMS) with appropriate strengths and weaknesses.
The NKÚ and the BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by a Member State alone.
Successful criteria, elements or approaches of an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in all EC Member States. Otherwise, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5.).
As part of the cooperation, the two auditors examined selected cases of intraCommunity transactions that were realized between Czech and German tax subjects.
Of these, 31 cases were jointly reviewed by using the legal possibilities of the CLO, where there was doubts about the correct taxation or suspicion of VAT fraud.
The Court of Auditors stated:
In some cases, the FÄ used the information gained in the international exchange of information and re-established the turnover tax liability of the taxable persons concerned.
In such cases, the taxable persons had either illegally claimed the exemption from turnover tax or had not shown the purchase of goods in their turnover tax return.
In some cases, the FÄ could not use the information gained in exchange of information because it was incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be used due to different legal regulations in the two Member States.
In some cases, the financial administration of another Member State refused to provide information.
Some cases were revealed where taxpayers in their summary reports incorrectly reported transactions.
As a result, the data in MIAS was therefore incorrect, so that the case workers (the FÄ) had to investigate in these cases (see 6).
Examination procedure
Examination procedure in CR
The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by Division II - ′′ State budget revenue ′′ and the territorial audit departments of Central Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.
Certified posts were: The Ministry of Finance and the 10 FÄ Humpolec, Jihlava, Kadaň, Liberec, Nymburk, Otrokovice, Prague 1, Prague 4, Sokolov and Třinec.
The College of the NKÚ approved the exam findings on 23. April 2007.
Exam procedure in Germany
The test was carried out between July 2006 and February 2007 by the audit area traffic taxes and employees of the assigned PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt / Main and Munich.
It was part of the work plan for 2006 and was therefore announced to the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2006
After a test phase, the actual exam began in the 4. st quarter of 2006.
According to the cases selected by the BRH and later by the NKÚ the BRH had to announce the examination to several federal states.
Apart from interviews in the BMF and CLO, the exam was carried out in the following federal states:
Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.
Tax files from the following cases were included in the audit:
Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, Munich bodies, Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-North and Hamburg for large companies, Hanover-Nord, Winsen-Luhe, Bonn-Downtown, Cologne-Mitte, Cologne-Porz, Cologne-Süd, Saint Augustin, Pirmasens, Bautzen, Chemnitz-Süd, Dresden II, Freiberg, Leipzig I and Zschopau...
In addition, talks were held with the FÄ Augsburg City, Aurich, Düsseldorf-Old Town, Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.
The exam results were communicated to the BMF in May 2007
Cooperation between the two auditors
In the run-up to the parallel audit, several meetings of representatives of both auditors took place.
Participants at these meetings familiarized themselves with the organisation of the financial administration, the law on sales tax and the system of sales tax administration in each country.
The subject of the test phase was agreed at the meeting in May 2006
The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006
At this meeting, a timetable for the further procedure was drawn up and the following exam topics for the parallel examinations were determined: 1.
Registration of taxable persons.
2.
Cross-border passenger transport by bus - Legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.
3. International exchange of information, in particular the approach of the financial officials to handle requests for information and the review of selected problems mentioned in the requests for information and spontaneous information between the Czech Republic and Germany.
4. tax returns.
5.
Summary reports.
6.
Statistical information on deliveries and acquisitions between the Czech Republic and Germany.
7. Risk management in the sales tax sector.
At a meeting to coordinate the further examination of the NKÚ and the BRH in December 2006, both sides familiarized themselves with the examination procedure in the Czech Republic and Germany and discussed the results of the parallel examinations already achieved.

An entrepreneur with legal headquarters, headquarters or premises in the Czech Republic whose turnover exceeds the amount of CZK 1.000.000 during the last 12 consecutive calendar months will be charged on the first day of the third month following the month in which he has exceeded, subject to payment (§ 94 (1) of Law No. 235/2004 Coll., concerning turnover tax; hereinafter referred to as ′′ Law No. 235/2004 ′′).
The person concerned must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he exceeded the registration threshold.
The current legislation does not allow retroactive registration of a taxable person if he has exceeded the deadline for registration.
An entrepreneur with a legal headquarters, registered office or a permanent establishment in the Czech Republic who provides sales taxable services or services exempt from turnover tax with the right to deduct VAT must also register for sales tax if his turnover CZK 1 million does not exceed, but he fulfils other conditions, as laid down in Law No. 235/2004 are mentioned.
An entrepreneur with a legal headquarters, headquarters or a permanent establishment in the Czech Republic, who does not meet any of the requirements set out in the law, can voluntarily apply for registration for sales tax.
The registration procedure under Law No. begins when the registration application is received by the local tax officer. 337/1992.
If you want to register voluntarily for VAT, you have to state in your application the deadline from which you apply for registration as a VATable person.
The financial officer must verify the information provided by the entrepreneur, i.e. the completed application for registration with all the investments.
If he has doubts about the information contained therein, he shall ask the applicant to explain, supplement or prove the information provided.
If the financial officer has determined by verification that the entrepreneur fulfils the conditions for registration, he must give written notice on registration and the allocation of a tax number.
In the notice, the tax officer shall state the date of entry into force of the registration for turnover tax and the assessment period for the value added tax.
Assessment period is the calendar quarter, unless the turnover of the entrepreneur for the previous calendar year has reached at least CZK 10.000.000
If so, the predisposition period is the calendar month.
An entrepreneur whose turnover has reached at least CZK 2.000.000 in the previous calendar year is entitled to choose the calendar month as an assessment period and shall inform the fiscal officer of this change.
The issuance of a tax number in the registration notice is always a constitutive character.
The taxable person has to state the tax number for every communication (including payments) with the tax officer, and in cases where a special law requires it (e.g. Law No. 235/2004, concerning the copy of fiscal documents) 3.
The tax number contains the coding ′′ CZ ′′ and a basic component in the form of a general identification mark.
In the case of natural persons, this is the number of the birth certificate or another general identification mark, as far as a special law provides. For legal entities, the general identification mark is the company number (according to the provisions in § 33 (12) of Law No. 337/1992).
If the entrepreneur has not fulfilled his obligation despite the request made by the financial officer, the local tax officer responsible shall register him ex officio.
This will also be addressed to the taxable person.
In the Czech Republic, every entrepreneur approved for business will receive a tax number for any type of tax at his first registration.
This also applies to registration as a sales tax payer.
According to Law No. 235/2004, which came into force on 1. January 2005, in the event of non-compliance with the duty to register turnover, the taxable person may demand that the taxable person receives up to 10 % of the proceeds from the taxable turnover, the the person concerned has illegally acted without taxation, for the period from which the entrepreneur should have been registered as a taxable person until the date on which registration as a taxable person was made by the decision of the tax officer (§ 98 (1)) of Law No. 235/2004).
The payment of the amount thus fixed is considered as a tax payment within the meaning of § 98 (3) of Law No. 235/2004, i.e. it is not a fine or fine.
If the statutory requirements are met, the registration of a sales taxable person can be cancelled for two reasons:
1)
Deletion of registration at the request of the taxable person, i.e. mainly because turnover does not reach the threshold for registration (§ 106 (1) of Law No. 235/2004).
A taxable person may request the cancellation of his registration not earlier than one year after the date of entry into force stated in the registration notice.
2) Deletion of registration on its own initiative (§ 106 (7) of Law No. 235/2004), if: (a) the taxable person has not provided a service for the period of 12 consecutive months and has not informed the tax officials of the reasons for this, (b) the taxable person has obligations under Law No. (c) the previous taxable person no longer fulfils the conditions for taxable persons.
(B) Taxable persons without legal headquarters, registered office or business premises in the Czech Republic A person registered for tax purposes in another Member State who has neither his legal headquarters, place of business or a permanent establishment in the Czech Republic or a foreigner who is taxable in the Czech Republic provides services and according to § 108 of Law No. 235/2004 for these benefits or Deliveries have to issue a tax return and pay taxes (′′ non-resident entrepreneur ′′) becomes taxable when the service in question is provided.
He must submit an application for registration with FA Prague 1 no later than the day of the delivery in question.
He is obliged to submit in this application all VAT number assigned to him in other Member States or third countries. to show off.
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration later than on the day of the first taxable service provision in the Czech Republic, the FA Prague 1 must register him retroactively since he is under Law No. On the day of the first taxable service provision in the Czech Republic, it became VATable.
In case of retroactive registration, the FA Prague 1 must demand receipts (invoices or written explanations) from the entrepreneurs concerned for proof of performance.
If a non-resident entrepreneur requests registration in the Czech Republic before the first performance of a service, the FA Prague 1 must demand the presentation of the performance-based contract documents.
As of 31. December 2004, 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered with FA Prague 1, 124 of them from Germany. As of 31. December 2005, a total of 951 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered, including 233 from Germany.
According to the provisions of § 106 (9) of Law No. In 235/2004, the financial officer is empowered to delete the registration of a non-resident entrepreneur by 31. January of the following calendar year if he / she has the obligation to submit tax declarations or / or tax declarations.-declarations and not accepted for tax payment.
When the NKÚ examined, it became apparent that, in the case of filing a tax return by mail with dispatch abroad on 25. January, i.e. according to the mandatory deadline for filing a tax return, this declaration was not yet available until 31. January at FA has been received.
In cases where these facts, which are relevant for the possibility of cancellation of registration, become known to FA later than 31. January, a cancellation of the registration of the non-resident entrepreneur for turnover tax in the Czech Republic will be cancelled in the related calendar year no longer possible.
Registration of taxpayers in Germany
According to the rules of the tax order (§§ 137, 138 AO), every business operation must be registered with the municipality and / or the responsible tax office.
This notification shall take place no later than one month after the start of business.
The municipality is forwarding the registration to the tax authorities.
If the tax office in charge finds that business has started but has not been filed, it may also register retroactively to the taxpayers.
In Germany, taxable persons, regardless of whether they are resident or non-resident, are obliged to register for purposes of turnover tax if they fulfil the conditions in § 2 of the German Value Added Tax Act (UStG).
This does not depend on the level of turnover achieved.
There is no voluntary registration in Germany.
Special cases are responsible for entrepreneurs residing abroad.
For example, FA ChemnitzSüd is responsible for those entrepreneurs who are based in the Czech Republic.
As of 30. April 2004, total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered; as of 1. March 2006, 1.050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered there.
According to the BRH, these FÄ with special responsibilities often refused to register so-called self-employed persons residing in the new means or in the new ones. Eastern European Member States of the EC.
Since the freedom of movement of workers is still restricted following the entry into the EC of these ten countries, these self-employed people tried to circumvent these restrictions by starting their own business.
These (appearances) selfemployed persons do not meet the conditions for recognition as entrepreneurs defined in § 2 UStG, as they are usually dependent on a single client who determines their working hours and the way they work.
In order to be registered, the entrepreneur must fill out a questionnaire from the FA responsible and provide information about the company and the activities carried out.
The questionnaire is a form binding for all cases in Germany.
It will be processed either in special organizational units within the FÄ or in the general tax assessment units.
This form is used to carry out a risk assessment for the individual taxable person prior to the allocation of a tax number.
The structure of the tax number for domestic transactions is based on certain requirements:
The first three digits are the number for the FA responsible, the following three (or four) digits indicate which department is responsible within the FA, the following five (or four) digits are the identifier for the taxable person, the last digit always a check digit.
If an entrepreneur wants to participate in intra-Community trade, he needs a VAT number to be able to make intra-Community deliveries.
This will be assigned by the CLO upon request, if the entrepreneur is registered for VAT purposes in Germany.
The VAT number. is automatically allocated by the CLO when the taxable person declares intra-Community deliveries in his VAT pre-declarations or in his annual turnover tax return.
The VAT number. consists of the country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.
The registration of an entrepreneur can be deleted: 1. On request (e.g. when he stops business), but only after the settlement of all tax transactions (assessment of all fiscal years) or 2. when the financial administration finds that he no longer operates.
Usually the validity of the VAT number depends. from the validity of the VAT number.
In these cases, the FÄ must inform the CLO about the cancellation of the VAT number so that the validity of the VAT number is there. can be terminated at this point.
According to the Sales Tax Act (§ 19 (1) UStG), domestic taxable persons do not have to pay sales tax in the following cases: 1. the turnover of the previous calendar year plus the turnover tax resulting therefrom did not exceed the amount of 17.500 € and 2. €. The following year will probably not exceed the amount of 50.000 €.
The so-called small business owners are not entitled to invoice other entrepreneurs, nor are they entitled to deduct VAT.
Although they don't have to pay sales taxes, small business owners are obliged to register with the tax office and submit an annual sales tax return.
A small business owner can explain the non-use of § 19 (1) UStG.
This statement shall be binding for the following five years.
He is then allowed to invoice the sales tax and deduct the VAT.
Non-established taxable persons may appoint a fiscal representative (§ 22 a UStG).
The prerequisite for this is that they exclusively carry out tax-free transactions and waive deduction.
The fiscal representative fulfils the tax obligations of the foreign entrepreneur, so that he does not have to register for sales tax purposes.
The invoices shall indicate that a fiscal representative has been ordered.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation in the two states is different.
While entrepreneurs are registered in Germany regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the first requirement for registration (among others) is to exceed the threshold amount stated in the German VAT Act.
If an entrepreneur does not cross this threshold, he can voluntarily register.
The registration procedure in Germany is standardized, but differences may occur due to different organizational structures in the different federal states.
In the Czech Republic, at the time of his first registration, the taxable person receives a tax number for any tax.
In the case of his registration for the turnover tax, this tax number also applies to intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, an entrepreneur who registers for VAT purposes receives a tax number exclusively for domestic German turnover.
If the German entrepreneur wants to carry out intra-Community transactions, he must specifically allocate a VAT ID number. apply for it.
Both the NKÚ and the BRH found that the German two-step registration system in other Member States such as the Czech Republic, which allocates a single identification number for both national registration on turnover and intra-Community transactions, could lead to serious misunderstandings.
On the other hand, the two-stage system enables retroactive (national registration) in cases where the taxable person does not register his business with the municipality or with the FA responsible.
This retroactive registration enables a correct assessment of turnover tax for previous assessment periods, in particular an accurate estimation of turnover tax liability.
Since the different registration procedures lead to problems, the rules for the whole EC should be harmonized.
The German Parliament has recently decided to introduce a tax identification number.
This should be allocated by the Federal Central Office for Taxes of every natural person after birth.
This number applies to natural persons residing in Germany for life.
If a natural person takes up business, the FA in charge applies for a commercial tax identification number, which is called VAT. is serving.
In the future, therefore, there should be no delay between a taxable person's national registration and the allocation of the VAT number. give.
Work on implementing an IT procedure for managing the numbers has not yet been completed.
Cross-border passenger transport by bus
Legislative regulations in the Czech Republic
According to the provisions in § 70 of Law No. Since 235/2004 May 2004, the transport of passengers between the different Member States and between the Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic has been exempt from turnover tax since 1. May 2004 and there is a right to deduction of deductions.
The exemption from turnover tax applies even if the transport of persons registered as taxable persons in other Member States or is carried out by foreigners who are taxable at home.
The return journey is considered a separate transport process.
If non-resident entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic do not practice economic activity other than cross-border passenger transport by bus, they are not obliged to register as VATable in the Czech Republic.
Transboundary passenger transport has been implemented in the Czech Republic due to the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic Annex No. V, Chapter 5 (1) (b) Excluded from turnover tax. The entity mentioned in the text says:
' For the purpose of applying Article 28 (3) (b) of Directive 77/388 / EEC, the Czech Republic may, in accordance with point 17 of Annex F to the Directive, maintain the exemption for cross-border passenger transport either until: the condition of Article 28 (4) of the Directive is fulfilled or as long as the same exemption is applied by any of the present Member States."
The legal regulations in Germany
Pursuant to Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112 / EC of 28. November 2006, as implemented in Germany by durch 3 b (1) UStG, a transport service is carried out where the promotion is carried out.
Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and cross-border passenger transport.
Only the part of the transport service due to the domestic country is taxable in Germany.
German taxation also does not distinguish between resident and non-resident (bus) entrepreneurs.
If a non-established taxable person carries persons through Germany, the part of the transport resulting from Germany is considered to be taxable transport.
Before providing his services in Germany, the non-resident entrepreneur must report his intention to provide passenger transport services to the FA responsible.
This registers him for tax purposes (compare 4.1.2) and issues a special certificate for each bus mentioned in the taxable person's registration.
The entrepreneur must state his taxable transport services in a German turnover tax return.
On 1. March 2006, 741 Czech bus contractors were registered at FA Chemnitz-Süd.
If the transport service is provided to an entrepreneur established in Germany, the non-established taxable person does not have to pay the turnover tax himself to the FA.
In his place, the domestic customer of the services has to pay the turnover tax to the tax office and the net invoiced to the non-resident taxable person. This process is referred to as a 'liability shift' and is in line with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006/112 / EC.
In addition to filing by a non-resident taxable person and his income tax return, the German financial administration has several means to verify the accuracy of the tax return regarding taxable passenger transport:
Customs mobile control groups check certificates of buses registered abroad, which are used for passenger transport through Germany.
After each test, the mobile control groups shall submit an inspection protocol to the responsible FA.
If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group may require the bus driver to pay the sales tax before continuing his journey.
The non-resident taxable person may deduct the turnover tax paid in such a way from the tax liability stated in his turnover tax return.
If the FA has doubts about the accuracy of a turnover tax return, it can order an examination that has to be found in the FA or can it be found in Regulation (EC) No. Use appropriations of administrative assistance mentioned by the Council (see No. 4.6).
Even if the foreign taxable person refuses to pay the lawfully fixed turnover tax, the FA may request assistance under Council Directive 76/308 / EEC.
The BRH considers these means of mutual assistance in tax matters to verify the VAT return or return. compliance with the tax liability by a non-resident bus contractor as being too expensive compared to the low revenue from turnover tax on taxable passenger transport.
In particular, the examination of the books of a non-established taxable person entails disproportionately high costs for the taxable person himself and for the financial administration.
The latter must examine the foreign books, which requires not only knowledge of the foreign language, but also of foreign accounting principles.
Accordingly, such an examination is expected to cost more time than a resident taxable person, although the examination is limited to passenger transport in Germany.
On the other hand, the non-resident taxable person must not only accept the audit rights of his national financial administration, but also those of the other Member States where he carries out passenger transport there.
In addition, for each Member State where a single passenger transport is carried out, the taxable person must fulfil all existing tax obligations in the different languages and on the basis of the forms of the financial administrations of the EC Member States concerned.
This means that the correct taxation of cross-border passenger transport services leads to a disproportionate administrative burden.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation varies in the two states.
In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between different EC Member States as well as between Member States and third countries is exempt from turnover tax due to the law on EC membership of the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the transport service is liable to turnover tax according to the transport route which is not covered by German national territory.
If a non-established taxable person provides such transport for the first time, he must first notify him to the responsible FA.
This registers the taxable person who has to declare the taxable share of the transport service in a tax return in Germany.
Law enforcement in Germany is very time consuming.
At least three out of four Czech taxpayers registered at FA Chemnitz-Süd have passenger transport as a business purpose.
The tax revenue in question is quite low compared to the administrative burden.
Member States - which levy turnover tax in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112 / EC of 28. November 2006 on the common system of turnover taxes - have a high administrative burden compared to the relevant tax revenue.
In order to avoid the disproportionately high costs of taxation, cross-border passenger transport should only be subject to tax in one Member State.
This could be the state where the transport begins or where the service provider is located.
Such a form of taxation would require an amendment to Council Directive 2006/112 / EC of 28. November 2006
Sales tax returns
Submission and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic
Unless otherwise provided by the law, the entrepreneur is obliged to submit a turnover tax return on the form prescribed by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days of the expiry of the tax period.
The tax liability arises at the expiry of the deadline for submitting the VAT return. Excluded from this scheme is the turnover tax on the import of goods under Law No 235/2004 This is where the tax is due according to customs regulations.
If a claim for reimbursement is higher than average deductible, this amount will be refunded to the taxable person within 30 days of the date of the fixing of this deduction without the need to submit an application.
The deadline shall not be applied in cases where the tax officer initiates a tax procedure with regard to the taxable person's liability.
According to § 73 (11) of Law No. In 235/2004, the right to deduction can be asserted at the latest with the regular tax return for the last tax period of the calendar year in which the right to deduction was created.
After expiry of this period, the deduction of deductions can still be claimed within three years of the end of the tax period during which the claim would have been possible for the first time.
However, this requires a supplementary turnover tax return.
An amendment to Law No. 1., which came into force on 1. January 2005 In 235/2004, the submission of a supplementary VAT return only permits the period during which the claim to deduction could have been asserted for the first time.
A taxable person must submit a supplementary turnover tax return if: (a) the sum of the adjustments leads to an increase in the tax liability; (b) he makes adjustments that do not change the last known tax liability but only amends previous information; (c) he according to § 49 of Law No. 235/2004 Corrections to the rate of turnover tax and liability.
A taxable person may submit a supplementary turnover tax return if the sum of the adjustments reduces the tax liability.
The taxable person must submit the supplementary tax return by the end of the month following the month in which the facts in question were found.
The turnover tax return can be submitted electronically either via internet or via data carrier.
The delivery via internet can take place with or without a certified electronic signature.
If it is done without an electronic signature, it must also be submitted on data carriers.
The VAT return form contains separate lines indicating the value of intra-Community deliveries and acquisitions.
The value of related services must be stated in separate lines of the VAT return.
Some headings are used for automated primary checks under the ATIS system.
The value of goods delivered to other EC Member States to persons registered as taxable there is compared to the data provided by the Czech taxable persons in their summary declarations.
The value of the acquisition of goods from other Member States from persons registered as taxable persons is compared with the information contained in the summary declarations of taxable persons from other EC Member States.
Within the framework of the ATIS system, the FA is conducting a credibility check of the VAT returns.
This is done automatically because the VAT return cannot be processed without the prior examination.
The credibility check includes a calculation of the benchmarks of credibility and an assessment of the risks of sales tax returns.
According to the provisions of § 37 (1) of Law No. In 337/1992, the FA may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 million on persons who fail to comply with their non-monetary obligations under this or a special tax law or decision under this Act.
Automated tax information system - Automated tax information system that the Czech tax authorities use to technical support for tax collection.
During its examination, the NKÚ found that the FÄ rarely made use of the possibility of imposing a fine on the taxable person concerned if the turnover tax return was not submitted.
Submission and processing of VAT returns in Germany
In Germany, there is a distinction between monthly or quarterly VAT pre-declarations and the annual VAT return.
Those taxpayers who are obliged to submit pre-registration of turnover taxes must still submit an annual turnover tax return.
Even small business owners who are not obliged to pay sales tax must submit an annual sales tax return.
The taxable persons are generally obliged to submit a pre-registration until the 10. th day after the end of the calendar quarter in which the turnover tax is generated (§ 18 (2) UStG).
However, if the turnover tax liability exceeds 6.136 € in the previous year or if it is a newly founded company, the entrepreneur is obliged to submit monthly sales tax pre-declarations no later than the 10. th day after the end of the month in question.
The taxable person can also decide to submit monthly sales tax pre-registration if he received an amount exceeding € 6.136 in the previous year (§ 18 (2 a) UStG).
If the annual turnover tax does not exceed 512 €, neither advance sales tax declarations nor VAT returns must be submitted.
A resulting turnover tax liability is to be paid 10 days after the end of the tax period.
A refund can lead to a more thorough audit by the financial administration.
(Legal) deadlines for processing VAT returns and for reimbursement of VAT overpayments do not exist.
In order to receive a timely refund, a security can be offered for the refund amount.
Value added tax returns, including refund cases, must be processed quickly.
The German Value Added Tax Act enables an extension of this (tax or tax). Payment) deadlines (§ 18 (6) UStG).
The extension of the deadline must be requested separately.
If granted, pre-registration of sales tax and corresponding payments may be made one month later. In case of monthly reports, however, a special advance payment is to be made.
This payment will be offset against the turnover tax liability recorded for the pre-registration period December.
If an error is discovered, the entrepreneur must submit a corrected VAT pre-registration.
There is no ′′ supplementary ′′ VAT return.
Once the turnover tax return to be submitted to the tax office by May 31. of the following year, the entrepreneur can no longer correct an incorrect VAT pre-registration, but only the incorrect annual turnover tax return.
Adjustments to this turnover tax return to the advantage or disadvantage of the taxable person are possible within four years of the end of the year in which the first turnover tax return was submitted.
After the expiry of this four-year period, a turnover tax return can usually only be corrected in cases of a slight tax cut or evasion.
Taxable persons must submit pre-sales tax declarations by electronic means.
The FÄ can grant exceptions to this rule to avoid improper hardships.
The annual sales tax return can be submitted in paper form or via internet with or without certification.
If the levy is not certified, the taxable person must also submit the declaration on paper and with his personal signature.
Will no sales tax pre-registrations or-declarations issued, the financial administration is entitled to make a rough estimation of the turnover achieved by the taxable vorzunehmen6.
In case of late delivery, the taxable person can be charged with a delayed surcharge (up to 10 % of the tax liability or up to 25.000 €).
During an earlier examination, the BRH found that the FÄ often do not charge this delay.
In cases where the FÄ levied the delay allowances, the amount was determined in a non-uniform and arbitrary manner.
The delay surcharge therefore fails to reduce the average delay, especially when submitting the annual turnover tax return.
The form of the turnover tax return contains separate lines for value indications on intra-Community deliveries or supplies. Acquiring.
There are also separate lines for receiving services.
Non-taxable turnover must be stated in a separate line of the turnover tax return.
The turnover tax returns submitted on paper must either be scanned or recorded electronically by specially designated personnel.
The data submitted by electronic tax returns are directly available to the financial administration.
THIS segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
After all data is collected electronically, they are subjected to a risk management procedure and a case selection is made based on certain standards.
The turnover tax returns thus selected must be checked by the responsible clerk on the basis of the automatically generated test instructions (see 5.2).
Although the financial administration only has to make a rough estimate of the revenue tax liability, it still has to be as accurate as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, taxable persons must file their turnover tax returns no later than 25 days after the end of the tax period.
Depending on the turnover of the taxable person, the tax period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
In Germany, the taxable persons must submit their pre-declarations no later than 10 days depending on the amount of their tax liability in the previous year, either after the end of the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
The annual VAT return must be submitted by 31. May of the following year at the latest.
The obligation to submit an annual turnover tax return has some advantages and disadvantages:
+ At the end of the calendar year, the taxable person can correct the errors in the monthly pre-declarations by submitting a single turnover tax return;
- if the taxable person corrects his information on intra-Community transactions, the correction cannot be attributed to a specific reporting period of the CCT,
- The federal states do not compare MIAS data on intra-Community acquisitions of German taxable persons until the annual turnover declarations have been processed.
According to registration (see 4.1.3), German entrepreneurs must submit a VAT return regardless of the amount of their turnover.
This tax obligation enables the German financial administration to verify compliance with the revenue ceiling for small business owners.
In addition, the FA responsible can compare the annual turnover tax return with the corresponding declarations for direct taxes and with the annual accounts of the company concerned.
In the Czech Republic, the financial administration can only verify the amount of turnover by means of the income tax return submitted.
In contrast to the current regulations in the Czech Republic, German taxable persons are obliged to submit their pre-registration electronically.
The introduction of the obligation to submit the tax return electronically in the Czech Republic would improve the efficiency of the Czech financial administration.
Summary Stories
Submission and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic
According to the provisions in § 102 of Law No. In 235/2004, an entrepreneur who supplies goods to a person registered for tax purposes in another Member State has to submit corresponding summary reports (hereinafter referred to as ′′ ZM ′′).
The value of the delivered goods is always reported in the Czech currency in the ZM, broken down according to the VAT IdNr7, the individual taxable person under whom they are registered in the other Member State.
Information on services is not provided in the ZM.
The taxable persons with calendar monthly or quarterly annual tax period must submit the ZM to the local FA not later than the 25. th day after the end of each quarter.
Inaccurate data must be corrected in a correction ZM within 15 days of finding the error.
Incorrect data in the ZM is always replaced by the data from the correction ZM.
Similar to the tax returns, the taxable persons can also submit the ZM electronically.
Does a taxable person not give in a ZM or correction ZM, although he does so under Law No. 235/2004 is obliged, the tax officer has to ask him to submit the relevant CM and to draw attention to the consequences of the non-levy. In case of non-performance of non-monetary obligations, the financial officer is empowered to comply with § 37 of Law No. 337/1992 repeats fines up to CZK 2 million.
The NKÚ found during its examination that the FÄ usually did not use its power to impose fines on its default taxable persons.
In particular, when submitting the ZM, the taxable persons are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their obligations, since the failure to pay a ZM does not affect the amount of their turnover tax liability.
According to § 102 (5) of Law No. In 235/2004, the financial officer is obliged to verify the information contained in the ZM or Corrigendum, to remove all ambiguities and to use the information to determine the tax liability.
In case of disagreement
8 of the information in the ZM with which the taxable person corrects false information in the ZM by submitting a correction ZM either on his own initiative or upon request.
The financial officer shall correct the data on deliveries of goods to other Member States in the ATIS system if:
- the taxable person does not prove the accuracy of the information reported in the ZM (or correction ZM) and therefore corrects it by submitting a correction ZM,
- the tax officer has proven that the information reported by the taxable person in the CM or correction ZM has been incorrect.
Officers entered by the financial officer without a correction ZM being handed over by the taxable person do not replace the taxable person's duty to submit a correction ZM, but only lead to the correction of the data in MIAS so that they are current, complete and accurate...
The data from the CMM shall be transmitted to the Member States concerned.
Only the national tax authority referred to for cooperation with other Member States in the field of turnover tax may transmit and receive such data.
This is the CLO (in the Czech Republic, this function is performed by the Department of International Mutual Assistance in the field of VAT in the Ministry of Finance). The O _ MCTL message will automatically receive the CLO from other Member States.
It contains all the incorrect VAT IDNr., specified in the ZM lines.
Will the incorrect VAT number. used in some of the transmitted lines of the ZM or corrected ZM, an entry is made in the false VAT number list.
The list contains a ′′ Message of Doubts regarding VAT IdNr.".
The financial officer checks the data and enters the result of the verification into the system.
When acquiring goods from another Member State, the taxable person must state this in his turnover tax return and enter the value of the acquisition in the lines of the turnover tax return.
Selected cases of differences between the values of the acquisition made by the Czech taxable person in his turnover tax return and the values for delivery of goods stated by the supplier from the other Member State in his ZM will be forwarded by the CLO for examination to the relevant FA.
The clerks there need to investigate the deviations.
There can then be three different situations:
(a) The value stated by the Czech acquirer in the relevant headings of his turnover tax return is lower than the value of deliveries stated by suppliers from other EC Member States.
In this case, the fiscal officer shall verify the accuracy of the information.
(b) The difference is zero.
This situation can either be caused by a change in the data within the EC (the foreign supplier corrects his CM) or by a change in the information contained in the turnover tax return (the Czech taxable person now submits a supplementary VAT return on his own initiative).
In this case, it is at the discretion of the tax officer to verify the accuracy of the information contained in the VAT return anyway.
(c) The value of goods acquired from other Member States as stated in his turnover tax return is higher than the value of their deliveries of goods reported by suppliers of other EC Member States.
Again, it is at the discretion of the tax officer to verify the accuracy of the information.
After checking the differences and clarifying the reasons for their appearance, the financial officer shall enter the results of his review in ATIS.
These results will be sent to the CLO.
The number of processes submitted by the CLO for examination is shown in Graph No. 2005 for each quarter of 2005 1 (Source: Czech Ministry of Finance).
Graph 1 above shows that the number of cases submitted by the CLO has decreased for the individual quarters of 2005
The significant reduction in the number of cases in the first quarter of 2005 is due, inter alia, to the fact that the Czech CLO has increased the threshold for a case selection taking into account the minimum amount limit for a request for information to the other EC Member States.
Divergences between the data in the VAT returns and data from the EC do not always have to be based on a mistake by the domestic acquirer.
There may also be a mistake by the taxable person in another Member State or a mistake caused by the fact that certain types of deliveries in the CCM are differently stated in each EC Member State.
The most common reasons for deviations in the value of reported transactions found in the audited FÄ are shown in Table 1
Submission and processing of summary reports in Germany
Entrepreneurs who make intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EC Member States or participate in triangular transactions must deliver quarterly ZM where intra-Community deliveries are listed by acquirer (§ 18 a (1) UStG).
The ZM must be delivered no later than the 10. th day of the month following the calendar quarter.
If a permanent extension is granted for the submission of pre-registrations of sales tax, it also applies to the ZM.
The ZM are available at the CLO.
Since 1. January 2007 electronic levy is mandatory.
The FA responsible may grant exemptions for individual taxable persons in order to avoid undue hardships.
If the taxable person finds that the ZM was incorrect, he is obliged to issue a correction ZM within one month.
In case of non-delivery of ZM, the CLO initiates an enforcing procedure.
This includes the following steps: - first reminder - second reminder associated with the threat of penalty payment being fixed and - fixing the penalty payment.
Although the German Tax Code allows the establishment of a penalty payment of up to 25.000 € (§ 329 AO), the CLO sets penalty payments in three stages of 125, 250 and 500 €.
In addition to that, bestimmt 26 a (1) No. 5 UStG that the taxable person acts unlawfully if he deliberately or recklessly does not deliver a ZM correctly, completely or not in good time or if he does not correct a ZM in good time.
This violation can be punished with a fine of up to 5.000 €.
Data on intra-Community deliveries cannot be entered into MIAS by the FÄ because the CLO is exclusively responsible for processing the ZM.
The data of the ZM is only stored at the CLO.
The information from the summary reports is only available after their processing by the CLO.
The deadlines for processing ZM are set out in Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003 regulated.
ZM data must be stored within three months of the calendar quarter concerned (in MIAS).
In case of incorrect VAT number In the ZM German taxable person, the German CLO receives a notification ′′ O _ MCTL ′′ from the other Member State.
The CLO then turns to the entrepreneur and demands the right data.
If the CLO fails to get the correct information, the case will be handed over to the FA in charge.
It is then his job to request the correct information.
In the course of its exam, the BRH found that most entrepreneurs have the VAT ID. corrected at the request of the CLO.
However, the reminder, as well as the threat and fixing of up to three consecutive periodic penalty payments, takes too much time when a taxable person may be involved in a cross-border carousel fraud.
The cases that were finally reported to the responsible FÄ were usually closed within one to two months.
The FA in charge refused to exempt the reported intra-Community deliveries in 73 % of these Fälle9.
Did the taxpayer put the correct VAT ID., the FA called on him to submit a corrected ZM to the CLO because the FÄ can't correct the MIAS data themselves.
The BRH found that neither the FÄ nor the CLO controlled the levy of the corrected ZM.
This is why the taxpayers often did not comply with the request. Since the CLO does not have access to the data of the VAT returns, there is no comparison between those in the VAT pre-declarations or. Information on deliveries of goods and the corresponding information in the ZM before being transferred to the CLO of other Member States.
This matching can only be done by the FÄ This is usually done when preparing a sales tax special audit.
Data incoming from other Member States is processed at the CLO.
Incorrect VAT number are recognized and reported to the affected Member States.
The data is used to control the acquisition taxation in the FÄ.
Once available in the system, it matches the CLO with previous calendar quarters data.
If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), inspection notifications will be drawn up and sent to the relevant cases.
This happens continuously, whereas a list of the acquisition data of all persons liable to turnover will be subsequently compiled and sent to the FÄ.
The risk management system (RMS) for the assessment procedure then matches these data with those on intra-Community acquisitions.
The system fully (only) checks those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct the deduction of the VAT.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, taxable persons who have made intra-Community deliveries to a person registered for turnover tax in another Member State must deliver a ZM to the local FA within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter.
The FÄ are processing the ZM and passing the data on to the CLO.
The values of intra-Community deliveries reported by the taxable persons in the ZM shall be matched in the case of the FÄ with the values of intra-Community deliveries as stated by the same taxable persons in their turnover tax returns.
The results of the reconciliation will be taken into account in the framework of the tax determination.
In Germany, taxable persons who have made intra-Community deliveries are obliged to submit quarterly ZM within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter10.
Since 1. January 2007, taxpayers have to submit the ZM electronically to the CLO.
The data from the ZM are only available to the CLO after their processing.
In both the Czech Republic and Germany, the taxable persons only indicate the deliveries of goods in the ZM.
The provision of services is not specified in the ZM. Unlike the Czech FÄ, the German FÄ cannot correct incorrect information themselves in individual lines of the ZM submitted.
Due to this restricted access to German MIAS data, incorrect VAT number became. not corrected even if the taxable person has the right VAT ID. told the FA.
The German financial administration does not compare the information on intra-Community deliveries made by German taxable persons in their sales tax pre-declarations with the information contained in the corresponding ZM.
Differences between pre-notification data and ZM are regularly not revealed until the German CLO transmits MIAS data to other Member States.
Based on these findings of the BRH, it is evident that a comparison would improve the reliability of the MIAS data transmitted.
The data on deliveries of goods to Czech taxable persons transmitted by other Member States is compared in the Czech Republic with the data on the acquisition of goods provided by the Czech taxable persons in their turnover tax returns.
The Czech CLO checks separately for each calendar quarter.
The most serious cases of deviations are sent to the FÄ for examination.
Unlike the Czech financial administration, the German financial administration does not generally examine the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.
Such general control is only carried out by taxable persons who are not fully entitled to deduct VAT.
In addition, the German tax administration only controls the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other taxable persons if the RMS has issued an inspection note or the taxable person has already been selected for an examination.
This procedure relieves the FÄ from clarifying the reasons for the differences.
On the other hand, exposing VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
Updated information on intra-Community acquisitions must be available as early as possible to combat carousel fraud.
The current system of ZM, especially MIAS, provides information to the fiscal authorities, which may well be half a year old.
This delay in time could be reduced to up to four months if taxpayers had to surrender monthly ZM.
The monthly levy would only significantly increase the bureaucratic effort, since most taxpayers in the Czech Republic and Germany are already subject to monthly VAT returns or taxes.-Pre-declarations are obligatory and no more information is required for ZM than for the VAT returns or VAT returns.-pre-registrations.
In order to avoid bureaucracy, the submission of ZM could be possible by submitting the VAT returns or by submitting the VAT returns.-pre-registrations will be connected.
However, a compulsory monthly delivery of ZM would cause more periodic discrepancies between intra-Community deliveries and intra-Community purchases and would increase data flows between CLOs.
In 2006, the federal government considered the general introduction of monthly ZM.
The implementation failed due to the concerns of the federal states.
They feared that monthly transmission of MIAS data to other member states CLOs could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In order for the obligation to submit monthly ZM to effect, it is necessary to reach agreement at European level on the single monthly levy so that it is possible to update MIAS data on a monthly basis.
Statistical information on deliveries of goods and acquisitions between the Czech Republic and Germany
In foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the Czech Republic.
The total turnover of intraCommunity trade between the Czech Republic and Germany is shown in Table No. 2 depicted.
Both auditors requested data on the number of incorrect tax numbers or. VAT number in the O _ MCTL reports exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany for the individual audited quarter.
These data can be found in the following tables.
They have significant differences.
The reason for the differences can be a different basis for calculation of the number of O _ MCTL messages.
While the Czech CLO refers to the calendar quarter for which the ZM was submitted, the German CLO refers its figures to the calendar quarter in which O _ MCTL reported.
International exchange of information at level 3
conducting international exchange of information in the Czech Republic
International exchange of information enables financial officials to receive information from other Member States on intra-Community transactions as well as on the taxable persons who have implemented them.
Regulation (EC) No Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on mutual assistance in the field of VAT, which provides for Directive 1798/2003 / EC. Regulation (EC) No 218/92 was repealed in 218/92 (hereinafter referred to as Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 of the Council ′′), distinguishes between two basic types of exchange of information: exchange of information upon request and spontaneous exchange of information (without prior request).
International exchange of information upon request is carried out by means of a request for information RFI using the standardized SCAC form.
Finance officials in the Czech Republic send their RFIs or. their responses to an RFI received by the Financial Directorate to the CLO. This provides for the translation of the information provided in the standardized SCAC form into the foreign language and for the transmission to the other Member States.
In addition, the CLO receives requests for information (RFIs) from other Member States and replies to requests sent. It delivers their translation into Czech and their distribution to the responsible FÄ for processing.
Art 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 sets a maximum period of three months from receipt of the request for its processing.
All the RFI exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany during the period examined were examined by the NKÚ
Out of the total number of 94 of the RFIs received from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74,5 %) were processed within the three-month period; in another 23 cases (i.e. 24,5 %) this processing period was exceeded.
In the remaining one case, no response had been sent to Germany until the NKÚ was examined. More detailed information on the deadlines within which requests made by Germany were answered by the Czech Republic can be found in Graph 2.
Out of the total number of 335 requests for information (RFIs) addressed to Germany from the Czech Republic, 136 cases (i.e. 40,6 %) resulted in a response within the three-month period; another 179 (i.e. 53,4). %) were processed after the expiry of this period and in 19 cases, no response from Germany was received at the moment (in the remaining one case it could not be determined on the basis of the explained information when Germany replied to the request for information).
More detailed information on the deadlines within which the requests for information from the Czech Republic from Germany were answered can be found in Graph No. 3.
The percentage of intraCommunity turnover expressed in the requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany is shown in Graph No. 4 depicted.
The graph above shows that the turnover checked in connection with requests for information usually had values of over 60.000 €.
The international exchange of information without prior request takes place either automatically, structured automatically or in the form of spontaneous information.
The financial officials of other Member States are often provided with information without prior request, which is important for determining the turnover tax liability.
In the Czech Republic all information is collected at the CLO.
The exchange of information between the different Member States takes place electronically.
'Automatic exchange' in accordance with Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003 of the Council means the systematic transmission of previously defined information to other Member States at regular intervals, without prior request.
'Structured automatic exchange' means the systematic transmission of previously defined information to another Member State without prior request as soon as the relevant information is available.
The Czech Republic shall inform the other Member States of automatic exchange of information about deliveries of new vehicles.
This information is obtained from the form notification of the delivery of a new vehicle according to § 19 of Law No. 235/2004 and from the copy of the invoice issued.
When processing this form, the financial officer enters the required data into the corresponding document submission and forwards it directly to the responsible employee of the Financial Directorate where such data will be collected and sent to the CLO for further processing. Subsequently, those data will be transmitted to the other Member States within the prescribed period, at the latest within two months of the end of the quarter in which they were won.
The Czech Republic shall also provide the other Member States with information on transactions in mail order that are tax-free in the country of origin, intra-Community transactions that appear inadmissible and potential ' Missing Trader s'.
This information shall be transmitted to the other Member States via a SCAC form in spontaneous exchange of information.
conducting international exchange of information in Germany
In Germany, the initiative for requests for information and spontaneous exchange of information comes from the local FA.
The FÄ send the completed SCAC 2004 form directly to the German CLO, which forwards the SCACforms to the foreign CLO.
FÄ are instructed to write their requests for information or spontaneous information only in German, even the SCAC form used is a language.
Half of the German requests for information examined by the BRH were sent to ensure or taxation of acquisition in the other Member State. to prove the tax exemption of intra-Community delivery from Germany to the other Member State.
If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it checks whether the value of the deliveries mentioned in the request exceeds the minimum amount of € 15.000
If there is no reasonable reason for the request, the German CLO refuses to provide information regarding a turnover below the minimum amount limit.
In addition, the German CLO provides the translation of the freely formulated texts in the SCAC form [(B1- 17) or (E)], if they are not written in German or English.
In response to the request for information, the CLO directs this to the FA responsible, referring to the three-month period.
No further deadlines are set at the different levels of the German financial administration.
Although the German CLO has the technical means to monitor compliance with deadlines, it does not have the necessary personnel capacities to remind the FÄ of responding to the unfinished requests for information.
The FÄ receive the necessary information by letter from the taxable person or conducting an external audit.
The external auditors usually choose between two forms of audit: the special sales tax audit, which covers all taxable transactions within a period of several months or the so-called turnover tax review, which may be possible. relates only to a recent process.
In this short and flexible form of audit, an announcement to the taxable person is not required and it has proven itself in the examination of a single turnover.
When automatically exchanging information, Germany will send the following information to the other Member State: - via VAT number assigned to companies established in other EC Member States - on the refund of input tax to entrepreneurs residing in other EC Member States...
In addition, Germany has undertaken to provide the following information to the other EC Member States in the context of the structured automatic exchange of information:
a. a. Delivery of new vehicles to entrepreneurs without VAT: b. Distance sales (mail order) to other EC Member States not subject to turnover tax in Germany, c. Significant differences between acquisitions reported by a taxable person and MIAS data transmitted by other Member States, i.e. intra-Community deliveries of goods which were incorrectly subject to taxation by the taxable person in Germany, e. potential ′′ Missing Traders ′′ that have made intra-Community turnover, regardless of whether their VAT number. is still valid or has already been deleted and f. Taxable persons who have made intra-Community deliveries to potential ′′ Missing Traders ′′ or to customers who have issued a VAT number. misused.
Comparison and evaluation
The sending of requests for information or Spontaneous information is carried out in both the Czech Republic and Germany on the initiative of the local FÄ, which send the corresponding SCAC forms to the CLO.
While the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCAC forms (Czech-English) and provided information in English or German. German language translated, the German FÄ follows the instructions to submit requests for information or spontaneous information on a monolingual form only in German.
The German CLO does not produce translations of German texts.
When examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany between 1. May 2004 and 31. December 2005, the NKÚ found that the Czech financial administration completed 74,5 % of the requests for information received within the three-month period, while the requests for information addressed to Germany were only processed by the German financial administration in 40,6 % of cases within this period.
Although the German CLO points out the FÄ to the three-month period, it does not monitor compliance with it.
Due to the lack of memories, there is a large proportion of temporary requests for information replies.
That's why the BRH recommended a continuous reminder procedure to the German CLO.
The situation has changed by now.
According to the information available to us, the German CLO now reminds the tax authorities of responding to the pending requests for information.
Sales tax risk management
Risk management in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, several organizational units at different levels of financial administration are involved in risk management in the field of sales tax.
Within the Czech Ministry of Finance, the following organizational units are responsible for risk management and the fight against VAT fraud:
The Department of Methodology and Economic Administration of Sales Tax or their risk management unit deals with identifying potential risk fields for tax revenue and evaluating trends in these risks in domestic and intra-Community trade.
At national level, this body coordinates the requirements for the ′′ credibility of VAT returns ′′ criterion and uses MIAS data to discover possible tax evasions in the context of intra-Community deliveries and acquisitions.
Based on data on the trade balance of the Czech Republic, it evaluates risk-free goods, prepares conceptually risk management in the field of turnover tax and cooperates in this field with the relevant EC institutions and other Member States.
The Department of International Administrative Assistance in the field of turnover taxes provides information exchange, contributes to the creation and maintenance of a relevant information database, evaluates the data available under the MIAS system, conducts public relations and is in favour of other forms of intergovernmental assistance within the meaning of the Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003

The Department of Tax Audit and Tax Search conducts, among other things, risk analyses in the methodological control of tax audits, sets priorities for the work planning of the Financial Directorates with regard to the selection of cases to be examined, draws up risk analyses to combat tax evasion and collects information from the Financial administration and other sources and make suggestions for measures to combat tax evasion.
The financial directorates are responsible for the tax search. Their tasks include the search for taxpayers and industries that are at risk with regard to the frequency of tax evasion (e.g. internet shops, gold, pharmaceuticals), the search for unregistered taxpayers (e.g. in the sectors Internet services, employment services, electronic and print media, etc.)....), investigating chain fraud interconnections and informing local fiscal authorities.
Special exam units were set up in 12 selected cases.
These have regional competence and, on the basis of appropriate authorization, carry out tax audits outside the local competence of the FÄ.
The need to set up the special examination units resulted from the increase in new and ′′ improved ′′ forms of tax evasion, especially in connection with chain transactions.
These special units are checking according to the needs of the tax authorities or focus on taxpayers with specific activities, multinational companies and taxpayers with particularly high turnover.
The following mechanisms to reduce the risks associated with turnover tax have been integrated into the ATIS system: - the task ′′ credibility of turnover tax returns ′′ to assess the risk of tax returns, - the task ′′ selecting taxable persons to be examined ′′ with the taxable persons to be examined using the following :-the MIAS task, which enables financial officials to access the data provided by other EC Member States.
The task ′′ MIAS ′′ enables, among other things, the following: - verification of the validity of the VAT number.-confirmation of the value of the goods delivered to a Czech taxable person as stated in the CM by all the suppliers of the taxable person concerned from other Member States, - preparation of a list of taxable persons who have not surrendered ZM, - formal Control of the information provided by taxable persons in the Czech Republic in their CM before they are transmitted to other Member States - drawing up a list of taxable persons whose turnover tax returns do not correspond to those in the CC, - drawing up a list of taxable persons whose turnover tax returns do not match the value of goods purchased from other Member States with the information contained in the CCM of all their suppliers from other Member States13.
As part of their task to combat tax evasion, the financial officials have access to the data with state authorities such as Commercial Registers, Land Registers, Motor Vehicle Registers, Commercial Registers, etc.
More detailed information can be found in section 4.4.1 Submission and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic.
Risk management in Germany
Because of their federal structure, both the federal financial authorities (especially the CLO) and the financial administrations of the 16 federal states are involved in the development and introduction of an RMS in the Federal Republic of Germany.
Although there are joint working groups for development, neither the CLO nor the federal state financial administrations fully have a uniform database.
At the CLO level, Unit ST I 2 (hereinafter referred to as ′′ KUSS ′′ - coordination centre for sales tax audits and fiscal search measures) collects the findings of fraud in the OPUS database.
In cooperation with the countries, another database called MAGIC was set up at KUSS. There, the tax authorities can enter and query the names of discovered Missing Traders or VAT fraudsters.
KUSS coordinates both related cases of turnover tax fraud at national level and cases of cross-border sales tax fraud.
KISS's experiences are brought into the development of the RMS through their cooperation in the working groups.
In addition, specialists from several other organizational units of the CLO and BMF are also involved.
The formal review of the composition of VAT No. of other Member States that appear in the ZM German taxable persons will be carried out at the CLO.
This formal review will take place before the ZM is transmitted to other Member States in order to improve the reliability of MIAS data and thus also its benefits (cf. 4.4.2).
The validity test in the ZM mentioned VAT number. occurs using the O _ MCTL identifiers transmitted by other Member States (for the procedure for correcting invalid VAT ID number, see also 4.4.2).
In addition, the CLO's RMS relies on MIAS data transmitted by other Member States and generates various types of communications to discover alleged Missing Traders. Some features are used as indications, which usually occur in carousel shops.
The FÄ of the federal states are instructed to process these communications and have to be forwarded to the CLO in certain cases.
The BRH audit confirmed that all available features must be included in order to likely conclude a case of tax fraud (rather than focusing mainly on a company's turnover).
Accordingly, the BRH has recommended that the BMF should work with combinations of various indications when it comes to making the messages.
The risk management system should also take into account other indications, e.g. the payment behaviour of the taxable person, the industry or the company's equity.
A second level of risk management is among the financial administrations of the federal states and focuses on processing VAT pre-registrations and annual declarations.
For example, the system draws up a list of those taxable persons who are in their VAT pre-declaration or. Annual declaration of intra-Community deliveries.
This list will be sent to the CLO to monitor the full delivery of the ZM.
In addition, this type of risk management compares the acquisitions stated by the taxable person in his annual turnover tax return to the data in MIAS.
The federal government's financial administrations avoid comparing quarterly data as they would result in too many inconsistencies due to factors other than tax evasion or fraud; e.g. B.:
- Supplier and acquirer assume different dates for the implementation of intra-Community turnover;
- different accounting records and tax statement of discounts and discounts.
In addition to comparing the data from the turnover tax returns with the MIAS data, many federal states have certain mechanisms of risk management based on information contained in the turnover tax returns and certain other indications (e.g. company wording, age of owners / shareholders, number of employees and method of payment of the taxable person)...
Bavaria has introduced a fixed-rule risk management system that enables a team of specialists in the fight against tax fraud (hereinafter referred to as ′′ risk managers ′′) to program their own rules in such a way that alleged tax fraudsters are filtered out.
This system is used when processing VAT pre-declarations by the FÄ.
This gives the FA in charge the information from the RMS before the turnover tax is fixed.
Since this system is not capable of learning, risk managers must adapt the rules according to the feedback from the FÄ.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has developed an adaptive neural network based on the data of exposed evasion cases.
Based on these data, the RMS is able to learn the characteristics of tax evasion.
The system draws up a monthly list of tax cases where there are evidence of tax evasion.
On the basis of this list, the competent FÄ decide on the examination of the taxable persons concerned.
After the audit, the tax auditors must report their results so that the RMS can learn from the results of the examinations they have proposed.
In North Rhine-Westphalia, an adaptive neural network is used in combination with a rule-based fuzzy system.
Based on a lot of data from processed VAT returns and some other indications, this neuro fuzzy system (also called datamining system) calculates how likely a taxable person is to be involved in tax fraud.
After that, it creates a monthly list of suspected tax fraudsters.
On the basis of this list, the FÄ select the taxable persons concerned for examination and report the results to the data center concerned.
The introduction of these three RMS is underway in the federal states.
As each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three anti-fraud systems seems to be a good idea.
It remains to be seen whether the hoped for effects will be adjusted during actual use.
Comparison and evaluation
Although this report is not possible to deal with the specific criteria of the RMS in the Czech and Germany, the NKÚ and the BRH have found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.
Just like the different approaches in the three German states mentioned above, the RMS of each European state has its special strengths and weaknesses.
There is currently an exchange of experiences between the fiscal authorities of the European Member States on new trends and models of cross-border sales tax fraud.
Turnover tax fraud - especially carousel fraud - has proved not a national problem but a European one.
The people involved in fraud coordinate their actions not only in one but in several Member States.
A Member State alone cannot develop an effective RMS.
Successful criteria, components or approaches to an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in every EC Member State. If this does not happen, scammers will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS for their crimes.
The tax losses caused by Europe-wide frauds on turnover taxes do not necessarily affect the Member State in which the initiator is based.
Any other Member State involved in the fraud may be affected.
This is why there should be a European exchange of experiences on the RMS.
Selected results from the examination of individual turnover During the parallel tests, the NKÚ and the BRH examined the quality and utilization of information on selected deliveries or supplies.
Acquisition that was the subject of international exchange of information between the Czech Republic and Germany.
In addition, the two courts of law jointly examined the processing of several deliveries about which there were doubts about their implementation or which the taxpayers of both States explained differently in the tax returns or in the CM.
At the request of the BRH, the NKÚ examined a total of eight transactions between eight Czech and eight German taxpayers.
In addition, in 43 cases, the NKÚ examined the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany, which Czech taxable persons had stated in their tax returns and ZM in 43 cases.
At the request of the NKÚ the BRH checked a total of 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech taxpayers.
The relevant information was exchanged exclusively on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 via the CLO.
Examination of selected cases revealed, inter alia, that the different procedures for registration in the EC Member States lead to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:
1.
According to the MIAS data, a Czech taxable person bought goods worth € 60.500 from a German taxable person in the third quarter of 2004
When the Czech taxable person declared an acquisition of only € 29.869, the Czech financial administration addressed a request for information to Germany to verify the value of the goods delivered.
In its reply to the Czech request for information, the German side stated that the German taxable person concerned had goods valued at € 27.381 in the first quarter of 2. to his Czech counterparty in the first quarter of 2004, and in the third quarter of 31.997, goods valued at € 31.997 and delivered in the fourth quarter worth € 10.276
Furthermore, the answer resulted in the fact that the VAT number. of the German taxable person was only valid from 28. September 2004 However, the German CLO had granted another application by the German taxpayer and the validity of the VAT IDNr. retroactively moved forward to 1. May 2004
The German taxable person corrected the ZM.
Based on this information, it was a (intra-Community) purchase of goods by the Czech taxpayer.
Through a request to the responsible tax office in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that in 2004 the Czech taxable person had submitted additional turnover tax returns for the individual (under-year) tax periods during which he declared a higher value of acquisitions from other Member States and at the same time requested the deduction of input tax from acquisitions from other Member States.
On the basis of these additional turnover tax returns, the relevant clerk of the Czech Tax Office could not clearly determine whether the declared acquisitions also included the value of the deliveries of the abovementioned German supplier.
In response to a request for information from the NKÚ the BRH found that the German supplier had been registered as VATable in September 2003
Je-but he had not applied for the allocation of a VAT number, but only a tax number that is exclusively applicable to Germany when registering.
Although it is usually not possible in Germany to retroactively give a taxable person a VAT number. In 2006, the responsible clerk of the German financial administration did so retroactively on 1. May 2004.
The German CLO shares a VAT number. retroactively, if the German entrepreneur did not cause the delayed allocation; e.g. if the CLO had the delay after the taxable person's application for the issue of a VAT number. caused.
In this case, CLO issuance the VAT number. retroactive because the entrepreneur according to § 6 UStG does not have a valid VAT ID for intra-community delivery. needed.
Conversely, a German acquirer does not need the (valid) VAT number. of its supplier to explain intra-community acquisition.
Due to these procedural differences between the Member States, the German CLO issued VAT number. retroactively in this particular case.
2.
As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech financial officer requested the verification of the turnover tax registration of the German entrepreneur.
The MIAS data shows as the date of registration of 5. March 2005, while a registration certificate issued by the local German FA shows the 1. October 2004
The German authorities stated in their reply that the German taxable person was registered on 1. October 2004, but for organizational reasons it was not until 16. February 2005 in Germany. Allotted.
By requesting the local Czech financial officer, the NKÚ learned that the tax officer had carried out a turnover tax audit with the Czech taxable person for the tax period from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005
During this examination, the tax office found that in his turnover tax return the Czech taxable person had declared services worth CZK 9.897, which he provided to the German taxable person before his turnover tax registration (i.e. before 1. October 2004).).
The (Czech) tax office fixed a tax liability of CZK 1.880 to the Czech taxable person for the third quarter of 2004
Due to the NKÚ's request, the BRH found that the German taxable person has the VAT number. had only been assigned when he filed for his company founded in 2004 with the FA on 16. February 2005
In addition, the FA registered him retroactively from 1. October 200415 for purposes of sales tax in order to be able to monitor the lodging of the VAT return for 2004
In this turnover tax return, the taxable person gave intra-Community acquisitions from the Czech Republic worth 160 € (approx. 5.000 CZK).
3. In his turnover tax return for September 2004 and in his ZM for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech taxable person reported deliveries worth CZK 114.615 to a German taxable person.
When checking the registration of the German taxable person in the MIAS system, the Czech fiscal officer found that this registration was only valid from 11. November 2004 and thus after deliveries to Germany.
The Czech taxable person submitted a supplementary VAT return declaring turnover from domestic deliveries worth CZK 114.615 and turnover tax of CZK 21.777, which he paid.
Through a request to the local FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxable person subsequently filed a request for the resumption of the taxation procedure in respect of the supplementary turnover tax return. As proof, he submitted a confirmation from the German financial administration that the German taxable person had been registered since 1. January 2000
Accordingly, the Czech financial officer verified the validity of the registration of the German taxable person in the context of the international exchange of information.
According to German information, it was found that the German taxable person does not receive a VAT number until 11. November 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of goods. had been assigned.
As a result, the Czech fiscal officer rejected the application for resumption of the taxation procedure.
The BRH found that in this case no intra-Community acquisition of goods had taken place because the German taxable person did not receive a VAT number until 11. November 2004 had received.
However, the German recipient declared both acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and turnover tax and also demanded the reimbursement of input taxes at the same level.
Because this did not lead to a change in the amount of the tax liability of the German taxable person, the German tax officer did not correct the information contained in the turnover tax return.
Furthermore, the BRH found that the company of the German taxable person mentioned in the request for information was changed during the processing of the answer in Germany, which led to confusion between two German taxable persons.
This change of name for the German taxable person also confused the Czech tax officer.
4.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German financial officer verified the purchase of goods by a Czech taxable person from a German taxable person worth € 22.686 in the first quarter of 2005
By requesting the local tax officer in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech financial officer had investigated, during an external audit with the Czech taxable person, whether the intra-Community delivery had actually taken place and whether the Czech taxable person had the invoice for the delivery of the goods had booked and paid for.
The Czech taxable person did not explain the intra-Community acquisition in his turnover tax return because the German supplier did not explain his VAT number in the invoice. but only gave his tax number for business within Germany.
According to the MIAS data, the German taxable person will not be registered until 21. April 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech taxable person, for turnover tax in connection with intra-Community transactions.
The Czech financial officer also requested that the German financial administration should send a copy of the registration certificate of the German taxable person so that he could. could initiate a corresponding taxation procedure.
The Czech FA considered this business to be the acquisition of goods from a non-entrepreneurial (private) person in Germany and therefore did not set a turnover tax for the purchase of goods from Germany.
The BRH found that under German law a taxable person who supplies goods to other Member States does not have a VAT ID. for intra-Community deliveries in order to qualify for the exemption from value added tax for such a delivery.
The delivery person just needs the VAT number. of the acquirer in the other Member State and can prove the transport of the goods in question to the other Member State.
In this case, the turnover under German tax law is a (exempt) intra-Community supply that should be subject to acquisition taxation in the Czech Republic.
In any case, it is important that the Czech financial officer took note of this transaction because the delivery of a machine of this value was not part of the core business of the German supplier.
As described in section 4.6.2, the German CLO rejects requests for information on intra-Community transactions if they are below the minimum amount limit of € 15.000: 5.
According to the MIAS data, a Czech taxable person acquired goods worth € 12.561 from a German taxable person in the third quarter of 2004
The Czech fiscal officer carried out an audit for this tax period.
Within the framework of intergovernmental assistance, the Czech financial administration requested the examination of this delivery by means of a SCAC form.
The Czech taxable person claimed that he did not receive the goods, that he had never been in business with the German company and that the purchase of the goods in question was not accounted for.
The German financial administration rejected the request for the transmission of receipts - contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents - because the turnover was less than 15.000 € and no other justification was given.
Since the Czech fiscal officer did not receive any documents for retrospective taxation of the goods purchased, the tax audit remained unsuccessful and the original tax determination was in place.
Following a request from the NKÚ the BRH found that the German taxable person acted as ′′ fiscal Fiskalvertreter17" (§ 22 (a) - (e) UStG).
The German taxable person explained these deliveries in his VAT return and in the ZM.
His right to tax exemption has been recognized.
Due to the notification by the BRH, the German FA will send the documents required for subsequent taxation of the purchased goods to the Czech Republic.
Section 4.6.1 showed that the responses of the German financial administration to requests for information exceeded the three-month period more often than the replies of the Czech financial administration:
6. During its audit, the NKÚ found that on 5. October 2005 the Czech Financial Administration had submitted a request for information on the value of deliveries made in the first quarter of 2004 to Germany.
In the ZM for this quarter, the German taxable person had reported a delivery of goods to the Czech taxable person worth € 86.307; however, the Czech taxable person declared only the purchase of goods worth € 35.314 for the same period in his VAT return.
In response to the request for information issued by the Czech Republic on 9. May 2006, i.e. after the expiry of the kind. 8 of Regulation (EC) No In 1798/2003, the German side announced that the request for information could not be processed since the German company was dissolved at the end of 2005
Because the German financial administration did not meet the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech tax administration did not have the documents necessary for taxation in the Czech Republic.
7. In 2005, a Czech tax officer requested the verification of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German taxable person valued at € 1.265.554 by means of a SCAC form, using a SCAC form of 2004, with indications of carousel fraud.
The NKÚ found that a German response to the request for information had not yet been received at the time of its examination.
Through a request from the local tax officer, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxable person had not declared in his turnover tax return the supply of new motor vehicles to this German taxable person worth CZK 11.816.103
The Czech financial officer corrected the information in the tax return and the Czech taxable person submitted a corrected ZM.
Due to technical problems, the German CLO did not forward this request for information to the local FA for examination.
After the notification by the BRH, a special sales tax audit was carried out with the German acquirer in Germany. It was found that the purchase of all the motor vehicles concerned had been correctly taxed and that the vehicles were sold to other taxable persons in Germany.
8. According to MIAS data, the Czech taxable person acquired a car worth € 48.500 from a German taxable person in the first quarter of 2004
However, the Czech taxable person did not explain intra-Community acquisition.
By requesting the local tax officer in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxable person had not submitted a turnover tax return since August 2004
The Czech taxable person did not submit any tax returns even after the request by the tax officer. As a result, the FA fixed the turnover tax liability for the period October to December 2004 at zero on 23. May 2005
On 2. June 2005, the CLO issued an order to examine the said supply by the German taxable person.
Since the Czech taxable person did not cooperate with the tax officer, he addressed a request for information about the abovementioned delivery to Germany.
Since the reply to the request for information was not received until 7. February 2007, it was not known until the end of the audit of the NKÚ how the Czech fiscal officer used the information obtained during the international exchange of information.
Due to non-compliance with the obligations under the Czech VAT Act, the VAT registration of the Czech taxable person was cancelled with effect from 23. August 2005
In some cases, only a partial response was sent because at the time of the audit of the NKÚ and the BRH, the FA in charge had not yet completed the external audit:
9.
In 2005, the Czech financial officer requested the verification of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German taxable person valued at € 16.991 by means of a SCAC form, which was carried out in the third quarter of 2004, with indications of carousel fraud.
In his reply to the request for information, the German financial officer stated that he had only the invoices issued by the Czech taxable tax on deliveries valued at € 16.335
Following the request of the NKÚ the BRH found that the external audit carried out by the German FA with the acquirer in Germany was not yet completed.
The German acquirer declared the purchase of goods valued at € 16.335 double in his sales tax pre-registrations for August and September 2004.
10. In 2005, a Czech tax officer requested the verification of the deliveries of motor vehicles to a German taxable person in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005, using a SCAC form, of € 198.167, with: There were signs of carousel fraud.
The German financial administration submitted a partial response to the request for information to the Czech Republic confirming that the German taxable person had acquired several motor vehicles and that the investigation in Germany has not yet been completed.
The NKÚ found that the local FA had carried out several external audits on the Czech taxable person in order to verify the deduction above average high taxes.
However, an unjustified claim was not found.
The BRH found that for the period in question, the German taxable person declared the purchase of goods from other Member States totalling € 579.114 in his turnover tax returns and that the German FA's examination has not yet been completed with the acquirer in Germany.
Section 4.4.1 describes the reasons for inconsistencies between the declaration of intra-Community acquisition in the recipient's turnover tax return and the information contained in the supplier's ZM.
In the cases examined, periodic Unstimmig or incorrect declarations of turnover as intra-Community goods were not the most common reasons for the differences:
11.
According to the data from MIAS, the Czech taxable person acquired 35.716 € worth of goods from the German taxable person in the first quarter of 2005, but the Czech taxable person did not declare this acquisition.
Since the Czech taxable person did not cooperate with the tax officer and did not undertake any business at the company's legal headquarters, the Czech fiscal officer asked for a verification as part of the international exchange of information, how the German taxable person had communicated with the Czech.
The German response to the request for information revealed that according to the findings of the German financial administration, the Czech taxpayer was unknown at the address provided and the goods were collected by an agreed forwarder.
The total value of the order was 155.000 €, but the German taxable person only delivered goods worth 21.659 €.
The Czech taxable person sent the German taxable person a false payment confirmation of the amount of 155.153 € in favor of the German taxable person.
After exposing the fraudulent behaviour of the Czech acquirer, the German taxable person managed to get back the delivered material with the support of his other Czech customers, with the exception of a part worth € 7.916
Through a request to the local FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that, on the basis of the information received, the financial administration subsequently carried out the turnover taxation of goods deliveries from other Member States, among other things, on the basis of the information received to the Czech taxable person.
Following a request from the NKÚ the BRH confirmed that the German supplier had only reported a delivery of goods to the Czech taxable person worth € 7.916 after adjustments.
According to German law, the German taxable person declared the reversal of supply and the reduction of the taxable basis during the quarter of the reversal.
His ZM contained the following information concerning the Czech taxable persons:
12.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German financial administration requested the verification of a delivery of goods and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005. via a SCAC form.
According to the request for information, the Czech taxable person had delivered goods totalling € 396.126 to the German taxable person during the period in question and provided services worth € 11.885
The NKÚ found that the Czech financial administration had carried out an audit with the Czech taxable person to investigate this supply.
In response to the request for information, the Czech financial administration stated that the Czech taxable person had supplied and installed a production plant to the German.
The Czech taxable person delivered the individual parts of the production plant before the Czech Republic joined the EC and the production plant was installed on the basis of the order after 1. May 2004
The German taxable person did not remove the installed production plant and claimed defects.
In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech taxable person charged the German production plant for 107.100 € and 11.885 € for services.
The German taxpayer received the accounts, but did not acknowledge them and did not pay them either.
By requesting the local tax officer in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that all the invoices had been duly recorded in the books of the Czech taxable person.
The third quarter of 2005 VAT returns contained only the amounts documented by the Czech taxable person and related to invoices invoiced after the first of May 2004
The BRH found that the local FA concluded on the basis of the reply of the Czech financial administration that these transactions were a uniform (goods) delivery of the Czech taxable person to the German including the assembly.
In this particular case, the place of performance of this so-called factory delivery is the place where the production plant is installed.
The German recipient of the factory delivery owes the turnover tax according to the German Value Added Tax Act.
At the same time, the recipient can claim a deduction of the same amount.
Since the German taxable person's turnover tax liability remained unchanged, the German FA did not initiate an adjustment to the VAT return.
13. According to MIAS data, the Czech taxable person A acquired a machine worth € 58.000 from the German taxable person C in February 2005
The Czech fiscal officer addressed a request for review of this information to Germany.
In response to the request for information, the German side stated that the German taxable person C had delivered this machine to the Czech taxable person B in 2004, but who had returned it to the German taxable person C in October 2004
According to the German financial administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but to the establishment of the German taxable person C in the Czech Republic.
The reply to the request for information further revealed that the German taxable person C had delivered the machine to the Czech taxable person A in February 2005
He received the machine at the headquarters of the branch of the German taxable person in the Czech Republic.
Since this delivery (from C to A) only took place within the Czech Republic, there was no intra-Community delivery.
According to MIAS data, the German taxable person C had delivered goods (another machine) to the Czech taxable person (another machine) valued at € 88.027 in the third quarter of 2004...
The taxable person B stated that he did not receive this product, so that the Czech tax official responsible for the local financial service sent a request for information to Germany.
The answer to this was that the machine was delivered.
In the course of further investigation with taxable person B, the tax officer found that the machine valued at € 88.027 had not been accounted for by the taxable person B and that it could be the same type of machine as it was the establishment of the German taxable person C in On February 2005, 2005, the Czech taxable person A delivered.
The NKÚ continued to find that the Czech fiscal officer responsible for taxable person A had carried out an audit on him.
The financial officer had the account of the German taxable person C dated 7. February 2005, in which the taxable person A is to indicate as the recipient of the machine.
The Czech fiscal officer found that the taxable person A had not recorded this bill.
The taxable person A had concluded a lease with another Czech company whose object was a machine of the same kind.
The leasing company delivered the machine on February 9., 2005 and also provided transport.
The Czech FA did not use the information provided in the reply to the request for information to determine the taxable person A.
The BRH found that the German taxable person C had delivered the machine worth € 88.027 not to the Czech Republic, but to another German taxable person D.
Accordingly, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods, but a taxable delivery within Germany.
Consequently, the German tax officer did not recognise the claim of the German taxable person C to exemption from VAT and corrected the information in his tax return.
The German taxable person D delivered the machine to the Czech taxable person B.
According to German law, this delivery was not taxable in Germany, but was subject to turnover tax in the Czech Republic.
The BRH further stated that the German taxable person C had declared the supply of a machine worth € 58.000 to the Czech taxable person A in his ZM for the first quarter of 2005
This delivery was not checked during the tax audit carried out by the German FA.
The following figure shows the contractual relationship between the counterparties involved in the above mentioned transactions.
14.
On 4. October 2005, the NKÚ found that the Czech Financial Administration received a request for information from Germany in which a German tax official checks the intra-Community deliveries of a German taxable person valued at € 879.680.625 to a Czech taxpayers requested.
The German financial officer stated that there is a suspicion that this was a fictional intra-Community delivery of goods.
The German taxable person has not pursued an active business since 1999
The NKÚ found that the Czech fiscal officer had carried out an external audit on the Czech taxable person.
The head of the Czech company explained that this was probably a claim of the German taxable person against the German financial administration, which the Czech taxable person claimed as shareholder in the German company at the German FA.
According to the information submitted to the NKÚ the Czech financial officer has so far no information about the fact that the German financial administration is dealing with the case with reference to the Czech taxable person.
Based on the information available, it shows that it was not a delivery of goods; however, the amount concerned is still stored as intra-Community delivery of goods from Germany to a Czech taxable person in MIAS.
The main reason for these inconsistencies was the refusal of intra-Community acquisition in the recipient s' tax returns (see section 4.4.1):
15. According to the MIAS data, a German taxable person delivered a total of € 33.205 from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005 to a Czech taxable person.
However, the Czech taxable person did not explain the intra-Community acquisition.
The Czech financial officer requested an examination of the delivery of goods from Germany as part of the intergovernmental exchange of information.
In its reply to this request for information, the German side stated that the German taxable person had dispatched some of the goods to the address of the Czech taxable person and that he had collected the other goods personally.
By requesting the local Czech fiscal officer, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxable person had submitted a supplementary turnover tax return for the period concerned before receiving a reply to the request for information.
Nevertheless, the differences in the values of the acquisition could not be clarified, so that the Czech financial officer recommended a tax audit with the Czech taxable person.
This test has not yet been carried out.
16. According to the MIAS data, a German taxable person had delivered goods worth € 46.854 to a Czech taxable person in the third quarter of 2004
For the same period, a Czech taxable person declared the intra-Community acquisition of goods valued at only 14.856 €.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech fiscal officer asked to verify the actual value of the delivery.
With the German answer to this request, three invoices were sent, which showed a total value of € 31.999, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech taxable person and the MIAS data.
By requesting the local Czech financial officer, the NKÚ found that after receiving the answer from Germany, he had contacted the accountant of the Czech taxable person and remained with her in such a way that after verification of the invoices with the company owner, she had to submit a supplementary Sales tax return for the third quarter of 2004
So far, no additional VAT return has been submitted.
The Czech fiscal officer informed NKÚ that he would proceed in such a way that the deadlines for retroactive turnover tax determination would be respected for the relevant tax period.
17.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German taxable person delivered goods worth € 11.600 to the German taxable person.
In the context of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the German financial officer asked whether the Czech taxable person actually existed because the alleged capital owner of the German taxable person had founded a number of shell companies in Germany.
In the course of the FA review of the transaction, the Czech taxable person confirmed the purchase of the goods.
According to the Czech taxable person, however, the goods were not delivered from Germany to the Czech Republic, but resold in Germany in 2005
The Czech taxable person submitted evidence of the sale in January 2005
The Czech taxable person was not registered as VATable in Germany and had taxed the sale of the goods in question neither in the Czech Republic nor in Germany.
All these facts pointed to tax evasion within Germany and the Czech tax officer provided this information in his response to the request for information to the German financial administration.
By requesting the local Czech tax officer, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxable person had submitted a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004 due to a tax examination, declaring, among other things, the value of the goods he acquired from a German taxable person and at the same time asserted the right to deduct VAT from other Member States.
In his Czech turnover tax return he did not register sales tax on goods in Germany.
Due to a supplementary turnover tax return submitted after the external audit, the Czech financial officer fixed the turnover tax liability unchanged.
According to the Czech legal regulations, there was no purchase of goods from other Member States in this case because the goods were not shipped or transported by another Member State to the Czech Republic.
Thus, the Czech fiscal officer has drawn a wrong conclusion during the external audit.
The BRH found that immediately after receiving the reply to the request for information, which showed that the goods had not left Germany, corrected the German taxable person's return and claimed the payment of turnover tax valued at € 1.600
In addition, the FA in charge of the actual recipient of the goods sent a notification of inspection to ensure that the resale of these goods is properly taxed.
In the following cases, entrepreneurs declared intra-Community deliveries that may not have been carried out:
18.
The Czech financial officer received a request for information from the German financial administration on whether the Czech taxable person had acquired a car worth € 47.400 from the German taxable person in February 2005
The request for information was accompanied by an imprint of the Czech taxable person's VAT registration certificate.
Another attachment was accompanied by a photocopy of the passport of the person who was supposed to have transferred the vehicle.
In the course of his investigation, the Czech financial officer found that the passport was stolen, that the person mentioned therein had not imported a vehicle into the Czech Republic and claimed that he had no contacts with a German taxable person.
The VAT registration certificate, the print of which had been sent by the German side, had not been issued by the Czech financial administration.
With this information, the Czech finance officer replied to the request for information and at the same time stated that he could not confirm the purchase of the car.
By requesting the local Czech financial officer, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxable person is not based at the address stated in the Commercial Register and that the managing director of the company is unavailable.
Following a tax complaint procedure for the February 2005 tax period, the Czech fiscal officer fixed zero the tax liability of the Czech taxable person.
In the course of another investigation, the Czech financial official found that the vehicle concerned had been sold to another Czech person who had purchased it on the basis of an internet advertisement.
The BRH found that the local German financial officer in charge had rejected the German taxable person's right to exempt this supply from turnover tax on the basis of the Czech reply to the request for information.
19. In the course of an external audit, a German FA was unable to clarify a difference of 3.000 € between the value of the goods purchased and the reported values from other Member States as stated in the turnover tax return.
A Czech taxpayer should have delivered 89.424 € worth of goods to a German taxable person in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005
Since the acquisition declared by the German taxable person did not match the MIAS data, the German financial officer requested the verification of deliveries and their payment within the framework of the intergovernmental exchange of information.
In his reply to the request for information, the Czech financial official stated that the only managing director of the Czech company had been deleted on 8. July 2005 and a new managing director has not yet been registered.
The German recipient of the goods was allegedly a relative of the shareholder of the Czech company.
The Czech taxable person submitted a turnover tax return and a ZM that had been signed after the deletion of the managing director in the commercial register by an unauthorized person, namely that shareholder of the company.
The accountant of the Czech taxable person informed the financial officer that the capital owner had paid the payment received for the goods invoiced in euros into the company's account.
Cash register receipts were not issued.
By requesting the local Czech FA, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer's claim to exempt VAT for deliveries of goods to other Member States worth CZK 1.326.307 in the first quarter of 2004 and CZK 1.416.180 in the first quarter of 2005 acknowledged.
The BRH found that the German financial officer did not correct the German acquirer's turnover tax return because in the meantime a German court had confirmed the insolvency of the German taxable person.
Since the previous external audit did not show any signs of tax fraud, there is no prospect of actually imposing a fixed turnover tax liability.
20. According to the MIAS data, a German taxable person bought goods from the Czech Republic valued at € 4.251.196 in 2005, after which he purchased goods valued at € 43.274 last year.
The German taxable person declares the intra-Community acquisition neither in his turnover tax return in 2004 nor in that for 2005.
Furthermore, he did not explain any initial turnover in value.
Due to these inconsistencies, the German FA submitted a request for information regarding the first quarter of 2005 and the second quarter of 2006.
In the ZM for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-Community deliveries totalling CZK 167.246.083
On 6. September 2006, the request for information was received, in which the German side requested to examine whether the supply reported by the Czech taxable person had actually taken place.
In reply to this request for information, the Czech financial administration stated that the German request could not be met because the Czech company does not have a managing director (or other legal representatives).
The documents left to NKÚ by the responsible tax officer show that, together with the managing director of the Czech taxable person, on 30. March 2006, a protocol on the beginning of the turnover tax audit for the first quarter of 2004 and the period January had been created until December 2005
At the same time, the taxable person was asked by the tax officer to submit all accounting and fiscal documents for that period, but did not do so.
According to the Commercial Register, the term of office of the sole managing director had expired on 16. May 2005 without a new managing director being appointed.
Since April 2006, the Czech taxable person has not issued any turnover tax returns.
During the parallel examination, the NKÚ in cooperation with the BRH investigated several cases of intra-Community deliveries between the Czech Republic and Germany, which were not the subject of prior exchange of information between the two countries.
The two auditors exchanged information on the cases audited via the CLO of both countries.
21. A Czech company (UCR) that is not based in Germany informed the FA (Chemnitz-Süd) that it wanted to do taxable business in Germany.
Based on this information, the company was registered as of June 2005, but did not receive a German VAT number.
The (UCR) accepted an order from a Danish company (UDK) for the production of wind turbines and their delivery to Austria on behalf, at the risk and on behalf of the Danish customer.
Due to insufficient own production capacity, the Danish company passed on part of the contract to a German taxable person (UDE) based in Germany.
The following figure shows the contractual relationships and the transport route of wind turbines:
According to German law, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as described below:
- The Danish company (UDK) sent the wind turbines to Austria on its behalf, at its risk and for its own account.
Due to the assembly, its delivery takes place in Austria, i.e. the delivery of the wind turbines can be controlled in Austria.
- Because the forwarder was commissioned by the Danish company (UDK) and the latter had the transport carried out in his own name, at his own risk and for his own account, the place of delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE) is where the transport started, i.e. in Germany.
Although the wind turbines were delivered to another EC Member State (AU) and the recipient is registered as taxable in an EC Member State (CR), no tax exemption could be claimed for the delivery of the German subcontractor (UDE) because the EC-Member State for which the delivery was destined is different from the country of the Czech Unternehmens19.
Accordingly, the delivery is duly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (UCR) claimed the deduction in its VAT returns.
The place of delivery of the Czech company (UCR) also depends on the place where the transport started.
However, some of the wind turbines were transported from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.
- The delivery of wind turbines manufactured in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.
- Delivery of the remaining wind turbines manufactured in Germany took place in Germany.
Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) provided both intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-Community deliveries from Germany to Austria.
The BRH found that the Czech company (UCR) did not explain intra-community deliveries in its German tax returns or in its ZM submitted to the German CLO.
Thus, the Czech company may have treated all its intra-Community deliveries uniformly as intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic.
The NKÚ found that (UCR) did not report intra-Community deliveries to Austria, but intra-Community deliveries to Denmark.
In order to ensure the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in Austria, cooperation between at least four financial administrations (Austrian, Czech, Danish and German) would be necessary, although there are no signs of tax fraud or evasion in this case.
In addition, the NKÚ and the BRH examined case design to show the size of the differences between the data in the turnover tax returns and the MIAS data caused by the different laws of 2004
The cases examined also show that it takes some time for the taxpayers and the FÄ to apply the new statutory regulations:
22. In his ZM for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2004, a Czech taxable person reported deliveries of goods totalling CZK 792.977.452 to a German taxable person.
During the same period, another Czech taxable person reported intra-Community deliveries to another German taxable person totalling CZK 18.157.265 in his ZM.
Based on the information provided by BRH to NKÚ it was found that both cases were electricity.
Both Czech taxpayers took into account the above-mentioned deliveries in accordance with Czech Law No. 2004 in force in 2004 235/2004 in her ZM.
During a further examination of these transactions, an audit group of the NKÚ found that in 2004 different statutory regulations on delivery or delivery. the acquisition of electrical energy between the Czech Republic and Germany.
While in the Czech Republic taxpayers deliveries of electrical energy according to the provisions of Law No. 2004 in force in 2004 According to the German statutory provisions in force in 2004, it was not an intra-Community acquisition of goods, but taxable and taxable transactions in Germany.
The differences in legal regulations were found in the Czech Republic by passing Law No. Removed in 635/2004, which changed some tax regulations with effect from 1. January 2005
23. During the examination of intra-Community deliveries or Acquisition in cooperation with the BRH further found that a Czech taxable person in his ZM for the first and fourth quarters of 2005 intra-Community deliveries to a German taxable person totalling CZK 240.411.163 and another Czech taxable person in his ZM for the same Period of intra-Community deliveries to another German taxable person worth CZK 263.470.776
Information submitted by the BRH to the NKÚ showed that both cases had involved deliveries of electrical energy.
In accordance with the wording of Law No 1., which will apply from 1. January 2005 In 235/2004, when electrical energy is supplied, the place of performance is the place where the acquirer has his legal headquarters, headquarters or premises for which such delivery takes place.
Therefore, the Czech taxpayers should not have reported the supply of electricity in their ZM for 2005
The fact that both taxable persons treated the supply of electrical energy in their ZM as intra-Community supplies led to an amount difference of CZK 503.881.939 in MIAS.
Final remarks
The cooperation achieved the goals of the BRH and NKÚ
Both auditors gained deep knowledge about the VAT administration systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The cooperation revealed differences between the two systems and the laws governing the sales tax administration.
During the parallel examinations, interesting cases of intra-Community deliveries or supplies came. Acquiring to day.
Some of these are worth another observation.
On the basis of the audit results, both auditors made recommendations for the management of the sales tax.
Follow-up to these recommendations in the form of a check should be part of the further observation.
The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of both auditors is the basis for the successful conduct of future audits in the field of sales tax administration.

Public procurement of works and prevention of corruption
Joint report of the Supreme Court of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on their parallel audits
Introduction and Overview
The award of services by contracting authorities is of great importance for both the state and the economy.
It is the task of the state to use public funds as economical and economical as possible as well as to ensure fair and regulated competition.
In the European Union (EU), the award of services by contracting authorities is an important part of the creation of a single economic area.
In order to ensure broadly unlimited competition, contracting authorities must comply with EU requirements when allocating their contracts at certain value limits (thresholds).
To this end, EU member states must transfer and apply EU procurement law to national law.
This has already happened in both the Czech Republic and Germany.
Below the EU thresholds, individual countries are left to regulate the award of public contracts themselves.
The award of benefits is also a vulnerable to corruption.
Due to the fundamentally high potential for damage, contracting authorities must therefore implement appropriate measures to prevent and prevent corruption and unauthorised benefits when awarding their contracts.
In January 2011, the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed to carry out parallel audits on both the EU-wide award of works and the prevention of corruption.
The examinations focused on the application of EU procurement law, which was transposed into national regulations, as well as on preventing corruption in the award of construction and road construction works. of transport infrastructure.
The allocations below the EU thresholds were also included in the considerations for prevention of corruption.
The audit results of both audit bodies are summarized in this Joint Report.
The report should also be addressed to international bodies, such as the International Organization of Supreme Audit Authorities (INTOSAI).
Examination areas and audited bodies The evaluations of the Federal Court of Auditors on the topics listed are mainly based on cross-sectional checks, which he carried out in 2011/2012 with the construction administrations responsible for the road and construction of the federal government in Germany.
He examined, for example, the construction of motorways and large construction projects.
In addition, the Federal Court of Auditors used results from previous investigations.
The Czech Republic's Supreme Control Office based its evaluations on the findings of audit from 2008 to 2011 The tests included construction work in road construction, rail transport, hydraulic engineering, building construction (hospitals, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc.).) as well as other construction areas in the Czech Republic.
The award of the federal public procurement in Germany predominantly carries out the construction administrations of the federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the state construction administration is central to the allocation of transport infrastructure.
In building construction, the allocations are carried out decentralally by those who use government budgets.
In both countries, freelance workers are also engaged in sub-areas of the procurement procedures.
When comparing the evaluations, differences in procurement law and market structure for both countries should be taken into account.
Establishment of procurement law in both countries
In Germany, the implementation of EU-wide procurement procedures is defined in laws and regulations.
Procurement procedures limited to the national sector are regulated by budget law and the administrative rules resulting therefrom.
For both EU and national contracts, many complementary individual rules are also laid down by internal administrative rules.
such as the so-called ′′ forgiveness manuals ′′ of the federal government, in which the statutory requirements complement or supplement the lawfulness of the law in compliance with public procurement law. to be formulated in more detail.
In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure applies exclusively to the procurement law and other legal regulations, which apply both above and below the EU thresholds.
Public procurement law was substantially revised in 2012
The new regulation increased transparency in the handling of public funds, enabled greater competition and limited the possibility of corruption in the procurement process.
Broad guidelines of procurement law in both countries
In both countries, the open procedure, restricted procedure and negotiated procedure are to be used in EU-wide contracts.
In Germany, measures below the EU threshold apply the national types of procurement (public procurement, restricted tendering, free-handed award), which largely correspond to the above mentioned EU-wide tendering methods.
Public procurement law in Germany is characterized by the principle of the open procedure (for EU-wide contracts) and the public procurement procedure (for national contracts).
Any interested company can submit an offer in the open procedure and in the public tendering procedure.
Another essential feature of German procurement law is the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises.
This is mainly the purpose of dividing an overall construction measure into specialist and partial lots.
The individual award of these lots is intended to enable as many companies as possible to participate in the competition.
Both of the aforementioned characteristics of German procurement law are proven instruments for achieving economic results.
In Germany, over 330.000 construction companies with 1,9 million. Employees working.
In the Czech Republic, EU-wide procurement procedures are also to be applied to construction projects below the EU threshold.
One exception here is the simplified procedure, in which a less stringent procedure can be used below the thresholds and under certain conditions.
The Czech procurement law, in line with EU law, contains provisions to conclude contracts if competition is guaranteed and a beneficial price is achieved.
The current legal regulations in the Czech Republic allow the awarding bodies to choose between the open and the restricted procedure.
There are over 85.000 construction companies in the Czech Republic, of which about 1.900 companies employing 20 or more employees.
Construction volume of contracting authorities and shares of the types of contracts in both countries
In Germany, the total construction volume in 2011 was 307 billion. Euros.
Of this, 45,5 billion was lost. Euro on public works (15 %), which, in addition to the federal building, includes the construction work of the federal states and municipalities.
The construction volume of the federal government in construction and highway construction (excluding rail infrastructure and hydraulic engineering) was 8,5 billion. Euros.
The volume of contracts for works in construction and highway construction of the federal government was distributed among the types of contracts in 2011 as follows: 80,7 % open procedures and public tenders, 12,7 % restricted procedures and restricted tenders and 6,6 % Negotiation procedures and free-hands allocation.
Of these, 33,2 % were European-wide forgiveness.
The volume of public works in the Czech Republic was 4,7 billion in 2011 Euro, which corresponded to about 25 % of the total volume of all construction projects in the Czech Republic.
In 2009, the volume was 7,8 billion. Euro, which corresponded to 37 % of the total building volume.
Breakdown by type of award for 2011: 65,1 % open procedures 14,3 % non-public procedures 9,5 % negotiated procedures 8,4 % simplified procedures for contract volume below threshold 2.7 % other procedures
The data refers to all public contracts for deliveries, services and works awarded by public procurement bodies in 2011
The above data shows that the parallel examinations of both countries are aimed at a significant part of public procurement, which is of great financial importance for all contracts and is an outstanding priority in the award of contracts. own it
Summary of results of parallel exams
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Court of Auditors of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have carried out parallel audits in their countries for the award of works throughout the EU and for prevention of corruption.
In this context, the working groups of both auditors compared the corresponding legal basis and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and Germany as well as the results of their parallel audits, which they carried out, especially in the areas of construction and road construction.
In doing so, they found essentially:
The EU directives for the award of works by contracting authorities have been transposed into national law in both the Czech Republic and Germany (Nos.). 1 and 3.1).
In addition to EU regulations, prevention of corruption also serves the procurement rules of both countries, which are partly different in their priorities and detailed measures (No. 3.2).
In both countries, an essential requirement for the tender documents is that they must contain all the information necessary for proper tender preparation.
The performance descriptions must be neutral and must not contain restrictions on competition.
In Germany, the procurement documents have largely met these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, it is still a problem to adequately determine the subject of the contract.
In Germany, construction works should be divided into lots as far as possible in order to promote competition.
According to the findings of the BRH, this requirement was largely implemented in Germany.
During its tests, the NKÚ found, in particular in the field of road construction, that the award of extensive services without lots or with very large lots could affect competition and result in a restriction to only a few large companies.
Restrictions to market potential can result in significant cost increases and pose a risk of price or other agreements.
According to the rules of both countries, under certain conditions, the awarding bodies may, in principle, agree additional or modified services with the companies already entrusted with them, which proves necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (No. 4.1).
The respective guidelines for determining the method of award were largely followed in both countries.
According to the rules of the Czech Republic, the awarding bodies are free to choose between open and restricted procedures.
In Germany, on the other hand, the priority of the open procedure for EU-wide procurement or budget-enshrined in law and budget law applies. the public tendering procedure, which corresponds to the open procedure for national contracts.
This allows more companies to offer.
This reduces the risk of corruption, makes price agreements between tenderers difficult and leads to the most economic results.
For construction projects whose estimated total contract values reached or exceeded the EU threshold, the audited construction administrations awarded construction works in principle throughout Europe.
The correct estimate of the estimated contract value is an essential basis for choosing the right method of award.
In Germany, cost databases are used for the calculation of public buildings, especially in building construction,
which are based on the evaluations of completed construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, a database is used in road construction, but it is not yet an effective tool (No. 4.2).
Preliminary information and notices should be published for works to be awarded throughout Europe. This is intended to strengthen competition by allowing interested companies to adapt to the planned contracts at an early stage.
The approved construction administrations usually adhered to this requirement.
In individual cases, incorrect information, incorrect applications or lack of controls may result in competition (No 4.3).
The selection of applicants to participate in non-public procurement procedures is particularly vulnerable to manipulation.
According to EU law, the number of invited applicants must be sufficient to ensure real competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not discriminate and must be announced in advance.
In addition to the EU's guidelines, the contracting bodies in both countries should switch among the companies to be asked as often as possible when selecting candidates.
In order to counter the risk of manipulation, there are sometimes very detailed specifications in Germany.
In some cases, the audited administrations disregarded these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, the decision to select candidates was not always comprehensible (No. 4.4).
In both countries, during the supply phase, it is necessary to ensure that the companies interested in making tenders receive the same information.
In order to avoid anti-competitive agreements, contact between these companies and with freelance workers involved in the preparation of the service description should be prevented as far as possible.
The corresponding regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.
The audited construction administrations in Germany partly did not comply with these requirements (No. 4.5).
When opening up offers, in particular, the multi-eye principle and the principle of transparency must be respected in both countries.
The requirements for the labelling, documentation, storage and confidentiality of offers are intended to limit manipulation margins and are particularly detailed in Germany.
The exams in both countries resulted in few complaints (No. 4.6).
The examination and evaluation of the offers are determined in both countries by guidelines for the organisation of the organisation of the organisation of the organisation.
The regulations in Germany are more comprehensive, but have not been observed continuously by the approved contracting bodies.
For example, contracting entities handed over offers for examination to third parties without first looking through the offers and sufficiently documenting conspicuities.
The offers were therefore insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulations (No. 4.7).
At the end of the EU-wide procurement procedures, the companies participating in the competition will be informed about the intended contract before the award is awarded.
This legal protection option also has a preventive function against corruptive behavior.
The Czech Republic also provides for a judicial review option for non-EU-wide procurement procedures.
Only in a few cases did the contracting entities not meet the prescribed deadlines during the placing of orders or deviated from the tenderers content (No. 4.8).
The documentation of the procurement procedures was not always complete or comprehensible with the approved construction administrations in both countries.
The EU-wide transparency bid was not sufficiently implemented in the listing of certain procedures.
Some of the shortcomings also reduced the corruption-preventive function of the documentation.
The contracting authorities of both countries largely fulfilled their reporting and reporting obligations (No. 4.9).
Fundamentals of EU procurement law and prevention of corruption
EU procurement law
In order to ensure unlimited competition within the European Union with freedom to provide services and goods, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, among other things, the Procurement Coordination and the Appeal Directives to be transposed by the Member States into national law.
The general award principles of the European Union are in particular that of competition, the bid for equal treatment or the competition. the prohibition of discrimination and the transparency requirement.
In order to achieve these goals, the Procurement Coordination Directive contains special rules for works to be awarded throughout the EU for construction projects.
To this end, their estimated order amounts must reach or exceed 5.000.000 euros at the moment.
The rules concern in particular the content of the award documents, the publication of certain information before, during and after the award, the observance of deadlines, including the receipt of tenders, the documentation of the award procedure, the requirements that can be placed on the qualification of candidates. and the appeal directive is the basis for the legal protection of applicants and tenderers.
In the event of possible breaches of procurement law, affected companies may have the decisions of contracting authorities reviewed in verification proceedings.
Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the directives of the European Union into national law.
Corruption prevention
Importance of prevention of corruption
There is no legal definition of the term of corruption in both countries.
In general, corruption means abuse of a trust position for private benefit,
which is usually prompted by the beneficiaries of these decisions.
Corruption can hinder competition and cause significant economic damage.
It is estimated that corruption-related costs are 5 % of global economic performance.
The size of these costs is estimated at 1 % for the European Union.
For contracting authorities, restrictive agreements or unfair practices can question the trust in the integrity and functionality of the administration.
Preventing corruption is therefore one of the basic tasks of public contracting authorities.
They have to check the organisation of their administrations for areas that are particularly vulnerable to corruption in order to ensure that they are safeguards against corruption.
Preventive measures and effective controls can significantly limit the vulnerability of decision-making to corruptive abuse.
The award of public works is generally regarded as a particularly vulnerable area of work.
Corruption prevention measures
In Germany, corruption - especially bribery and corruption as well as acceptance and approval of benefits Vorteilsannahme is prosecuted in criminal and labour law.
In order to prevent corruption, the federal government has issued a directive and recommendations on corruption12 prevention in the federal administration. In addition to risk analysis, the following principles must be followed in particular: priority of public tenders and open procedures, multi-eye principle and transparency, principle separation of planning, awarding and invoicing, precise and complete documentation of procurement procedures.
In addition, further anti-corruption requirements have been incorporated into the procurement regulations.
In 2011, the Federal Ministry responsible for the award of the federal highway introduced an electronically supported control system,
with the award data Vergabedaten such as the estimated costs and the order amounts Auftragssummen as well as information on the freelance workers involved are collected nationwide and evaluated on the basis of conspicuousness.
In the Czech Republic, corruption is also prosecuted in criminal and labour law.
The statutory imperatives of transparency and equal treatment of tenderers and the prohibition of any discrimination are the most important bases of preventing corruption.
For public procurement, the Czech government has set anti-corruption measures in a strategy paper to combat corruption for the years 2011 to 2012 and updated it for the years 2013 to 2014
Some of the measures recommended therein have already been implemented in national procurement law and corresponding administrative regulations14.
The new legislation essentially contains the following rules: lowering the thresholds for smaller contracts, mandatory to prior notice by the awarding authority, including mentioning the reasons for tendering, prohibiting the restriction of the number of tenderers in restricted procedures and thus abolishing the possibility of selecting tenderers by Lot procedure, introduction of the obligation to publish the contract documents and all annexes, introduction of the obligation to publish the actual price and the list of subcontractors.
Test results for each phase of the award procedure
Procurement documents
Procurement documents The procurement documents must contain all the information the tenderers need for proper tender preparation.
In particular, the procurement documents must enable a proper calculation.
The tenderers must not be given risks that are not calculable for them.
The award documents consist in particular of the description of the service and the contract terms.
In addition, they contain the requirements to prove the qualification (suitability) of the tenderers and the criteria that are decisive for selecting the most economical offer.
Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption
The requirements of EU law regarding the award documents are specifically addressed to the technical specifications.
These must be equally accessible to all tenderers and should limit competition as little as possible.
The service description must be product neutral.
Therefore, information about products or manufacturers is only permitted under strict conditions as part of the service description.
Avoidance of restrictive rules in the procurement documents is also an elementary principle of prevention of corruption.
In addition, unclear or incorrect information should be avoided in the award documents as they open up room for speculation when drawing up the offers and for manipulation when evaluating them.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar regulations In both countries, EU legal requirements regarding technical specifications have been transposed into national law.
The services are generally product-neutral without writing out factory specifications.
In the service descriptions, the individual benefits usually have to be detailed in terms of performance units with respective quantity.
The prices are to be agreed on the basis of performance units (e.g. Euro per sq m or per piece).
Only in exceptional cases can services be defined by functional targets.
The performance descriptions must be complete and clear in any case.
They shall contain precise quantities and shall not include services that are not determined whether they are needed.
Remuneration according to packages or time expenditures should be avoided as far as possible.
These rules are intended to prevent speculation and manipulation based on undetermined specifications in the award documents.
The service descriptions must enable tenderers to be able to produce their offers safely and without extensive preparatory work.
The tendering procedure will not be published until the award documents have been completed.
Different regulations
There is no obligation to tendering for works in lots in the Czech Republic.
If it is possible by the type of service to be commissioned, the public contracting authorities can divide works into several lots.
In Germany, construction works must be divided into lots, separated by quantity (partial) and / or by type or subject area (skilled).
This is intended to enable small and medium-sized enterprises to participate in competition, to expand the number of possible suppliers and to make price agreements more difficult.
This type of award is considered to be the most economical in general.
Valuation criteria must be specified in the award documents in the Czech Republic both for EU and national procedures.
This is intended to be fully and finally recognizable for the applicants on which criteria their offers should be evaluated.
In Germany, indication of evaluation criteria in EU-wide notices, but at the latest in the procurement documents, is only mandatory in EU-wide procurement procedures.
For national procurement procedures, the evaluation criteria must be recorded only in an administrative note.
Procurement documents drawn up by freelancers must not contain any references to these offices or planners or experts involved in Germany to the construction and some road construction administrations.
This is intended to prevent individual companies from acquiring additional information or other unacceptable competitive advantages without the knowledge of the client about contact with these freelance workers.
This is also the reason why freelance procurement documents must neither send nor interpret planning documents for inspection.
The contact person of the companies is solely the client.
There is currently no regulation on this in the Czech Republic.
Additional or modified services, which prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (addendum), almost always apply to large construction projects.
In both countries, the statutory provisions allow to a certain extent the award of additions to the company already entrusted with the already mandated, without a public procurement procedure.
According to EU regulations and German regulations, the remuneration of supplementary benefits must not exceed half of the main contract.
In addition, the additional services must not be separated from the main contract without significant disadvantages or must be absolutely necessary.
In the Czech Republic, a corresponding award without public notice is subject to a narrower limit of 20 %.
However, this increases if necessary. the risk of delayed completion of the construction project or the need to involve an additional contractor in the construction work already underway.
If supplementary services are also transferred to the already commissioned company, according to the regulations in Germany, an arbitrary price increase for these services is generally not possible by the contractor.
In determining the remuneration for the additional services, the agreed prices and the basics of determining the price of the already issued order should be based on the agreed prices.
In addition to supplementary services, there may also be a reduction in the scope of services.
In the Czech Republic, small amounts cannot be offset against additional supplementary benefits.
Essential exam results
BHR
Technical specifications and product-neutral tendering
In individual cases, the service descriptions contained references to national technical approvals or standards, which had already been replaced by Europe-wide standards.
Some performance descriptions also contained product-related specifications - for example for graffiti protection, joint tapes or noise protection panels - without this being necessary.
In some cases, performance requirements were described so accurately that only one product was eligible.
Service directories broken down by partial service
In none of the procedures examined, the BRH has found breaches of the bid to advertise services in principle in a list of services broken down by partial services.
completeness of the service descriptions
In the vast majority of procedures, the procurement documents were completed before the tenders began.
In some cases, the tendering documents had to be corrected during the tendering phase because some positions or deadlines had changed.
In some cases, the directories contained positions that did not determine whether they were needed.
A performance index for demolition work consisted of almost half of such needs.
Lots and criteria for rating
Many contracts lacked the prescribed justification why the predominantly tendered services were not further divided into partial pieces.
There were no complaints when indicating the criteria to be used when evaluating the tenders.
Reference to freelance workers
A small part of the service descriptions contained references to the freelance workers involved.
Their names were partly on the covers or in attached plans or opinions.
In one case, the contracting authority even specifically asked applicants to contact the architect ′′ on questions of the tendering procedure
Especially in the field of construction, the contracting authorities mainly attributed the complaints shown to the failure of freelancers responsible for drawing up the service descriptions.
Construction services pointed out the lack of capacity in order to be able to adequately control the performance descriptions.
NKÚ
Technical specifications and product neutral tendering The public procurement contract for the construction of a residential building with 12 units of housing were specified in the service description a supplier and a certain product brand.
The awarding authority did not allow comparable products to be used without giving reasons.
When several university buildings were built, suppliers and products were also prescribed in the call for tenders.
Performance descriptions with power units
For construction projects in some industrial areas, the contracting authority did not clearly identify the scope and nature of the required services in the service descriptions.
As power units, it only stated the converted space of the individual buildings in cubic meters.
completeness of the service descriptions
In the construction of a motorway bypass, the service descriptions under a restricted procedure were revised four times between August and September 2009,
because the scope of services significantly increased and technical requirements changed.
Tendering documents for social buildings contained inaccurate location information, insufficient structural technical examinations and incomplete design drawings, which had to be commissioned additional services.
When building a large library building, the service description of the interior decoration contained no product quality requirements.
As a result of these lack of specifications, some subcontractors installed overpriced and inappropriately high-quality equipment.
Lots and suitability criteria
In the Czech Republic, the division of construction measures into partial bulk or partial bulk. the award of subcontracts is not mandatory.
An examination of the three major sections of the construction of a motorway ring revealed that savings up to 31,6 million if selected parts were to be allocated. Euro with a total cost of 620,3 million Euros would have been possible.
For six different buildings which were the subject of a single contract alone, with a loose award, would have 2,5 million. Euro (25 %) can be saved.
If the construction of 20 bridges was lost, savings of 11,5 million would be compared to a total allocation. Euro (25 %) was possible.
When it comes to the award of works in road construction, the central contracting authority set very extensive reference requirements as a suitability criterion.
During the construction of part of a motorway, the contracting authority required the tenderers to prove at least three road construction projects worth 28 million each. Euros from the last five years.
In the Czech Republic, a maximum of nine providers met these requirements.
The public allocation of another section of a motorway included six separate construction projects, whereby the contracting authority as a suitability criterion for companies has an annual construction volume of at least 480 million. Euros had pretended in the last three years.
Two thirds of the funding for road construction projects in 2008 and 2009 (i.e. 2,5 billion). Euros total of 3,7 billion Euros) were commissioned by a total of five companies that carried out the orders alone or as a working group.
For 46 procurement procedures with a contract size of 528 million. Euros gave only two or two. even only one bidder makes an offer.
The NKÚ showed that narrowing the market potential could result in significant cost increases.
Additional services
When building a motorway bypass, the contracting authority did not use any of the procedures required by law when allocating additional services in two cases and did not conclude any written contracts for the additional services.
Due to unclear quantity and quality requirements, addendum was created in the first case of up to 63,7 million. Euro (net) and in the second case up to 165,4 million. Euro (net), resulting in the respective order volume by 21 % or 21 % respectively. 91 % increased.
THIS segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
For several university buildings, some services were not listed in the award documents, although their necessity was already known when the contract was awarded.
Although the extent of these additional services exceeded the 20 % of the original contract value set out in national procurement law, the contracting authority carried out negotiated procedures without notice with the contracting entities.
When building a large courthouse, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional works in negotiated procedures without tendering.
During the construction period, the contracting authority expanded the scope of the work by 2 million. Euros.
The standard prices for the additional works awarded without competition were considerably higher than comparable services provided by the same company.
Further findings
Due to a sample inspection of construction projects, the NKÚ found that the average cost of building a four-lane motorway kilometre in the Czech Republic up to 14,6 million. Euros are.
In Germany, according to an evaluation of long-term data from the Federal Ministry of Construction, the average cost of a four-lane motorway kilometre is up to 10,4 million. Euros.
This comparison suggests that motorway construction is more expensive in the Czech Republic than in Germany.
Summary findings
The basic rules on the procurement documents are broadly consistent in both countries and take into account EU requirements.
They serve both comprehensive and fair competition and prevention of corruption.
For example, the requirement for sufficient certainty of the service descriptions should enable tenderers to properly calculate and prepare their offers,
Protect the client from additional services to be agreed retrospectively and also contain speculative leeway.
In Germany, the common basic requirements for the award documents are supplemented by regulations aimed at further reducing restrictions on competition and manipulation possibilities.
There are no requirements in the Czech Republic to this extent, but transparency is increased by publishing the evaluation criteria in non-EU-wide procurement procedures.
The requirements for the service description have largely been met in both countries.
In some cases, however, deviations had to be made, which could have led to restrictions on competition.
The German bid to form lots promotes competition and leads to economic results.
In the Czech Republic, according to the findings of the NKÚ the award of extensive benefits without lots or lots can be achieved. With very large lots restrictions on the provider field to only a few large companies.
The extensive reference requirements imposed in the Czech Republic in road construction have led to public contracts being awarded only to a narrow circle of providers and not to enable small and medium-sized enterprises to participate in competition.
Also, a limited number of competitors often lead to higher prices and increases the risk of price or other agreements.
Regulations in both countries differ in terms of the award and remuneration of additional or modified benefits.
According to EU regulations as well as German regulations, supplementary services with a value of up to half the main contract can be awarded without public procurement under certain conditions.
In the Czech Republic, a narrower limit of 20 % applies, up to which additional negotiated services can be awarded without notice to the original contractor.
THIS segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
This line is often crossed,
because the scope of services for public contracts is often insufficiently determined.
If the exceedance exceeds 20 %, the additional services must be advertised with public notice.
By dividing services into lots, restrictions on competition and resulting negative consequences can be avoided.
Establishing the type of award and taking into account the EU threshold
By determining the method of award, the contracting authority determines the extent of the number of companies participating in the competition.
It can largely leave the circle of potential candidates and tenderers, e.g. by choosing an open procedure, unlimited or by limiting the requirement of non-public procurement procedures.
Europe-wide procurement procedures shall apply to construction projects where a threshold set by the EU is reached or exceeded.
Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption
When choosing the method of award, the contracting authority must take into account in particular the European competition and transparency bids.
Is the estimated total contract value of the works of a project included or above the EU threshold of currently 5.000.000 euros, works are generally to be awarded throughout Europe using open or restricted procedures.
In exceptional cases, negotiated procedures or competitive dialogue are also possible.
The contracting authority may deviate to a limited extent from the principle of pan-European procurement for works that reach or exceed the EU threshold and award works in national procurement procedures provided that the estimated contract value of the respective lot is less than 1.000.000 euros and the sum this lot does not exceed 20 % of the estimated total contract value of all works contracts.
A standard construction project must not be divided into individual measures without compelling reason or deliberately estimated with too low cost values in order to avoid the obligation to award works in principle throughout Europe.
As restrictions on competition significantly increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of the type of award is of great importance in preventing corruption.
The detailed justification of the chosen method of award and the examination of the application of the EU procurement rules are important components of the documentation of the award procedure.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have fully implemented EU legal requirements regarding the award procedures and thresholds into national law.
Different regulations
The Czech Republic has also transferred the principle equality of open and restricted procedures contained in the EU Directive to its construction contracts, which are not subject to EU regulations.
There is freedom of choice between the open and the restricted procedure without the decision being documented or justified. Other procedures, on the other hand, are only possible under certain statutory conditions.
In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure or.-in the case of national contracts Vergaben the public tendering procedure in principle priority. This is defined by the budget and procurement law as well as the guidelines on prevention of corruption.
Other types of award - as well as the restricted procedure or procedure. the restricted alert Ausschreibung is only possible in exceptional cases, which are finally regulated by procurement law.
The existence of an exceptional case must be reasonably justified and documented.
The principle of primacy of the open procedure or the public tendering procedure is intended to ensure unlimited competition, to eliminate the possibility of manipulation by determining certain tenderers and to make possible price agreements between tenderers difficult.
The principle of public procurement is a central element of prevention of corruption in Germany.
The correct estimate of the estimated contract value is an essential basis for choosing the right method of award.
Construction services in Germany can rely on planning and cost databases of public administrations and other organisations when determining the expected costs of public buildings.
These databases are based on evaluations of completed construction projects. The databases contain, among other things, cost characteristics for building categories, usage units, components or individual works.
On the basis of such cost characteristics, the estimated contract value of a planned project or a construction work to be awarded can be determined.
The corresponding cost databases for road construction only have a few construction administrations in Germany.
A nationwide introduction for all road construction administrations is planned.
Contracting entities in the Czech Republic cannot rely on central databases or average price estimates of comparable construction measures when determining the expected costs of works.
In most cases, the cost determination is based on estimates made by the financing body or is based on the amount of funds made available to the construction department.
Measures to standardize cost assessment procedures are still in the beginning.
As part of the 2011 anti-corruption plan, the ministries in charge were commissioned to create a database of standardized building materials and materials.
THIS segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In this database, information on material expenditures and construction and expansion works as well as other cost-relevant data will be collected in order to enable cost estimates and regulations of standard prices.
The Czech Ministry of Transport has also issued a data collection for construction projects for better cost control,
which is to serve as a benchmark for price determination in the financing plan and is currently being updated.
Essential exam results BRH
Choice of procurement procedure
The audited contracting bodies wrote the works largely by open procedure or by means of an open procedure. in public tender and thus followed the budget and procurement guidelines.
In 2011, 59,5 % of the federal government's construction work in construction became public or public. advertised in open procedure.
In road construction, this share was 94,8 %.
In the election of non-public procurement methods, some of the reasons why the awarding bodies had been given the principle of open procedure or. had to deviate from the public tender.
In a cross-sectional investigation, the BRH found, on the basis of more than 16.000 procurement procedures, that non-public procurement methods have significant disadvantages compared to open procedures and public tenders and increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.
In building construction, more than twice as many tenders were submitted to public tenders as for restricted tenders and almost three times as many offers as for free-handed contracts.
The investigation also found that the offer prices for restricted tenders and free-handed contracts were on average by 6 % or 6 % respectively. 10 % higher than public tenders.
Parallel investigations by the Federal Ministry of Construction and a national accounting court confirmed the economic differences between public and non-public procurement types.
As a result of its studies on economic efficiency, the Federal Ministry of Construction even reached twice as large differences between public and non-public procurement procedures.
Considering the EU threshold
The audited awarding bodies usually set up procurement plans for the works for which they had estimated a total contract sum of more than 5.000.000 euros, in which they defined the works to be awarded according to EU and national procurement procedures.
According to the procurement plans, this always meant that more than 80 % of the works were to be allocated throughout the EU.
It was unrealistic to avoid the commitment to EU-wide contracts through cost estimates that were too low.
However, partly as a result of incorrect calculations, the minimum proportion of EU-wide procurement procedures was below in fact.
During the construction process, some contracting bodies unacceptably changed the definition of their procurement plans.
They didn't justify these changes and didn't prove that the minimum share of EUwide procurement procedures continued to be respected.
For most of the construction work audited, the share of EU-wide allocations was usually lower than expected according to the award plan.
In some cases, for construction projects above the EU threshold, the awarding bodies violated the requirement to bid all 1.000.000 euros and more comprehensive individual lottery in EU-wide procedures,
and chose national procedures instead.
NKÚ
Choice of award type
In several large construction projects, such as the construction of some motorway sections, construction projects at a large sporting event and housing projects, the contracting entities divided works into several subcontracts, although these services were similar or comparable.
Due to these divisions, the individual benefits were no longer above the threshold and were subsequently awarded in simplified procedures or even in contempt of legal requirements.
Methods of calculation for estimated order value
In road construction, the existing price databases for this area were an insufficient tool to determine the estimated contract values.
The data was based on just completed construction projects, but there were indications of lack of profitability, unnecessary additional performance or excessive profits of the contracted companies.
For three sections of a motorway ring, the actual prices were about 37 % below the estimated order values obtained using the database.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Transport revised the databases to take into account not only the offer prices of recent years, but also comparable market prices and price increase indices in the construction sector.
In building construction, the estimated contract values were based on cost values estimated by project architects or on estimates of investors.
The actual order values deviated greatly from the estimates.
The estimate price for the conversion or Expansion of a large library was twice as high as the later agreed order value, but eight addendums resulting in a cost increase of 2,1 million as part of the construction. Euro or 27 %.
Similarly, the actual order value for the construction of a library depot was 33 % lower than the estimated price, with cost increases in the construction phase here too.
In other cases, the offer prices exceeded the estimates and increased during the construction process.
Construction of a large library estimated at 16 million. Euro or exceeded 22 When building a judicial building, costs increased disproportionately at 139 as the useful area had only expanded by 12
Summary findings
Both countries have transposed the EU rules to determine the type of allocation and to take into account the EU threshold into national law. Therefore, the respective regulations are largely in line.
The preference of the open procedure or procedure in Germany. However, the public tendering procedure goes beyond the EU requirements and the regulations in force in the Czech Republic.
Compared to non-public procurement procedures, more companies have the opportunity to participate in competition in public procurement or public procurement.
Public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of offers and the most economic results.
The risk of corruption is significantly improved by not restricting the applicant field by manipulating-prone regulations by the contracting authority and making price agreements between tenderers more difficult.
The investigations have the advantage of the primacy of the open procedure or confirmed by the public tender in Germany.
According to Czech law, contracting bodies can award contracts by open or restricted procedure.
According to the latest changes to the procurement law, the number of tenderers must no longer be limited in proceedings with prior participation competition.
This means that the restricted procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.
In Germany, the contracting authorities have the requirements regarding the priority of the open procedure or. largely followed by the public procurement. In the Czech Republic, some services were inadmissible in order to avoid the rules on the choice of the type of award.
Taking into account the EU threshold, mistakes had to be found in Germany that resulted in a lower proportion of the minimum EU-wide tendering.
There is no satisfactory solution in the Czech Republic yet to accurately determine the estimated costs of works and construction projects.
The construction administrations should, if necessary. by further checks ensure that the specifications for the choice of the type of award and the EU-wide tendering to be advertised or advertised. the conditions for correct cost determination are created.
Pre-information and announcement
In the case of construction projects with works to be awarded throughout Europe, the public client has to inform interested companies about the planned contracts before the tendering procedure.
Pre-information and announcements form an important basis for European-wide competition.
Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption
The preliminary information should contain the essential public procurement information on the planned construction projects.
They are required for works where the estimated total contract value reaches or exceeds the EU threshold and where the contracting entity wants to shorten the time limits of open or restricted procedures.
In notices, the contracting entity must give details of the planned works contracts to be awarded throughout Europe.
THIS segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Among other things, he has to make known the scope of services, the procedure and execution dates, the special requirements as well as the evaluation criteria and their weighting.
When describing the subject of the contract, the common procurement vocabulary (CPV codes) is to be used throughout Europe.
Preliminary information and notices shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the procurement profile of the contracting entity.
In order to prevent the disadvantage of foreign interested parties, notices must contain additional information at national level and must only be published after sending the notice to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union.
Incomplete or incorrect information in the notice may affect competition and, if necessary, even support manipulations.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar regulations
The EU legal requirements for pre-information and publication have fully transposed into national law.
Different regulations
In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and notices should also be published for works not to be awarded throughout Europe.
Procurement procedures may not earlier than one month after dispatch of the prior information to the EU Official Journal (for EU-wide contracts) or. to the National Official Journal (all contracts).
Only in exceptional cases can the publication of a prior information be waived.
In Germany, no prior information is necessary in the non-EU-wide procurement procedures.
In the national procurement procedures, notices for public tenders and competition for participation before restricted tenders are on the federal internet portal and, if necessary, if necessary, also published in newspapers or magazines.
For restricted tenders without competition, notices of services to be awarded from 25.000 euros are mandatory (ex ante transparency).
The preliminary information shows all planned lots of construction projects.
This is particularly important in Germany because of the small part of the loose construction contracts.
In the Czech Republic, this scheme has only a small effect, as there are significantly fewer construction works divided into lots.
Essential exam results
BRH
Preliminary information
The contracting bodies examined published preliminary information on all audited construction projects with works to be awarded throughout Europe.
In some open procedures, however, they shortened time limits for tenders, although the 52-day period required between dispatch of the prior information and the notices had not yet expired.
Other abbreviated procedures were not advertised until the-month period of validity of the previous information expired and before it was extended.
Much of the published preliminary information lacked evidence of the planned division of works into lots.
Announcements
The notices of the audited bodies contained partly CPV codes that deviated from the information contained in the previous information or which did not correctly cover the required services.
In individual cases, notices were published earlier at national level or contained more information - e.g. on the deadlines - than the notices in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Ex ante transparency
The contracting bodies of an audited construction administration had commissioned a service company to publish the national procurement procedures.
This published the reports on its own paid award platform.
However, the awarding authorities did not verify whether the company had also forwarded the reports to the free internet portal of the federal government as prescribed.
Samples showed that only one third of the reports of the audited administration were published on this portal.
NKÚ
Announcements
When building a wastewater treatment plant, the contracting authority did not indicate in its notice the criteria on which it wanted to select the tenderers.
The awarding authority could not demonstrate how the tenderers were selected.
The restriction of the number of tenderers was permitted under the law in force at the time.
When building a motorway ring, the contracting authority did not indicate in the notice or in the documentation of the award procedure that it wanted to assess the qualification of the applicants and how many applicants it wanted to compete.
The awarding authority found that all six applicants met the qualification requirements, but excluded the applicant with the worst assessments from the further procedure.
The procedure of the awarding authority was not transparent because it had not provided information on the qualification criteria and the evaluation procedure at any point in the procedure.
Publication of notices
During the renovation of former military grounds, the contracting authority did not publish the tendering procedure.
Summary findings
The two-tier information and notice system is an important part of implementing the transparency requirement in Europe-wide contracts, strengthening competition and thus preventing corruption.
Both countries implemented EU guidelines and increased the transparency of their procurement procedures in the national procurement sector as well:
Selection of applicants for non-public procurement
Unlike the public procurement procedures, not every undertaking interested in performing the services to be awarded can participate in competition.
In the case of non-public procurement procedures, the contracting authority has to make a selection in advance which companies should be invited to submit tenders.
Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption The EU regulations allow a limit to the number of applicants in non-public procurement procedures throughout the EU.
However, in the case of restricted procedures, at least five companies should be invited to submit their bid.
At least three companies shall be invited to negotiate procedures with a notice of award.
In any case, the number of invited applicants must be sufficient to ensure real competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be announced in advance.
The selection of companies is a process within the award procedure, which is highly vulnerable to manipulation, e.g. by unilaterally favouring certain companies.
In addition, restricting competition to a few companies also favours possible agreements between applicants.
In both cases, the result of the contract can be significantly impaired at the expense of the contracting authority.
The awarding bodies must therefore take special precautions against possible manipulations, to carry out adequate checks and, in particular, to ensure the transparency and traceability of this process.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar regulations
The rules for selecting candidates are similar in both countries.
In addition to the EU requirements, the contracting entities should switch as often as possible among the companies to be asked when selecting candidates.
Nor must competition be limited to companies located in certain regions.
The awarding bodies shall justify the selection of candidates and document the process of the selection procedure in their award notes.
Different regulations
In Germany, at least three suitable candidates for restricted tenders and, in principle, several suitable candidates must be invited to submit tenders.
According to the new Czech rules, apart from two special areas, it is prohibited to limit the number of tenderers in restricted procedures and negotiated procedures.
In Germany, the multi-eye principle must be observed when selecting companies.
For example, if an employee has proposed a number of companies for a non-public procurement procedure, the management level of the construction department or an agent from the contracting authority usually have to amend this proposal by removing a proposed company and / or supplementing a new company...
This is intended to prevent a single person from finally determining the circle of companies to participate in the competition.
Otherwise, in the case of manipulative intentions, this could enable far-reaching agreements between those involved.
The list of companies to be requested should be treated confidentially, even with regard to freelance workers, and should not be made publicly accessible.
THIS segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In the Czech Republic, there are no appropriate rules for drawing up and keeping lists of applicants.
According to the German regulations, freelance workers are not allowed to determine the companies to be asked, but can only submit proposals to the awarding authority.
There is a regulation gap in this in Czech legislation.
Essential exam results
BRH
Number of applicants
The requirement to call on a minimum number of companies to submit tenders in non-public contracts has been respected except for a few exceptions.
An evaluation of the BRH of almost 7.000 non-Europe-wide procurement procedures for construction works revealed that, on average, the contracting bodies asked for tenders in Germany to submit an offer for restricted tenders in Germany in 6,6 and for free-handed contracts an average of 4,4 companies.
Change of businesses and regional restrictions
Especially in trades with few providers, the awarding agencies did not always change the circle of selected applicants.
Above all, they took into account companies that have already known and proven in their opinion.
As a reason for this, they claimed that, in non-public proceedings, they had to ensure the suitability of the companies to be invited to compete even before the invitation to tender was made.
The BRH did not find an unacceptable restriction to regional tenderers in non-public procurement procedures, but a higher proportion of regional companies than in public tenders.
The awarding authorities mainly attributed this to the fact that the scope of services in non-public procurement procedures is much lower on average and therefore, for example, longer routes are more important than for public procurement.
Multi-eye principle and suggestions freelance actors
Contrary to the rules, the awarding bodies mainly refused to request the proposed list of companies to be modified by an independent person.
They justified this in particular by lack of processing capacity, deadlines or insufficient knowledge about alternative suitable companies.
It was often not documented who proposed the companies invited to submit their offer.
Some samples showed that freelance workers had drawn up the lists of applicants and those proposals had been taken over by the contracting authorities unchanged.
This did not protect themselves from possible manipulations to the extent required.
Confidential treatment of bidding lists
At a contracting authority, the lists of companies to be requested were recorded in a data processing system that could be viewed by all employees of the department.
In case of manipulative intentions, the names of the intended or authorized companies can be passed on unauthorized and can, for example, enable agreements between these companies.
Documentation
The documentation of the award procedures contained only a few reasons for selecting the candidates.
NKÚ
Selection of applicants
When building a motorway ring, the tenderers did not receive any information on the assessment criteria and the valuation procedures.
In the restricted procedures for expanding and modernising waterways and ports, the notices did not contain any information on how to choose the candidates.
In one procedure, all eight participating candidates met the qualification requirements, exceeding the specified maximum number of companies to be approved.
The award committee subsequently conducted a lottery procedure for selecting the companies.
However, this method, which was generally acceptable at the time, should have been mentioned as one of the criteria in the notice.
Summary findings
Due to the high risk of manipulation in the selection of candidates in non-public procurement procedures, both countries have taken special precautions to prevent unauthorised restrictions of competition.
With the multi-eye principle, the secretion of the bidder lists and the sole power of the awarding bodies to suggest the companies to be asked, the German regulations restrict such abuses.
In the case of the Czech regulations, the newly introduced requirement of the largely unlimited number of tenderers can counteract possible manipulative restrictions in non-public procedures.
However, the examination findings have shown that some of these requirements have not been adequately implemented and that the potential for manipulation for an abusive restriction of the field of participants has not been sufficiently reduced in these cases.
Contracting authorities should completely eliminate the deficits shown.
Offer phase
With the announcement of the award or The tendering phase begins with the invitation to tender in which companies can draw up tenders based on the tender documents sent to them.
Candidates may submit their tenders until the deadline for tenders set by the contracting authority.
Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption
There are no separate EU legal requirements for this phase of the procurement procedure.
The awarding bodies must observe the national rules aimed at counteracting the existing manipulation possibilities during the supply phase.
These are mainly organizational guidelines and controls.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar regulations
The procurement documents on the basis of which the companies are to draw up their offers must, in principle, only be sent by the awarding authority.
Freelancers involved in the award procedure must not perform this task.
The contracting authority shall ensure that all applicants receive the same information during the offer period.
In case of ambiguity regarding the award documents or other questions relating to the tendering procedure, only the awarding authority may provide information to the applicants.
Freelance workers responsible for drawing up the award documents must not provide any information.
During the entire offer phase, contact between the commissioned freelance workers and the applicants should be prevented.
Freelance workers must not become a hub of the procurement procedure through which contacts with anti-competitive consequences can be established.
Tenders sent by mail or directly sent shall be submitted in a closed envelope.
Tenders sent electronically must have technical encryption.
Different regulations
In Germany, the contracting authority can also commission external service companies with the printing and dispatch of the award documents, whose employees are obliged to keep the offers confidential and to ensure the conscientious fulfilment of the contractual obligations.
The tenders received must be marked with an entry stamp in Germany and must be sent directly, immediately and unopened to a servant responsible for the custody.
This staff member may not be involved in the award.
The offers received must be closed until the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, the offers received are marked with a file number.
The contracting authority shall record the offer data including order numbers as well as the creation and receipt details in a protocol.
The storage of tenders is not more detailed in the Czech Republic.
Essential exam results
BRH
The tendering phase examinations focused mainly on the procurement procedures of a building administration.
dispatch of procurement documents
The contracting bodies of the audited building administration sent the procurement documents themselves or had them printed and sent by an external service company.
Freelance workers didn't send any award documents.
Information to applicants
The audited building administration largely did not comply with the requirements for separating planning and allocation when designating the contact persons for inquiries and information.
In the service descriptions, she did not indicate employees from the award office, but from the project management as a contact person.
Some award documents even contained the names of the freelance workers who had created the description of the service.
In case of inquiries during the supply phase, not all applicants received the same information in individual cases.
Marking of tenders
At the certified building management, all offers received were marked with entry stamps and entry note.
However, some free-handed contracts received the offers from freelancers, which contradicted the precepts for preventing corruption.
Keeping Offers
After their marking, not all tenders immediately and immediately arrived at the staff member responsible for storage, who included the offers in a steel cabinet.
In the meantime, the offers were placed in an open compartment of the post office, which every member of staff had access to.
Another department had hung up a mailbox in an uncontrolled corridor, where the offers that were thrown in there remained even overnight.
Since the slot of this mailbox was large and unsecured, not only staff members but also visitors of the department would have had the opportunity to take out offers received and if necessary. to manipulate.
NKÚ
There were no defects on the Czech side.
Summary findings
During the tendering phase, in both countries, contacts between interested companies and freelance workers involved in the award procedure will be prevented.
The principle of equal treatment should also be respected by all tenderers.
The rules on receipt, keeping and secrecy of offers seem appropriate to counteract manipulation and corruption.
The corresponding regulations in Germany are a little more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
The findings of the investigation in Germany have resulted in violations of the regulations in some areas.
These shortcomings could be removed with little effort.
Opening of offers
Opening of offers
During the opening date, the previously closed offers will be opened and their contents will be read and thus made public.
From the opening date, tenderers shall be bound by their tenders until the expiry of the additional deadline set by the awarding authority.
Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption
No separate EU legal regulations are required to open tenders.
However, the national rules on corruption prevention contain extensive guidelines for this highly sensitive period of the award procedure to protect tenders and competition.
The multi-eye principle as well as the transparency and traceability of the offer opening should prevent manipulations and changes to the submitted offers.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar regulations
The opening date must be carried out by several persons to be determined by the awarding authority.
The multi-eye principle is intended to prevent individuals from uncontrollably manipulating the offers when opening up the offers.
Most tenderers can participate in the opening date.
Only tenders submitted to the negotiator when the first bid is opened are admitted to the opening.
In principle, tenders received late may no longer be considered.
In order to ensure the transparency of the opening date, the actions taken and the results of the opening of the offer should be included in a protocol stating, among other things, the names of the tenderers and the offer prices.
The protocol is to be read and signed by the negotiating board.
It can also be signed by the bidders present.
Different regulations
In the Czech Republic, a committee is conducting the opening of tenders.
Freelance workers can also participate in this.
The committee can also be entrusted with further stages of the award procedure, such as the evaluation of tenders.
In Germany, a negotiator and a secretary conduct the opening of the offer.
The negotiator must be an official of the issuing authority.
The negotiator and the secretary should not be involved in the processing of the procurement documents as well as in the award and contract execution.
According to the German regulations, the minutes of the opening date must include information about discounts and discounts as well as special features Besonderheiten such as damaged or delayed offers −
In addition to the offer price, only the language of the offer and the signature authorization are recorded in the Czech Republic.
The German regulations provide that the open offers are to be marked in all parts in such a way as to prevent subsequent changes and additions.

Multi-eye principle
At the opening dates, the audited contracting bodies implemented the guidelines on the multi-eye principle.
They held the opening dates each with negotiators and secretaries, who were not responsible for any other forgiveness.
However, there were occasional cases in which freelance workers opened offers sent to them without the participation of the awarding authority.
Minutes
In the minutes of the opening dates, the opening of the offers was not always fully documented.
In some cases, for example, the tenders submitted late were not registered, and in individual cases even signatures were missing.
Marking of tenders
The awarding bodies examined during the cross-sectional examination marked the tenders by perforating the date of the opening date according to the specifications.
Insufficient markings were found in some beneficiaries of longer past tests.
These awarding bodies changed their labelling practices after the BRH complaint.
NKÚ
Deadline for submission
In the award of road conservation measures, an offer was received only one month after the deadline for submission to the contracting authority. The awarding authority still accepted this offer.
Summary findings
The rules of both countries to open tenders are consistent in significant parts. They take into account both the multi-eye principle and the transparency principle. This can significantly limit the risks of corruption and manipulation when opening up offers.
The regulations in Germany are more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
In particular, the requirements for accurate documentation of the procedure as well as the labelling, safe keeping and secrecy of offers significantly limit manipulation options such as subsequent changes to offers.
In addition, the representatives responsible for opening the tenders must not perform any other tasks related to the performance to be awarded.
The overall only few complaints prove the high acceptance of the opening of the offer.
Testing and evaluating the offers
Examination and evaluation of tenders The contracting authority shall examine and evaluate the tenders available at the opening date.
He shall determine the tendering for awarding the award, which best meets the requirements according to the specified award criteria.
Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption
The EU's guidelines provide for a multi-level procedure:
First of all, the suitability of the tenderers is to be determined.
Bidders must be economically and financially efficient and have the necessary professional and technical expertise.
Companies that are legally convicted of bribery or fraud should be excluded from participation in the award procedure.
The tenders of the non-excluded tenderers must be examined in a constructive, technical and economic manner and must be evaluated on the basis of the award criteria previously announced.
The client has to determine the most economical offer. The customer has to examine offers with unusually low prices.
The examination and evaluation of tenders is a particularly susceptible phase of the award procedure.
For example, tenderers can be excluded unjustified or offers that do not meet the requirements can be left in competition.
By favouring or disadvantaging tenderers, the result of the valuation can be inadmissible and thus preventing the finding of the most economically advantageous offer.
The awarding authority must therefore take special precautions to ensure that the persons responsible for examining and evaluating meet the requirements of integrity and expertise.
It must also ensure transparency and traceability of the procedure and the decisions taken.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar regulations
According to EU requirements, the offers in both countries must be examined and valued in multi-stage procedures.
The requirements for the certificates of suitability to be provided by the companies and the award criteria to be taken into account during the assessment are set out in the notices or in the award documents and cannot be changed during the procedure.
After examining the suitability of tenders, the suitability criteria must no longer be used when evaluating the tenders.
The assessment must be limited to the award criteria.
The tenders submitted must initially be formally examined immediately whether they are complete and whether they contain, for example, inconsistencies that could indicate possible manipulation intentions.
If tenderers are excluded from further examination and evaluation of their tenders, they must be informed immediately.
If the valuation of tenders results in an unduely low price, the tenderer must be given the opportunity to comment before a possible exclusion of his offer.
The decisions taken when examining and evaluating the offers must be documented comprehensibly.
Different regulations
In Germany, the offers to be kept secret can only be made accessible to persons directly responsible for processing.
The examination of the tenders and the accounting examination of the tenders may only be carried out by the awarding authority.
It shall only hire staff who are not concerned with the decision to award or the implementation of the measure.
The performance of the further exam and evaluation tasks is not clarified.
If freelance workers are tasked with examining and evaluating, they must keep the offers confidential.
They are only allowed to make suggestions for the decisions to be made by the awarding bodies.
In the Czech Republic, award committees should be set up to examine and evaluate the tenders.
The committees prepare evaluation reports with procurement proposals.
As in Germany, only the contracting authorities have to decide on the award of contracts.
Where evidence or declarations required for tender are only incompletely submitted in Germany, the contracting authority has the opportunity to give tenderers the missing documents within six days.
Only when the documents are still not available after the deadline is expired, the offer is to be excluded from the valuation.
In the Czech Republic, it is at the discretion of the awarding authority whether it gives the tenderers the opportunity to complete missing evidence or explanations.
If a tenderer fails to do so, he must be excluded.
In addition to the total price, the standard prices (prices of partial services) of the offers should also be examined in Germany.
If, due to the price structure of the offer, there is evidence of too low or too high prices for partial services, the tenderer should be asked to clear these ambiguities.
If he does not succeed in this and if the contracting authority can prove that the prices are mixed, this offer should be excluded.
This is intended to prevent tenderers from speculating on significant volume changes in partial services when calculating their offer, which can result in significant cost increases in construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, the total price is valued, but not the appropriateness of the prices for partial services.
A mixing calculation cannot justify the exclusion of an offer.
A supplement must not be awarded in Germany on offers with unreasonably high or low prices.
If one or more offers below the correct price determination of the customer or The tenderers must demonstrate the correct calculation of their tenders by 10 % or more.
If this is not possible, the awarding authority may exclude the tenders in question.
In the Czech Republic, the call for tenders may be cancelled after the verification of profitability if only offers with unreasonable at low prices are available.
Unlike German procurement law, the surcharge for offers with prices significantly higher than the calculation of the customer cannot therefore be denied.
If there is a suspicion of restrictive behaviour in Germany, the awarding authority must immediately report to its supervisory authority.
The decision must be taken on what measures should be taken and whether the antitrust authority or the antitrust authority. the prosecutor should be taught.
For example, the leading level of supervision must also agree with works above 50.000 euros, if free-handed, if a supplement is not to be awarded to the offer with the lowest price or if the tendering procedure is to be cancelled.
There are no corresponding regulations in the Czech Republic.

Suitability and valuation criteria
The vast majority of the award procedures examined corresponded to the specified requirements.
For some companies suggested by freelance workers, the awarding authorities did not verify the suitability of the companies themselves.
A beneficiary commissioned companies without the required qualification certificates being fully available.
In some proceedings it was not clear whether the awarding authority took into account all the award criteria announced in its selection decision or whether it had merely based its award decision on the basis of the criterion ′′ price
Selection of persons involved and secrecy of offers
Some contracting bodies used non-approved persons to do so when examining tenders.
For example, freelance workers or employees of the department involved in planning or implementing a construction project carried out tasks that were only to be performed by employees of the contracting authority.
The construction sites justified this with insufficient personnel capacity in the respective areas.
In some cases, employees who were not obliged to keep the offers confidential and conscientious fulfilment of contractual obligations also participated in the freelance workers responsible for examining the offers.
For the construction services, it was usually not comprehensible whether the offers for the freelance workers were only accessible to the persons directly responsible for processing.
Review and calculating the offers
Some contracting entities handed over the open offers to freelance workers for further examination without first conducting the prescribed review of the offers and the accounting examination itself and documenting their results.
In the case of manipulative intentions, third parties could have made changes to the offers without this being comprehensible for the awarding bodies.
In the documents examined, uncertainty or lack of price or product information were partly not marked or insufficiently marked.
Audits of profitability
In the case of a sample in a construction administration, the most favorable tenders for three quarters of the audited procurement procedures deviated more than 10 % from the estimated costs previously determined.
Every th award procedure has been cancelled due to inappropriate offer prices.
Not all offer tests and information discussions with the tenderers were comprehensible or sufficiently documented.
In many cases, there were no further information, such as the standard prices of the most important items.
The deviations were often justified in a flat-rate manner, e.g. by indications of changed market prices or increased material costs.
The construction sites explained that the recognition and proof of mixed calculations is difficult.
In an invitation to tender by an institution of public law, the offer price of the most favorable offer was 66 % below the estimated value of these services previously determined.
Further calculation checks or investigations into the causes of this deviation were not documented.
In a briefing, the contracting authority found no indication of price dumping of the then commissioned company.
This left unclear whether the estimated estimated value was excessive or the offer price was too low.
Later, the client assessed the commissioned company as a ′′ cheap company ", which could neither maintain quality nor deadlines.
In another call for tenders, a construction site awarded the contract for an offer whose price was 35 % higher than the value of the calculation of costs.
It did not cancel the invitation to tender and gave the non-existent reasoning that this company could be concluded with a conventional calculation.
Suspicion of irregularities
There were two cases of irregularities in an audited construction management, both of which were reported to the supervisory authority.
In one of the cases, the calculation of two tenderers was identical in an invitation to tender, so that the contracting authority excluded both tenders from the procedure.
When applying the other rules, the tests did not reveal any substantial complaints.
NKÚ
Aptitude test
For many of the construction projects examined, e.g. in higher education, road construction and the extension of the rail network, the awarding bodies did not exclude tenderers from the procedure, although they did not meet the requirements stated in the tender documents or could not prove their suitability to the required extent. On the other hand, in one case, a contracting authority could neither prove nor explain why it had excluded a tenderer who had fulfilled the requirements.
Rating
When awarding works for a water treatment plant, the contracting authority did not take into account the prescribed criteria when examining and evaluating the offers.
In a construction project to expand the rail network, the contracting authority determined the weighting of the evaluation criteria only at the beginning of the evaluation.
In road conservation measures, the prescribed criterion ′′ shortening the construction phase ′′ was misjudged during one procedure.
This resulted in insufficient consideration being given to the shortening offered by the tenderers in second and third positions.
Documentation of the selection of offers
In three procurement procedures in the context of housing promotion, the awarding authority did not document which criteria it applied and on what basis it had chosen the successful bidder.
When building a motorway, the contracting authority chose the companies for smaller orders up to 20.000 euros solely because of telephone interviews at prices and delivery conditions.
Exams of this selection were not possible because the interviews were not documented.
Summary findings
In both countries, the rules for testing and evaluating offers correspond to the EU's requirements.
However, the respective rules differ in detail regarding the procedure and the selection of the persons involved.
In Germany, detailed requirements especially regarding the implementation of the multi-eye principle and the protection of offers are more regulated than in the Czech Republic.
The same applies to the requirements on the basis of which the adequacy of the offered prices should be examined.
In both countries, some of the procurement procedures examined had to be found that essential procedural steps in the examination and evaluation of tenders were not or were insufficiently documented.
However, without comprehensibility and transparency of exam and evaluation decisions, possible manipulative interventions are encouraged.
A particularly serious shortcoming was the transfer of all offers to third parties without the contracting authority having previously sufficiently read and documented the offers and thus protected them from possible manipulations in the further proceedings.
When contracting authorities have tasks carried out by third parties when examining and evaluating tenders, sufficient precautions and increased control effort are required to counter the increased risk of manipulation.
When examining the appropriateness of prices, the audited services in Germany did not always use the prescribed instruments in full, and therefore insufficiently examined the price structure of the offers.
In the Czech Republic, complaints arise mainly during the aptitude test and when applying the evaluation criteria.
Completion of the procurement procedure
After examining and valuing the tenders, the award procedure shall be concluded by awarding the award or by lifting the procedure.
Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption
In EU-wide procurement procedures, all tenderers must be informed in advance of the proposed award decision.
Companies have the option to provide the intended award for information by electronic means or by fax within 10 days or 10 days. for other means of communication within 15 days and if necessary. initiate an investigation procedure.
A contract must not be concluded before this information period expires.
THIS segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
If a tenderer submits an application for review within the information period, a contract is only possible after the final decision in the review procedure.
Companies can also have the award decision reviewed by an independent court during this investigation procedure.
The review procedure is intended to ensure the legal protection of companies and to encourage the contracting authority to observe the procurement law throughout the procurement procedure.
To do so, he must document the procedure sufficiently.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have implemented EU rules on information and verification procedures.
In both countries, the contracting authority has to decide on the award.
However, it must not derogate from the result of proper examination and valuation of tenders.
The contracting entity should place the contract within the announced deadline for the award,
also because the tenderers are no longer bound by their offers after the expiry of the deadline.
For open and restricted procedures or In principle, the contracting authority must not deviate from the content of the offer at the conclusion of the contract.
The inferior tenderers must be informed promptly about the decision to award and the reasons for not taking their tenders into account.
Procurement procedures may only be cancelled under certain conditions, e.g. if the tendering prices are excessive or the tenders do not meet the requirements of the tendering procedure.
Different regulations
In the Czech Republic there is 10 or 10 15-day obligation to inform and wait before the contract is awarded also for construction services not to be awarded throughout Europe.
In Germany, these requirements apply only to the area of EU-wide contracts.
In the case of other proceedings in Germany, tenderers can only be informed of the decision to award the award.
In the Czech Republic, a tendering procedure should be terminated if only one tendering has been received or only one tendering could be valued.
In Germany, even in the case of only one worthable offer, the contract must be awarded, provided that it complies with the conditions of the invitation to tender and is economic.
Essential exam results
BRH
There were only a few complaints regarding the audited contracts when the procurement proceedings were concluded.
In some cases, companies received letter of order for EU-wide contracts before the expiry of the information deadlines, which could result in the invalidity of the contract.
In individual cases, order letters also contained different content from the content of the offer, such as changed dates.
In several cases, the contracting entities did not meet the deadline for award.
In an open procedure, a contracting authority therefore awarded the contract to the second most favorable offer, since a company with a 50 % cheaper offer was no longer willing to perform the services at the originally offered price after the expiry of the contract period.
NKÚ
During a construction work in the higher education sector, the contracting authority deviated from the offer of the tenderer in substance.
In some contracts, for example for construction of road maintenance, construction of a motorway and bypass, the contracting authorities concluded the contracts after the expiry of the statutory deadline.
In the award of works for the renovation of former military grounds, the contracting authority sent the notification of the contract to all tenderers only after the expiry of the statutory deadline.
Summary findings
Both countries have implemented the EU's guidelines for the conclusion of the procurement procedure.
The legal protection of the inferior candidates or tenderers increases the tools for preventing corruption.
The scope of legal protection under Czech procurement law is also extended to contracts below the EU thresholds.
In both countries, exceedances of the deadlines for placing orders have been observed.
This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of manipulation.
Construction administrations should avoid the shortcomings shown in closing their procurement procedures in the future.
Documentation, reporting and reporting obligations
The procurement procedures must be documented during each stage with a view to the relevant findings as well as the reasons for the individual decisions.
In EU-wide procedures, the orders placed must be made public.
The order data is also recorded in an EU statistics.
Requirements of EU law and prevention of corruption The documentation of procurement procedures will implement a fundamental requirement of the EUwide transparency bid.
A carefully and promptly produced documentation only enables the traceability of the award decisions.
In particular, it also serves the effective legal protection of tenderers in procurement above the EU thresholds.
Proper documentation is also an essential part of preventing corruption, as the compulsion to substantiate decision-making significantly limits manipulation margin.
The notice of a contract awarded during an EU-wide procurement procedure shall be sent to the Office for Official Publications of the EU within 48 days.
The Office publishes the notices in the Official Journal of the EU and thus also implements the transparency bid.
The awarding bodies must also collect the essential data of their award procedures and report to the EU Commission through the relevant national ministries.
On this basis, the EU Commission compiles an annual EU statistics that allow it to gain an overview of the development of the internal market in construction services.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have fully implemented EU documentation and reporting requirements into national law.
The documentation and reporting regulations for EU statistics are largely the same in both countries.
Different regulations
In the Czech Republic, the compulsory publication of contracts awarded is not only limited to EU-wide contracts, but also extends to other procurement procedures.
The notice period is shortened to 15 days.
In Germany, in addition to EU-wide contracts, there is only a publication requirement for restricted tenders and for free-handed contracts of 25.000 euros or more. 15.000 Euro without sales tax (so-called Ex post transparency).
Below these value limits and in the case of public procurement, only the companies participating in the competition procedure will receive information on the award of contracts.
Essential exam results
BRH
Documentation
A large number of the audited award procedures were not fully documented.
The award notes did not contain all the necessary information, such as justifying product specifications or references to national rules.
In a procurement procedure, the awarding authority did not explain why it awarded the contract to a company, although its offer did not contain proof to be submitted.
In a few cases, the documents of the awarding bodies did not contain all the evidence necessary for the documentation of the award procedure either.
Announcements of order
In some EU-wide procurement procedures, the awarding bodies failed to make known the award of the contracts.
Further procurement procedures lacked evidence that the contracting authorities had made known the contracts awarded.
Reporting and reporting obligations
The statistical records that were viewed contained the required minimum data. They had been created and sent on time.
Ex post transparency
In most cases, the audited construction administrations published the contract data of the completed procurement procedures.
However, due to a transmission error, the data did not appear in a building administration.
Construction administration only noticed this error after half a year,
so that the contract data of the contracting procedures that have been completed so far have not been published.
NKÚ
Documentation
The documentation of the procurement procedures showed considerable flaws in building measures to host a major sporting event. This was mainly incorrect information, such as false offer prices in the protocols of the valuation commissions.
In addition, some protocols of the offer opening were not signed.
Announcements of order
For several road construction projects, notices of contracts awarded were only delayed or not published at all.
Summary findings
The rules on documentation and reporting and reporting obligations largely correspond in both countries and implement EU guidelines.
The transparency of the award procedures, including the award of contracts, is thus guaranteed in principle.
The rules to be applied for publication in the Czech Republic go a little further than the rules in Germany.
The shortcomings in documentation and notices highlighted significantly restricted the orruption preventive effect of these instruments in the respective procurement procedures.
THIS segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Construction administrations should further improve the transparency of their procurement procedures and contract assignments and fully comply with their reporting and reporting obligations.
Summary evaluation and recommendations
The parallel audits of the NKÚ and the BRH have focused on two priorities, which are essential in the Czech Republic and Germany for the award of works by contracting authorities: the application of EU procurement regulations and the prevention of corruption.
The requirements of EU law enable cross-border competition to create a European internal market.
Anti-corruption measures are not only intended to prevent or at least reduce corruption. They should also prevent economic damage and a possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the state.
The audit findings of the two auditors on the application of the procurement rules in both countries and the comparison of these rules provide information on common ground and differences which may help both countries to develop their procurement law and apply.
Application of EU procurement rules
Both countries have transposed the EU's guidelines for the award of works into national law.
This gives an important common basis for the award of works in the Czech Republic and Germany and for taking into account the essential bids of competition, equal treatment of the companies involved and the transparency of procurement procedures.
The construction administrations of both countries have partly underlined these bids very extensively by further administrative regulations.
The Czech Republic has largely transferred the requirements regarding works to be awarded throughout the EU to its nationwide procurement procedures below the EU threshold.
However, the Court of Auditors has found that construction administrations have not fully respected the requirements of EU law in all areas.
The construction administration in Germany should further improve the quality of its procurement procedures in order to eliminate the complaints raised when implementing EU regulations.
The audits in the Czech Republic have mainly revealed dangers that affect the profitability of the contracts.
Incomplete descriptions of services required additional benefits, which were often given in breach of the law. In addition, the cost estimates were usually insufficiently compiled. Excessive qualification requirements also reduced the number of possible tenderers and restricted competition especially in transport buildings.
Corruption prevention
The investigations didn't have the goal of exposing corruption cases,
also because the Court of Auditors does not have appropriate tools for this.
However, the Court of Auditors can examine to what extent the administrations of both countries have taken precautions against corruption and manipulation in the award of works and how these guidelines are applied.
In preventing corruption, both countries have set different priorities.
In particular, German regulations provide for largely unlimited competition as well as transparency and controls as central elements of anti-corruption prevention.
The Czech regulations aim primarily at increased transparency of procedures.
BRH
In Germany, general principles of prevention of corruption apply, which the entire federal administration has to apply.
These principles are also implemented in the specifications for the award of works and are geared to their specific requirements.
The corresponding rules lay down in part very precisely how the bids for prevention of corruption should be taken into account when the procurement procedures and when selecting the persons involved.
In particular, the BRH considers that the priority of the principle of open procedure or procedure is particularly important. the public procurement procedure is an appropriate tool to significantly reduce the risk of corruption in the award of works. Restrictions on competition, on the other hand, increase the risk of manipulative intervention.
Risk analysis and sufficient controls (especially the multi-eye principle), the guidelines for transparency and documentation of procurement procedures as well as various organizational measures are also effective precautions to prevent corruption and manipulation.
The BRH therefore does not see any fundamental need for change to the corresponding administrative requirements for the award of works.
In practice, the rules on prevention of corruption are largely taken into account.
The shortcomings identified in sub-areas have revealed shortcomings in implementing some guidelines.
Construction administrations should continue to train their employees on the guidelines for prevention of corruption and raise them even more aware of this problem.
A significant part of the complaints concerned tasks that the construction administrations had delegated to freelance workers.
However, without controls and adequate safeguards, the risk of abuse increases when delegating tasks.
Manipulation and corruption tasks should therefore only be entrusted to third parties if the administration can ensure a sufficient level of protection against inadmissible interventions.
NKÚ
At government level, the Czech Republic adopted a strategy against corruption in which public procurement is the most important element.
The Procurement Act and the corresponding implementing rules have been substantially changed.
NKÚ's audits took place during the implementation of this strategy.
The strategy adopted and the new statutory provisions should be effective measures to improve as the awarding bodies justify the profitability of contracting, the calculation of expected prices, the appropriateness of qualification requirements, the essential assessment criteria and the nature of the evaluations and properly document and publish all these aspects have to.
Recommendations
The NKÚ and the BRH assess the implementation of the EU guidelines in principle positively.
The broad acceptance in practice has confirmed that the EU bids of competition, equal treatment and transparency are an appropriate basis for the award of works within the European Union.
The supranational model implemented in the European Union can also serve as a basis for similar projects to enable and promote cross-border competition.
Given the enormous material and ideal potential for damage caused by manipulation and corruption in the award of works, both auditors see the construction administrations in their countries as required to continue their actions against corruption and manipulation and, if necessary,. still to be improved.
In particular, the organisation and procedures of the procurement procedures should be continuously examined for weaknesses and risks in order to identify need for action and to initiate appropriate countermeasures.
Comparison of procurement practice in both countries suggests that the proportion of open procedures in the Czech Republic should be increased as open procedures can provide a wider scope for competition and significantly reduce the risk of corruption.
A stronger division of works into lots can also have a favourable effect on supply prices provided that it achieves greater competition with a higher number of tenderers.
Ensuring proper conduct of the procurement procedures is an essential basis for an efficient awarding of contracting authorities.
In Germany, the procurement procedures are carried out by the specialized construction administrations. In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, these tasks, with the exception of transport construction projects, are carried out by the departments themselves or contractors commissioned by them.
The two countrie s' audit bodies have the desire to develop and, if necessary, develop the important findings for them, even after their joint project. to bring to the parliament and government of their country.
Both auditors also believe that the principles of procurement law and its implementation are also of interest at the international level of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Authorities (INTOSAI) as set out in this report. The principles and findings outlined are of general importance to effectively counteract corruption and to ensure economic procurement of works in well-functioning and fair competition.

Administration of sales tax in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany
Report on the check check
Forewords
Taxes are the main source of revenue of public budgets.
A focus of the work of the Court of Auditors should therefore be on the audit of this area.
This is especially true of VAT fraud.
This alone creates annual tax losses of an estimated 100 billion in the European Union. Euro1.
Already at VI. EUROSAI Congress 2005 in Bonn stressed the need for closer cooperation.
This enables audit offices to exchange audit approaches and to optimize audit practice.
The turnover tax (VAT) is particularly suitable for cooperation as it is harmonized within the European Union.
In 2006, for the first time, the courtyards of both states audited parallel in the field of VAT.
The relevant audit report was published in 2008
Since VAT fraud is a widespread phenomenon in the European Union, close cooperation between the audit bodies is needed. This can be comprehensively assessed whether the measures taken are likely to effectively counter VAT fraud.
The two auditors decided to continue their cooperation and carried out a second parallel audit. Administration of turnover tax in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany report on the inspection
1. Introduction
Exam No :(CZ) 09/11 (D) VIII 2-2009-0892
Subject of audit: (CZ) Administration of VAT (D) Bilateral audit with the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic (hereinafter NKÚ), audit audit
Exam goal:
(CZ) The VAT administration and the treatment of selected turnover between entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic (hereinafter CZ) and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter Germany) should be examined. In addition, the procedures used by the financial authorities for intergovernmental assistance should be examined.
(D) The audit was intended to evaluate how the financial management implemented the recommendations made by the audit bodies.
In addition, additional exam fields linked to the VAT should be processed.
The findings made here should be compared to determine whether the taxation procedures can be optimized.
Examination period was 2006 to 2008 including relevant information from the period before the examination period until the conclusion of the exam.
2. Summary of results and evaluation of parallel exam
The audit bodies of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have agreed on an audit for the administration of the VAT.
During the previous parallel examination, they discovered suspicion cases involving intraCommunity transactions,
who made another exam appear useful.
On the basis of the findings of the audit, the two audit bodies made recommendations for the administration of the VAT.
The aim of the check was to evaluate how these recommendations were implemented. In addition, the suspected cases identified should be investigated.
The exam also dealt with other facts. This included selected cases of risky intra-Community transactions, mutual assistance in the recovery of VAT claims and VAT audit for large companies.
The Court of Auditors stated:
1. Recommendations made due to previous exam
Recommendation 1: Regulations for registration of taxable persons should be harmonized within the EU
In the first audit, the Court of Auditors compared the registration procedures for the USt in the two states and found differences that caused problems.
The Court of Auditors therefore recommended harmonising the registration of taxpayers within the EU.
This was also taken up at EU level.
The draft for the amendment of Regulation No. 1798/2003 of the Council provides for the extension of current databases in the EU including a database with the identification number of those with VAT.
The draft also provided for common rules for the registration of taxpayers and their possible cancellation.
The Court of Auditors expected Member States to agree on appropriate regulations in line with their decision to remove unreliable entrepreneurs from the VAT system as early as possible.
On the last version of the draft, the Member States reached political agreement in ECOFIN.
These common rules are no longer contained. The two auditors regret this.
They still consider such regulations important to prevent VAT fraud.
• Recommendation 2: Monthly submission of summary reports As a result of the first audit, the auditors recommended that the summary reports (CM) should be submitted monthly in future.
The amounts of intraCommunity transactions could then be reviewed more closely.
Council Directive 2008/117 / EC amending Directive 2006/112 / EC on the common system of value added tax to combat tax fraud in intra-Community transactions has reduced the deadline for submission of the CM to one month.
In the CZ, this requirement was implemented by a change to the VAT Act, which came into force on 1. January 2010
In Germany, the implementation did not come into force until 1. July 2010 It has thus not transposed the obligation to pay the ZM monthly into national law within the time limits.
• Recommendation 3: Data synchronization of VAT pre-registrations and ZM in Germany for more reliable MIAS data and suggestion to check the merging of procedures for VAT pre-registrations and ZM The German Financial Administration has taken up the recommendation issued by the Federal Court of Auditors and set up a working group to work out possible solutions.
The work is not finished yet.
The Federal Court of Auditors will observe the further development.
• Recommendation 4: Exchange on successful criteria, components or approaches to a risk management system at EU level During the first audit, the two auditors agreed that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by one Member State alone.
Successful criteria as well as elements or Risk management approaches must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State.
If this does not happen, scammers will focus on the weakest risk management system Member State.
The Court of Auditors noted that the two Member States apply different risk management systems, which have both strengths and weaknesses.
The NKU audited the system of information exchange within the EU - EUROCANET, while the Federal Court of Auditors focused on German participation in the ′′ platform for risk management
2. check of selected intra-Community transactions
At the first audit, the Court of Auditors jointly examined transactions in which it was doubtful whether they had actually been implemented or whether they had been carried out by the taxpayers of the two States in the VAT pre-declarations (or VAT declarations) or ZM had been explained differently.
The Court of Auditors selected nine cases of intra-Community deliveries of goods between CZ and Germany for the inspection.
The audits carried out by the fiscal authorities of both states were not yet completed at the time of the first parallel audit.
The audit has revealed that the fiscal procedures for these selected transactions have now been completed. The respective financial administrations had taken appropriate measures to do so (including retrospective VAT fixings or preventing deductions).
3. Examination of selected, particularly risky intra-Community turnover
The audit also included intra-Community transactions between taxpayers in the EU, which were covered by the EUROCANET system.
EUROCANET is used to identify risky taxable persons.
Member States may participate in this scheme on a voluntary basis.
CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET. Germany has a passive status, i.e. it does not participate in data exchange within the framework of EUROCANET.
From the point of view of an active participant state, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to participate actively.
This could not gain any information on which suppliers with German VAT ID would have been classified as severely risky cases.
The NKU found both normal business transactions and suspicion of VAT fraud, including carousel fraud, in selected transactions.
The FÄ could only consider high risk turnover limited. This was particularly true for so-called ′′ Missing Traders ", whereby an examination of the documents alone is hardly sufficient to prove fraud to the taxable person.
In case of suspicion of merry-go-round fraud on imports and exports
It is recommended that the customs and tax authorities cooperate more closely to track the identity of the goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final customer.
Germany and a number of other countries have rejected an active participation in EUROCANET because there is insufficient legal basis from their point of view.
The Federal Audit Court found that the German financial administration uses other tools to identify risky taxpayers.
Nevertheless, there is a need for communication and exchange of experiences between all EU Member States.
The EU Council agreed on a draft regulation,
was created by EUROFISC.
The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should be integrated into the planned network to combat VAT fraud.
4. Mutual administrative assistance in recovering claims
Intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims is subject to the same European law in all Member States.
Therefore, requests for intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in the CZ and Germany are dealt with in the same way.
Federal Court of Auditors and NKU compared the statistics that both Member States submitted to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008
These statistics contained inconsistencies.
The two auditors consider it useful to reopen a discussion on statistics at EU level in order to avoid any inconsistencies that remain in the future.
If this does not happen, the statistics cannot be used appropriately for comparisons.
In addition, the statistics should contain more information about the VAT.
Analysis of detailed data can make it easier for the Commission to support Member States in their efforts to combat VAT fraud.
Both auditors consider that Member States with a low recovery rate should strive to at least achieve the average recovery rate.
The Commission should support the Member States if so desired.
5. VAT test for large companies
The Court of Auditors analysed the legal situation regarding the VAT audit of large companies in both countries.
Additionally, they collected information from the financial administrations with a questionnaire that they considered important in this context.
It was clear that the situation varies in both countries.
CZ has a system for selecting risky cases that includes a large amount of relevant data (including information on VAT audits, balance sheet data and profit and loss accounts).
This allows the overall control and analysis of the VAT control.
A special financial office for large companies will be set up in 2012
There is no comparable system in Germany yet. This makes it difficult to control and analyze total VAT control.
The German financial administration focuses more on the selection of relevant individual cases and is based in particular on data from the VAT pre-registrations or. VAT declarations and the ZM.
Various risk management components to be improved support the evaluation of these data.
3. Exam procedure
3.1 Exam procedure in the Czech Republic
Division II - Government revenue and Regional Departments IX Pilsen, X České Budějovice, XIII Brno and XV Ostrava audited between May 2009 and February 2010.
Registered bodies were the Czech Ministry of Finance and 25 FÄ Tax Office (FA) Brno II, FA Brno III, FA Brno IV, FA in Břeclav, FA in Domažlice, FA in Hodonín, FA in Hradec Králové, FA in Cheb, FA in Jablonec nad Nisou, FA in Karlovy Vary, FA in Kralupy nad Vltavou, FA in Kraslice, FA Ostrava I, FA Ostrava III, FA in Písek, FA in Pilsen, FA Prague 1, FA Prague 4, FA Prague 8, FA in Rakovník, FA in Sokolov, FA in Tábor, FA in Vysoké Mýto, FA in Zlín and FA in Žamberk.
The Czech Court of Auditors Senate approved the audit findings on 27. April 2010.
3.2 Exam procedure in Germany
The examination area traffic taxes and employees of the associated PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt / Main and Munich audited from February 2009 to February 2010.
After selecting the sample cases, they announced the examination in several countries:
• Bavaria, • Hamburg, • Hessen, • North Rhine-Westphalia, • Saxony. They also conducted interviews at the Federal Ministry of Finance (Federal Ministry of Finance).
• Erlangen, Central Finance Office Munich, Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in der Upper Palatinate, Grafenau; • Hamburg-Nord, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Sonderfinanzamt Hamburg for Large Companies; • Wiesbaden I, Wiesbaden II, Darmstadt; • Essen-NordOst, FA Essen for tax audits at large companies and corporations, Lüdenscheid; • Chemnitz-Süd.
In addition, talks were held with the FÄ Mühlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-Süd and the OFD Frankfurt / Main, Chemnitz and Münster.
The Federal Audit Court informed the Federal Ministry of Finance of the audit results in April 2010
3.3 Cooperation between the two audit bodies
In the run-up to the parallel audit, the representatives of both auditors met in September 2008 to discuss and determine the audit topics.
In December 2008, the Presidents of both auditors signed the agreement on cooperation in the parallel audit.
At a meeting in Bonn in June 2009, the exam teams informed each other about the first results obtained during the exam preparation, discussed possible exam approaches and agreed on the further approach.
A second meeting took place in Prague from 2. to 4. December 2009
The audit teams exchanged the exam findings gained so far and agreed on the schedule for the joint audit report.
The two audit bodies set out the following topics for their parallel audit: • Evaluation of the recommendations made in the previous report; • Review of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between taxpayers from the CZ and Germany, which could not be fully clarified during the first parallel audit; • Review Selected intra-Community transactions classified as risk-free transactions between taxable persons from CZ and Germany; • Examination of the procedures of the two tax administrations regarding intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of VAT claims; • VAT audits for large companies.
The report on the results of the parallel exam was prepared during a working meeting in June 2010
4. Audit of sales tax administration in selected areas
4.1 Implementation of recommendations from the first joint examination
4.1.1 Implementation of recommendations in the Czech Republic
Recommendation 1
Harmonization of requirements for registration of taxable persons within the EU supported
on the results of the first audit, the Czech Court of Auditors recommended adjusting the requirements for VAT registration and introducing new rules for the cancellation of registration in the CZ.
These revised rules should more effectively contain the risk of possible tax evasion.
In certain cases, it was found that the FÄ did not delete the VAT registration of taxable persons if they had their obligations under Czech Law No. 235/2004 (hereinafter referred to as ′′ VAT law ′′) did not comply.
So far, the Czech Ministry of Finance has not submitted any amendment to oblige the FÄ to cancel if the taxpayers repeatedly do not submit VAT returns.
According to the Czech USt Act, the FA can delete the registration of a taxable person on its own initiative if (a) the taxable person has not made any turnover for twelve consecutive months and has not informed the FA of the reasons for it; (b) the taxable person has his obligations under the VAT (c) the taxable person no longer fulfils the conditions for tax liability.
The first examination had revealed that, due to the existing legal situation, the FA Prague 1 must delete the VAT registration of ′′ foreign taxable person ′′ in 3 with effect from 31. January of the following calendar year, if they do not apply for registration during the current calendar year and Payment of VAT were obligated.
The FA Prague 1 often did not delete the VAT registration of these taxpayers because the relevant provision of the deadline could not be properly implemented in practice.
The problem was solved by the amendment of the USt Act, which came into force on January 1., 2009
Accordingly, the FA is entitled to cancel the registration of a foreign taxable person if he has not provided taxable goods or exempt goods or services with a right to deduction during the previous calendar year.
Recommendation 2
Monthly levy of the ZM
Due to the initial audit, the Court of Auditors had recommended that the monthly levy of ZM be introduced.
The Council Directive, which shortened the turnaround for the delivery of the ZM to one month, was implemented in CZ by the VAT Act, which came into force on 1. January 2010
The ZM must now be delivered electronically.
In addition, a ZM must be surrendered if services whose place of performance is to be determined according to § 9 (1) VAT Act are provided to a person registered as a value added tax in another Member State.
The prerequisite is that the recipient is obliged to declare and pay the VAT for these services. This obligation arises from Council Directive 2008/8 / EC amending Directive 2006/112 / EC as regards the place of service.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of VAT pre-registrations data and ZM to increase the reliability of MIAS data This recommendation relates to German financial administration.
In its ATIS4 system, the Czech financial administration automatically checks data on intra-Community transactions from the VAT declarations and the ZM.
Recommendation 4
Exchanging successful criteria, components or approaches to a risk management system at EU level
The proper collection of VAT is an indispensable prerequisite for the smooth functioning of the EU's internal market.
This is why the fight against VAT fraud is of priority interest and has received considerable attention in recent years.
Among other things, the importance of this is demonstrated by an investigation published by the European Commission in October 2009
In this an external expert estimated the VAT outage caused by the 25 Member States between 2000 and 2006 After evaluating the available data, the tax loss for the said period was between 90 and 113 billion. Euros numbered. The EU-25 was based on an average of 12 % of turnover taxes due to them each year.
The estimated tax loss for CZ in 2006 was 18 %.
The first audit found that a Member State alone cannot develop an effective risk management system (RMS).
Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each Member State.
Regarding the RMS, the Czech Court of Auditors has audited the system for the exchange of information within the EU (EUROCANET).
Risk intraCommunity transactions carried out by taxpayers within the EU and recorded in EUROCANET (see chapter 4.3).
The EUROFISC network aims to optimize administrative assistance in tax matters and to combat VAT fraud more effectively. Cooperation between the competent authorities should be improved in order to detect fraud as early as possible.
Later, EUROFISC could be used as an aid to assess the potential for intra-Community transactions.
The ECOFIN ECOFIN approved EUROFISC as early as 7. October 2008 and adopted the principles governing the functioning of the system.
EUROCANET is a model for EUROFISC, which has been developed by the Belgian financial administration in cooperation with the other Member States and with the support of the European Commission and OLAF7
The purpose of the system is to uncover risky transactions and to identify entrepreneurs involved in organised VAT fraud.
4.1.2 Implementation of recommendations in Germany
The assessment of the recommendations from the first report led to the following findings:
Recommendation 1
Harmonization of the conditions for registration of taxable persons within the EU
The German financial administration has developed a well-functioning system for the registration of taxpayers using a detailed questionnaire.
The Federal Ministry of Finance presented this system to the Commission in October 2007
The system itself is constantly being improved.
The data provided in the questionnaire will now be collected electronically and will later be available for inquiries. They are therefore part of the risk management during registration.
The Commission had made a Vorschlag8 to amend Regulation 1798/2003 Among other things, the latter provided common standards for the registration and cancellation of taxable persons.
There was also a need for clarification and clarification among the Member States.
The Federal Court of Auditors had recommended that the Federal Ministry of Finance not go back to the standards already achieved.
Recommendation 2
Monthly levy of the ZM
On 8. April 2010, a Gesetz9 transposing EU directives into national law was passed.
It contains, inter alia, provisions on monthly delivery of the CM for intra-Community deliveries
and will enter into force on July 1., 2010
Recommendation 3
Comparison of VAT pre-registrations and ZM data for more reliable MIAS data and considerations on merging the previously separate procedures for filing VAT pre-registrations and ZM
A joint federal state working group has been set up,
which has developed a concept for automatic synchronization of data from the VAT pre-registrations and the ZM.
The concept is currently being discussed with the countries.
In addition, this working group has dealt with a concept to optimize the control procedure for intra-Community transactions.
Recommendation 4
The exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches to a risk management system at EU level will be exchanged at EU level.
Germany is participating in the risk management platform.
The European Commission supported the initiative and initiated the establishment of a risk management platform within the Fiscalis 2006-2007 action plan by written procedure dated 18. October 2006
The members of the platform dealt with the following topics in 4 subgroups: • risk management tools, • influence the behaviour of taxpayers, • evaluation, • update the risk management guide.
New reports from the subgroups ′′ Risk Management Instruments ′′ and ′′ Update of the Risk Management Guide ′′ were published early 2010
4.1.3 evaluation
Registering
The question of the requirements for VAT registration and its cancellation in different countries was dealt with at EU level.
The draft revised Council Regulation 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEQ No 218/92 provides for the extension of current databases within the EU, including a database of VAT. Identification numbers.
This proposal also contains common standards for the registration and deletion of taxable persons.
The questions of registration and cancellation are reserved until further notice by the national laws of the EU Member States.
There was also a need for clarification and clarification among the Member States.
The Federal Court of Auditors had recommended that the Federal Ministry of Finance not fall behind the standards already achieved.
On the last version of the draft, the Member States reached political agreement in the ECOFIN on 8. June 2010
Common rules for registration and cancellation of taxable persons are no longer contained.
THIS segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The two auditors regret this. They still consider such regulations important to prevent VAT fraud.
THIS segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Monthly levy of the ZM
With a view to international cooperation, as a result of the previous examination, it was recommended that all Member States introduce the monthly levy of the CM in order to enable an earlier examination of the amounts of intra-Community transactions.
Council Directive 2008/117 / EC amending Directive 2006/112 / EC on the common system of value added tax to combat tax fraud in intra-Community transactions has reduced the turnaround for the delivery of the corresponding CM to one month.
In the CZ, this requirement was implemented by the amendment of the VAT law, which came into force on 1. January 2010
Germany did not implement the obligation to pay monthly ZM levy until 1. July 2010, and thus did not implement it in due time, while CZ complied with the EU's guidelines.
Matching data from VAT pre-registrations and ZM for more reliable MIAS data and considerations on combining previously separate procedures for submitting VAT pre-registrations or the ZM
The German financial administration has taken up the recommendations of the Federal Court of Auditors and has set up a working group to draw up possible solutions.
The Federal Court of Auditors will observe the further development.
Exchanging successful criteria, components or approaches to a risk management system at EU level
Germany and CZ use different approaches to identify risky entrepreneurs.
The Czech Court of Auditors audited the application of the EUROCANET system in CZ (see section 4.3).
The Federal Accounting Court focused on German participation in the risk management platform.
4.2 check of selected intra-Community transactions
The first examination jointly examined transactions in which there were doubts as to whether they had actually been carried out or whether there were inconsistencies in the reports of taxable persons in both Member States.
The two auditors selected nine cases of intraCommunity deliveries of goods between CZ and Germany for the purpose of the audit, in which the fiscal audit carried out by the FÄ of the Member State concerned was not yet completed at the time of the previous joint audit.
1)
In the first quarter of 2005, a Czech taxable person acquired goods worth 22 686 euros from a German taxable person.
The Czech taxable person did not declare the acquisition in his VAT statement, since the period referred to in the German taxable person did not have a VAT identification number, but only a tax number for domestic transactions.
Through international mutual assistance according to the Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the competent Czech FA received information that under German VAT law, the supplier of intra-Community goods does not need a VAT identification number to be able to claim the tax exemption of intra-Community goods.
The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors found that - according to the audit of the Czech FA responsible - the Czech taxable person submitted an additional VAT declaration declaring the purchase of goods in the abovementioned value and at the same time asserting his right to deduction of deduction at the same amount...
2)
In the fourth quarter of 2004, a Czech taxable person is said to have purchased goods worth 12 561 euros from a German taxable person.
However, he explained that he did not acquire the goods and therefore did not explain in his VAT statement.
The German financial administration refused to process the request, on the basis of a provision of the Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, because the turnover associated with the acquisition did not exceed the threshold of 15 000 euros.
Since the Czech FA could not obtain any documents, the tax audit remained unsuccessful and the original tax determination remained in place.
The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors revealed that the Czech FA received two spontaneous information from Germany in accordance with the Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, according to which the German taxable person charged the goods in question to a Slovak addressee.
The Czech taxable person acquired the goods from the Slovak taxpayer and reported the purchase in his regular VAT statement for October 2004
3)
In the fourth quarter of 2004, a Czech taxable person is said to have purchased a car worth EUR 48 500 from a German taxable person.
However, he did not explain intra-Community acquisition.
In addition, he had not issued a VAT statement since August 2004 That's why the FA set the VAT for the quarter in question at CZK 0
On the basis of information submitted from Germany during the international exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the FA asked the taxable person to submit a retrospective tax return in March 2007, but this was refrained by the taxable person.
The audit found that the FA had carried out further audits in this tax case in 2007 It found that the car concerned had been sold by the taxable person to a used car dealer in the CZ.
The Czech FA carried out an assessment for the fiscal period December 2004, setting additional taxes of CZK 295 379 for the purchase of goods from another Member State and their resale.
The competent Czech court decided to open an insolvency proceedings concerning the property of the Czech taxable person; an insolvency administrator was appointed.
In the absence of significant assets, the outstanding tax liability should be irrelevant.
4)
A Czech taxable person is said to have delivered new vehicles (cars) totalling 167 198 euros to Germany in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005
The reply to a request for information under the Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 stated that a tax criminal proceedings were pending against the German taxable person.
The audit of the Federal Court of Auditors showed that, after the conclusion of the proceedings, there was evidence that the German taxable person was involved in fraud.
The acquisition of intra-Community goods was subject to acquisition tax of 424 182 euros (for 2004) and 369 690 euros (for 2005).
The Czech Court of Auditors audit revealed that the Czech taxable person was involved in carousel fraud with new vehicles.
Based on information from the German financial administration, a VAT audit of the Czech taxable person took place for the tax periods April, May and June 2005
Based on the examination findings and the information from the international exchange of information, the FA fixed additional VAT of CZK 703 031 for May 2005 and CZK 726 551 for June 2005
5)
The Czech taxable person A is said to have purchased a machine from a German taxable person in February 2005 with a total value of 58 000 euros.
In the third quarter of 2004, the German taxable person is said to have delivered a machine worth EUR 88 027 to the Czech taxable person B. B, however, denied the acquisition.
The audit of the Czech Court of Auditors showed that B had acquired the machine from a German company with a branch in the CZ.
The Czech taxable person A did not indicate the purchase of the goods from the said German taxable person in his VAT statement.
The German FA's reply to a request for information under the Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 revealed that the German taxable person had not made an intra-Community supply of a machine worth 000 58 euros, but a delivery within the CZ.
In the audit, the Federal Court of Auditors found that the intra-Community delivery of the machine was classified as domestic delivery after completing an audit and that the VAT exemption was subsequently refused.
6)
In the third quarter of 2004, a German taxable person is said to have delivered goods worth 11 600 euros to a Czech taxable person.
The goods were purchased and later sold in Germany in 2005
The audit of the Czech Court of Auditors found that the Czech FA had made its assessment on the basis of a supplementary VAT statement, which inadmissiblely showed acquisitions from another Member State, including acquisitions in the abovementioned amount.
The Federal Court of Auditors found that after receiving a reply to a request for information in accordance with the Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the German FA corrected the VAT statement of the German taxable person and fixed an additional VAT of 600 1 euros.
Due to the resale of the goods in Germany and the corresponding VAT assessment there, an examination is underway.
The German taxable person's ZM has not yet been corrected, since in Germany only the taxable person who surrendered the ZM can correct it.
7)
The Czech FA in charge received a request for information from the German financial administration in accordance with the Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 on the question of the purchase of a car worth EUR 47 400 by a Czech taxable person in February 2005
After an examination for the tax period 2005, the Czech FA fixed the tax liability of the Czech taxable person at CZK 0 and told the German FA that it could not confirm the purchase of the car by the Czech taxable person.
The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors revealed that the registration of the Czech VAT person had been cancelled because he had not fulfilled his tax obligations.
The Czech FA had sent the documents to the Czech police.
The German taxable person has not so far corrected his information in the ZM, but has appealed against the tax notice.
8)
According to MIAS10, a German taxable person delivered goods totalling 33 205 euros between the third quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005 to a Czech taxable person, which he did not declare as an intra-Community acquisition.
The audit of the Czech Court of Auditors found that the Czech FA examined the reasons for the discrepancies.
The Czech taxable person issued repeated retrospective VAT declarations for the first quarter of 2005
Nevertheless, the Czech FA could not clarify the difference in the amount of CZK 134 273 in the third quarter of 2004 to first quarter of 2005 It justified this by the fact that turnover could not be accurately allocated for individual quarters and accepted the VAT declarations submitted.
9)
In the third quarter of 2004, a German taxable person had delivered goods worth EUR 46 854 to a Czech taxable person.
For the same period, the Czech taxable person declared the intra-Community acquisition of goods valued at only 14 856 euros.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the Czech FA verified the actual value of the delivery.
With the German response to this request, three invoices were sent, which showed a total value of the delivered goods of 31 998 euros, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech taxable person and the MIAS data.
According to the result of the audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors, the Czech taxable person had submitted a retrospective VAT declaration for the July 2004 tax period following repeated reminders from the FA in January 2007
With this statement, the taxable person asserted his right to deduction at the same time. His liability for the tax period in question remained unchanged.
The control audit confirmed that most of the tax procedures regarding the transactions selected for the audit were completed and that the financial administrations in the CZ or CZ respectively. Germany had taken appropriate measures (including retrospective VAT fixings or preventing tax refunds).
4.3 Examination of selected cases of risk intra-Community transactions
4.3.1 findings in the Czech Republic
EUROCANET can be a major source of information to identify risky taxable persons in the Member State of acquisition.
In the CZ, the early warning information obtained from EUROCANET is checked by the responsible FA from the acquirers.
Since the first quarter of 2008, CZ has introduced information on turnover and taxable suppliers considered to be risky into the EUROCANET system.
Nine Czech taxpayers were selected for the audit,
which were entered into EUROCANET by the financial administrations of other Member States either as suppliers or acquirers.
THIS segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Since the German financial administration did not participate in the data exchange via EUROCANET, it could not be determined whether suppliers with a German VAT identification number were classified as risk-bearing by the German financial administration.
The audit detected both normal business transactions and those suspected of carousel fraud or other VAT fraud.
In the cases in question, the FÄ exchanged information under Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003,
e.g. B.:
• FÄ found no suspicion of risky turnover when examining early warning information.
The taxpayers concerned were constantly monitored because their data was stored in EUROCANET.
• During the verifications of risky transactions, the FÄ failed to demonstrate breaches of the rules on the calculation of the tax base and the VAT basis on the basis of the accounts submitted, even though they detected inconsistencies in the transport and storage of the goods or discovered business relationships with mailbox companies from other Member States.
• The review of individual transactions was complicated because certain taxable persons did not cooperate with the FÄ and could not be contacted.
The responsible cases checked most of the risky taxpayers and turnovers mentioned in early warning reports from EUROCANET.
Their opportunities to verify risky turnover, especially so-called ′′ Missing Traders ′′ are limited.
In particular, pure examination of the documents can hardly prove the fraudulent actions of the taxable person.
Stricter requirements for registration of taxpayers for VAT purposes and greater flexibility in deleting registrations would be helpful to combat VAT fraud.
The taxable persons involved in fraudulent merry-go-round transactions can be registered for VAT purposes in order to fake fictitious goods deliveries throughout the EU or to issue formal correct tax receipts to other taxable persons, with which they then assert unjustified rights to deduction.
In case of suspicion of carousel fraud related to imports and exports, it is recommended that the customs and tax authorities cooperate more closely to track the identity of the goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final customer.
Member States may participate voluntarily in EUROCANET.
At the end of 200811, the European Parliament considered that three large Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not participate as a weakness in the system, which should be remedied by establishing a EUROFISC network with mandatory participation.
4.3.2 findings in Germany
The Federal Court of Auditors evaluated data available at the Federal Office for Taxes, including those from EUROCANET.
They served as the basis for the selection of six German taxable persons whose files were checked.
Both Germany and a number of other countries refused to participate actively in EUROCANET.
This is why Germany has a passive status, i.e. it does not send data itself to Brussels, it is only recipient of EUROCANET data.
This is justified by the fact that ′′ from the point of view of the federal government
No doubt-free legal basis [exists] that would allow to break the tax secrecy that exists in Germany.
Additionally, the federal government has no reliable findings on how information sent by the Member States is processed within the framework of EUROCANET ". 12 Since October 2007, the Federal Office for Taxes has been evaluating and transmitting the EUROCANET data to the financial authorities of the Federal and Länder based on a coordinated procedure.
The German FÄ receive control notifications regarding the direct business relationships of taxpayers registered with companies from other EU countries recorded in EUROCANET.
However, the respective German FA does not receive any information as to whether the company from the aforementioned other EU Member State has business relations with a company established in another Member State, which is also in business with the German company from the control notice.
4.3.3 evaluation
CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has only a passive status.
From an active participant's point of view, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to participate actively.
Accordingly, the test had to be carried out differently in this area.
However, significant differences in the success of the detection of VAT fraud could not be found. The reason for this is that EUROCANET is only one component of the risk management system.
But both countrie s' financial administrations have a variety of other tools to expose fraudulent business. Nevertheless, it is necessary to develop a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.
The Council of the European Union agreed on a draft regulation13 establishing EUROFISC, a network to combat VAT fraud.
The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should be exchanged at European level and integrated into this network.

The cases brought to court at national and European level show that there is a need for a discussion between the Member States and the Commission on the conditions for exempting intra-Community transactions.
4.4 Mutual assistance in recovering claims
4.4.1 Intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic
Legislation on intergovernmental assistance to recover certain claims in the EU is essentially based on:
Council Directive 76/308 / EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims related to measures forming part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as levies and customs duties;
Council Directive 2001/44 / EC amending Council Directive 76/308 / EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims related to measures forming part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund; and levies and customs duties and VAT and certain excise duties; and
Commission Directive 2002/94 / EC laying down detailed rules for the application of certain Articles of Directive 76/308 / EEC concerning mutual assistance in the recovery of claims related to certain levies, customs duties, taxes and other measures.
CZ transposed Council Directive 76/308 / EEC by Law No. 76/308 252/2000 concerning intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of certain claims.
Following the adoption of Council Directive 2001/44 / EC, it also had to be transposed into Czech law. At the same time, amendment of the aforementioned law was required.
In this context, Law No. Adopted in 191/2004 on intergovernmental assistance to recover certain claims.
A new relevant legal instrument was introduced by Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1179/2008 of November 28., 2008
Appendices to this Regulation contain new application forms to be used from 1. January 2009 Furthermore, the Regulation makes electronic transmission mandatory and obliges the requesting authority to certify that all documents sent are in conformity with the original.
Essential principles of international mutual assistance for the recovery of claims are:
1. The principle of reciprocity applies;
2. The administrative assistance must always be provided only upon request and upon fulfilment of all requirements;
3. The administrative assistance does not cover claims considered criminal sanction in the requested State;
4. Intergovernmental assistance procedure for recovering claims must be carried out in accordance with the national law of the requested State;
5. In the recovery process, foreign claims do not have priority over domestic claims;
6. The administrative assistance shall only be provided for the recovery of undisputed claims;
7. The principle of exhaustion applies: the requesting State must use all the means to recover the claim under national law.
Law No. 191/2004 provides for three forms of administrative assistance: providing information, serving legal acts and actual recovery.
Procedures for outgoing requests to other EU Member States
The FA responsible shall have the request for information to transmit the request for notification of acts or the request for recovery together with the relevant documents electronically to the Ministry of Finance of the CZ via the respective Financial Directorate.
The Ministry of Finance of the CZ initiates the translation of the request into the language in question, scans it with all the facilities and sends it via the communication network or via the communication network. the common interface CCN / CSI of the competent fiscal authority of the state concerned.
A request for recovery assistance must meet the following condition: the claim must exceed EUR 1 500 and must not be more than five years.
The requested authority may refuse to recover if the requirements are not met.
Procedures for incoming requests from other Member States
The CZ Ministry of Finance must confirm receipt of requests from other Member States as soon as possible, within seven days at the latest.
If it decides not to accept the request, it shall inform the applicant authority of the reasons for the refusal, giving the specific provisions of the Directive on which it is based.
The corresponding notification shall be sent no later than three months after the date of receipt of the request.
Upon receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance shall verify whether the request complies with all legal requirements.
It will then send the request to the FA concerned via the relevant financial directorate. If the request for recovery is granted, the FA has to determine, among other things, the assets of the debtor, e.g. by extracts from the land register, inquiries about existing bank accounts and registration of cars at the registration office.
At the expiry of six months from the date of receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance of CZ should inform the requesting authority of the result of the investigation.
The requesting authority should also be informed if the taxable persons concerned are unavailable and therefore the claim cannot be contributed.
All sums successfully contributed must be transferred to the requesting authority within one month of recovery.
With the consent of the requesting State, the Czech FA involved in recovery can agree on the debt hours or payment of instalments.
The interest or default surcharges imposed on the debtor for the delay period under Law No. 337/1992 concerning the administration of taxes and fees
are entitled to the requesting state.
In particular in 2006 and 2007, the Ministry of Finance delayed the requests for recovery received to the FA.
The same applies to the transfer of the requests for recovery submitted by the Czech FÄ to the competent authority in the requested State.
The audit found that the Ministry of Finance has violated the Intergovernmental Assistance Act for the recovery of claims. Failure to inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State of the state of the recovery procedure within six months of the confirmation of receipt of the request.
The situation has improved since 2008
Statistical data
According to § 13 (4) of Law 191/2004, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ prepares statistics for the European Commission by 15. March of the year. This includes the number of requests for information, notification of acts and recovery received during the previous year, including the amount of claims.
Based on the data transmitted by the Member States, the European Commission shall draw up its report to the Council and the European Parliament on the application of the rules on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims.
The audit found that in 2008, the Ministry of Finance of CZ dropped the claims by 5 250 000 euros. The reason was the incorrect statement regarding the amount of a VAT claim brought in 2008 (caused by the postponement of a decimal comma in the conversion of the claim of Czech crowns into euros).
The mistake subsequently reflected in the statistics of the European Commission.
Mutual recovery assistance information is shown in the table below.
4.4.2 Intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in Germany
The legal basis for intergovernmental assistance in tax matters is Council Directive 2008/55 / EC of 26. May 2008 (EC Recovery Directive) 14 and Regulation (EC) No. 1178/2008 of the Commission of 28. November 2008 (EC implementing Directive).
In order to improve readability and clarity, the EC recovery Directive codifies Council Directive 76/308 / EEC of 15. March 197616, whose provisions had been substantially modified several times.
Among other things, the recovery of VAT and taxes on income and wealth including the associated interest, fees and surcharges are regulated.
The EC recovery directive was transposed into German law by the Recovery Act (EC) 17 of 3. May 2003
The enforcement procedure in Germany is regulated by the Tax Code (AO).
§ 117 paragraph 2 AO provides that the financial authorities can provide intergovernmental legal and administrative assistance under international treaties and legal norms of the European Communities applicable under national law and by virtue of the EC Mutual Assistance Act.
Part six of the AO (§§ 249-346) contains the laws governing the enforcement proceedings.
The administrative actions of the fiscal authorities shall in particular regulate the enforcement and enforcement order.
The Federal Ministry of Finance agreed with the representatives of the Supreme Financial Authorities of the Länder on the principles of mutual assistance in tax matters and transferred its own competence in this field to the Federal Central Office for Steuern18.
General conditions for the admissibility of a request for recovery are:
• The legal requirements must be met (§§ 251, 254 AO).
• All domestic recovery resources have been exhausted.
• The claims for which assistance is requested is indisputable.
• The period between issuing the order of enforcement or the date on which the claim or title became unchallengable and the date of the request shall not exceed five years.
• The claim must be at least 1 500 euros.
Procedures for outgoing requests to other EU Member States The German requests for the recovery of lagging taxes are sent by the enforcement agencies of the FÄ through the relevant central authority and the Federal Office for Taxes to the foreign authority concerned, e.g. the Czech CLO.
The details are set out in the leaflet on intergovernmental assistance for the collection of taxes (recovery) dated 19. January 200419
This leaflet is currently being revised by a federal-state working group and adapted to the new recovery directive.
In addition to installations, the request will be sent electronically by FA to the central authority.
The latter checks whether it is content and formally correct.
If not, the request will be returned to the FA in question.
Otherwise it will be sent to the Federal Tax Office.
The Federal Office for Taxes will then take over the necessary communication with the foreign authority concerned.
Procedures for incoming requests from other EU Member States
Requests for recovery from other Member States are recorded at the Federal Central Office for Taxes, which sends a receipt within ten days.
It also checks whether the formal requirements are met.
The Federal Tax Office generally forwards these requests to the central authority, which forwards them to the FA concerned and monitors the execution.
The Federal Office for Taxes also dispatches intermediate or interim taxation. Final reports.
If the processing of a request takes more than six months, it reminds the central authority of the obligation to submit an interim report in accordance with Article 16 of Commission Directive 2002/94 / EC.

Statistical data
Information on mutual recovery assistance between Germany and CZ for the years 2006 to 2008 (as at 31. December 2008).
4.4.3 Examination of selected recovery cases
A total of 21 intergovernmental requests for recovery between CZ and Germany were selected for the examination. Ten cases are listed below, in which, among others,
The following was found:
1.
On 20. October 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German request for recovery of VAT debt from a Czech taxable person from 2004 and 2005 totalling 3 883 euros (CZK 109 820)).
It was not until 26. February 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request for recovery to the responsible FA.
In order to secure the claim to be accrued, the Czech FA charged a property belonging to the taxable person with a pledge with a pledge.
Since the burdened property was not sufficient to pay the entire tax liability, a payment agreement of at least CZK 2 000 per month was concluded with the debtor.
On August 31., 2009, an interim report was sent to the German FA. Accordingly, the taxpayer had in the meantime paid tax debts of CZK 49 600 (as of 25. August 2009).
The amount was transferred to Germany. Shortly thereafter, on 28. August 2009, a further 000 3 CZK were transferred.

It was not until 27. November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to the responsible FA.
After checking bank accounts, securities, real estate, motor vehicles and other movable property, the FA found that the debtor did not have pledible assets.
Investigations on site also revealed that the debtor had been absent from his permanent residence for almost a year.
His whereabouts in CZ were unknown.
The Czech Ministry of Finance received this notice on 6. April 2009 and forwarded it to the German financial administration on 16. April 2009
3.
On 21. November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for VAT plus interest and fees totalling 3 139 euros (= 84 846 CZK).

However, the debt was also paid in CZ under the recovery procedure and the corresponding amount was transferred to Germany on 27. October 2008
Due to the long time needed by the Czech Ministry of Finance to pass on the information to the FA, the tax liability was paid twice - by the taxable person himself in Germany and by means of recovery by the responsible Czech FA.
In cooperation with the Federal Court of Auditors, it was found that the amount accrued against the tax liability is offset by another procedure, which amounts to EUR 6 649 and should be transferred to CZ in September 2008

The request was returned in a letter dated 3. April 2009 from the German finance administration to the Czech Ministry.
The German financial administration argued that the real estate acquisition tax was not a tax within the meaning of Article 2 e), f), g) and h) of Directive 2008/55 / EC.
Furthermore, Article 2 (g) Liabilities arising from taxes on income and property.
Accordingly, Article 3 of Directive 2008/55 / EC applies to taxes on income and property not mentioned in Articles 1, 3 and 4 of Directive 77/799 / EC.
The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed to send a new request for recovery to the German financial administration, which should no longer include the property acquisition tax arrears of CZK 61 759, but the arrears with VAT, corporation and income tax.
The Czech Ministry of Finance received a new request from the FA responsible for the recovery of tax debts of the same taxable person of CZK 7 079 735

According to which the German FA issued an enforcement order on 11. June 2007 for the seizure of the bank account. The bank stated that it was not in business with the said taxable person.

10.
On 26. September 2005, the Czech FA responsible sent the Czech Ministry of Finance a request for recovery for VAT debt totalling CZK 1 296 845 = EUR 43 591
The relevant Financial Directorate sent the request to the Ministry of Finance on 10. October 2005
The Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request to the German financial administration on 15. December 2005
Prior to the transmission of the request, the Czech FA executed the tax claim by seizing the accounts with banks and salary pledge as well as by debiting a property.
A request for information was submitted to the German financial administration on 16. March 2005 before the request for recovery.
According to the letter dated 16. September 2005 to the Czech FA, the Czech taxable person resided in Germany and had income from non-independent activity totalling 8 437 euros. On 20. April 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a response to the request for recovery and did not forward it to the relevant Czech FA until 12. February 2008
According to that, the debtor's insolvency was unefficient in Germany.
No assets were found that the income from non-independent activity was already the subject of other enforcement measures.
The German financial administration therefore considered the request to be done.
4.4.4 Comparison and evaluation
When it comes to recovery, all EU Member States shall be subject to the requirements of EU law for intergovernmental assistance.
The procedures for processing requests are therefore similar in the CZ and Germany.
Bundesrechungshof and NKÚ have compared the statistics submitted by the two Member States to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008
There were inconsistencies in this.
In its 200620 report, the European Commission recommended that Member States compile their statistics with greater care.
In 200921, the Commission concluded that despite the large number of requests for assistance, the disagreements in the statistics have decreased.
Both auditors consider it useful to have a further discussion at EU level on statistics so that the remaining discrepancies can be avoided in the future.
If this does not happen, the statistics are conditional and cannot be used for comparisons.
In addition, the Court of Auditors considers that the statistics should show both the annual number of requests and the nature of the claims (e.g. VAT, income tax) and the amount of the amounts collected per Member State.
A closer analysis of the statistics submitted by the Member States could help the Member States to assess their measures to combat VAT fraud.
Since the recovery rate can be calculated per Member State, the audit bodies are in favour of at least the average recovery rate within the EU should seek at least the average recovery rate.
At the request of a Member State, the Commission could play an active role in this.
The foreign requests for recovery received by the Ministry of Finance CZ were delayed to the responsible FÄ especially in 2006 and 2007
The same applies to the requests for recovery submitted by the Czech FÄ
The audit found that the Czech Ministry of Finance in this respect against Law No. infringed the intergovernmental recovery assistance in 191/2004 when it did not inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State of progress of recovery within the six-month period from the date of receipt of the request.

4.5.3 Management of sales tax audit for large companies
According to the agreement, both auditors did not audit individual cases. They looked into the question of how the financial administrations are conducting VAT audit of large companies.
Using a questionnaire, they collected information from the financial administrations that is essential for the audit of large companies.
• What statistical records and evaluations for the VAT audit of large companies are available to the management of the tax administration?
In particular:
• Are there any statistics or records of how distinction is made between VAT fraud prevention and general VAT audit?
CZ: No, the current version of the ATIS system does not allow such distinction.
Germany: The financial administration does not distinguish between audits to combat VAT fraud and general VAT audits.
• Are there any statistics or records of the time proximity of the exams?
CZ: Information on the time proximity of intra-Community acquisitions of selected VAT persons is recorded in the ATIS system;
The same applies to information about the beginning and end of the FA exam.
Germany: No, the statistics for auditors summarized at the federal level only contain information about the so-called average last audit period (year).
This figure does not give an overview of the audit periods selected for individual companies.
USt special auditors focus on the last USt assessment periods and are also authorized to audit large companies.
The statistics for USt special auditors at the federal level do not contain any information on the size class of the audited company.
• Are there any statistics or records of the type of multi-result; e.g. divided by:
i.e. real additional result (e.g. applying a reduced instead of the general VAT rate)
iii. incorrect additional result (e.g. transfer / postponement of a facts not to be challenged by VAT law to another tax period)
iii. Cash office effectiveness (payment of the fixed additional result)
CZ:
The Czech financial administration monitors the number of tax audits carried out, the amount of the multi-tax profit broken down by type of tax, the number of taxable persons audited and the number of tax periods audited.
Other tax procedures (local investigations, dunning procedures) are monitored in the same way.
Regardless, the amount of additional payments and the receipts of payments are recorded.
Tax debt statistics are broken down by type of tax. However, there is no distinction between tax debts resulting from a tax return and those resulting from audit acts of the FA.
Germany: No, the statistics summarized at the federal level for auditors and VAT special auditors do not differ according to the above criteria.
In this regard, most fiscal authorities where local surveys were carried out did not differentiate.
• Are results-pregnant exam fields detained?
CZ: Yes, FA can select case cases based on criteria linked to selected ATIS indicators.
Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for auditors and VAT special auditors do not provide such information.
However, the finance ministries of the federal government and the state have agreed on a common approach.
Accordingly, auditors and tax experts of the countries have to enter the additional tax result they have achieved in MAGIC if a certain threshold exceeds.
In this case, additional information shall be provided, e.g. on the origin of the additional VAT result achieved.
• What are the most common findings?
CZ:
- large companies who are liable to have unjustified deduction of deductions for supplies and services received,
• which were not used for an entrepreneurial activity according to § 72 (1) CZ UStG;
• used for representation effort according to § 75 (3) CZ UStG;
• due to invoices that do not meet the requirements of § 73 (1) CZ UStG
- large-scale taxable companies have refrained from the registration of VAT provided for in § 21 (1) CZ UStG.
Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for auditors and VAT special auditors do not provide such information.
The countries do not separate the findings regarding VAT from large-scale audits.
However, the Federal Central Office for Taxes can evaluate the Magic database, which has to be entered into the auditors and tax officers of the Länder with the additional tax result they have achieved if a certain threshold exceeds it.
• Does the financial administration analyze profitable audit fields and draw conclusions for strategic management?
CZ: Yes, e.g. nationwide audits are carried out for hazardous goods and industries.
Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for auditors and VAT special auditors do not provide information about particularly ′′ productive ′′ audit fields.
There were different views among the survey bodies regarding the analysis of such information, the usefulness and the way in which they were used.
Some headquarters provide such information to FÄ, but the FÄ are free to use it or not.
4.5.4 Comparison and evaluation
As a result, large amounts of information are processed automatically in the CZ. Among other things, data from VAT audits, as well as key figures from balance sheets, profit and loss accounts are processed in the system.
CZ is able to control the selection of risky cases using a wide range of information.
The same applies to the evaluation and management of VAT audits in general.
In the CZ, a special financial office for large companies is planned for 2012
In Germany, the financial administration does not collect comparably large amounts of data.
Accordingly, it is harder to perform these tasks in the same way.
The focus is more on selecting relevant individual cases.
THIS segmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Based on the data in VAT pre-registrations or VAT declarations as well as inspection notes select the cases to be examined and ensure the appropriate taxation.
Appropriate management processes and risk management systems should be introduced in order to reduce revenue losses at VAT while increasing the risk of being discovered.

5. Conclusions
The cooperation of the two audit bodies has proven itself.
This resulted in necessary insights into the systems applied in both countries: • intra-Community turnover, • risk management at the USt, particularly with regard to the selection of risky turnover, • recovery of VAT receivables and • VAT audit of large companies.
The audit revealed differences in strategies for detecting VAT fraud and the systems explained above.
These findings can be used to improve existing procedures.
They can also be used to initiate a discussion among interested bodies on which audit approaches and strategies to combat fraud can be used. This applies, for example, to the relationship within and between the Member States and the EU Commission.
The experience and insights gained should encourage us to continue to jointly examine the administration of the VAT.
