Joint report on parallel audits of expenditure on the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway Preliminary remark Without trans-European motorways, modern, united Europe would only be able to cope with the high volume of traffic between the partner states with significant restrictions and quality losses.

High-quality transport networks are essential for maintaining and increasing living standards in Europe.
Ensuring fast, safe, reliable and economical passenger and freight transport is an important task for the state.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
It requires a great deal of organisational, technical and financial effort.
When building and expanding a sustainable European transport infrastructure, difficult compromises often have to be made with European and national policy objectives, such as the preservation of the environment.
Precisely because of the necessary environmental protection measures, the construction of the transport infrastructure is complex.
When planning and awarding the construction of transport routes, administrations can save considerable financial resources through careful action and decision-making and use them for other useful purposes.
One of the tasks of state auditing authorities is to identify deficiencies that stand in the way of optimum economy, efficiency and effectiveness in spending on the construction of transport facilities.
The audit authorities should not only draw the attention of the administrations to the shortcomings identified, but also make suggestions for improvement for the benefit of the citizens and for the benefit of Europe.
Summary
In 2005 and 2006, the two Supreme Audit Institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic, the Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) and the Nejvygl ä u ß t carried out parallel audits of expenditure for the construction of the Prague - Dresden motorway (D 8 motorway in the Czech Republic and A 17 motorway in the Federal Republic of Germany).
The two motorways are connected by a border bridge jointly financed by the two states.
The cooperation with the NK K ä mpfer enabled the BRH to carry out an in-depth examination of the cost-effectiveness of the use of funds for the construction of the border bridge.
In the course of the cooperation with the BRH, the NK received data from German bridges and tunnels for its own cost comparisons.
In 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany signed a contract for the construction of the border bridge.
According to the planning progress, the completion date was finally set for the end of 2006.
However, during the tendering process, the Road and Highway Directorate of the Czech Republic (RMD) made mistakes that delayed the procedure and shortened the available construction time.
The contract with the contractor was therefore concluded later than planned.
The contractor assured the accelerated construction of the bridge by the end of 2006.
However, the RMD had to accept significant additional costs.
As part of the joint audit activity, the prices of motorway bridges on the D 8 and A 17 were compared. The benchmark for the price comparison of the bridges was the size of the bridge area.
A price analysis using statistical methods identified bridges with high costs per square meter.
The analysis showed that the border bridge was the most expensive among the major bridges with lengths of over 100 m.
This was also due to the price increase as a result of the delays in awarding contracts.
The comparison of the prices of the tunnels showed that the prices of the tunnels in the course of the D 8 are significantly higher than the prices of comparable tunnels in Germany.
In future audits of the economic viability of transport infrastructure expenditure, both BRH and NK Kr ä fte can rely on a data collection of bridge and tunnel prices.
Both courts of auditors recommend standardizing bridge structures and carrying out composite and special steel structures only where prestressed concrete structures are inappropriate.
The examination process was characterised by teamwork and an open approach.
During the parallel examination, the examiners from both sides exchanged their expertise and skills.
Introduction
This report deals with parallel audits of expenditure on the construction of the motorway from Dresden to Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and A 17 in Germany).
The focus of the audit was on the economy, cost-effectiveness and effectiveness of the use of funds.
The parallel tests were carried out by the BRH in Germany and the NK K K ä ufer in the Czech Republic
In 2005 and 2006.
The NK ä r examined the economy, economy and effectiveness of the expenditure for the border section 0807 of the D 8 motorway in the amount of approx. CZK 20 billion gross (approx. €690 million).
Of this amount, €64 million will come from EU Structural Funds (ISPA).
The BRH had already examined the planning and construction of the A 17 motorway in the years 2003 to 2005, independently of the parallel tests with the NK K K ö rper.
Of the approximately €670 million for the construction of all three sections of the A 17, €277 million will be co-financed by the European Fund (ERDF).
The Prague-Dresden motorway is part of the Pan-European Corridor IV Dresden - Central and Southeast Europe - Istanbul.
The D8 runs from Prague via Usti nad Labem to the Czech / German border,
The A17 from the border to Dresden.
At the time of the inspection, the border sections of the motorways were under construction.
Both sections were opened to traffic on 21 December 2006.
While the motorway is thus completed on the German side to Dresden, the D 8 remains incomplete on the Czech side, as the section 0805 over a length of 16.4 km between Rehlovice and Lovosice is still in the planning phase.
The crossing of a landscape protection area in the Bohemian Central Uplands is planned.
According to Czech forecasts from 2001, the volume of traffic in 2008 in the border section 0807 of the D 8 motorway will amount to 22,940 vehicles per day.
German forecasts estimate the volume of traffic on the A 17 at the Czech border in 2010 at around 25,000 vehicles per day.
In 2000, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic signed a contract for the merger of the German A 17 motorway and the Czech D 8 motorway at the common state border by building a border bridge.
Since both countries are involved in the construction of this bridge, this individual construction project represented an important aspect of the parallel audits of both audit institutions.
Cooperation between BRH and NK Kl ä ge
From the middle of 2005, the two courts of auditors jointly considered cooperation in the audit of the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway.
Both sides had important reasons for this cooperation:
1.
Germany is partly financing the construction of the border bridge.
Planning and construction are the responsibility of the Czech Road Administration.
There was no opportunity for the BRH to examine this construction project itself.
2.
The NK did not have any comparative data to assess whether the funds were used sparingly with regard to the total construction costs of the bridges and tunnels on the D 8.
3.
The NK ü nstler also had to check the effectiveness of the expenditure by examining the essential technical parameters of the bridges and tunnels, which were to ensure the same quality of use on both sides of the border.
After preparatory negotiations, the presidents of the two courts of auditors concluded an agreement on 4 January 2006 on the coordination of the audits of the Prague-Dresden motorway.
In the course of 2006, the auditors of both audit institutions met at intervals of about six to eight weeks.
They dealt with current problems and tasks. They developed a uniform methodology for examining the bridge and tunnel prices, exchanged test results for the construction of the border bridge and prepared joint reports.
The ongoing exchange of information was essential to the cooperation.
While the BRH focused on the comparison of the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels as well as the award procedures, the NK mainly developed the methodology for the analysis of bridge and tunnel prices.
In Germany and the Czech Republic, the legal basis of financial control and thus also the way in which the two courts of auditors complete their audits differ.
For this reason, both authorities drew up separate national reports on their audit results.
This report takes into account the results of the two parallel audits.
The cooperation ends with the signing of a final communication agreement in the first half of 2007.
Construction of the border bridge
In the 2000 treaty, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed to complete the border bridge in 2005 if possible.
Later, they mutually postponed the date to the end of 2006.
The RMD acted as the contractor for the construction project.
Germany is contributing 42.13% to the bridge construction.
Initially, the RMD provided a prestressed concrete structure for the border bridge.
In 1999, however, RMD agreed with its German partner to build a steel composite structure.
They justified this decision with the possible reduction of the number of pillar pairs from seven to five and the associated ecological benefits for the floodplain.
In addition, a comparative calculation of the RMD had shown the steel composite structure to be the more cost-effective solution.
However, this was based on a calculation error.
The calculation was based on a length of the new steel composite structure of only 397 m,
In fact, it is 5% longer.
During the award process, the RMD made serious mistakes,
By inadequately preparing the award documents and inaccurately describing both evaluation criteria and sub-criteria.
These errors led to subjective and ambiguous assessments by the evaluation commission and the director general of the RMD.
A losing bidder challenged the outcome of the award procedure.
The subsequent investigation by the Czech antitrust office delayed the signing of the construction contract for the border bridge.
As a result, the summer construction season following the offer review in 2004 was lost and the total construction time available was shortened.
The contractor agreed to build the bridge in a shorter time, resulting in a significant price increase.
The measures offered included the double assembly of the superstructures, the change of the pillar shape and the construction of an assembly hall.
In addition, the contractor was unable to procure the original steel grade.
The new type of steel - whose higher costs of around €4 million were borne by the client alone - made it possible to shorten the construction time provided for corrosion protection and thus the overall construction time.
Compared to the offer price of around €18.3 million net, the acceleration measures and other additions will significantly increase the total construction costs of the border bridge.
The shortened construction period alone led to a price increase of about €5.9 million.
Excluding price management, costs are currently around €25.9 million net (as of October 2006).
Comparison of the prices of bridges and tunnels
Both courts examined the bridge prices on the D 8 and the A 17 in order to identify the bridges that were characterised by particularly high prices and to compare the bridge prices on the German and Czech sides.
The study was based on mathematical statistical methods.
The tunnels on the D 8 were compared with similar tunnels on the German motorways A 71, A 38 and A 4, because there were no comparable tunnels on the A 17.
A precise definition of the price concept was important in the preparation of this part of the examination.
For the comparison of the bridge prices, both courts of auditors agreed on detailed specifications, for example: To use the current price paid for the bridge without VAT.
(The VAT rates in the Czech Republic and in Germany are different and may change), not to take into account the costs of special start-up measures, to use the exchange rate of the European Central Bank of 30.12.2005 for currency conversion (29 CZK = 1 €).
Bridges of various types (reinforced concrete, prestressed concrete, steel composite and steel) and various sizes are available on both the D 8 and the A 17.
To ensure the comparability of the tested bridge structures, the bridges were grouped according to their design.
The analyses also took into account the bridge size within these groups.
Concrete bridges were by far the most common on both sides of the border (20 bridges on the D 8 and 36 bridges on the A 17).
The study focused on this type of bridge, as the size of the sample allowed the application of mathematical statistical methods and improved the reliability of the results.
The study showed that the price of the concrete bridges on the D 8 / A 17 depends on the bridge size (length, road surface): The larger the bridge, the lower the square meter price.
The correlation between price and size is more pronounced for German bridges than for Czech bridges (see figures below).
Two bridges on the A 17 and four bridges on the D 8 were identified at a significantly higher price.
These bridges were determined partly by a method for detecting significant deviations within a sample and partly by regression analysis of the correlation between bridge price and size (atypically expensive bridges can be identified based on the distance to the regression curve).
However, the atypically high price of these bridges should only serve as an indication of which bridges to focus on.
In order to draw definitive conclusions, the causes of the respective high price must be determined in individual cases.
This could be due, for example, to inefficient administrative action, but also to environmental protection requirements or other legitimate reasons.
Taking into account the larger average length of Czech concrete bridges compared to German ones (see Table 1), the proven negative correlation between the bridge price and the length indicated that Czech concrete bridges are cheaper.
This was also supported by the lower labour costs in the Czech Republic compared to Germany.
However, the evaluation of the results showed that the price of the concrete bridges on the D 8 is higher than on the A 17.
During joint discussions, two reasons for this situation were identified:
1.
In Germany, construction contracts for bridges are mainly awarded separately.
This also allows medium-sized companies to participate in the award competition.
In the Czech Republic, many bridge constructions are awarded as part of larger contracts for the construction of several kilometres of motorway sections.
Orders of this magnitude cannot be managed by medium-sized companies.
2.
In the Czech Republic, the variety of bridge structures built is greater than in Germany.
In this context, the NK K ä rke noted that the construction of bridges is determined long before construction begins,
Already at the submission of the application for planning approval by the RMD.
At this point, it selects a specific bridge construction variant from several alternatives. However, cost-effectiveness plays a minor role in this decision.
Only a thorough analysis of the construction sectors of both countries would have made it possible to reach a final conclusion with regard to bridge prices in the Czech Republic and Germany. However, this would have gone beyond the scope of this review.
The border bridge is the most expensive steel composite bridge on the D8 and A17.
The prices for the tunnels on the D8 are about twice as high as in Germany.
However, a comparison of the technical parameters between the tunnels on the D 8 and the tunnels in Germany showed no significant difference.
The significant price differences may be the result of underdeveloped competition for tunnels in the Czech Republic.
However, the small number of tunnels did not allow generalizing conclusions.
Efficiency and effectiveness of the Dresden - Prague motorway
The independent Czech Republic was founded in 1993.
In the same year, the government approved the plan for the expansion of the motorway network.
The plan was to gradually expand the D 8 from Prague to the state border with Germany.
Section 0805 was to be built through the Bohemian Central Uplands before section 0807 near the border.
The Czech Republic is financing the D8 under the programme financing.
The programme number 327 220 "Construction of the D 8 Prague motorway - W ä rst ä nstz nad Labem - Czech-German border" defines two objectives:
1.
As a national goal: To improve the connection between Prague and st i nad Labem;
2.
As an international destination: The connection between Prague and Berlin as part of the Pan-European Transport Corridor IV BerlinIstanbul.
The programme envisaged completion of the construction of the section leading through the Bohemian Central Uplands in June 2008 and the construction of the border section 0807 in June 2007.
It should be noted that the end of the construction work is not identical to the time of commissioning.
The NK stated that the planning approval decision had already been issued for the construction of the section leading through the Bohemian Central Uplands.
Environmental associations have sued against this decision.
A final judgment is still pending.
Compared to the schedule provided for in the programme documentation, a delay of several years in the completion of section no. 0805 could not be ruled out.
In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed postponing the completion date of construction phase No. 0805 to 2010.
As a result, the construction of the border section did not meet the national goal of improving the connection between Prague and Usti nad Labem.
The RMD subjected the border-near section no. 0807 of the D 8 and section no. 0805 through the Bohemian Central Uplands to an economic feasibility study between 1999 and 2001.
The investment costs for both sections no. 0805 and no. 0807 were approximately €639 million.
Table 2: Results of the economic feasibility study (EIRR = internal interest rate)
Variant Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D8 sections in 2007.
Traffic volume in the northern part of the border section 18 000 cars per day in 2010.
Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D8 sections in 2007.
Traffic volume in the northern part of the border section 22 000 cars per day in 2010.
Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D8 sections in 2007.
Traffic volume in the northern part of the border section 25 000 cars per day in 2010.
The economic feasibility study from 2001 was based on the assumption that the section near the border and the section leading through the Bohemian Central Uplands will be under traffic at the same time.
At the time of the test, it was obvious that the section through the Bohemian Central Uplands would not be opened on the original date.
This reduces the aforementioned EIRR values.
As of December 31, 2005, the costs of both sections amounted to €897 million excluding VAT, which is 27.4% higher than the 2001 profitability assessment.
In addition, there is a risk that section 0805 will have a different, more complex route, which would affect the profitability of the project.
The economic analysis showed that the construction of both motorway sections is economically justified with a daily traffic volume of at least 18,000 vehicles per day in 2010. The forecast for 2008 had predicted 22,940 vehicles per day.
However, a study on detour routes as an alternative to the missing section through the Bohemian Central Uplands assumes a traffic volume of 12,600 to 13,750 vehicles per day in 2007.
A higher volume of traffic on the routes, which are to replace the missing section with the Bohemian Central Uplands, is likely to result in congestion and thus increased external costs, which were not taken into account in the original economic feasibility study.
The aforementioned reduction in revenue and increase in costs means that the already low EIRR for the construction of the border section of the D8 will not be achieved.
The construction of the section of the D 8 near the border is therefore uneconomical.
There were also cost increases in the construction of the A 17, as in the construction of the two above-mentioned sections of the D 8.
As part of the macroeconomic assessment for the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan 1992, the Federal Ministry responsible for transport assumed investment costs of around €320 million.
This resulted in a benefit / cost ratio of 4.6.
In the meantime, costs have increased to around €670 million and the benefit / cost ratio has been reduced by more than half.
In the years 2003 to 2005, the BRH examined the cost-effectiveness of the planning and construction of the A 17 motorway independently of the parallel tests carried out with the NK K ä mpfer.
He noted that the authority responsible for the permit required an unnecessary landscape tunnel for the third section of the A 17.
During the audit, the BRH succeeded in convincing the Federal Ministry and the road construction administration of the superfluity of the landscape tunnel.
As a result, €10 million in construction costs and €150,000 in annual operating costs were avoided.
When examining the first section of the A 17, the BRH found that the construction project was inadequately prepared.
The following example illustrates this:
During the planning phase, the road construction administration did not record the condition of the rock on the surface of the D ö lzschen wall, as it was difficult to access.
Only when the tunnelling reached the wall did it catch up.
It turned out that the rock was more weathered than assumed in the tender.
Elaborate measures such as anchorages, injections and rockfall protection nets for around €3.3 million were necessary.
The road construction administration not only bore the costs for additional services that were already required, such as securing the D ö lzschener Wand, but also for those that would not have been necessary if the construction preparation had been flawless.
These include expenses due to disrupted construction processes (€3.2 million), additional training of the tunnelling team (€0.5 million) and increased wages and material prices due to the construction time extension (€7 million).
This additional expenditure of around €10.7 million is not offset by any permanent added value.
The BRH took this and other measures as an opportunity to call on the Federal Ministry to better exercise its specialist supervision of major road construction measures.
In this context, it should insist that the road construction authorities introduce quality assurance systems.
Advantages of the cooperation for BRH and NK ä rzte The cooperation met the expectations of both auditors.
The BRH received insights into the planning, procurement and implementation of the construction of the border bridge.
Both audit institutions developed a database on bridge and tunnel prices, which will be helpful for future audits.
The NK found that the most important structural parameters for bridges, tunnels and roadways of the D 8 are no different from those of the A 17.
The auditors of both audit institutions involved in the cooperation gained valuable experience that will be useful in future audits.
Report on the results of the parallel audit of the VAT administration of the Czech Republic and Germany
Preface
The Lima Declaration, adopted in 1977, emphasises that the courts of auditors have the power to audit all public finances.
The declaration requires the courts of auditors to have the power to audit tax collection as much as possible.
The Organisation of European Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers taxes to be an important part of public revenue.
The thematic focus of the 6th EUROSAI Congress, which took place in Bonn in 2005, was the audit of public revenues by the courts of auditors.
One of the most important steps towards optimising the audit activities of a Court of Auditors is the development of a special strategy for auditing public revenues.
This is especially true for taxes as the largest source of public revenue with a high risk of default.
As national economies become increasingly interconnected and interdependent, a situation may arise in which national audit institutions can only carry out their audit work in cooperation with the audit institutions of other states.
As an example, the audit of internationally organized fraud can be considered, which can lead to significant revenue losses in many states.
Cooperation between the authorities is needed to combat such crimes.
Auditors in this area must be prepared to cooperate closely with each other.
The idea for an audit of VAT and the MIAS system arose at the 6th EUROSAI Congress in Bonn. This audit was carried out in cooperation between the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Court of Auditors.
In the course of thorough preparation, the participating audit institutions first had to familiarise themselves with the legal framework and procedures of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.
Based on the evaluation of the available information, we selected the test subjects for the examination planning.
Achieving efficient and effective management of VAT is a long-standing problem and individual states (especially the EC Member States) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify the collection of VAT and create greater transparency in this area.
We are convinced that the results of our audit can not only help to improve the work of the financial administration, but also form the basis for a proposal for an improved system of international exchange of information.
Report on the results of the parallel audit of the VAT administration of the Czech Republic and Germany
Introduction
Reference number: CZ) 06 / 27 (DE) VIII 2 - 2005 - 1215
Subject of examination:
(CZ) VAT administration after the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union
(De) Examination of administrative cooperation in the field of VAT in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and 1925 / 2004
The Commission's audit objective:
(CZ) The purpose of the audit in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedures applied by the financial administration in the area of VAT following the integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter referred to as the "EC") with free movement of goods and services and the use of MIAS1, in particular the control of the use of the VAT exemption for intra-Community supplies.
(De) The aim of the audit was to examine the system of intra-Community VAT control with a focus on mutual assistance in the area of VAT in accordance with the above-mentioned regulations.
As a result of the audit, weaknesses should be identified and recommendations should be made to remedy them.
VAT information exchange system The audits were carried out jointly by the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic ("NK K K ä ufte") and the Federal Court of Auditors ("BRH") of the Federal Republic of Germany on the basis of an agreement concluded on 8 June 2006.
The cooperation focused on the review of selected business transactions between entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the utilization of information obtained through international administrative assistance between the tax administrations and the comparison of the VAT administration systems in the two states.
A joint final report on the results of the audits was prepared in accordance with European Guideline No. 31 for the implementation of the INTOSAI audit standards.
The audited period covered the period from May 1, 2004 to December 31, 2005.
Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel examination
The parallel audit of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two auditors.
In addition to the focus on the exchange of information under Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 and 1925 / 2004 of the Commission, other closely related aspects were also examined, such as the registration of tax receipts, tax returns and summary reports.
The audit also covered the legal situation for cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach and the comparison of statistical data.
When comparing the systems of VAT administrations in the two states, differences were found in the following areas:
1) Registration for VAT purposes.
While in Germany, entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, among others, the essential criterion for registration is the exceeding of the turnover threshold specified in the VAT Act.
In the Czech Republic, tax authorities only receive a single tax identification number, which they also use for intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, the tax payer receives a tax number valid only for domestic transactions for the purposes of VAT.
If the German tax authorities want to make significant intra-Community transactions, they must apply for a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID number.
As problems arise from the different registration procedures, the rules within the EC should be standardised (see 4.1).
2) Cross-border passenger transport by bus.
In the Czech Republic, cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach is exempt from VAT, but there is a right to deduct input tax.
In Germany, the transport service, as far as the route runs through Germany, is subject to VAT.
Efforts should be made at EC level to unify the situation in accordance with Article 393 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common VAT system (see 4.2).
3) Tax returns.
While in the Czech Republic the tax authorities only have to file valid VAT returns for tax periods during the year (month or quarter), tax authorities in Germany (monthly or quarterly)
VAT pre-registrations and filing a VAT return after the end of the calendar year.
In contrast to the Czech Republic, tax authorities in Germany have to submit the VAT pre-declarations electronically.
The introduction of electronic VAT returns in the Czech Republic would improve the efficiency of the Czech tax administration (see 4.3).
4) Summary messages.
While the tax authorities in the Czech Republic have to submit their summary reports to the tax authorities (F Ä), German tax authorities have to submit the summary reports to the CLO2.
Accordingly, the information from the summary reports will be available to the F Ä in the Czech Republic as soon as they are submitted.
The information from the summary reports will only be available to German F Ä after processing by the CLO.
To combat VAT fraud, updated information on intra-Community transactions is needed as soon as possible.
The monthly submission of summary reports would shorten the period between the time of sales and the update of MIAS data.
This would allow a timely assessment of taxation in the acquirer's Member State (see 4.4), but only if all EC Member States introduce the same deadlines.
5) International exchange of information on VAT.
When requests for information are received, the Czech CLO monitors compliance with the three-month deadline.
The German CLO does not monitor processing times.
As a result, the German financial administration completed a significantly lower percentage of requests for information within the specified period.
Because of these problems, the BRH has recommended that the German CLO constantly monitor the deadlines (see 4.6).
6) Risk management.
Each of the two Member States is developing its own risk management system (RMS) with corresponding strengths and weaknesses.
The NKK and BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by one Member State alone.
Successful criteria, elements or approaches of an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in all EC Member States. Otherwise, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5).
As part of the cooperation, the two courts examined selected cases of intra-Community transactions between Czech and German tax entities.
Of these, 31 cases were jointly reviewed using the legal possibilities of the CLO, in which there were doubts about the correct taxation or the suspicion of VAT fraud.
The Court of Auditors found that:
In some cases, the F Ä used the information gained in the international exchange of information and reassessed the VAT liability of the relevant tax authorities.
In these cases, the tax authorities either unlawfully claimed the VAT exemption or did not report the purchase of goods in their VAT return.
In some cases, the F Ä could not use the information obtained in the exchange of information because it was incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be used due to different legal requirements in the two Member States.
In some cases, the financial administration of another Member State refused to provide the requested information.
A number of cases were uncovered in which tax inspectors incorrectly reported sales in their summary reports.
As a result, the data in MIAS were correspondingly incorrect, so that the clerks (the F Ä) had to investigate in these cases (see 6).
Examination procedure
Examination procedure in the Czech Republic
The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by Department II - "State Budget Revenue" and the Territorial Audit Departments of Central Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.
The audited bodies were: The Ministry of Finance and the 10 F Ä Humpolec, Jihlava, Kadal ä n, Liberec, Nymburk, Otrokovice, Prague 1, Prague 4, Sokolov and Th ä u inec.
The college of the NK K ä rke approved the audit findings on April 23, 2007.
Examination procedures in Germany
The audit was carried out between July 2006 and February 2007 by the audit area traffic taxes and employees of the associated P Ä B Berlin, Frankfurt / Main and Munich.
It was part of the work plan for 2006 and was therefore announced to the Federal Ministry of Finance in 2006.
After a test phase, the actual test began in the fourth quarter of 2006.
In accordance with the cases selected by the BRH and later by the NK authorities, the BRH had to announce the examination to several federal states.
Apart from interviews in the BMF and the CLO, the examination was conducted in the following federal states:
Baden-Wuerttemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.
Tax files from the following departments were included in the audit:
Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, M ü hlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, F ü rstenfeldbruck, Munich corporations, Munich II, IV and Munich V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-Nord and Hamburg for large companies, Hanover-Nord, Winsen-Luhe, Bonn-Innenstadt, K ö ln-Mitte, K ö ln-Porz, K ö ln-S ü d, Sankt Augustin, Pirmasens, Bautzen, Chemnitz-S ü d, Dresden II, Freischopau and Leipzig.
Discussions were also held with the F Ä Augsburg-Stadt, Aurich, D ü sseldorf-Altstadt, Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.
The test results were communicated to the BMF in May 2007.
Cooperation between the two auditors
Prior to the parallel audit, several meetings of representatives of both audit institutions took place.
The participants in these meetings familiarized themselves with the organization of the tax administration, the VAT legislation and the VAT administration system in the other country.
The subject of the test phase was agreed at the meeting in May 2006.
The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.
At this meeting, a timetable for the further procedure was developed and the following examination topics for the parallel examinations were determined: 1.
Registration of tax authorities.
2.
International passenger transport by bus - legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.
3. International exchange of information, in particular the approach of tax officials in processing requests for information and reviewing selected problem cases mentioned in the requests for information, as well as spontaneous information between the Czech Republic and Germany.
4. Tax returns.
5.
Summary messages.
6.

An entrepreneur with legal domicile, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic whose turnover exceeds the amount of CZK 1,000,000 in the last 12 consecutive calendar months will be liable for payment on the first day of the third month after the month in which he has exceeded the threshold (apply 94 (1) of Act No. 235 / 2004 Coll., concerning VAT; hereinafter "Act No. 235 / 2004").
The person concerned must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he has exceeded the registration threshold.
The current legislation does not allow the retroactive registration of a tax liability if it has exceeded the application deadline for registration.
An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic, who provides VAT services or services exempt from VAT with the right to deduct VAT, must register for VAT even if his turnover does not exceed CZK 1 million, but he meets other requirements specified in Act No. 235 / 2004.
An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic who does not meet any of the requirements specified in the law can voluntarily apply for registration for VAT.
The registration procedure in accordance with Law No. 337 / 1992 begins with the receipt of the registration application by the local tax officer.
If you want to register voluntarily for VAT, you must specify in your application the deadline from which you apply for registration as a VAT package.
The tax officer must check the information provided by the entrepreneur, i.e. the completed application for registration with all attachments.
If he has doubts about the information provided therein, he must ask the applicant to explain, supplement or substantiate the information provided.
If the tax official has verified that the entrepreneur meets the requirements for registration, he must issue a written notification about the registration and the allocation of a tax number.
In the notification, the tax officer must indicate the date of entry into force of the registration for VAT and the assessment period for VAT.
The assessment period is the calendar quarter, unless the turnover of the entrepreneur for the previous calendar year has reached at least CZK 10,000,000.
If this is the case, the assessment period is the calendar month.
An entrepreneur whose turnover has reached at least CZK 2,000,000 in the previous calendar year is entitled to choose the calendar month as the assessment period and must inform the tax officer of this change.
The issuance of a tax number in the registration notice is always constitutive.
The tax payer must indicate the tax number in all communications (including payments) with the tax officer, as well as in cases where a special law requires this (e.g. Act No. 235 / 2004, concerning the issuance of tax documents) 3.
The tax number contains the coding "CZ" and a basic component in the form of a general identification sign.
In the case of natural persons, this is the number of the birth certificate or another general identification mark, insofar as this is determined by a special law. In the case of legal persons, the general identification mark is the company identification number (in accordance with the provisions in section 33 (12) of Law No. 337 / 1992).
If the entrepreneur has not fulfilled his obligations despite the corresponding request by the tax officer, the local tax officer must register him ex officio.
This will also be communicated to the tax authorities.
In the Czech Republic, every entrepreneur registered for a business activity receives a tax number for any type of tax on his first registration.
This also applies to registration as a VAT payer.
According to Law No. 235 / 2004, which entered into force on January 1, 2005, in the event of non-compliance with the VAT law, the tax officer may not require the tax payer to register up to 10% of the proceeds from the tax payable turnover, which the person concerned has unlawfully made without taxation, for the period from the date on which the entrepreneur should have been registered as a tax payer, until the date on which the registration as a tax payer was made by order of the tax officer (Law No. 235 / 2004).
The payment of the amount fixed in this way is considered a tax payment within the meaning of Act No. 235 / 2004, i.e. it is not a fine or penalty.
If the legal requirements are met, the registration of a VAT beneficiary can be deleted for two reasons:
1)
Cancellation of the registration at the request of the tax authorities, i.e. mainly for the reason that the turnover does not reach the threshold for registration (registration 106 (1) of Law No. 235 / 2004).
A tax beneficiary may request the cancellation of his registration at the earliest one year after the date of entry into force specified in the registration notice.
2) Cancellation of the registration ex officio (106 (7) of Law No. 235 / 2004) if: A) the tax authorities did not provide any services for a period of 12 consecutive months and did not inform the tax officer of the reasons for this, b) the tax authorities did not fulfil their obligations under Law No. 235 / 2004, c) the previous tax authorities did not meet the requirements for tax payments.
B) Tax resident without legal domicile, place of business or business premises in the Czech Republic A person who is registered for tax purposes in another Member State and does not have his legal domicile, place of business or place of business in the Czech Republic or a tax resident foreigner who provides services in the Czech Republic and has to file a tax return and pay taxes for these services or deliveries in accordance with Act No. 235 / 2004 ("non-resident entrepreneur") becomes tax resident with the provision of the relevant service.
He must submit an application for registration with FA Prague 1 no later than the day of the delivery in question.
He is obliged to indicate in this application all VAT IDs assigned to him in other Member States or third countries.
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration later than on the day of the first tax-exempt service provision in the Czech Republic, the FA Prague 1 has to register him retroactively, as he became void on the day of the first tax-exempt service provision in the Czech Republic according to Law No. 235 / 2004.
In the case of retroactive registration, the FA Prague 1 must require the entrepreneurs concerned to provide proof of performance (invoices or written explanations).
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration in the Czech Republic before performing a service for the first time, the FA Prague 1 has to request the submission of the performance-based contract documents.
As of December 31, 2004, 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered with FA Prague 1, 124 of them from Germany. As of December 31, 2005, a total of 951 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered, 233 of them from Germany.
In accordance with the provisions of Section 106 (9) of Law No. 235 / 2004, the tax officer is entitled to cancel the registration of a non-resident entrepreneur as of January 31 of the following calendar year if the latter does not accept the obligation to file tax declarations or declarations and to pay tax.
During the examination of the NKK, it turned out that in the case of filing a tax return by post with dispatch abroad on 25 January, i.e. according to the mandatory deadline for filing a tax return, this declaration has not yet been received by the FA until 31 January.
In cases where these facts, which are decisive for the possibility of cancellation of the registration, become known to the FA later than 31 January, it is no longer possible to delete the registration of the non-resident entrepreneur for VAT in the Czech Republic in the calendar year in question.
Registration of tax authorities in Germany
In accordance with the provisions of the tax code 137, 138 AO, each business must be registered with the municipality and / or the responsible tax office.
This registration must be made no later than one month after the start of business.
The municipality forwards the registration to the tax authorities.
If the responsible tax office determines that a business activity has started but has not been registered, it can also register the tax beneficiary ex officio retroactively.
Tax authorities in Germany, regardless of whether they are resident or non-resident, are required to register for Zwekke VAT if they meet the requirements set out in Title 2 of the German VAT Act (VAT).
This does not depend on the amount of revenue generated.
There is no voluntary registration in Germany.
Special F Ä are responsible for entrepreneurs based abroad.
For example, the FA ChemnitzS ü d is responsible for entrepreneurs based in the Czech Republic.
As of April 30, 2004, a total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered; as of March 1, 2006, 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered there.
According to the findings of the BRH, these F Ä with special responsibilities often refused to register so-called pseudo-self-employed persons residing in the new Central or Eastern European Member States of the EC.
Since the free movement of workers is still restricted after the accession of these ten countries to the EC, these self-employed tried to circumvent these restrictions by setting up their own business.
These (fictitious) self-employed persons do not meet the requirements for recognition as entrepreneurs set out in section 2 of the UStG, as they are usually dependent on a single client who determines their working hours and the type of work they do.
In order to be registered, the entrepreneur must complete a questionnaire from the competent FA and provide information about the company and the business activity carried out.
The questionnaire is a binding form for all FE in Germany.
It is handled either in special organisational units within the F Ä or in the organisational units generally responsible for tax assessment.
With the help of this form, a risk assessment for the individual tax payer is carried out before the allocation of a tax number.
The structure of the tax number for domestic transactions is based on certain requirements:
The first three digits are the identification number for the responsible FA, the following three (or four) digits indicate which department is responsible within the FA, the following five (or four) digits are the identification feature for the tax payer, the last digit is always a check digit.
If an entrepreneur wants to participate in intra-Community trade, he needs a VAT ID no.
This is allocated by the CLO on request if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany for VAT purposes.
The VAT ID number is automatically assigned by the CLO if the tax authorities declare intra-Community deliveries in their VAT pre-declarations or in their annual VAT declaration.
The VAT number consists of the country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.
The registration of an entrepreneur can be deleted: 1. On request (e.g. if he stops doing business), but only after all tax transactions have been processed (assessment of all financial years) or 2. If the financial administration determines that he no longer does business.
As a rule, the validity of the VAT number depends on the validity of the VAT number.
In these cases, the F Ä must inform the CLO of the deletion of the VAT number, so that the validity of the VAT number can be terminated at this time.
According to the Value Added Tax Act (VAT Act 19 (1)), domestic tax authorities do not have to pay VAT in the following cases: 1. The turnover of the previous calendar year plus the VAT incurred on it has not exceeded the amount of €17,500 and 2. Will probably not exceed the amount of €50,000 in the following year.
The so-called small entrepreneurs are not entitled to charge other entrepreneurs VAT, nor to deduct VAT.
Although they do not have to pay VAT, small business owners are obliged to register with the tax office and file an annual VAT return.
A small entrepreneur can declare the non-application of UStG 19 (1).
This declaration is binding for the next five years.
He can then invoice the VAT and deduct the input tax.
Non-resident tax authorities can appoint a fiscal representative (22a VAT).
The prerequisite for this is that they only make tax-free transactions and do not deduct input tax.
The fiscal representative fulfils the tax obligations of the foreign entrepreneur, so that he does not have to register for VAT purposes.
The invoices must indicate that a fiscal representative has been appointed.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation in the two states is different.
While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the first prerequisite for registration (among others) is exceeding the threshold amount specified in the VAT Act.
If an entrepreneur does not exceed this threshold, he can register voluntarily.
The registration procedure in Germany is standardized, but differences can occur due to different organizational structures in the individual federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the tax resident receives a tax number for any tax at the time of his first registration.
In the case of its registration for VAT, this tax number also applies to intra-community transactions.
In Germany, an entrepreneur who registers for VAT purposes receives a tax number exclusively for intra-German transactions.
If the German entrepreneur wants to carry out intra-community transactions, he must specifically apply for the allocation of a VAT ID number.
Both the NK and BRH noted that the German two-tier registration system in other Member States, such as the Czech Republic, which allocates a single identification number for both national VAT registration and intra-Community transactions, can lead to considerable misunderstandings.
On the other hand, the two-tier system allows for retroactive (national registration) in cases where the taxpayer does not register his business with the municipality or the competent FA.
This retroactive registration enables an accurate assessment of VAT for previous assessment periods, in particular an accurate estimate of the VAT liability.
As the different registration procedures lead to problems, the rules should be standardised for the whole EC.
The German parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number.
This is to be allocated by the Federal Central Tax Office to every natural person after birth.
This number is valid for life for natural persons resident in Germany.
If a natural person starts a business, the responsible FA applies for a commercial tax identification number, which serves as a VAT ID number.
In the future, there should therefore be no delay between the national registration of a tax liability and the allocation of the VAT ID number.
Work on the implementation of an IT procedure for the management of numbers has not yet been completed.
International passenger transport by bus and coach
The legal regulations in the Czech Republic
Since 1 May 2004, the carriage of passengers between the individual Member States and between the Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic has been exempt from VAT and is entitled to deduct input tax in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 235 / 2004.
The exemption from VAT also applies if the transport is carried out by persons who are registered as tax beneficiaries in other Member States or by foreigners who are tax beneficiaries in Germany.
The return journey is considered a separate transport process.
If non-resident entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic do not carry out any economic activity other than the cross-border transport of passengers by bus and coach, they are not obliged to register as VAT exempt in the Czech Republic.
Cross-border passenger transport in the Czech Republic has not been exempted from VAT due to the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic Annex V, Chapter 5 (1) (b).
For the purpose of applying Article 28 (3) (b) of Directive 77 / 388 / EEC, the Czech Republic may maintain the tax exemption for cross-border passenger transport either until the condition of Article 28 (4) of the Directive is met or until the same tax exemption is applied by any of the current Member States.
The legal regulations in Germany
In accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006, as implemented in Germany by Act 3b (1) of the VAT Act, a transport service is carried out where the transport is effected.
Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and international passenger transport.
Only the domestic part of the transport service is tax-exempt in Germany.
German taxation also does not distinguish between resident and non-resident (bus) entrepreneurs.
If a non-resident taxpayer transports important persons through Germany, the part of the transport attributable to Germany is considered taxable.
Before providing its services in Germany, the non-resident entrepreneur must notify the competent FA of his intention to provide passenger transport services.
This registers it for tax purposes (compare 4.1.2) and issues a special certificate for each bus and coach mentioned in the registration of the tax liability.
The entrepreneur must state his tax-exempt transport services in a German VAT return.
As of 1 March 2006, 741 Czech bus operators were registered with the FA Chemnitz-S ü d.
If the transport service is provided for a domestically based entrepreneur, the non-resident taxpayer does not have to pay the VAT to the FA himself.
In its place, the domestic customer of the services has to pay VAT to the tax office and the net amount invoiced to the non-resident tax payer. This process is referred to as "shifting tax liability" and is in accordance with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC.
In addition to the registration by a non-resident tax resident and his income tax return, the German tax administration has several means of verifying the correctness of the tax return with regard to taxable passenger transport:
Mobile customs control groups check the certificates of buses registered abroad, which are used for passenger transport through Germany.
After each test, the mobile control groups submit an inspection protocol to the competent FA.
If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group can require the bus driver to pay VAT before continuing his journey.
The non-resident tax payer can deduct the VAT paid in this way from the tax liability stated in his VAT return.
If the FA has doubts about the correctness of a VAT return, it can order an audit to be carried out in the FA, or it can use the means of mutual assistance referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 (see point 4.6).
Even if the foreign taxpayer refuses to pay the legally established VAT, the FA may request mutual assistance in accordance with Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC.
The BRH does not consider these means of administrative assistance in tax matters to be too costly in relation to the low revenue from VAT on taxable passenger transport.
In particular, the audit of the books of a non-resident tax auditor causes disproportionately high costs for the tax auditor himself and for the financial administration.
The latter must check the foreign books, which requires knowledge not only of the foreign language, but also of foreign accounting principles.
Accordingly, a higher time expenditure is to be expected for such an examination than for a resident tax payer, although the examination is limited to the passenger transport taking place in Germany.
On the other hand, the non-resident taxpayer must accept not only the audit rights of his national financial administration, but also those of the other Member States, insofar as he carries out passenger transport there.
In addition, for each Member State in which even a single passenger transport is carried out, the taxpayer must comply with all existing tax regulations in the various languages and on the basis of the forms of the financial administrations of the EC Member States concerned.
This means that the correct taxation of cross-border passenger transport services leads to a disproportionate administrative burden.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation is different in the two states.
In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between different EC Member States and between Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT under the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the transport service is subject to VAT according to the transport route on German territory.
If a non-resident taxpayer provides such a transport service for the first time, he must notify the competent FA beforehand.
This registers the tax payer, who must declare the tax payer's share of the transport service in a tax return in Germany.
Law enforcement in Germany is very time-consuming.
At least three out of four Czech tax authorities registered with the FA Chemnitz-S ü d have passenger transport as a business purpose.
The tax revenue in question is quite low in relation to the administrative burden.
The Member States - which collect VAT in accordance with Article 46 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006 on the common VAT system - have a high administrative burden in relation to the relevant tax revenue.
In order to avoid the disproportionate costs of the VAT assessment, cross-border passenger transport should only be subject to tax in one Member State.
This could be the state where the transport begins or where the service provider is located.
Such a form of taxation would require an amendment to Council Directive 2006 / 112 / EC of 28 November 2006.
VAT returns
Filing and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic
Unless the law stipulates otherwise, the entrepreneur is obliged to file a VAT return on the form provided by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days of the end of the tax period, even if no tax liability has arisen.
The tax liability arises at the end of the deadline for submitting the VAT return. The VAT on the import of goods is excluded from this regulation in accordance with Act No. 235 / 2004. The due date of the tax is determined according to customs regulations.
If there is an above-average deductible input tax claim as a result, this amount will be refunded to the taxpayer within 30 days of the determination of this input tax deduction, without the need for an application.
The time limit is not applied in cases where the tax official initiates a tax procedure with regard to the tax liability of the tax payer.
According to Act No. 235 / 2004 73 (11), the right to deduct input tax can be asserted at the latest with the regular tax return for the last tax period of the calendar year in which the right to deduct input tax arose.
After this period, the deduction of input tax can still be claimed within three years of the end of the tax period in which the claim would have been possible for the first time.
However, this requires the submission of a supplementary VAT return.
An amendment to Act No. 235 / 2004, which came into force on 1 January 2005, allows the filing of a supplementary VAT return only for the period in which the right to deduct input tax could have been asserted for the first time.
A tax payer must file a supplementary VAT return if: A) the sum of the corrections leads to an increase in the tax liability, b) he makes corrections that do not change the last known tax liability, but only change previous information, c) he makes corrections to the VAT rate and tax liability in accordance with Act No. 235 / 2004.
A tax beneficiary can file a supplementary VAT return if the sum of the corrections reduces the tax liability.
The tax beneficiary must file the supplementary tax return by the end of the month following the month in which the relevant facts were established.
The VAT return can be submitted electronically either via the Internet or via data carrier.
Delivery via the Internet can be made with or without a certified electronic signature.
If it is done without an electronic signature, it must also be submitted on a data carrier.
The form for the VAT return contains separate lines indicating the value of intra-Community deliveries and acquisitions.
The value of services purchased must be stated in separate lines of the VAT return.
Some headings are used for automated primary controls under the atis system.
The value of goods delivered to persons registered as tax exempt in other EC Member States is compared with the data provided by the Czech tax authorities in their summary reports.
The value of purchases of goods from other Member States from persons registered as tax exempt there is compared with the information in the summary reports of tax exempt persons from other EC Member States with the help of MIAS.
Within the framework of the ATIS system, the credibility of VAT returns is checked by the FA.
This is done automatically, as the VAT return cannot be processed without the prior review.
The credibility check includes a calculation of the standards for credibility and an assessment of the risks of VAT returns.
In accordance with the provisions of section 37 (1) of Law No. 337 / 1992, the FA can repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 million on persons who fail to comply with their non-monetary obligations under this or a special tax law or a decision under this law.
Automated tax information system - Automated tax information system used by the Czech tax authorities to provide technical support for tax collection.
During its examination, the NK K found that the F Ä rarely made use of the possibility of imposing a fine on the relevant tax beneficiary if the VAT return was not filed.
Filing and processing of VAT returns in Germany
In Germany, a distinction is made between monthly or quarterly VAT declarations and the annual VAT return.
Those taxpayers who are obliged to file VAT pre-declarations must still file an annual VAT return.
Even small entrepreneurs who are not obliged to pay VAT must file an annual VAT return.
The tax beneficiaries are generally obliged to submit a VAT pre-registration by the 10th day after the end of the calendar quarter in which the VAT is incurred (conclusion 18 (2) VAT).
However, if the VAT liability in the previous year was more than €6,136 or if it is a newly founded company, the entrepreneur is obliged to file monthly VAT pre-registrations no later than the 10th day after the end of the month in question.
The tax beneficiary can also opt for the submission of monthly VAT pre-registrations if he has received a refund of €6,136 in the previous year (beneficiary 18 (2a) VAT).
If the annual value added tax has not amounted to more than €512, neither VAT pre-registrations nor VAT returns must be submitted.
A resulting VAT liability is payable 10 days after the end of the tax period.
A refund can lead to a more thorough audit by the financial administration.
There are no (statutory) deadlines for the processing of VAT returns and for the refund of VAT overpayments.
In order to receive a timely refund, a security can be offered for the refund amount.
In principle, VAT returns, including refund cases, must be processed quickly.
The German VAT Act allows an extension of these (surrender or payment) deadlines (except 18 (6) VAT).
The extension must be requested separately.
If it is granted, the VAT pre-registration and the corresponding payments may be made one month later. In the case of monthly notifications, however, a special advance payment must be made.
This payment will be offset against the VAT liability established for the pre-registration period of December.
If an error is discovered, the entrepreneur must submit a corrected VAT declaration.
There is no "supplementary" VAT return.
Once the VAT return to be submitted to the tax office by 31 May of the following year, the entrepreneur can no longer correct an incorrect VAT declaration, but only the incorrect annual VAT return.
Corrections to this VAT return to the advantage or disadvantage of the tax payer are possible within four years of the end of the year in which the first VAT return was filed.
After this four-year period, a VAT return can usually only be corrected in cases of a frivolous tax reduction or tax evasion.
The tax authorities must submit the VAT pre-declarations electronically.
The F Ä can grant exceptions to this rule in order to avoid unreasonable hardship.
The annual VAT return can be submitted on paper or via the Internet with or without certification.
If the submission is made without certification, the tax payer must also submit the declaration on paper and with his personal signature.
If no prior VAT declarations or declarations are submitted, the tax administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the revenue generated by the tax package 6.
In the event of late submission, a late surcharge can be imposed on the taxpayer (up to 10% of the tax liability or up to an amount of €25,000).
In an earlier examination, the BRH found that the F Ä often do not charge this late surcharge.
In cases where the F Ä levied the late payment surcharges, the amount was fixed inconsistently and arbitrarily.
The delay surcharge therefore misses its purpose of reducing the average delay, especially when filing the annual VAT return.
The form of the VAT return contains separate lines for value information on intra-community deliveries or purchases.
There are also separate lines for the purchase of services.
Non-taxable transactions must be stated in a separate line of the VAT return.
The VAT returns submitted on paper must either be scanned or electronically recorded by specially designated personnel.
The data of electronically submitted tax returns is immediately available to the tax administration.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
After all data is electronically recorded, they are subjected to a risk management procedure and a case selection is made on the basis of certain standards.
The VAT returns selected in this way must be checked by the responsible clerk on the basis of the automatically created test notes (see 5.2).
Although the tax administration only has to make a rough estimate of the VAT liability, it still has to be as accurate as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, tax authorities must submit their VAT returns no later than 25 days after the end of the tax period.
Depending on the turnover of the tax payer, the tax period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
Depending on the amount of their tax liability in the previous year, the tax authorities in Germany have to submit their advance declarations no later than 10 days after the end of the calendar quarter or month.
The annual VAT return must be submitted no later than May 31 of the following year.
There are some advantages and disadvantages of not filing an annual VAT return:
+ After the end of the calendar year, the tax auditor can correct the errors in the monthly pre-registration by submitting a single VAT return;
If the tax authorities correct their information on intra-Community transactions, the correction cannot be attributed to a specific reporting period of the ZM;
The L ä nder do not compare MIAS data on intra-Community acquisitions of German tax authorities until the annual VAT returns have usually been processed.
According to the registration (see 4.1.3), German entrepreneurs must file a VAT return regardless of the amount of their turnover.
This levy does not enable the German tax administration to check compliance with the sales ceiling for small entrepreneurs.
In addition, the competent FA can compare the annual VAT return with the corresponding declarations for direct taxes and with the annual financial statements of the company in question.
In the Czech Republic, the tax authorities can only check the amount of turnover on the basis of the income tax return.
In contrast to the current regulations in the Czech Republic, German tax authorities are required to submit the VAT declaration electronically.
The introduction of the electronic filing of tax returns in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech tax administration.
Summary messages
Submission and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic
In accordance with the provisions of Article 102 of Law No. 235 / 2004, an entrepreneur who delivers goods to a person registered for tax purposes in another Member State must submit summary reports (hereinafter referred to as "ZM").
The value of the delivered goods is always stated in the ZM in Czech currency, broken down according to the VAT number 7, the individual tax code under which they are registered in the other Member State.
Information on services is not provided in the ZM.
The tax authorities with a calendar monthly or quarterly tax period must submit the ZM to the locally responsible FA no later than the 25th day after the end of each quarter.
Incorrect data must be corrected in a corrective ZM within 15 days of the discovery of the error.
Incorrect data in the ZM are always replaced by data from the correction ZM.
Similar to the tax returns, the tax authorities can also file the ZM electronically.
If a tax officer does not surrender a ZM or a corrective ZM, even though he is obliged to do so under Act No. 235 / 2004, the tax officer must ask him to surrender the relevant ZM and point out the consequences of the non-surrender. In the event of non-compliance with non-monetary obligations, the tax officer is entitled to impose repeated fines of up to CZK 2 million in accordance with Act No. 337 / 1992.
During its examination, the NK K found that the F Ä mostly did not use their power to impose fines on their defaulting tax beneficiaries.
In particular, when submitting the ZM, the tax authorities are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their obligations, since the omitted submission of a ZM does not affect the amount of their VAT liability.
In accordance with Act No. 235 / 2004 102 (5), the tax officer is obliged to check the information in the ZM or corrective ZM, to remove all ambiguities and to use the information to determine the tax liability.
In case of disagreement
8 of the information in the ZM with which The tax authorities correct incorrect information in the ZM by submitting a corrective ZM either on their own initiative or upon request.
The tax official must correct the data on the delivery of goods to other Member States in the ATIS system if:
The tax authority does not prove the correctness of the information reported in the ZM (or correction ZM) and therefore corrects it by submitting a correction ZM,
The tax official has proven the inaccuracy of the information reported by the taxpayer in the ZM or correction ZM.
Corrections entered by the tax official, without a corrective ZM being submitted by the tax authority, do not replace the corrective ZM, but only lead to the correction of the data in the MIAS, so that they are current, complete and accurate.
The data from the CM will be forwarded to the Member States concerned.
Only the national tax authority designated for cooperation with the other Member States in the field of VAT may transmit and receive this data.
This is the CLO (in the Czech Republic, this function is performed by the Department of International Administrative Assistance in the field of VAT at the Ministry of Finance). The CLO automatically receives the message "O _ MCTL" from the other Member States.
It contains all incorrect VAT ID numbers specified in the transmitted ZM lines.
If the incorrect VAT number is used in some of the transmitted lines of the ZM or the corrected ZM, an entry is made in the list of the incorrect VAT number.
The list contains a "message about doubts regarding VAT ID number".
The tax officer checks the data and enters the result of the check into the system.
When purchasing goods from another Member State, the taxpayer must state this in his VAT return and enter the value of the purchase in the lines of the VAT return designated for this purpose.
Selected cases of differences between the values of the purchases made by the Czech tax authorities stated in their VAT return and the values specified by the supplier from the other Member State in their ZM for the delivery of goods will be forwarded by the CLO to the competent FA for examination.
The clerks there must investigate the deviations.
Three different situations can occur:
A) The value stated by the Czech purchaser in the relevant headings of his VAT return is lower than the value of the deliveries indicated by suppliers from other EC Member States.
In this case, the tax officer checks the accuracy of the information.
B) The difference is zero.
This situation can result either from a change in the information within the EC (the foreign supplier corrects its ZM) or from a change in the information in the VAT return (the Czech tax authority meanwhile submits a supplementary VAT return on its own initiative).
In this case, it is at the discretion of the tax officer to verify the accuracy of the information in the VAT return.
C) The value of goods purchased from other Member States, which the Czech tax authorities have indicated in their VAT returns, is higher than the value of their goods deliveries reported by suppliers in other EC Member States.
Here again, it is at the discretion of the tax official to verify the accuracy of the information.
After reviewing the differences and clarifying the reasons for their occurrence, the tax officer enters the results of his review in ATIS.
These results are forwarded to the CLO.
The number of transactions submitted by the CLO for review is shown in Figure 1 for the individual quarters of 2005 (source: Czech Ministry of Finance).
Graph 1 above shows that the number of cases reported by the CLO to the FEA for the individual quarters of 2005 has decreased.
The significant reduction in the number in the fourth quarter of 2005 is partly due to the fact that the Czech CLO has raised the threshold for case selection, taking into account the minimum amount limit for a request for information to the other EC member states.
Discrepancies between the information in the VAT returns and the data from the EC do not always have to be based on an error by the domestic buyer.
There may also be an error on the part of the taxpayer in another Member State or an error caused by the fact that certain types of deliveries are indicated differently in the CM in the different EC Member States.
The most frequent reasons for deviations in the value of reported business transactions found in the audited F Ä can be seen in Table 1.
Submission and processing of summary reports in Germany
Entrepreneurs who make intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EC Member States or participate in triangular transactions must surrender ZM on a quarterly basis, in which intra-Community deliveries are listed according to purchasers.
The ZM must be submitted no later than the 10th day of the month following the calendar quarter in question.
If a permanent extension is granted for the submission of the VAT pre-registration, this also applies to the ZM.
The ZM must be handed over to the CLO.
Since 1 January 2007, the electronic levy has been mandatory.
The competent FA can allow exceptions for individual tax obligations in order to avoid unfair hardship.
If the taxpayer determines that the ZM was faulty, he is obliged to submit a corrective ZM within one month.
If the ZM is not surrendered, the CLO initiates enforcement proceedings.
This includes the following steps: - first reminder - second reminder, coupled with the threat that a penalty will be set and - fixing the penalty.
Although the German tax code allows the setting of a penalty payment of up to 25,000 €(i.e. 329 AO), the CLO sets penalty payments of 125, 250 and 500 €in three stages.
In addition, 26a (1) No. 5 UStG stipulates that the tax inspector acts improperly if he deliberately or recklessly does not deliver a ZM correctly, completely or in time or if he does not correct a ZM or does not correct it in time.
This violation can be punished with a fine of up to €5,000.
Data on intra-community deliveries cannot be entered into MIAS by the F Ä, because the CLO is exclusively responsible for processing the ZM.
The ZM data is only stored at the CLO.
The data from the summary reports are only available to the F Ä after their processing by the CLO.
The deadlines for processing ZM are regulated in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003.
The ZM data must be stored within three months of the calendar quarter in question (in MIAS).
In the case of incorrect VAT number in the ZM of German tax authorities, the German CLO receives a message "O _ MCTL" from the other Member State.
The CLO then turns to the entrepreneur and asks for the right data.
If the CLO is unable to obtain the correct information, the case will be submitted to the relevant FA.
It is then his job to request the correct information.
In the course of its audit, the BRH found that most entrepreneurs corrected the VAT number at the request of the CLO.
However, remembering, threatening and fixing up to three consecutive fines takes too much time if a tax package is involved in cross-border carousel fraud.
The cases, which were finally reported to the responsible FE, were usually completed within one to two months.
The relevant FA refused to grant tax exemption for the reported intra-Community deliveries in 73% of these cases9.
If the tax payer submitted the correct VAT ID number, the FA asked him to submit a corrected ZM to the CLO, because the FÄ cannot correct the MIAS data themselves.
The BRH found that neither the F Ä nor the CLO controlled the delivery of the corrected ZM.
Therefore, the tax authorities often did not comply with the request. Since the CLO does not have access to the data of the VAT returns, there is no comparison of the information provided in the VAT advance declarations or the VAT return on goods deliveries with the corresponding information in the ZM before this data is forwarded to the CLO of the other Member States.
This comparison can only be carried out by the F Ä. This usually happens during the preparation of a special VAT audit.
Data received from other Member States is processed by the CLO.
Incorrect VAT ID numbers are detected and reported to the affected Member States.
The data will be used to control employment taxation in the F Ä.
As soon as they are available in the system, the CLO compares them with data from previous calendar quarters.
If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control notifications are drawn up and sent to the responsible FEAs.
This happens continuously, whereas the acquisition data of all VAT beneficiaries is later compiled and forwarded to the F Ä.
The risk management system (RMS) for the investment procedure then compares this data with those for intra-community acquisitions.
The system fully verifies (only) those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct input tax.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, tax authorities who have made intra-Community deliveries to a person registered for VAT in another Member State must hand over a ZM to the locally responsible FA within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter.
The F Ä process the ZM and forward the data to the CLO.
The values of intra-Community deliveries reported by the tax authorities in the ZM are compared with the values of intra-Community deliveries reported by the same tax authorities in their VAT returns.
The results of the reconciliation will be taken into account in the tax assessment.
In Germany, tax payers who have made intra-Community deliveries are required to pay quarterly ZM within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter10.
Since 1 January 2007, the tax authorities have had to submit the ZM electronically to the CLO.
The data from the ZM are only available to the F Ä after their processing at the CLO.
Both in the Czech Republic and in Germany, the tax authorities in the ZM only indicate the deliveries of goods.
The provision of services is not stated in the ZM. Unlike the Czech F Ä, the German F Ä cannot correct erroneous information in individual lines of the ZM.
Due to this limited access to the German MIAS data, incorrect VAT ID numbers were not corrected even if the tax authorities informed the FA of the correct VAT ID number.
The German tax administration does not compare the information on intra-Community deliveries, which German tax authorities make in their VAT declarations, with the information of the corresponding ZM.
Differences between the data of the prior notification and the ZM are regularly not revealed before the German CLO transmits the MIAS data to other Member States.
Based on these findings, it is obvious that a comparison would improve the reliability of the transmitted MIAS data.
The data transmitted by other Member States on the delivery of goods to Czech tax authorities will be compared in the Czech Republic with the data on the purchases of goods indicated by Czech tax authorities in their VAT returns.
The Czech CLO makes the adjustment for each calendar quarter separately.
The most serious cases of deviations are forwarded to the F Ä for examination.
Unlike the Czech tax administration, the German tax administration does not generally examine the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.
Such a general control will only be carried out for taxpayers who are not fully entitled to deduct input tax.
In addition, the German tax administration controls the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other tax assets only if the RMS has drawn up an audit report or the tax authority has already been selected for an audit.
This procedure relieves the F Ä from clarifying the reasons for differences.
On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
To combat carousel fraud, updated information on intra-Community acquisitions must be available as early as possible.
The current system of the ZM, in particular MIAS, provides the tax authorities with information that may well be half a year old.
This time delay could be reduced to up to four months if the taxpayers had to surrender their monthly ZM.
The monthly levy would only insignificantly increase the bureaucratic burden, since most tax authorities in the Czech Republic and Germany are already obliged to submit monthly VAT returns or advance declarations and no more information is required for the ZM than for the VAT returns or advance declarations.
In order to avoid bureaucracy, the submission of the ZM could be linked to the submission of VAT returns or advance declarations.
However, a failure to pay monthly ZM would cause more periodic discrepancies between data on intra-Community deliveries and data on intra-Community purchases and increase data flows between CLOs.
In 2006, the federal government considered the general introduction of monthly ZM.
The implementation failed due to the concerns of the federal states.
They feared that a monthly transfer of MIAS data to the CLO of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In order for the commitment to the monthly submission of ZM to be effective, it is necessary to agree on the uniform monthly submission at European level, so that a monthly update of the MIAS data is possible.
Statistical information on deliveries and purchases between the Czech Republic and Germany
In foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the Czech Republic.
The total turnover of intra-Community trade in goods between the Czech Republic and Germany is shown in Table 2.
Both auditors requested data on the number of incorrect tax numbers or VAT ID numbers in the O _ MCTL reports, which were exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany for the individual audited quarters.
This data can be found in the tables below.
They have significant differences.
The reason for the differences may be a different basis for calculating the number of O _ MCTL messages.
While the Czech CLO relates the figures to the calendar quarter for which the ZM was submitted, the German CLO relates its figures to the calendar quarter in which O _ MCTL notification was received.
International exchange of information at level 3
International exchange of information in the Czech Republic
The international exchange of information allows tax officials to obtain information from other Member States on intra-Community transactions as well as on the tax checks they have carried out.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 on mutual assistance in the field of VAT, repealing Directive (EEC) No 218 / 92 (hereinafter referred to as Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003), distinguishes between two basic types of exchange of information: Exchange of information on request and spontaneous exchange of information (without prior request).
The international exchange of information on request takes place through a request for information (RFI) using the standardized SCAC form.
The tax officials in the Czech Republic send their RFI or their responses to a received RFI through the Finance Directorate to the CLO, which ensures the translation of the information provided in the standardised SCAC form into the foreign language and forwarding it to the other Member States.
In addition, the CLO receives requests for information (RFI) from other Member States and the responses to requests sent. It arranges for their translation into Czech and their distribution to the relevant FÄ for processing.
Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 sets a maximum period of three months from receipt of the request for its processing.
All RFIs exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany during the audited period were audited by the NK.
Of the total number of 94 RFIs received from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were processed within the three-month period; in a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%), this processing period was exceeded.
In the remaining one case, no reply had been sent to Germany until the NK K ä mpfer had examined it. More detailed information on the deadlines within which Germany's requests were answered by the Czech Republic can be found in Figure 2.
Out of the total number of 335 requests for information (RFIs) sent to Germany from the Czech Republic, 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) received a reply within the three-month period; a further 179 (i.e. 53.4%) were processed after this period and in 19 cases no reply had been received from Germany at the time of the examination by the NK (in the remaining one case it was not possible to determine when Germany answered the request for information based on the declared information).
More detailed information on the deadlines within which requests for information from the Czech Republic from Germany were answered can be found in Figure 3.
The percentages of intra-Community sales indicated in the requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in Figure 4.
The graph above shows that the sales audited in connection with requests for information usually had values of more than €60,000.
The international exchange of information without prior request is either automatic, structured automatically or in the form of spontaneous information.
Tax officials in other Member States are often provided with information without prior request, which is important for determining the VAT liability.
In the Czech Republic, all information is collected at the CLO.
Information is exchanged electronically between the individual Member States.
"Automatic exchange" in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003 means the systematic transmission of predetermined information to other Member States at regular, predetermined intervals without prior request.
Structured automatic exchange means the systematic transfer of pre-defined information to another Member State without its prior request, once the information in question is available.
The Czech Republic informs the other Member States in the automatic exchange of information about deliveries of new vehicles.
The tax officer obtains this information from the form notification of the delivery of a new vehicle in accordance with Act No. 235 / 2004 as well as from the copy of the issued invoice.
When processing this form, the tax officer enters the required data into the relevant document template and forwards it directly to the responsible employee of the Financial Directorate, where this data is collected and sent to the CLO for further processing. Thereafter, this data will be transmitted to the other Member States within the specified period, at the latest within two months after the end of the quarter in which it was obtained.
The Czech Republic also provides other Member States with information on mail order transactions that are tax-free in the country of origin, on intra-Community transactions that appear inadmissible and on potential missing traders.
This information is transmitted to the other Member States by means of a SCAC form in a spontaneous exchange of information.
Implementation of the international exchange of information in Germany
In Germany, the initiative for requests for information and spontaneous exchange of information comes from the local FA.
The F Ä send the completed form SCAC 2004 by e-mail directly to the German CLO, which forwards the SCAC forms to the foreign CLO.
The F Ä are instructed to write their requests for information or spontaneous information only in German, even the SCAC form used is monolingual.
Half of the German requests for information examined by the BRH were sent in order to ensure the acquisition tax in the other Member State or to prove the tax exemption of intra-Community delivery from Germany to the other Member State.
If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it checks whether the value of the deliveries mentioned in the request exceeds the minimum amount limit of €15,000.
If there is no adequate justification for the request, the German CLO refuses to provide information regarding sales below the minimum amount limit.
In addition, the German CLO provides the translation of the freely formulated texts in the SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)] if they are not written in German or English.
To answer the request for information, the CLO directs it to the competent FA and refers to the three-month period.
No further deadlines have been set at the various levels of the German financial administration.
Although the German CLO has the technical means to monitor compliance with the deadline, it does not have the necessary personnel capacity to remind the F Ä to respond to the unresolved requests for information.
The F Ä receive the required information by letter from the tax authorities or by conducting an external audit.
The external auditors usually choose between two forms of audit: The special VAT audit, which covers all tax-related transactions within a period of several months, or the so-called VAT review, which may only refer to a recent transaction.
With this short and rigorous form of examination, an announcement to the tax authorities is not necessary and it has proven itself in the investigation of an individual turnover.
In the automatic exchange of information, Germany transmits the following information to the other Member State: - via VAT ID number allocated to companies established in other EC Member States - about the refund of VAT to entrepreneurs established in other EC Member States.
In addition, Germany has undertaken to provide the other EC Member States with the following information as part of the structured automatic exchange of information:
A. The delivery of new vehicles to entrepreneurs without VAT number, b. Distance sales (mail order) to other EC Member States, which are not subject to VAT in Germany, c. Significant deviations between the purchases reported by a tax payer and the MIAS data transmitted by other Member States, i.e. intra-Community deliveries of items that have been subject to taxation in Germany by the tax payer, e. potential "Missing Traders" who have made intra-Community transactions, regardless of whether their VAT number is still valid or has already been deleted, as well as potential tax payers who have misused or misused a tax payer.
Comparison and evaluation
Requests for information or spontaneous information are sent both in the Czech Republic and in Germany on the initiative of the locally responsible F Ä, who send the relevant SCAC forms to the CLO.
While the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCAC forms (Czech-English) and translates information into English or German, the German FÄ follow the instruction to write requests for information or spontaneous information on a monolingual form only in German.
The German CLO does not produce translations of German texts.
When examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany in the period from May 1, 2004 to December 31, 2005, the NK ü st ä tzen found that the Czech financial administration handled 74.5% of the requests for information received within the three-month period, while the requests for information addressed to Germany were only handled by the German financial administration in 40.6% of cases within this period.
Although the German CLO draws the attention of the F Ä to the three-month deadline, it does not monitor compliance.
Due to the lack of reminders, there is a high proportion of time-limited requests for information.
That is why the BRH has recommended a continuous reminder procedure to the German CLO.
The situation has now changed.
According to the information available to us, the German CLO is now reminding the tax offices of the answer to the outstanding requests for information.
Value-added tax risk management
Risk management in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, several organisational units at different levels of financial management are involved in risk management in the area of VAT.
Within the Czech Ministry of Finance, the following organisational units are responsible for risk management and combating VAT fraud:
The department for methodology and economic management of VAT and its department for risk management deals with identifying potential risk areas for tax revenue and evaluates the trends in these risks in domestic and intra-Community trade.
At the national level, this body coordinates the requirements for the criterion "credibility of VAT returns" and uses the MIAS data to detect possible tax evasion in the context of intra-Community deliveries and purchases.
Based on data on the trade balance of the Czech Republic, it evaluates risky goods, prepares conceptual risk management in the area of VAT and cooperates in this area with the relevant EC institutions and the other Member States.
The Department for International Administrative Assistance in the field of VAT provides inter alia for the exchange of information, participates in the creation and implementation of a relevant information database, evaluates the data available in the MIAS system from other Member States, carries out public relations work and is responsible for other forms of intergovernmental administrative assistance within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003.

Among other things, the tax audit and tax investigation methodology department conducts risk analyses within the framework of the methodological management of tax audits, sets priorities for the work planning of the financial directorates with regard to the selection of cases to be audited, prepares risk analyses to combat tax evasion and collects information from the financial administration and other sources in this context, and makes proposals for measures to combat tax evasion.
Tax investigation offices exist at the financial directorates. Their tasks include the search for tax authorities and industries that are risky in terms of the frequency of tax evasion (e.g. Internet transactions, gold, pharmaceutical industry), the search for unregistered tax authorities (e.g. in the Internet services, employment services, electronic and print media, etc.), the investigation of misconduct in chain fraud cases and the information of local tax authorities.
Special examination units have been set up in 12 selected subjects.
These have a regional competence and carry out tax audits outside the local area of responsibility of the F Ä.
The need to set up the special audit units resulted from the increase in new and "improved" forms of tax evasion, particularly in the context of chain transactions.
These special units check according to the needs of tax investigators or focus on tax investigators with certain activities, multinational companies and tax investigators with particularly high turnover.
The following mechanisms for reducing risks in the area of VAT have been integrated into the ATIS system: - the task of "credibility of VAT returns" to assess the risk-bearing nature of tax returns; - the task of "selecting the tax authorities to be audited", whereby the tax authorities to be audited are selected on the basis of certain criteria; - the task of "MIAS", which gives tax officials access to the data provided by the other EC Member States.
The task "MIAS" allows inter alia the following: - verification of the validity of the VAT ID number of tax beneficiaries from other Member States, - confirmation of the value of the goods delivered to a Czech tax beneficiary as indicated in the ZM by all suppliers of the relevant tax beneficiary from other Member States, - preparation of a list of tax beneficiaries who have not submitted a ZM, - formal control of the information provided by tax beneficiaries in the Czech Republic in their ZM before this information is transmitted to other Member States, - preparation of a list of tax beneficiaries whose VAT declarations do not correspond to the information in the other Member States on the value of the goods acquired in the ZM, the other Member States' tax declarations of which do not correspond to the information in the other Member States.
As part of their task to combat tax evasion, tax officials have access to data from state authorities such as commercial registers, land registers, motor vehicle registers, trade registers, etc.
More detailed information is provided in Section 4.4.1 Submission and processing of summary reports in the Czech Republic.
Risk management in Germany
Due to their federal structure, both the federal authorities (especially the CLO) and the financial administrations of the 16 federal states are involved in the development and introduction of an RMS in the Federal Republic of Germany.
Although there are joint working groups for development, neither the CLO nor the financial administrations of the federal states have a uniform database.
At the level of the CLO, the ST I 2 unit (hereinafter referred to as "KUSS" - Coordination Office for Special VAT Examinations and Tax Investigation Measures) collects the audit findings on fraud cases in the OPUS database.
In cooperation with the countries, another database called ZAUBER has been set up at KUSS. There, the tax offices can enter the names of discovered missing traders or VAT fraudsters and also query them.
Kuss coordinates both related cases of VAT fraud at national level and cases of cross-border VAT fraud.
The experiences of the KUSS are brought into the development of the RMS through their participation in the working groups.
Experts from several other organisational units of the CLO and the BMF are also involved.
The formal review of the composition of VAT number of other Member States, which appear more important in the ZM of German tax authorities, is carried out at the CLO.
This formal review takes place before the ZM is transmitted to other Member States in order to improve the reliability of the MIAS data and thus its benefits (see 4.4.2).
The validity of the VAT ID number mentioned in the ZM is checked using the O _ MCTL identifiers transmitted by the other Member States (for the procedure for correcting invalid VAT ID numbers, see also 4.4.2).
In addition, the RMS of the CLO is based on the MIAS data transmitted by the other Member States and generates various types of notifications for the detection of suspected missing traders. Certain characteristics are used as clues, which usually occur in carousel transactions.
The F Ä of the federal states are instructed to process these notifications and in certain cases have to forward the result of their investigations to the CLO.
The BRH audit confirmed that all available features must be taken into account in order to be sufficiently likely to conclude a case of tax fraud (instead of focusing mainly on a company's turnover).
Accordingly, the BRH has recommended that the BMF work with combinations of different clues when preparing the communications.
The risk management system should also take into account other indicators, such as the payment behaviour of the tax payer, the industry or the company's shareholding.
A second level of risk management exists in the financial administrations of the federal states and focuses on the processing of VAT pre-declarations and annual declarations.
For example, the system creates a list of those tax beneficiaries who have indicated intra-Community deliveries in their VAT declaration or annual return.
This list is sent to the CLO to monitor the complete submission of the ZM.
Furthermore, in this type of risk management, the acquisitions specified by the tax authorities in their annual VAT return are compared with the data in MIAS.
The tax administrations of the federal states avoid comparing the quarterly data, as this would result in too many discrepancies due to factors other than tax evasion or tax fraud; e.g.:
Supplier and acquirer assume different times for the execution of intra-Community sales;
Different accounting and tax declaration of discounts and rebates.
In addition to comparing the information from the VAT returns with the MIAS data, many federal states have certain risk management mechanisms that are based on information in the VAT returns and certain other indications (e.g. company wording, age of the owner / partner, number of employees and payment method of the tax payer).
Bavaria has introduced a risk management system based on fixed rules, which allows a team of specialists in the fight against tax fraud (hereinafter referred to as "risk managers") to program their own rules so that suspected tax fraudsters are identified.
This system is used in the processing of the VAT advance declarations by the FEA.
This gives the responsible FA the information of the RMS before the VAT is determined.
Since this system is not capable of learning, the risk managers have to adapt the rules according to the feedback from the departments.
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has developed an adaptive neural network based on the data of detected evasion cases.
Based on this data, the RMS is able to learn the characteristics of tax evasion.
The system compiles a monthly list of tax cases where there is evidence of tax evasion.
On the basis of this list, the competent authorities decide on the audit of the relevant tax authorities.
After the audit, the tax auditors must report their results so that the RMS can learn from the results of the audits it proposes.
In North Rhine-Westphalia, an adaptive neural network is used in combination with a rule-based fuzzy system.
Based on a lot of data from processed VAT returns and some other clues, this neuro-fuzzy system (also called data-mining system) calculates how likely it is that a tax liability is involved in tax fraud.
It then draws up a monthly list of suspected tax fraudsters.
Based on this list, the F Ä select the relevant tax authorities for examination and report the test results to the relevant data center.
The introduction of these three RMS is underway in the federal states.
Since each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three systems for combating fraud appears to be effective.
It remains to be seen whether the hoped-for effects will occur during actual use.
Comparison and evaluation
Although it is not possible in this report to deal with the specific criteria of the RMS in the Czech Republic and Germany, the NK and BRH have found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.
Just like the different approaches in the three above-mentioned German states, the RMS of each European state has its particular strengths and weaknesses.
There is currently an exchange of experience between the tax authorities of the European Member States on new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.
VAT fraud - especially carousel fraud - has proved to be a European problem, not a national one.
The people involved in fraud coordinate their actions not only in one but in several Member States.
A Member State alone cannot develop an effective RMS.
Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each EC Member State. If this does not happen, fraudsters choose the Member State with the weakest RMS for their crimes.
The tax losses caused by Europe-wide VAT fraud do not necessarily affect the Member State in which the initiator is located.
Any other Member State involved in the fraud may be affected.
That is why there should be a European exchange of experience on the RMS.
Selected results from the audit of individual sales Within the framework of the parallel audits, the NK Kl ä ger and the BRH examined the quality and usability of information on selected deliveries or deliveries.
Which were the subject of the international exchange of information between the financial administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.
In addition, the two courts jointly examined the processing of several deliveries, the implementation of which was in doubt, or which the tax authorities of both states declared differently in the tax returns or ZM.
At the request of the BRH, the NK examined a total of eight transactions between eight Czech and eight German tax authorities.
In addition, in 43 cases, the NK examined the values of intra-community transactions with Germany, which Czech tax authorities had indicated in their tax returns and ZM, based on notifications from the BRH.
At the request of the NK ä mpfer, the BRH checked a total of 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech tax authorities.
The relevant information was exchanged exclusively on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 on the CLO.
The examination of the selected cases showed, among other things, that the different registration procedures in the EC Member States lead to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:
1.
According to MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004, a Czech tax resident purchased goods worth €60,500 from a German tax resident.
When the Czech tax authorities declared a purchase of only €29,869, the Czech tax authorities sent a request for information to Germany to check the value of the goods delivered.
In its response to the Czech request for information, the German side stated that the relevant German tax authorities had delivered goods worth €27,381 to their Czech business partner in the second quarter of 2004, goods worth €31,997 in the third quarter and €10,276 in the fourth quarter.
It also emerged from the answer that the VAT ID number of the German tax ID number was only valid from September 28, 2004. However, the German CLO had granted another application of the German tax ID number and brought the validity of the VAT ID number forward retroactively to May 1, 2004.
The German tax authorities corrected the ZM.
Based on this information, it was a (intra-Community) purchase of goods by the Czech tax authorities.
In a request to the competent tax office in the Czech Republic, the NK K ö rfer found that the Czech tax authorities had submitted supplementary VAT returns in 2004 for the individual (under-year) tax periods in which they declared a higher value of purchases from other Member States and at the same time requested the deduction of input tax from purchases from other Member States.
On the basis of these additional VAT declarations, the responsible clerk of the Czech tax office could not clearly determine whether the value of the deliveries of the above-mentioned German supplier was included in the declared purchases.
In response to a request for information from the NK K ö rger, the BRH stated that the German supplier had been registered as a VAT resident in September 2003.
However, when registering, he did not apply for the allocation of a VAT ID number, but only a tax number exclusively applicable to Germany.
Although it is generally not possible in Germany to retroactively assign a VAT ID number to a tax resident, the responsible clerk of the German tax administration did so retroactively as of May 1, 2004.
The German CLO allocates a VAT ID number retroactively if the German entrepreneur did not cause the delayed allocation; e.g. if the CLO caused the delay after the application of the tax authorities to issue a VAT ID number.
In this case, the CLO issues the VAT ID number retroactively, because the entrepreneur does not need a valid VAT ID number for an intra-community delivery according to UStG 6.
Conversely, a German buyer does not need the (valid) VAT ID number of his supplier to explain the intra-community acquisition.
Because of these procedural differences between the Member States, the German CLO issued the VAT ID number retroactively in this particular case.
2.
As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech tax official asked for verification of the VAT registration of the German entrepreneur.
From the MIAS data, the date of registration is 5 March 2005, while a registration certificate issued by the local competent German FA indicates 1 October 2004.
In their reply, the German authorities stated that the German tax authorities had been registered on 1 October 2004, but for organisational reasons they did not receive a VAT number until 16 February 2005 in Germany.
Through a request to the locally responsible Czech tax official, the NK learned that the tax official had carried out a VAT audit for the tax periods from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.
During this audit, the tax office found that the Czech tax authorities had declared in their VAT return services worth CZK 9,897, which they had provided to the German tax authorities before their VAT registration (i.e. before October 1, 2004).
The (Czech) tax office set a tax liability of CZK 1,880 for the third quarter of 2004 against the Czech tax authorities.
On the basis of the request of the NK K K ä mpfer, the BRH determined that the VAT ID number had not been assigned to the German tax authorities until he registered his company, founded in 2004, with the FA on 16 February 2005.
In addition, the FA registered it retroactively from 1 October 200415 for VAT purposes in order to monitor the filing of the VAT return for 2004.
In this VAT return, the tax authorities indicated significant intra-community acquisitions from the Czech Republic worth 160 €(approx. 5,000 CZK).
3. In its VAT return for September 2004 as well as in its ZM for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech tax payer stated that the value of goods delivered to a German tax payer amounted to CZK 114,615.
When checking the registration of the German tax authorities in the MIAS system, the Czech tax official found that this registration was only valid from 11 November 2004 and thus after the goods were delivered to Germany.
The Czech tax payer filed a supplementary VAT return in which he declared sales from domestic deliveries worth CZK 114,615 and sales tax of CZK 21,777, which he paid.
Through a request to the local competent FA in the Czech Republic, the NK K ä mpfer determined that the Czech tax authorities subsequently filed an application for the resumption of the tax procedure in the matter of the supplementary VAT return. As proof, he submitted a confirmation from the German tax administration that the German tax authorities had been registered since January 1, 2000.
Accordingly, the Czech tax official checked the validity of the registration of the German tax inspector in the context of the international exchange of information.
From the German information it emerged that the German tax authorities had only been assigned a VAT ID number on November 11, 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods.
As a result, the Czech tax official rejected the request to resume the tax procedure.
The BRH found that in this case no intra-Community purchase of goods had taken place, because the German tax authorities had only received a VAT ID on 11 November 2004.
However, the German recipient declared both the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and the VAT on it and also demanded the refund of input taxes in the same amount.
Because this did not lead to a change in the amount of tax liability of the German tax authorities, the German tax official did not correct the information in the VAT return.
Furthermore, the BRH found that the company of the German tax attorney named in the request for information was changed during the processing of the answer in Germany, which led to confusion between two German tax attorney.
This name change at the German tax office also confused the Czech tax official.
4.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax official checked the purchase of goods in the first quarter of 2005 by a Czech tax payer from a German tax payer worth €22,686.
Through a request to the local competent tax official in the Czech Republic, the NK Kl ä uge determined that the Czech tax official had examined the Czech tax authority in the context of an external audit, whether the intra-community delivery had actually taken place and whether the Czech tax authority had booked and paid the invoice for the delivery of the goods.
The Czech tax authorities did not declare the intra-community acquisition in their VAT return, because the German supplier did not state his VAT number in the invoice, but only his tax number intended for transactions within Germany.
According to the MIAS data, the German tax authorities are only registered for VAT in connection with intra-Community transactions from 21 April 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech tax authorities.
The Czech tax official also requested that the German tax administration send a copy of the registration certificate of the German tax authorities, so that he could initiate appropriate tax proceedings if necessary.
The Czech FA regarded this transaction as the acquisition of goods from a non-entrepreneurial (private) person in Germany and therefore did not set any VAT on the purchase of goods from Germany.
The BRH stated that under German law, a tax exempt person who delivers goods to other Member States does not have to have a VAT number for intra-Community deliveries in order to be able to claim the VAT exemption for such a delivery.
The supplier must only have the VAT number of the purchaser in the other Member State and be able to prove the transport of the goods in question to the other Member State.
In this case, according to German tax law, the turnover is a (tax-exempt) intra-Community delivery that should be subject to acquisition taxation in the Czech Republic.
In any case, it is important that the Czech tax official took note of this business transaction because the delivery of a machine of this value was not part of the core business of the German supplier.
As described in Section 4.6.2, the German CLO rejects requests for information on intra-Community transactions if they are below the minimum amount limit of €15,000: 5.
According to MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004, a Czech tax authority acquired goods worth €12,561 from a German tax authority.
The Czech tax official carried out an audit for this tax period.
As part of the intergovernmental administrative assistance, the Czech financial administration requested the verification of this delivery of goods by means of an SCAC form.
The Czech tax authorities declared that they had not received the goods, had never been in business with the German company and that the purchase of the goods in question had not been recorded with them.
The German tax administration rejected the request for the transmission of receipts - contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents - because the turnover was below €15,000 and no other justification had been given.
Since the Czech tax official did not receive any documents for a subsequent taxation of the purchased goods, the tax audit was inconclusive and the original tax assessment remained in place.
On the basis of a request from the NK K K ä mpfer, the BRH determined that the German tax authorities acted as "fiscal representatives17" (22 (a) - (e) UStG).
The German tax authorities declared these deliveries in their VAT return and in the ZM.
His right to tax exemption was recognised.
Based on the notification by the BRH, the German FA will send the documents required for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods to the Czech Republic.
In section 4.6.1 it was shown that the responses of the German tax administration to requests for information exceeded the three-month period more frequently than the responses of the Czech tax administration:
6. During its audit, the NK K K ä mpfer found that on October 5, 2005, the Czech financial administration had submitted a request for information on the value of goods delivered to Germany in the fourth quarter of 2004.
In the ZM for this quarter, the German tax authorities had reported a delivery of goods to the Czech tax authorities worth €86,307; however, the Czech tax authorities only declared the purchase of goods worth €35,314 in their VAT return for the same period.
In response to the request for information received by the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, i.e. after the expiry of the maximum processing period specified in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798 / 2003, the German side stated that the request for information could not be processed as the German company had been dissolved at the end of 2005.
Because the German tax administration did not meet the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech tax administration did not have the necessary documents for taxation in the Czech Republic.
7. In 2005, a Czech tax official used an SCAC form to request verification of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German tax payer worth €1,265,554 in the third and fourth quarters of 2004, with evidence of carousel fraud.
The NK found that at the time of its examination, a German response to the request for information had not yet been received.
Through a request to the locally responsible tax officer, the NK k ä mpfer determined that the Czech tax authorities had not declared the delivery of new motor vehicles to these German tax authorities in the value of CZK 11,816,103 in their VAT return.
The Czech tax official corrected the information in the tax return and the Czech tax inspector issued a corrected ZM.
Due to technical problems, the German CLO did not forward this request for information to the local FA for examination.
According to the notification by the BRH, a special VAT audit was carried out on the German purchaser in Germany. It was determined that the purchase of all relevant motor vehicles had been taxed correctly and that the vehicles were sold to other tax authorities in Germany.
8. According to MIAS data, in the fourth quarter of 2004 the Czech tax authorities acquired a car worth €48,500 from a German tax authorities.
However, the Czech tax authorities did not declare any intra-Community acquisition.
By enquiry to the local tax official in the Czech Republic, the NK K K ä rke determined that the Czech tax authorities had not filed a VAT return since August 2004.
The Czech tax authorities did not file any tax returns even at the request of the tax official. As a result, the FA set the VAT liability for the period October to December 2004 at zero on 23 May 2005.
On June 2, 2005, the CLO issued an instruction to check the aforementioned delivery from the German tax authorities.
Since the Czech tax authorities did not cooperate with the tax official, he sent a request for information on the above-mentioned delivery to Germany.
Since the answer to the request for information was not received until February 7, 2007, it was not known until the conclusion of the NK investigation how the Czech tax official used the information obtained in the international exchange of information.
The VAT registration of the Czech tax authorities was cancelled with effect from August 23, 2005 due to non-compliance with the VAT law.
In some cases, only a partial answer was sent, because at the time of the examination of the NK and BRH, the responsible FA had not yet completed the external examination:
9.
In 2005, the Czech tax official used an SCAC form to request a review of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German tax payer worth €16,991 in the third quarter of 2004, with evidence of carousel fraud.
In his reply to the request for information, the German tax official stated that he only had the invoices issued by the Czech tax authorities for deliveries worth €16,335.
On the basis of the request from the NK K K ä rzte, the BRH found that the external audit carried out by the German FA at the purchaser in Germany had not yet been completed.
The German acquirer declared the purchase of goods worth €16,335 twice in its VAT pre-registrations for August and September 2004.
10. In 2005, a Czech tax official used an SCAC form to request a review of deliveries of motor vehicles to a German tax payer worth €198,167 in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, showing signs of carousel fraud.
The German tax administration sent a partial reply to the request for information to the Czech Republic, in which it confirmed that the German tax authorities had acquired several motor vehicles and that the investigation in Germany had not yet been completed.
The NK stated that the locally responsible FA had carried out several external audits at the Czech tax office to check the deduction of above-average input taxes.
However, an unjustified claim has not been established.
The BRH found that the German tax authorities had declared in their VAT returns the purchase of goods from other Member States with a total value of €579,114 for the relevant period, and that the examination of the German FA with the purchaser in Germany has not yet been completed.
Section 4.4.1 describes the reasons for discrepancies between the declaration of intra-community purchases in the recipient's VAT return and the information in the supplier's ZM.
The examined cases showed that periodic discrepancies 18 or the incorrect declaration of a turnover as intra-Community delivery of goods were not the most common reasons for the differences:
11.
According to data from MIAS, in the first quarter of 2005 the Czech tax authorities acquired goods worth €35,716 from the German tax authorities, but the Czech tax authorities did not declare this acquisition.
Since the Czech tax official did not cooperate with the tax official and no business was carried out at the legal headquarters of the company, the Czech tax official asked for verification as part of the international exchange of information, how the German tax official had communicated with the Czech.
The German response to the request for information revealed that, according to the findings of the German tax administration, the Czech tax authorities were unknown at the specified address and the goods were collected by an agreed forwarder.
The total value of the order was €155,000, but the German tax authorities only delivered goods worth €21,659.
The Czech tax payer sent the German tax payer a false payment confirmation for the amount of €155,153 in favor of the German tax payer.
After uncovering the fraudulent behaviour of the Czech acquirer, the German tax authorities managed, with the support of their other Czech customers, to get the supplied material back, with the exception of a part worth €7,916.
Through a request to the local competent FA in the Czech Republic, the NK K ä st determined that the financial administration, on the basis of the information received, subsequently paid the Czech tax authorities, among other things, the turnover tax on goods deliveries from other Member States in the amount of CZK 388,522.
On the basis of a request from the NK K K ä mpfer, the BRH confirmed that the German supplier had only reported a delivery of goods worth €7,916 to the Czech tax authorities after corrections.
In accordance with German legislation, the German tax authorities declared the cancellation of the delivery and the reduction of the tax base in the quarter of the cancellation.
His ZM contained the following information concerning the Czech tax authorities:
12.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German financial administration requested the verification of a delivery of goods and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005 using a SCAC form.
According to the request for information, the Czech tax authorities had supplied the German tax authorities with goods worth €396,126 and provided services worth €11,885 in the period in question.
The NK stated that the Czech tax administration had carried out an audit with the Czech tax authorities to investigate this delivery.
In response to the request for information, the Czech tax administration announced that the Czech tax authorities had supplied and installed a production plant for the German.
The Czech tax authorities delivered the individual parts of the production plant before the Czech Republic joined the EC and the production plant was assembled on the basis of the order after May 1, 2004.
The German tax authorities did not accept the assembled production plant and claimed defects.
In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech tax authorities charged the German company the production plant for €107,100 and €11,885 for services.
The German tax payer received the invoices, but did not recognize them and did not pay them.
By enquiring with the local tax official in the Czech Republic, the NK K ä mpfer determined that all invoices had been properly recorded in the books of the Czech tax authorities.
The VAT returns for the third quarter of 2005 contained only the amounts documented by the Czech tax authorities and related to invoices invoiced after May 1, 2004.
The BRH found that the locally competent FA came to the conclusion on the basis of the response of the Czech tax administration that these sales were a uniform (goods) delivery of the Czech tax liability to the German including the assembly performed.
In this particular case, the place of performance of this so-called factory delivery is the place where the production plant is assembled.
The German service recipient of the work delivery owes the VAT in accordance with the German VAT law.
At the same time, the recipient can claim a deduction of the same amount.
Since the VAT liability of the German tax payer remained unchanged, the German FA did not initiate a correction of the VAT return.
13. According to MIAS data, in February 2005 the Czech tax authorities acquired a machine worth €58,000 from the German tax authorities.
The Czech tax official sent a request to Germany to verify this information.
In response to the request for information, the German side announced that the German tax authority C had delivered this machine to the Czech tax authority B in 2004, but that it had returned it to the German tax authority C in October 2004.
According to the German tax administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but to the branch of the German tax authorities in the Czech Republic.
The answer to the request for information also revealed that the German tax authorities had delivered the machine to the Czech tax authorities in February 2005.
He received the machine at the headquarters of the German tax office in the Czech Republic.
Since this delivery (from C to A) only took place within the Czech Republic, there was no intra-community delivery of goods.
By enquiring with the local tax officer responsible for the tax package B, the NK K ä st determined that according to the MIAS data, the German tax package C had delivered goods worth €88,027 to the Czech tax package (another machine) in the third quarter of 2004.
The tax authorities declared that they had not received the goods, so the local Czech tax official sent a request for information to Germany.
The answer was that the machine had been delivered.
In the course of further investigations into the tax liability B, the tax officer found that the machine worth €88,027 had not been booked with the tax liability B and that it could be the same type of machine as the branch of the German tax liability C had delivered to the Czech tax liability A in February 2005.
The NK also found that the Czech tax official responsible for the tax credit A had carried out an audit at the tax office.
The tax official had the invoice of the German tax auditor C dated February 7, 2005, in which the tax auditor A is specified as the recipient of the machine.
The Czech tax official noted that the tax inspector A had not recorded this invoice.
The taxpayer A had concluded a lease agreement with another Czech company whose object was a machine of the same type.
The leasing company rma delivered the machine on February 9, 2005 and also took care of the transport.
The Czech FA did not use the information provided in the reply to the request for information to determine the tax liability of the taxpayer.
The BRH found that the German tax payer C did not deliver the machine worth €88,027 to the Czech Republic, but to another German tax payer D.
Accordingly, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods, but a tax-exempt delivery within Germany.
Consequently, the German tax official did not recognise the claim of the German tax exempt C for VAT and corrected the information in his tax return.
The German tax authorities delivered the machine to the Czech tax authorities.
Under German law, this delivery was not subject to tax in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.
The BRH also noted that the German tax authorities had indicated in their ZM for the first quarter of 2005 the delivery of a machine worth €58,000 to the Czech tax authorities.
This delivery was not checked during the tax audit carried out by the German FA.
The figure below represents the contractual relationships between the business partners involved in the above-mentioned transactions.
14.
During the examination of requests for information received, the NK k ä mpfer noted that the Czech tax administration had received a request for information from Germany on October 4, 2005, in which a German tax official requested the verification of intra-Community deliveries of a German tax payer worth €879,680,625 to a Czech tax payer.
The German tax official stated that there was a suspicion that this was a deliberate intra-Community delivery of goods.
The German tax authorities have not been active in business since 1999.
The NK stated that the Czech tax official had carried out an external audit with the Czech tax authorities.
The head of the Czech company explained that this was probably a claim by the German tax authorities against the German tax authorities, which the Czech tax authorities had asserted as a shareholder in the German company at the German FA.
According to the information provided to the NK, the Czech tax official has so far no information that the German tax administration is handling the case with reference to the Czech tax authorities.
The information available shows that it was not a delivery of goods; nevertheless, the amount in question is still stored in MIAS as an intra-Community delivery of goods from Germany to a Czech tax payer.
The main reason for these discrepancies was the failure to indicate the intra-Community acquisition in the tax returns of the recipients (see also Section 4.4.1):
15. According to MIAS data, in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005, a German tax payer delivered goods worth a total of €33,205 to a Czech tax payer.
However, the Czech tax authorities did not explain the intra-Community acquisition.
The Czech tax official asked for an examination of the delivery of goods from Germany as part of the intergovernmental exchange of information.
In its reply to this request for information, the German side stated that the German tax authorities had sent a part of the goods to the address of the Czech tax authorities, and that the other goods had been collected personally.
By enquiring with the locally competent Czech financial officer, the NK K K ä mpfer determined that the Czech tax authorities had submitted a supplementary VAT return for the period in question before receiving a reply to the request for information.
Nevertheless, the differences in the values of the acquisitions could not be clarified, so the Czech tax official recommended a tax audit at the Czech tax office.
This test has not yet been carried out.
16. According to MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004 a German tax authority delivered goods worth €46,854 to a Czech tax authority.
For the same period, a Czech taxpayer declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only €14,856.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech tax official asked for verification of the actual value of the delivery.
With the German answer to this request, three invoices were sent showing a total value of the delivered goods of €31,999, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech tax authorities and the MIAS data.
By enquiring with the local Czech tax official, the NK K ö rfer determined that after receiving the answer from Germany, he had contacted the accountant of the Czech tax office and remained with her in such a way that she wanted to talk to the company owner about submitting a supplementary VAT return for the third quarter of 2004 after reviewing the invoices.
So far, no supplementary VAT return has been filed.
The Czech tax official informed the NK that he would proceed in such a way that the deadlines for a retroactive VAT assessment for the relevant tax period would be met.
17.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German tax authorities delivered goods worth €11,600 to the German tax authorities.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the German tax official asked for verification as to whether the above-mentioned Czech tax authorities actually existed, since the alleged capital owner of the German tax authorities had established a number of bogus errors in Germany.
In the course of the FA's review of the transaction, the Czech tax authorities confirmed the purchase of the goods.
According to the Czech tax authorities, the goods were not delivered from Germany to the Czech Republic, but resold in Germany in 2005.
The Czech tax authorities submitted receipts for the sale in January 2005.
The Czech tax beneficiary was not registered as a VAT beneficiary in Germany and had not taxed the sale of the goods in question in the Czech Republic or Germany.
All these facts pointed to tax evasion within Germany and the Czech tax official submitted this information in his response to the request for information to the German tax authorities.
By enquiring with the local Czech tax official, the NK K ö rfer found that the Czech tax authorities had filed a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004 on the basis of a tax audit, in which they declared, among other things, the value of the goods they had acquired from a German tax payer and at the same time asserted the right to deduct input tax for purchases from other Member States.
In his Czech VAT return, he did not declare VAT on the sale of goods in Germany.
On the basis of a supplementary VAT return submitted after the external audit, the Czech tax official fixed the VAT liability unchanged.
Under Czech law, there was no purchase of goods from other Member States in this case, as the goods were not shipped or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.
Thus, the Czech tax official drew the wrong conclusion during the external audit.
The BRH found that immediately after receiving the reply to the request for information, which showed that the goods had not left Germany, the German tax official corrected the tax return of the German tax liability and demanded the payment of VAT worth €1,600.
In addition, the competent FA sent a control notice to the FA responsible for the actual recipient of the goods to ensure that the resale of these goods is properly taxed.
In the following cases, entrepreneurs declared intra-Community deliveries that may not have been carried out:
18.
The Czech tax official received a request for information from the German tax administration on the question of whether the Czech tax authorities had acquired a car worth €47,400 from the German tax authorities in February 2005.
Attached to the request for information was a copy of the VAT registration certificate of the Czech tax authorities.
Another attachment was a photocopy of the passport of the person who was supposed to have transferred the vehicle.
In the course of his investigation, the Czech tax official found that the passport was stolen, that the person named in it had not imported a vehicle into the Czech Republic and stated that she had no contacts with a German tax authority.
The VAT registration certificate, the print of which had been sent by the German side, had not been issued by the Czech tax authorities.
With this information, the Czech tax official answered the request for information and at the same time stated that he could not confirm the purchase of the car.
By enquiring with the local Czech tax official, the NK k ä mpfer determined that the Czech tax office is not located at the address specified in the commercial register and that the managing director of the company is not available.
Following a tax complaint procedure for the February 2005 tax period, the Czech tax official set the tax liability of the Czech tax payer at zero.
In the course of a further investigation, the Czech tax official found that the vehicle in question had been sold to another Czech person who had purchased it on the basis of an internet advertisement.
The BRH found that the locally responsible German tax official had rejected the claim of the German tax authorities to exempt this delivery from VAT on the basis of the Czech response to the request for information.
19. In the course of an external audit, a German FA was unable to clarify a difference of €3,000 between the value of the purchased goods stated in the VAT return and the reported values from other Member States.
In the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, a Czech tax payer should have delivered goods worth €89,424 to a German tax payer.
Since the acquisition declared by the German tax authorities did not correspond to the MIAS data, the German tax official requested the verification of deliveries and their payment as part of the intergovernmental exchange of information.
In his reply to the request for information, the Czech tax official stated that the only managing director of the Czech company had been deleted from the commercial register on 8 July 2005 and that a new managing director had not yet been registered.
The German recipient of the goods was presumably a relative of the shareholder of the Czech company.
The Czech tax authorities filed a VAT return and a ZM, which was signed by an unauthorized person, namely this shareholder of the company, after the deletion of the managing director in the commercial register.
The accountant of the Czech tax office informed the tax official that the capital owner had paid the payment received for the invoiced goods in euros into the company's account.
Cash receipts were not issued.
By enquiry to the locally competent Czech FA, the NK K ä mpfer stated that the tax official had recognised the Czech tax exemption for goods deliveries to other Member States worth CZK 1,326,307 in the first quarter of 2004 and CZK 1,416,180 in the first quarter of 2005.
The BRH found that the German tax official did not correct the VAT return of the German acquirer, as in the meantime a German court had confirmed the insolvency of the German tax liability.
Since the previous external audit showed no signs of tax fraud, there is no prospect of actually being able to collect a fixed VAT liability.
20. According to MIAS data, a German tax payer purchased goods from the Czech Republic worth €4,251,196 in 2005, after purchasing goods worth €43,274 in the previous year.
The German tax authorities did not declare the intra-Community acquisitions either in their 2004 VAT return or in the 2005 VAT return.
In addition, he did not explain any initial sales in terms of value.
Because of these discrepancies, the German FA made a request for information regarding the fourth quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006.
In the ZM for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-community deliveries of goods with a total value of CZK 167,246,083.
On September 6, 2006, the request for information was received, in which the German side asked to check whether the delivery reported by the Czech tax authorities had actually taken place.
In response to this request for information, the Czech tax administration stated that the German request could not be met because the Czech company did not have a managing director (or other legal representative).
From the documents provided to the NK by the responsible tax official, it can be seen that on March 30, 2006, a protocol on the start of the VAT audit for the fourth quarter of 2004 and the period from January to December 2005 was drawn up together with the managing director of the Czech tax office.
At the same time, the tax inspector was asked by the tax officer to submit all accounting and tax documents for this period, but failed to do so.
According to the commercial register, the term of office of the sole managing director expired on May 16, 2005, without a new managing director being appointed.
Since April 2006, the Czech tax authorities have not issued any VAT returns.
In the context of the parallel investigation, the NK Circuit, in cooperation with the BRH, investigated several cases of intra-Community deliveries between the Czech Republic and Germany that were not the subject of a prior exchange of information between the two countries.
The two courts exchanged information on the audited cases through the CLO of both countries.
21. A Czech company (UCR), which is not based in Germany, informed the competent FA (Chemnitz-S ü d) that it wanted to conduct tax transactions in Germany.
Based on this information, the company was registered from June 2005, but did not receive a German VAT number.
The (UCR) accepted an order from a Danish company (UDK) to manufacture wind turbines and deliver them to Austria on behalf, at the risk and for the account of the Danish customer.
Due to insufficient in-house production capacity, the Danish company passed on part of the order to a German tax resident (UDE).
The following illustration shows the contractual relationships and the transport route of the wind turbines:
According to German law, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as follows:
The Danish company (UDK) sent the wind turbines to Austria for assembly on its behalf, at its own risk and on its own account.
Because of the installation, its delivery takes place in Austria, i.e. the delivery of wind turbines is controllable in Austria.
Because the forwarder was commissioned by the Danish company (UDK) and the latter had the transport carried out in its own name, at its own risk and for its own account, the place of delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE) is where the transport began, i.e. in Germany.
Although the wind turbines were delivered to another EC Member State (AU) and the recipient is registered as tax-exempt in an EC Member State (CR), no tax exemption could be claimed for the delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE), since the EC Member State for which the delivery was intended is different from the Czech company's domicile 19.
Accordingly, the delivery is duly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (UCR) claimed the deduction in its VAT returns.
The place of delivery of the Czech company (UCR) also depends on the place where the transport started.
However, some of the wind turbines were transported from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.
The delivery of wind turbines manufactured in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.
The remaining wind turbines, which were manufactured in Germany, were delivered in Germany.
Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) provided both intra-community deliveries from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-community deliveries from Germany to Austria.
The BRH found that the Czech company (UCR) did not declare intra-Community deliveries in its German tax returns or in its ZM submitted to the German CLO.
Thus, the Czech company may have treated all its intra-Community deliveries uniformly as intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic.
The NK found that (UCR) did not report intra-Community deliveries to Austria, but intra-Community deliveries to Denmark.
Cooperation between at least four tax administrations (the Austrian, Czech, Danish and German) would be required to ensure taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in Austria, although in this case there is no evidence of tax fraud or tax evasion.
In addition, the NK ä rger and the BRH examined case designs to show the size of the differences caused by the different legislation in 2004 between the information in the VAT returns and the MIAS data.
The audited cases also show that it takes some time for the tax authorities to settle and the F Ä to apply the new legal provisions:
22. In its ZM for the second, third and fourth quarter of 2004, a Czech tax package of goods with a total value of CZK 792,977,452 reported to a German tax package.
During the same period, another Czech tax cardholder reported intra-Community deliveries to another German tax cardholder with a total value of CZK 18,157,265.
From the information transmitted by the BRH to the NK, it emerged that in both cases electricity supplies were involved.
Both Czech tax authorities took into account the above-mentioned deliveries in accordance with the Czech Law No. 235 / 2004 in force in 2004.
During a further examination of these business transactions, an audit group of the NK K ö rfer found that in 2004, different legal regulations on the supply and acquisition of electrical energy between the Czech Republic and Germany applied.
While in the Czech Republic the tax authorities declared the deliveries of electrical energy as intra-Community deliveries of goods in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 235 / 2004 valid in 2004, according to the German legal provisions applicable in 2004 it was not an intra-Community purchase of goods, but taxable and taxable transactions in Germany.
The differences in the legal provisions were eliminated in the Czech Republic by the adoption of Law No. 635 / 2004, which amended some tax provisions with effect from 1 January 2005.
23. During the examination of intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions in cooperation with the Federal Republic of Germany, it was further established that a Czech tax payer declared intra-Community deliveries to a German tax payer with a total value of CZK 240,411,163 and another Czech tax payer declared intra-Community deliveries to another German tax payer with a value of CZK 263,470,776 for the same period.
Information transmitted by the BRH to the NK ä rke showed that in both cases it had been a matter of supplies of electrical energy.
In accordance with the wording of Act No. 235 / 2004 applicable from January 1, 2005, the place of performance for the supply of electrical energy is the place where the purchaser has his legal domicile, his place of business or his place of business for which this delivery is made.
Therefore, the Czech tax authorities should not have stated the electricity supplies in their ZM for 2005.
The fact that both tax authorities treated the supply of electrical energy in their ZM as intra-Community supplies led to a difference of 503,881,939 CZK in MIAS.
Final remark
Through the cooperation, the goals of the BRH and the NK ä rke were achieved.
Both auditors gained in-depth knowledge of the VAT administration systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The cooperation revealed differences in the two systems and in the relevant legal provisions for VAT administration.
During the parallel tests, interesting cases of intra-Community deliveries and acquisitions came to light.
Some of them are worth further observation.
On the basis of the audit results, both courts of auditors developed recommendations for the management of VAT.
The follow-up of these recommendations in the form of a control review should be part of the further observation.
The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of the two courts of auditors is the basis for the successful implementation of future audits in the field of VAT administration.

Public procurement of construction services and corruption prevention
Joint report of the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (NK K K ä r) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on their parallel audits
Introduction and overview
The awarding of services by contracting authorities is of great importance for both the state and the economy.
The state has the task of using public funds as economically and economically as possible and ensuring fair and regulated competition.
In the European Union (EU), the awarding of services by contracting authorities is an important part of the creation of a single economic area.
In order to ensure largely unrestricted competition across borders, contracting authorities have to comply with EU regulations when awarding contracts above certain value limits (thresholds).
To this end, the EU member states must transpose and apply EU procurement law into national law.
This has already happened in both the Czech Republic and Germany.
Below the EU thresholds, it is up to individual countries to regulate public procurement themselves.
The awarding of benefits is also an area at risk of corruption.
Due to the inherently high damage potential, contracting authorities must therefore take appropriate measures to prevent and prevent corruption and undue favours when awarding their contracts.
In January 2011, the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed to carry out parallel audits for both the EU-wide award of construction services and the prevention of corruption.
The focus of the audits was on the application of EU public procurement law, which has been transposed into national regulations, as well as the prevention of corruption in the awarding of construction services in building construction and road construction and transport infrastructure.
The allocation below the EU thresholds was also taken into account with regard to corruption prevention.
The audit results of both courts are summarised in this joint report.
The report should also be addressed to international institutions, such as the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).
Audit areas and audited bodies The evaluations of the Federal Audit Office on the listed topics are mainly based on cross-sectional audits, which it carried out in 2011 / 2012 at the construction administrations, which are responsible for the road and building construction of the federal government in Germany.
He examined, for example, the construction of motorways and large construction projects.
In addition, the Federal Court of Auditors used results from previous investigations.
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic based its evaluations on audit findings from the years 2008 to 2011. The audits included construction measures in road construction, rail infrastructure construction, hydraulic engineering, building construction (hospitals, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc.) and other construction areas in the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the public procurement of the federal government is mainly carried out by the construction administrations of the federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the State Construction Administration is centrally responsible for the procurement of transport infrastructure.
In building construction, the awarding of contracts is carried out decentrally by those agencies that use state budget funds.
In both countries, freelancers are also involved in some areas of the procurement procedures.
When comparing the evaluations, differences in procurement law and the market structure for construction services in both countries must be taken into account.
Development of procurement law in both countries
In Germany, the implementation of EU-wide procurement procedures is stipulated in laws and regulations.
Procurement procedures limited to the national area are governed by budgetary law and the administrative regulations based on it.
In addition, many supplementary individual regulations are stipulated by internal administrative provisions for both EU-wide and national procurement,
Such as the so-called "procurement manuals" of the federal government, in which the legal requirements are supplemented or formulated in more detail in compliance with procurement law.
In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure is governed exclusively by the Public Procurement Act and other legal provisions, which apply both to the area above and below the EU thresholds.
The procurement law was significantly amended in 2012.
The new regulation increased transparency in the use of public funds, enabled greater competition and limited the possibilities for corruption in the procurement procedure.
Outlines of procurement law in both countries
In both countries, the open procedure, the non-open procedure and the negotiated procedure in particular apply to EU-wide contracts.
In Germany, the measures below the EU threshold are subject to the national award types (public tender, limited tender, hands-free award), which largely correspond to the EU-wide award types mentioned.
Public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of the primacy of the open procedure (for EU-wide contracts) and the public tender (for national contracts).
With the open procedure and the public tender, any interested company can submit an offer.
Another key feature of German procurement law is the promotion of medium-sized companies.
Above all, the division of a total construction project into specialist and partial lots serves this purpose.
The individual allocation of these lots is intended to enable as many companies as possible to participate in the competition.
Both of the aforementioned features of German procurement law are proven instruments for achieving economic results.
There are over 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees in Germany.
In the Czech Republic, EU-wide procurement procedures also apply to construction projects below the EU threshold.
An exception is the simplified procedure, where a less stringent procedure may be applied below the thresholds and under certain conditions.
Czech public procurement law contains provisions, in line with EU law, according to which contracts should be concluded if competition is guaranteed and an advantageous price is achieved.
The current legal provisions in the Czech Republic allow contracting authorities to choose between the open and the non-open procedure.
There are more than 85,000 construction companies in the Czech Republic, including about 1,900 companies with 20 or more employees.
Construction volume of contracting authorities and shares of the types of contracts in both countries
In Germany, the total construction volume in 2011 was 307 billion euros.
Of this, 45.5 billion euros were allocated to public construction (15%), which, in addition to federal construction, also includes the construction measures of the federal states and municipalities.
The federal government's construction volume in building construction and highway construction (excluding rail infrastructure construction and hydraulic engineering) amounted to 8.5 billion euros.
The volume of contracts for construction work in construction and highway construction by the federal government in 2011 was distributed as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public tenders, 12.7% non-open procedures and limited tenders and 6.6% negotiated procedures and open contracts.
Of these, 33.2% were Europe-wide contracts.
The volume of public works projects in the Czech Republic amounted to 4.7 billion euros in 2011, representing about 25% of the total volume of all construction projects in the Czech Republic.
In 2009, the volume amounted to 7.8 billion euros, representing 37% of the total construction volume.
Breakdown by type of award for 2011: 65.1% open procedures 14.3% non-public procedures 9.5% negotiated procedures 8.4% simplified procedures for contracts below the threshold 2.7% other procedures
The data refer to all public contracts for supplies, services and construction services awarded by public procurement authorities in 2011.
The above-mentioned data show that the parallel audits of both countries focus on a significant part of public procurement, that the prevention of corruption is of great financial importance in all contracts and that the open procedure and the public tender are of outstanding importance in the award of contracts.
Summary of the results of the parallel tests
In their countries, the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic (NK K K ö rper) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have carried out parallel audits on the EU-wide awarding of construction services and on corruption prevention.
In this context, the working groups of both audit institutions compared the corresponding legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and Germany as well as the results of their parallel audits, which they carried out in particular in the areas of building construction and road construction.
In doing so, they essentially stated:
The EU Directives on the award of works by contracting authorities have been transposed into national law in both the Czech Republic and Germany (Nos. 1 and 3.1).
In addition to the EU requirements, the procurement regulations of both countries serve to prevent corruption, which differ in their priorities and details (No. 3.2).
In both countries, an essential requirement for the procurement documents is that they must contain all the information required for an appropriate tender.
The service descriptions must be neutral and must not have any restrictive requirements.
In Germany, the procurement documents have largely met these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, it is still a problem to adequately determine the subject of the order.
In Germany, construction work must be divided into lots if possible in order to promote competition.
According to the findings of the BRH, this requirement was largely implemented in Germany.
During its audits, the NK found, particularly in the field of road construction, that the award of extensive services without lots or with only very large lots can affect competition and lead to a restriction to only a few large companies.
Narrowing the market potential can lead to significant cost increases and carry the risk of price or other agreements.
According to the provisions of both countries, under certain conditions, the contracting authorities can agree on additional or amended services with the companies already commissioned, which prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (No. 4.1).
The respective guidelines for determining the type of award were largely followed in both countries.
Under the rules of the Czech Republic, contracting authorities are free to choose between open and non-open procedures.
In Germany, on the other hand, the legal and budgetary primacy of the open procedure for EU-wide contracts or the public tender, which corresponds to the open procedure for national contracts, applies.
This allows more companies to submit bids.
This reduces the risk of corruption, complicates price agreements between bidders and leads to the most economic results.
In the case of construction projects whose estimated total contract values reached or exceeded the EU threshold, the audited construction administrations generally awarded the construction services throughout Europe.
The correct estimation of the prospective contract value is an essential basis for choosing the right type of contract.
In Germany, cost databases are used for cost assessments of public buildings, especially in building construction,
Based on the evaluations of completed construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, a database is used in the field of road construction, but it is not yet an effective tool (No. 4.2).
In the case of construction works to be awarded throughout Europe, preliminary information and announcements must be published. This is intended to strengthen competition by allowing interested companies to prepare for the planned contracts at an early stage.
The audited building administrations generally adhered to this requirement.
In individual cases, incorrect information, incorrect applications or lack of controls may affect competition (No. 4.3).
The selection of candidates for participation in non-public procurement procedures is particularly susceptible to manipulation.
Under EU law, the number of invited applicants must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, not discriminatory and must be announced in advance.
In addition to the requirements of the EU, the contracting authorities in both countries should change as often as possible among the companies to be invited when selecting applicants.
In order to counter the risk of manipulation, there are sometimes very detailed requirements in Germany.
In some cases, the audited administrations ignored these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, the decisions on the selection of candidates were not always comprehensible (point 4.4).
In both countries, it is important to ensure that companies interested in submitting bids receive the same information during the bidding phase in the interest of equal competition.
As far as possible, contact between these companies and freelancers who were involved in the preparation of the service description must be prevented in order to avoid anti-competitive agreements.
The relevant regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.
The audited construction administrations in Germany did not comply with these requirements in some cases (No. 4.5).
In both countries, the principle of multi-eyes and the principle of transparency must be observed when opening up offers.
The requirements for labelling, documentation, safekeeping and secrecy of the offers are intended to restrict scope for manipulation and are particularly detailed in Germany.
The tests in both countries revealed only a few complaints (No. 4.6).
In both countries, testing and evaluation of the offers are determined by specifications for the structure and process organization.
The regulations in Germany are more comprehensive, but have not been consistently observed by the audited contracting authorities.
For example, contracting authorities handed over offers to third parties for review without first reviewing the offers and sufficiently documenting abnormalities.
As a result, the offers were inadequately protected against subsequent manipulation (No. 4.7).
At the conclusion of the EU-wide procurement procedures, the companies involved in the competition will be informed about the intended contract before the award of the contract.
This legal protection also has a preventive function against corrupt behaviour.
The Czech Republic also provides for judicial review of non-EU procurement procedures.
Only in a few cases did the contracting authorities fail to meet the specified deadlines or deviated from the bidders' offer in terms of content (No. 4.8).
The documentation of the procurement procedures was not always complete or comprehensible for the audited construction administrations in both countries.
The EU-wide transparency requirement was not sufficiently implemented in the award notices of some procedures.
Some of the shortcomings also reduced the anti-corruption function of the documentation.
The contracting authorities of both countries largely met their reporting and reporting obligations (No. 4.9).
Basics of EU procurement law and corruption prevention
EU procurement law
In order to ensure unrestricted competition within the European Union with the free movement of services and goods, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, among other things, the Procurement Coordination Directive and the Remedies Directive, which had to be transposed into national law by the member states.
The general award principles of the European Union are, in particular, the competition law, the equal treatment law and the prohibition of discrimination, as well as the transparency law.
In order to achieve these goals, the Procurement Coordination Directive contains special regulations for construction work to be awarded throughout the EU.
To this end, their estimated order amounts must reach or exceed the current amount of 5,000,000 euros.
The rules concern in particular the content of the award documents, the publication of certain information before, during and after the award, compliance with deadlines, inter alia for the receipt of tenders, the documentation of the award procedure, the requirements that can be placed on the qualifications of applicants and the Remedies Directive forms the basis for the legal protection of applicants and bidders.
In the event of possible breaches of public procurement law, affected companies can have the decisions of the contracting authorities reviewed in review procedures.
Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the European Union directives into national law.
Prevention of corruption
The importance of preventing corruption
In both countries, there is no legal definition of corruption.
Corruption is generally understood as the abuse of a position of trust for private benefit,
Which is usually initiated by the beneficiaries of these decisions.
Corruption can hamper competition and cause significant economic damage.
It is estimated that the global cost of corruption is 5% of global economic output.
For the European Union, the level of these costs is estimated at 1%.
In the case of contracting authorities, restrictive agreements or unfair practices can call into question trust in the integrity and functioning of the administration.
Preventing corruption is therefore one of the fundamental tasks of public authorities.
They have to check the organisational structure and processes of their administrations for areas particularly at risk of corruption in order to take appropriate safeguards against corruption.
Preventive measures and effective controls can significantly reduce the vulnerability of decision-making processes to corrupt abuse.
The award of public works is generally regarded as a particularly corruption-prone area of work.
Measures to prevent corruption
In Germany, corruption - in particular bribery and bribery as well as the acceptance and approval of benefits - is prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
In order to prevent corruption, the Federal Government has issued a guideline and recommendations on corruption prevention in the Federal Administration. In addition to the risk analysis, the following principles must be observed for the awarding area: Priority of public tenders and open procedures, multi-eyes principle and transparency, fundamental separation of planning, awarding and billing, accurate and complete documentation of the awarding procedures.
In addition, further anti-corruption provisions have been incorporated into the procurement law.
In 2011, the responsible Federal Ministry for Procurement in the area of federal highways introduced an electronically supported control system,
With the awarding data such as the estimated costs and the order amounts as well as information on the freelancers involved are collected nationwide and evaluated for abnormalities.
In the Czech Republic, corruption is also prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
The legal requirements of transparency and equal treatment of bidders as well as the prohibition of all discrimination form the most important basis for preventing corruption.
For public procurement, the Czech government has defined anti-corruption measures in a strategy paper for the years 2011 to 2012 and updated them for the years 2013 to 2014.
Some of the measures recommended in it have already been incorporated into national procurement law and corresponding administrative provisions UM14.
The main provisions of the new legislation are as follows: Lowering the thresholds for smaller contracts, the obligation for the awarding authority to announce contracts in advance, including the reasons for tendering, the prohibition of limiting the number of bidders in closed procedures and thus the abolition of the possibility of bidding by lottery, the introduction of the obligation to publish the contract documents and all annexes, the introduction of the obligation to publish the actual price and the list of subcontractors.
Examination results on the individual phases of the award procedure
Award documents
Award documents The award documents must contain all the information that the bidders need for an appropriate tender.
In particular, the award documents must enable an accurate calculation.
No risks may be transferred to the bidders that cannot be calculated for them.
The award documents consist in particular of the service description and the contract terms.
They also contain the requirements for proving the qualification (suitability) of the bidders as well as the criteria that are decisive for the selection of the most economical offer.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
The requirements of EU law for the procurement documents are aimed in particular at the technical specifications.
These must be equally accessible to all bidders and should limit competition as little as possible.
The service description must always be product neutral.
Therefore, information about products or manufacturers as part of the service description is only permitted under strict conditions.
Avoiding restrictive requirements in the procurement documents is also a fundamental principle of corruption prevention.
In addition, unclear or inaccurate information in the award documents must be avoided, as they open up scope for speculation in the preparation of bids and for manipulation in their evaluation.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar regulations In both countries, the EU legal requirements for the technical specifications are implemented in national law.
The services are basically product-neutral without factory specifications.
As a rule, the individual services must be subdivided into performance units with the respective quantities in detail in the service descriptions.
The prices are to be agreed on the basis of performance units (e.g. euros per meter or per piece).
Only in exceptional cases may services be defined by functional targets.
In any case, the service descriptions must be complete and clear.
They must contain precise quantities and must not include services for which it is not clear whether they are required.
Remuneration according to flat rates or time expenditure should be avoided as much as possible.
These provisions are intended to prevent speculation and manipulation based on indefinite specifications in the procurement documents.
The service descriptions must enable bidders to prepare their bids safely and without extensive preparatory work.
The call for tenders will not be made public until the tender documents have been completed.
Differing regulations
There is no obligation to tender for construction work in lots in the Czech Republic.
If it is possible according to the type of service to be commissioned, the public procurement authorities can divide construction services into several lots.
In Germany, construction services are generally to be divided into lots, separated by quantity (partial lots) and / or by type or subject area (specialist lots).
The aim is to enable medium-sized companies to participate in the competition, expand the number of possible providers and make price agreements more difficult.
This type of award is generally considered the most economical.
In the Czech Republic, evaluation criteria must be stated in the award documents for both EU-wide and national procedures.
This should allow applicants to fully and conclusively identify the criteria according to which their offers should be evaluated.
In Germany, the indication of evaluation criteria in EU-wide announcements, but at the latest in the award documents, is only required for EU-wide award procedures.
In the case of national award procedures, the evaluation criteria are only to be recorded in an internal administrative award note.
In Germany, award documents drawn up by commissioned freelancers may not contain any references to these offices or involved planners or surveyors in the building construction and some road construction administrations.
This is to prevent individual companies from gaining additional information or other undue competitive advantages without the knowledge of the client through contact with these freelancers.
This is also the reason why freelancers are not allowed to send procurement documents or interpret planning documents for inspection.
The contact person of the companies is solely the client.
There is currently no regulation in the Czech Republic.
Additional or modified services, which prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (supplements), are almost always incurred for large construction projects.
In both countries, the legal provisions allow the awarding of supplements to the already commissioned company to a certain extent, without the need for a public procurement procedure.
According to EU regulations and German regulations, the remuneration of supplementary services must not exceed half of the main order.
In addition, the additional services must not be separated from the main order without significant disadvantages or must be absolutely necessary.
In the Czech Republic, there is a narrower limit of 20% for awarding contracts without public notice.
However, this may increase the risk of delayed completion of the construction project or the need to involve an additional contractor in the construction work already underway.
If supplementary services are also transferred to the already commissioned company, an arbitrary price increase for these services by the contractor is not possible according to the regulations in Germany.
In determining the remuneration for the additional services, the agreed prices and the basis for determining the price of the order already placed must be assumed.
In addition to supplementary services, there may also be a reduction in the scope of services.
In the Czech Republic, reduced quantities cannot be offset against additional supplementary services.
Essential test results
BHR
Technical specifications and product-neutral tendering
In individual cases, the service descriptions contained references to national technical approvals or standards that had already been replaced by Europe-wide standards.
Some performance descriptions also contained product-related specifications - such as for graffiti protection, joint tapes or noise protection panels - without this being necessary.
In some cases, performance requirements were described so accurately that only one product was considered.
Performance lists broken down by partial performance
In none of the examined procedures has the BRH found violations of the commandment to advertise services in principle in a list of services subdivided by partial services.
Completeness of service descriptions
In the vast majority of cases, the procurement documents were completed before the start of the tenders.
In some procedures, the award documents had to be corrected during the offer phase, as some positions or deadlines had changed.
In some cases, the performance lists contained positions where it was not clear whether they were needed.
Almost half of a list of services for demolition work consisted of such demand items.
Lots and scoring criteria
Many awards lacked the prescribed justification as to why the services, which were predominantly advertised to the unskilled, were not further divided into partial lots.
There were no objections when specifying the criteria to be used when evaluating the offers.
References to freelancers
A small part of the service descriptions contained references to the freelancers involved.
Their names were partly on the covers or in attached plans or reports.
In one case, the contracting authority even explicitly asked the applicants to contact the architect "on questions of the tender".
In the building construction sector in particular, the contracting authorities attributed the complaints shown mainly to the omissions of the freelancers commissioned to draw up the service descriptions.
The construction services pointed out the lack of capacity to adequately control the performance descriptions.
NK Catching up
Technical specifications and product-neutral tendering In the public procurement for the construction of a residential building with 12 residential units, a supplier and a specific product brand were specified in the service description.
The registry did not allow the use of comparable products without justification.
During the construction of several university buildings, suppliers and products were also specified in the tender.
Performance descriptions with performance units
In the case of construction projects in some industrial areas, the contracting authority did not clearly specify the scope and type of services required in the service descriptions.
As performance units, it only specified the converted space of the individual buildings in cubic meters.
Completeness of service descriptions
During the construction of a motorway bypass, the service descriptions were changed four times in the period August to September 2009 as part of a non-open procedure,
Because the scope of services had increased significantly and the technical requirements had changed.
Tender documents for social buildings contained inaccurate location information, inadequate preliminary structural investigations and incomplete construction drawings, which meant that additional services had to be commissioned.
During the construction of a large library building, the performance description of the interior contained no requirements for product quality.
As a result of these missing specifications, some subcontractors installed overpriced and unreasonably high quality equipment.
Lots and eligibility criteria
In the Czech Republic, the division of construction measures into partial lots or the awarding of partial contracts is not mandatory.
An examination of the three large sections of the construction of a motorway ring showed that if selected parts had been allocated, savings of up to 31.6 million euros would have been possible at a total cost of 620.3 million euros.
With six different buildings alone, which were the subject of a single contract, 2.5 million euros (25%) could have been saved with a random award.
If the construction of 20 bridges had been awarded in batches, savings of 11.5 million euros (25%) would have been possible compared to a total award.
When awarding road construction services, the central contracting authority specified very extensive reference requirements as suitability criteria.
During the construction of part of a motorway, the contracting authority required bidders in an open procedure to prove at least three road construction projects worth 28 million euros each from the last five years.
In the Czech Republic, a maximum of nine providers met these requirements.
The public procurement of another section of a motorway included six separate construction projects, for which the contracting authority had specified an annual construction volume of at least 480 million euros over the last three years as a criterion for the companies' suitability.
Two thirds of the funds raised for road construction projects in 2008 and 2009 (i.e. 2.5 billion euros out of a total of 3.7 billion euros) were allocated to contracts from a total of five companies that carried out the contracts alone or as a working group.
With 46 award procedures with a contract volume of 528 million euros, only two or even one bidder submitted an offer.
The NK ä mpfer showed that a narrowing of the market potential can lead to significant cost increases.
Additional services
In two cases, when building a motorway bypass, the contracting authority did not use any of the legally prescribed procedures for awarding additional services and did not conclude any written contracts for the additional services.
Due to unclear quantity and quality specifications, additions of up to 63.7 million euros (net) were made in the first case and up to 165.4 million euros (net) in the second case, increasing the respective order volume by 21% and 91% respectively.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In the case of several university buildings, some achievements were not listed in the award documents, although their necessity was already known when the contract was awarded.
Although the scope of these additional services exceeded the limit of 20% of the original contract value laid down in national procurement law, the contracting authority conducted negotiated procedures with the contracted companies without notice.
In the construction of a large court building, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional construction work in negotiated procedures without tendering.
During the construction period, the contracting authority expanded the scope of the work by 2 million euros.
The standard prices for the additional construction services awarded without competition were significantly higher than comparable services provided by the same company.
Other findings
On the basis of a random examination of construction projects, the NK K ä mpfer found that the average cost of building a four-lane motorway kilometre in the Czech Republic is up to 14.6 million euros.
In Germany, on the other hand, according to an evaluation of long-term data from the Federal Ministry of Construction, the average cost of a four-lane motorway kilometre is up to 10.4 million euros.
This comparison suggests that motorway construction in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.
Summary findings
The basic rules governing the procurement documents are largely identical in both countries and take EU requirements into account.
They serve both comprehensive and fair competition and the prevention of corruption.
For example, the requirement for the sufficient certainty of the service descriptions should enable bidders to calculate and prepare their offers appropriately,
Protect the client from additional services to be agreed retrospectively and also curb speculative scope.
In Germany, the common basic requirements for the award documents are supplemented by regulations aimed at further reducing restrictions on competition and possibilities for manipulation.
There are no requirements to this extent in the Czech Republic, but transparency is increased by publishing the evaluation criteria for non-EU procurement procedures.
The requirements for the performance description have largely been met in both countries.
In some cases, however, deviations had to be objected to, which may also have led to restrictions on competition.
The requirement to form lots in Germany promotes competition and leads to economic results.
In the Czech Republic, according to the audit findings of the NK K ä mpfer, the awarding of extensive services without lots or with only very large lots can result in restrictions of the provider field to only a few large companies.
The extensive reference requirements for road construction in the Czech Republic have meant that public contracts are only awarded to a narrow circle of suppliers and that small and medium-sized enterprises are not allowed to compete.
A limited number of competitors also often lead to higher prices and increase the risk of price or other agreements.
The regulatory approaches in both countries differ when awarding and remunerating additional or modified services.
According to EU requirements and German regulations, supplementary services with a value of up to half of the main contract can be awarded under certain conditions without award procedures with public notice.
In the Czech Republic, there is a narrower limit of 20% up to which additional services can be awarded to the original contractor in the negotiated procedure without notice.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
This limit is often exceeded,
Because the scope of services for public contracts is often insufficiently determined.
If the excess is greater than 20%, the additional services must be advertised with public notice.
By dividing services into lots, restrictions on competition and the resulting adverse consequences can be avoided.
Determining the type of award and taking into account the EU threshold
By determining the type of award, the client determines the scope of the number of companies participating in the competition.
It can leave the circle of potential applicants and bidders largely unrestricted, for example by choosing an open procedure, or by specifying non-public procurement procedures.
Europe-wide procurement procedures are to be applied for construction projects where a threshold set by the EU is reached or exceeded.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
When selecting the type of award, the contracting authority must take into account in particular the requirements of European law on competition and transparency.
If the estimated total contract value of the construction work of a project is at or above the EU threshold of currently 5,000,000 euros, the construction work must be awarded Europe-wide according to open or non-open procedures.
In exceptional cases, negotiation procedures or competitive dialogue are also possible.
For construction projects that reach or exceed the EU threshold, the contracting authority may deviate to a limited extent from the principle of Europe-wide procurement and award works in national procurement procedures, provided that the estimated contract value of the respective lot is less than 1,000,000 euros and the sum of these lots does not exceed 20% of the estimated total contract value of all construction contracts.
A uniform construction project must not be divided into individual measures without compelling reason or consciously estimated at too low cost values in order to withdraw it from the obligation to award construction services across Europe.
As restrictions on competition significantly increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of award method is of great importance in preventing corruption.
The detailed justification of the selected type of award as well as the examination of the obligation to apply EU procurement rules are important components of the documentation of the award procedure.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have fully transposed the EU rules on procurement procedures and thresholds into national law.
Differing regulations
The Czech Republic has also transferred the fundamental equality of open and non-open procedures contained in the EU Directive to its construction contracts, which are not subject to EU requirements.
There is freedom of choice between the open and the non-open procedure, without the decision having to be documented or justified. Other procedures, however, are only possible under certain legally defined conditions.
In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure or - in the case of national contracts - the public tender takes precedence. This is stipulated by budget and procurement law as well as by the directives on corruption prevention.
Other types of award - such as the non-open procedure or the limited tender procedure - are only possible in exceptional cases, which are finally regulated in the procurement law.
The existence of an exceptional case must be clearly justified and documented.
The principle of the primacy of the open procedure or the public tender is intended to ensure as unlimited competition as possible, to exclude the possibility of manipulation by specifying certain bidders and to make it more difficult for bidders to agree on prices.
The principle of public tendering is a key element in preventing corruption in Germany.
The correct estimation of the prospective contract value is an essential basis for choosing the right type of contract.
The construction services in Germany can use planning and cost databases of public administrations and other organisations to determine the expected costs in the area of public building construction.
These databases are based on evaluations of completed construction projects. The databases contain cost parameters for building categories, usage units, components or individual construction services.
On the basis of such cost parameters, the estimated order value of a planned advance or a construction work to be awarded can be determined.
Only a few construction administrations in Germany have appropriate cost databases for road construction.
However, a nationwide introduction is planned for all road construction administrations.
Contracting authorities in the Czech Republic cannot rely on central databases or average price calculations of comparable construction measures to determine the estimated costs of construction work.
In most cases, the cost estimates are based on estimates by the financing body or are based on the amount of funds made available to the construction site.
Measures to standardize cost determination procedures are still in their infancy.
As part of the anti-corruption plan for 2011-2012, the responsible ministries were commissioned to create a database for standardised building materials and materials.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In this database, information on the cost of materials and on construction and fit-out trades as well as other cost-relevant data will be recorded in order to enable cost determination and determination of unit prices.
The Czech Ministry of Transport has also published a data collection for construction projects to improve cost control,
Which will serve as a benchmark for pricing in the financing plan and is currently being updated.
Key test results BRH
Choice of award procedure
The audited contracting authorities tendered the construction work largely in an open procedure or in a public tender and thus followed the budgetary and procurement requirements.
In 2011, 59.5% of the federal government's construction work in building construction was tendered publicly or in an open process.
In road construction, this proportion was 94.8%.
The choice of non-public procurement methods lacked detailed reasons why the contracting authorities had to deviate from the principle of open procedure or public tendering.
On the basis of more than 16,000 procurement procedures, the BRH found in a cross-sectional investigation that the non-public types of procurement have significant disadvantages in terms of competition compared to open procedures and public tenders and increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.
In building construction, more than twice as many tenders were submitted for public tenders as for restricted tenders and almost three times as many tenders as for hands-free tenders.
The investigation also showed that tender prices for limited tenders and open contracts were on average 6% and 10% higher than for public tenders.
Parallel investigations by the Federal Building Ministry and a Land Audit Office confirmed the differences in profitability between public and non-public procurement types.
As a result of its cost-effectiveness studies, the Federal Building Ministry even found twice as high differences between public and non-public procurement procedures.
Taking the EU threshold into account
As a rule, the audited contracting authorities drew up procurement plans for the construction projects for which they had determined an estimated total contract amount of more than 5,000,000 euros, in which they determined the construction works to be awarded according to EU and national procurement procedures.
According to the award plans, a share of more than 80% of the construction work was to be awarded throughout the EU.
It was not possible to circumvent the obligation to award contracts across the EU by underestimating costs.
However, partly as a result of erroneous calculations, the minimum proportion of EU procurement procedures was actually undercut.
During construction, some contracting authorities improperly changed the specifications of their procurement plans.
They did not justify these changes and did not prove that the minimum proportion of EU-wide procurement procedures was still observed.
For most of the construction measures audited, the proportion of EU-wide contracts according to the settlement results was usually lower than envisaged under the procurement plan.
In some cases, for construction projects above the EU threshold, the contracting authorities violated the requirement to tender all 1,000,000 euros and more in EU-wide procedures,
And chose national procedures instead.
NK Catching up
Choice of award type
In several major construction projects, such as the construction of some motorway sections, construction projects as part of a major sporting event and housing projects, the contracting authorities divided construction work into several sub-contracts, although these services were similar or comparable.
As a result of these divisions, the individual benefits were no longer above the threshold and were then awarded in simplified procedures or even in violation of legal requirements.
Calculation methods for the estimated order value
In road construction, the existing price databases for this area were only an inadequate instrument for determining the expected order values.
The data were based on just completed construction projects, but there were indications of a lack of profitability, unnecessary additional effort or excessive profits of the contracted companies.
For three sections of a motorway ring, the actual prices were about 37% below the estimated order values determined using the database.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Transport revised the databases to take into account not only the supply prices of recent years, but also comparable market prices and price increase indices in the construction sector.
In building construction, the projected order values were based on cost values estimated by the project architects or on estimates by investors.
The actual order values deviated greatly from the estimates.
The estimated price for the conversion or expansion of a large library was twice as high as the later agreed contract value, but eight additions in the course of construction led to a cost increase of 2.1 million euros or 27%.
Similarly, the actual contract value for the construction of a library depot was 33% lower than the estimated price, with cost increases in the construction phase.
In other cases, supply prices exceeded estimates and increased during construction.
The estimated price for the construction of a large library was exceeded by 16 million euros or 22%. The costs for the construction of a judicial building rose disproportionately by 139%, as the usable space had only increased by 12%.
Summary findings
Both countries have transposed the EU regulations for determining the type of award and for taking the EU threshold value into account into national law.
However, the primacy of the open procedure or public tender in Germany goes beyond the EU requirements and the regulations applicable in the Czech Republic.
Compared to non-public procurement procedures, more companies have the opportunity to compete in public procedures or public tenders.
Public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of tenders and the most economic results.
The risk of corruption is significantly improved by not restricting the field of applicants by manipulation-prone stipulations of the client and by making price agreements between the bidders more difficult.
The investigations have confirmed the advantages of the primacy of the open procedure or public tender in Germany.
Under Czech law, contracting authorities can award contracts in open or non-open procedures.
According to the latest changes in public procurement law, the number of bidders may no longer be limited in proceedings with previous competition.
This means that the non-open procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.
In Germany, the contracting authorities have largely complied with the requirements for the primacy of the open procedure or the public tender. In the Czech Republic, some services have been distributed inadmissibly in order to circumvent the requirements for the choice of the type of award.
When taking the EU threshold into account, errors had to be detected in Germany, which resulted in a fall below the minimum proportion of EU-wide tendered services.
In the Czech Republic, there is still no satisfactory solution to accurately determine the estimated costs of construction work and construction projects.
If necessary, the construction administrations should ensure through further checks that the specifications for the choice of the type of contract and the scope of services to be tendered throughout the EU are complied with or that the conditions are created for appropriate cost assessments.
Preliminary information and announcement
In the case of construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe, the public contractor must inform interested companies about the planned contracts in advance of the tender.
Preliminary information and announcements form an important basis for Europe-wide competition.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
The preliminary information should contain the essential procurement information on the planned construction projects.
They are required for those construction projects where the estimated total contract value reaches or exceeds the EU threshold and where the contracting authority wants to shorten the tender periods for open or non-open procedures.
In announcements, the client must provide more details about the planned Europe-wide construction contracts.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Among other things, it has to make known the scope of services, the process and execution dates, the special requirements as well as the evaluation criteria and their weighting.
The common procurement vocabulary (CPV codes), which is standardized throughout Europe, must be used to describe the subject of the order.
Preliminary information and announcements will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the purchaser's profile.
In order to prevent discrimination against foreign interested parties, announcements at national level may not contain any additional information and may only be issued after the announcement text has been sent to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union.
Incomplete or inaccurate information in the announcement may affect competition and may even support manipulation.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have fully transposed the EU legal requirements for prior information and publication into national law.
Differing regulations
In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and announcements must also be published in the case of construction work not to be awarded across Europe.
Procurement procedures may not start until one month after the preliminary information has been sent to the EU Official Journal (for EU-wide contracts) or the national Official Journal (for all contracts).
The publication of preliminary information can only be dispensed with in exceptional cases.
In Germany, no preliminary information is required for non-EU procurement procedures.
Announcements for public tenders and participation competitions prior to restricted tenders must be published on the federal internet portal and, if necessary, in newspapers or magazines.
In the case of limited invitations to tender without competition, announcements of services to be awarded from 25,000 euros are mandatory (ex ante transparency).
All planned lots of the construction projects are to be listed in the preliminary information.
In Germany, this is of particular importance because of the small size of the loose construction contracts.
In the Czech Republic, this regulation has only a small impact, as much less construction work is divided into lots.
Essential test results
BRH
Preliminary information
The contracting authorities examined published preliminary information on all audited construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe.
In some open procedures, however, they shortened the offer periods, even though the 52 days required between the submissions of the preliminary information and the announcements had not yet expired.
Other shortened procedures were only advertised after the twelve-month period of validity of the preliminary information had expired and before it was extended.
Many published preliminary information lacked references to the planned division of construction services into lots.
Announcements
The announcements of the audited bodies partly contained CPV codes that deviated from the information provided in the preliminary information or did not accurately record the required services.
In individual cases, notices at national level were published earlier or contained more information - e.g. on the implementation deadlines - than the notices in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Ex-ante transparency
The contracting authorities of an audited construction administration had commissioned a service company to publish the national procurement procedures.
It published the reports on its own paid award platform.
However, the contracting authorities did not check whether the company had forwarded the reports to the free internet portal of the federal government as required.
Samples showed that only a third of the audited administration's reports were published on this portal.
NK Catching up
Announcements
When building a wastewater treatment plant, the contracting authority did not specify in its notice the criteria on the basis of which it wanted to select the bidders.
The awarding authority could not prove how the bidders were selected.
The restriction of the number of bidders was permitted under the law in force at the time.
In the case of the construction of a motorway ring, the contracting authority did not specify in detail in the notice or in the documentation of the award procedure, according to which it wanted to evaluate the qualifications of the applicants and how many applicants it wanted to admit to the competition.
The awarding authority concluded that all six applicants met the qualification requirements, but excluded the candidate with the worst ratings from the further procedure.
The procedure of the contracting authority was not transparent, because it had not disclosed information on the qualification criteria and the evaluation procedure at any time during the procedure.
Publication of the announcements
During the renovation of the former military site, the contracting authority did not publish the tender.
Summary findings
The two-stage information system with advance information and notification is an important component for implementing the transparency requirement for Europe-wide procurement, strengthening competition and thus preventing corruption.
Both countries have implemented the EU requirements and increased the transparency of their procurement procedures in the national procurement area:
Selection of applicants for non-public award types
Unlike public procurement procedures, non-public procurement procedures do not allow every company interested in the execution of the services to be awarded to participate in the competition.
In the case of non-public procurement procedures, the contracting authority has to make a selection in advance as to which companies should be invited to submit bids.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention The EU regulations allow a limitation of the number of applicants for EU-wide non-public procurement procedures.
In the case of non-open procedures, however, at least five companies are to be invited to submit bids.
At least three companies are to be invited to participate in negotiated procedures with tender notices.
In any case, the number of invited applicants must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be announced in advance.
The selection of companies to be requested is a process within the procurement procedure that is highly susceptible to manipulation, for example by allowing certain companies to be given unilateral preference.
In addition, restricting competition to a few companies also favours possible agreements between applicants.
In both cases, the award result can be significantly impaired at the expense of the client.
The contracting authorities must therefore take special precautions against possible manipulation, carry out adequate checks and, in particular, ensure the transparency and traceability of this procedural step.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar regulations
The rules for selecting applicants are similar in both countries.
In addition to the EU requirements, the contracting authorities should change as often as possible among the companies to be invited when selecting applicants.
Nor should competition be restricted to companies established in certain regions.
The awarding authorities must justify the selection of applicants and document the course of the selection process in their award notes.
Differing regulations
In Germany, at least three suitable applicants must be invited to submit bids for limited tenders and, in the case of open contracts, several suitable applicants.
Under the new Czech rules, except for two special areas, it is inadmissible to limit the number of bidders in non-open and negotiated procedures.
In Germany, the multi-eyes principle must be observed when selecting companies.
For example, if an employee has proposed a number of companies for a non-public procurement procedure, the management level of the construction site or a contracting authority representative must usually amend this proposal, for example by removing a proposed company and / or adding a new company.
The aim is to prevent a single person from conclusively determining the group of companies to be involved in the competition.
Otherwise, in the case of manipulative intentions, this could enable far-reaching agreements between the parties.
The list of companies to be requested must be treated confidentially - also with regard to freelancers - and not made generally available.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In the Czech Republic, there are no corresponding regulations for the establishment and secrecy of candidate lists.
Under the German regulations, freelancers are not allowed to determine the companies to be requested, but can only submit proposals to the contracting authority.
There is a loophole in Czech legislation.
Essential test results
BRH
Number of applicants
With a few exceptions, the requirement to require a minimum number of companies to submit bids for non-public contracts was met.
An evaluation by the BRH of almost 7,000 non-Europe-wide procurement procedures for construction services in building construction revealed that the contracting authorities called on an average of 6.6 companies to submit tenders for limited federal tenders in Germany and an average of 4.4 companies for open contracts.
Change of companies and regional restrictions
Especially for trades with a few providers, the contracting authorities did not always change the circle of selected applicants.
Above all, they took into account companies already known to them and proven from their point of view.
As a reason for this, they stated that in non-public proceedings they had to ensure the suitability of the companies to be invited to compete even before the invitation to submit an offer.
The BRH did not find an inadmissible restriction to regional bidders in the non-public procurement procedures, but a higher proportion of regionally based companies than in public tenders.
The contracting authorities attributed this mainly to the fact that the scope of services in non-public procurement procedures is on average much lower and therefore, for example, longer distances are more important than in public tenders.
Multi-eyes principle and suggestions Freelancer
Contrary to the rules, the contracting authorities largely failed to have an independent person amend the proposed list of companies to be requested.
They justified this in particular with a lack of processing capacity, deadline pressure or insufficient knowledge of alternative suitable companies.
It was often not documented who had proposed the companies invited to submit bids.
Some samples showed that freelancers had drawn up the application lists and that these proposals had been adopted unchanged by the contracting authorities.
Thus, the contracting authorities did not protect themselves against possible manipulation to the extent required.
Confidential handling of bidding lists
At a contracting authority, the lists of the companies to be requested were recorded in a data processing system that could be viewed by all employees of this service.
In the case of manipulative intentions, the names of the intended or approved companies could have been passed on unauthorized and, for example, could have allowed agreements between these companies.
Documentation
The documentation of the award procedures contained only in a few cases reasons for the selection of applicants.
NK Catching up
Selection of candidates
During the construction of a motorway ring, the bidders did not receive any information on the evaluation criteria and the evaluation procedures.
In the case of the non-open procedures for the development and modernisation of waterways and ports, the notices did not specify how the selection of candidates should be carried out.
In one process, all eight participating applicants met the qualification requirements, exceeding the specified maximum number of companies to be admitted.
The award committee then conducted a lottery to select the companies.
However, this approach, which was generally permissible at the time, should have been cited as one of the criteria in the notice.
Summary findings
Due to the high risk of manipulation in the selection of candidates in non-public procurement procedures, both countries have taken special precautions to prevent undue restrictions on competition.
With the multi-eyes principle, the secrecy of the bidding lists and the sole authority of the contracting authorities to propose the companies to be requested, the German requirements limit such abuse possibilities.
In the case of the Czech regulations, the newly introduced requirement of the largely unlimited number of bidders in non-public proceedings can counteract possible manipulative restrictions.
However, the audit findings have shown that some of these requirements have not been adequately implemented and the potential for manipulation for abusive restriction of the field of participants has not been sufficiently reduced in these cases.
The contracting authorities should completely eliminate the shortcomings identified.
Offer phase
The tender phase begins with the announcement of the award or the invitation to tender, during which the companies can draw up bids on the basis of the award documents sent to them.
Applicants can submit their bids until the end of the offer period set by the awarding authority.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
There are no separate EU legal requirements for this phase of the procurement process.
The contracting authorities have to observe the national regulations, which are intended to counteract the manipulation possibilities that exist during the offer phase.
These are mainly organisational requirements and controls.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar regulations
The award documents, on the basis of which the companies are to prepare their bids, are only to be sent by the awarding authority.
Freelancers involved in the award process are not allowed to perform this task.
The awarding authority must ensure that all applicants receive the same information during the offer phase.
In case of ambiguities in the award documents or other questions about the tender, only the awarding authority may provide information to the applicants.
Freelancers commissioned to prepare the award documents may not provide any information.
During the entire offer phase, contact between the commissioned freelancers and the applicants must be prevented.
Freelancers must not become a hub of the award procedure through which contacts can be made with anti-competitive consequences.
Bids sent by post or directly must be submitted in a sealed envelope.
Electronically transmitted offers have a technical encryption.
Differing regulations
In Germany, the contracting authority can also commission external service companies with the printing and dispatch of the procurement documents, whose employees are obliged to keep the offers confidential and to conscientiously fulfil the contractual obligations.
In Germany, the bids received must be marked with an entry stamp and sent directly, immediately and unopened to an employee responsible for custody.
This employee may not be involved in the award.
The received offers are to be kept under lock and key until the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, bids received are marked with a file number.
The contracting authority records the offer data, including order numbers, as well as the creation and receipt details in a protocol.
The safekeeping of offers is not regulated in the Czech Republic.
Essential test results
BRH
The tests for the tender phase focused primarily on the procurement procedures of a building construction administration.
Dispatch of the award documents
The contracting authorities of the audited building management sent the procurement documents themselves or had them printed and sent by an external service provider.
Freelancers did not send any award documents.
Information to applicants
The audited building administration did not comply with the requirements for the separation of planning and awarding when appointing the contact persons for queries and information.
Contrary to the specifications, she did not specify employees from the contracting authority in the service descriptions, but from the project managers as contact persons.
Some award documents even contained the names of the freelancers who had created the performance descriptions.
In individual cases, not all applicants received the same information during the offer phase.
Identification of offers
All bids received by the audited building administration were stamped with an entrance stamp and entry note.
In some freelance contracts, however, the offers were received by freelancers, which contradicted the requirements for corruption prevention.
Keeping the offers safe
After labelling, not all bids were sent directly and immediately to the custodian, who enclosed the bids in a steel cabinet.
In the meantime, the offers were stored in an open compartment of the post office, to which every employee had access.
Another department had hung up a letterbox in a corridor that was not constantly monitored, in which some of the offers made there even stayed overnight.
Since the slot in this letterbox was large and unsecured, not only employees, but also visitors to the department would have had the opportunity to take out offers received and, if necessary, manipulate them.
NK Catching up
On the Czech side, no defects were reported.
Summary findings
During the bidding phase, contacts between interested companies and freelancers involved in the procurement process will be prevented in both countries.
By providing all bidders with the same information, the principle of equal treatment should also be respected.
The regulations on receipt, custody and secrecy of the offers appear suitable to counteract manipulation and corruption.
The corresponding requirements in Germany are somewhat more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
The results of the investigation in Germany have revealed violations of the regulations in some areas.
These shortcomings could be remedied with little effort.
Opening of offers
Opening of offers
During the opening date, the previously closed offers will be opened and their contents will be read out and thus made known.
From the opening date, the bidders are bound to their bids until the deadline set by the awarding authority.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
There are no separate EU regulations for the opening of offers.
However, the national regulations on corruption prevention contain extensive requirements for the protection of tenders and competition for this highly sensitive phase of the procurement procedure.
The multi-eyes principle as well as the transparency and traceability of the offer opening are intended to prevent manipulation and changes to the submitted offers.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar regulations
The opening date is to be carried out by several persons to be determined by the registry.
The multi-eye principle is intended to prevent individuals from uncontrollably manipulating the offers when opening them.
In most award procedures, bidders can participate in the opening date.
Only offers submitted to the negotiator at the opening of the first offer are allowed.
Late bids may no longer be considered.
In order to ensure the transparency of the opening date, the actions taken and the results of the opening of the offer must be recorded in a protocol in which, among other things, the names of the bidders and the offer prices must be recorded.
The minutes must be read out and signed by the negotiators.
It can also be signed by the bidders present.
Differing regulations
In the Czech Republic, a committee is conducting the opening of bids.
Freelancers can also participate.
The committee can also be entrusted with further phases of the award procedure, such as the evaluation of bids.
In Germany, a negotiator and a secretary open the offer.
The negotiator must be an employee of the tendering body.
The negotiator and, in the case of contracts in building construction, the secretary should not be involved in the processing of the award documents or in the award and contract processing.
In the minutes of the opening date, according to the German regulations, in addition to the offer prices, information about discounts and discounts as well as special features such as damaged or delayed offers must be recorded.
In the Czech Republic, in addition to the offer price, only the language of the offer and the applicant's signature authority are recorded.
The German regulations stipulate that the open offers must be marked in all parts in such a way as to prevent subsequent changes and additions.
The offers are usually marked by perforations with the date of the opening date. They must be kept secret after the opening date and may only be made available to persons directly responsible for processing.
There are no corresponding Czech regulations.
If only one tender is received in the Czech Republic, it must not be opened and must be returned unvalued.
There is no such regulation in Germany. If only one offer is received, it must be opened and then evaluated.

Multi-eye principle
At the opening dates, the audited contracting authorities implemented the specifications for the MoreEye principle.
They carried out the opening dates with negotiators and secretaries who were not charged with any other procurement procedures.
However, in the case of freelance contracts with a smaller scope of services, there were isolated cases in which freelancers opened offers sent to them without the participation of the contracting authority.
Protocol
In the minutes of the opening dates, the opening of the offers was not always fully documented.
In some cases, for example, the late bids were not entered, in some cases even signatures were missing.
Identification of offers
The contracting authorities examined as part of the cross-sectional review marked the offers according to the specifications with a perforation with the date of the opening date.
Inadequate labelling had been found in recent audits of some beneficiaries.
However, these contracting authorities changed their labelling practices after the complaint by the BRH.

Offer period
When awarding road maintenance measures, an offer was received by the contracting authority only one month after the end of the offer period.
Summary findings
The regulations of both countries for the opening of the offers agree in significant parts. They take into account both the multi-eyes principle and the principle of transparency. This can significantly limit the risks of corruption and manipulation when opening the offers.
The requirements in Germany are more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
In particular, the requirements for the exact documentation of the procedure as well as for the labelling, safe storage and secrecy of the offers significantly limit manipulation possibilities such as subsequent changes to the offers.
In addition, the persons responsible for opening the offers may not perform any other tasks in connection with the service to be awarded.
The overall few complaints prove the high acceptance of the requirements for the opening of the offer.
Examination and evaluation of offers
Examination and evaluation of the offers The client must examine and evaluate the offers available at the opening date.
It must determine the bid for the award of the contract that best meets the requirements according to the specified award criteria.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
The EU guidelines provide for a multi-stage procedure:
First, the suitability of the bidders must be determined.
Bidders must be economically and financially efficient and have the necessary professional and technical expertise.
Companies that are legally convicted of bribery or fraud, for example, are generally excluded from participation in the award process.
The bids of the not excluded bidders must be checked mathematically, technically and economically and evaluated on the basis of the previously announced award criteria.
The client has to determine the most economically advantageous offer. Offers with unusually low prices have to be examined by the client in particular.
The review and evaluation of tenders is a particularly susceptible phase of the award process.
For example, bidders can be unjustifiably excluded or bids that do not meet the requirements can be left in competition.
By favouring or disadvantaging bidders, the valuation result can be adversely affected and thus the determination of the economically most advantageous offer can be prevented.
The contracting authority must therefore take special precautions to ensure that the persons responsible for the audit and evaluation meet the requirements for integrity and expertise.
It must also ensure the transparency and traceability of the procedure and the decisions taken.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar regulations
In accordance with EU requirements, offers in both countries must be examined and evaluated in multi-stage procedures.
The requirements for the companies' proof of suitability to be submitted as well as the award criteria to be taken into account in the evaluation and their weighting are specified in the notices or in the award documents and cannot be changed during the procedure.
After checking the suitability of bids, the eligibility criteria may no longer be used in the evaluation of bids.
The evaluation must be limited to the award criteria.
The submitted bids must first be formally checked immediately to see whether they are complete and whether they contain, for example, abnormalities that could indicate possible manipulation intentions.
If bidders are excluded from further examination and evaluation of their offers, they must be informed immediately.
If the evaluation of the bids results in an unreasonably low price, the bidder must be given the opportunity to comment before a possible exclusion of his offer.
The decisions made during the review and evaluation of the offers must be documented in a comprehensible manner.
Differing regulations
In Germany, the offers to be kept secret may only be made available to the persons directly responsible for processing them.
Only the contracting authority may carry out the review of the offers and the mathematical examination of the offers.
It must only appoint staff who are not involved in the award decision or the implementation of the measure.
The performance of further examination and evaluation tasks is not regulated in detail.
If freelancers are entrusted with the examination and evaluation, they must treat the offers confidentially.
They may only make suggestions for the decisions to be taken by the contracting authorities.
In the Czech Republic, award committees must be set up to examine and evaluate bids.
The committees prepare evaluation reports with award proposals.
Ultimately, as in Germany, only the contracting authorities have to decide on the contracts.
If evidence or declarations required for the submission of bids are only incomplete in Germany, the contracting authority must give the bidders the opportunity to submit the missing documents within six days.
Only if the documents are still not available after the deadline, the offer is excluded from the evaluation.
In the Czech Republic, it is at the discretion of the awarding authority whether it gives bidders the opportunity to complete missing evidence or declarations.
If a bidder fails to do so, he must be excluded.
In Germany, in addition to the total price, the standard prices (prices for partial services) of the offers must also be investigated.
If, due to the price structure of the offer, there are indications of prices being set too low or too high for partial services, the bidder must be asked to remove these ambiguities.
If he does not succeed and the contracting authority can provide proof of a mixed calculation of prices, this offer must be excluded.
This is to prevent bidders from speculating on significant volume changes in partial services when calculating their offer, which can lead to significant cost increases in the construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, the total price is assessed, but not the adequacy of the prices for partial services.
A mixed calculation cannot justify the exclusion of an offer.
Bids with unreasonably high or low prices may not be awarded in Germany.
If one or more bids fall short of the correct price determination of the client or the bid totals of the other bidders by 10% or more, the bidders must prove the correct calculation of their bids.
If this is not possible, the contracting authority can exclude the relevant offers.
In the Czech Republic, the call for tenders can be cancelled after an economic assessment if only bids with unjustifiable low prices are available.
In contrast to German procurement law, the knockdown cannot be refused for offers with prices significantly higher than the client's calculation for this reason.
If there is a suspicion of restrictive behaviour in Germany, the contracting authority must immediately report to its specialist supervisory authority.
It has to decide which measures should be taken and whether the antitrust authority or the public prosecutor's office should be informed.
The supervising level must also agree, for example, for construction work over 50,000 euros, if the contract is to be awarded by hand, if a contract is not to be awarded on the offer with the lowest price or if the tender is to be cancelled.
There are no such regulations in the Czech Republic.

Suitability and evaluation criteria
The vast majority of the procurement procedures audited complied with the listed requirements.
For some companies proposed by freelancers, the contracting authorities did not check the suitability of the companies themselves.
A grant recipient commissioned companies without the required proof of suitability being available in full.
In some cases, it was not clear whether the awarding authority had taken into account all the announced award criteria in its selection decision or whether it had based its award decision solely on the criterion of "price".
Selection of the persons involved and confidentiality of offers
Some contracting authorities used unauthorised persons to check the offers.
Freelancers or employees involved in the planning or implementation of a construction project carried out tasks that could only be performed by employees of the contracting authority.
The construction services justified this with insufficient personnel capacity in the respective areas.
In some cases, the freelancers commissioned to examine the offers also included employees who were not obliged to keep the offers secret and to conscientiously fulfil the contractual obligations.
For the construction services, it was usually not comprehensible whether the offers from freelancers were only accessible to the persons directly responsible for processing.
Review and computational review of offers
Some contracting authorities handed over the open offers to freelancers for further examination, without having previously carried out the prescribed review of the offers and the computational examination itself and documented their results.
In the case of manipulative intentions, third parties could have made changes to the offers without this being comprehensible to the contracting authorities.
In the audited documents, abnormalities or missing price or product information were sometimes not or only insufficiently marked.
Performance audits
In a sample in a building administration, the cheapest tenders deviated more than 10% from the previously determined estimated costs in three quarters of the examined procurement procedures.
Every twentieth award procedure has been cancelled due to inappropriate bid prices.
Not all bid reviews and clarification discussions with the bidders were comprehensible or sufficiently documented.
In many cases, there was a lack of further clarification, such as on the unit prices of the most important items.
The deviations were often only justified on a flat-rate basis, for example by indications of changed market prices or increased material costs.
The construction services explained that it was difficult to identify and prove mixed calculations.
In the case of a tender by an institution under public law, the offer price of the cheapest offer was 66% below the previously determined estimated value of these services.
Further calculations or investigations into the causes of this deviation were not documented.
In a briefing, the contracting authority found no evidence of price dumping by the company commissioned.
It remained unclear whether the estimated value was excessive or the offer price was too low.
Later, the client rated the contracted company as a "cheap company" that could not meet quality or deadlines.
In another tender, a construction service awarded the contract for an offer whose price was 35% higher than the value of the cost calculation.
She did not cancel the call for tenders and cited the inappropriate justification that this company could be concluded to have an adequate calculation.
Suspicion of irregularities
There were two cases of irregularities in an audited construction administration, both of which were reported to the technical supervisory level.
In one of the cases, the calculation of two bidders was identical in a tender, so that the contracting authority excluded both bids from the process.
When applying the other regulations, the audits did not reveal any significant objections.
NK Catching up
Aptitude test
For many of the construction projects examined, including university construction, road construction and the expansion of the rail network, the contracting authorities did not exclude bidders from the procedure, even though they did not meet the requirements specified in the tender documents or could not prove their suitability to the prescribed extent. On the other hand, in one case, a contracting authority could neither prove nor explain why it had excluded a bidder who had met the requirements.
Scoring
When awarding construction services for a water treatment plant, the contracting authority did not take the specified evaluation criteria into account when examining and evaluating the offers.
In a construction project for the expansion of the rail network, the awarding authority determined the weighting of the evaluation criteria only at the beginning of the evaluation.
In the case of road maintenance measures, the given criterion "shortening the construction phase" was incorrectly evaluated in a procedure.
As a result, the offered reduction was not sufficiently taken into account by the second and third bidders.
Documentation of the selection of offers
In three tendering procedures in the context of housing development, the contracting authority did not document which criteria it had applied and on which basis it had selected the successful bidder.
When building a motorway, the contracting authority selected the companies for smaller orders of up to 20,000 euros based on telephone surveys on prices and delivery conditions alone.
Examinations of this selection were not possible because the surveys were not documented.
Summary findings
The regulations for the examination and evaluation of offers in both countries comply with the requirements of the EU.
However, the details of the procedure and the selection of the persons involved differ from each other.
In Germany, the procedure is more tightly regulated than in the Czech Republic by detailed requirements, especially for the implementation of the multi-eyes principle and for the protection of offers.
The same applies to the specifications on the basis of which the adequacy of the prices offered must be checked.
In both countries, it had to be established in some of the audited procurement procedures that significant procedural steps in the examination and evaluation of the tenders were not or only insufficiently documented.
However, without traceability and transparency of the audit and evaluation decisions, possible manipulative interventions are favoured.
A particularly serious defect was the handing over of all offers to third parties without the contracting authority having sufficiently reviewed and documented the offers beforehand, thus protecting them from possible manipulation in the further proceedings.
If contracting authorities have tasks carried out by third parties in the examination and evaluation of the offers, sufficient precautions and an increased control effort are required to counter the increased risk of manipulation.
When assessing the adequacy of prices, the audited services in Germany did not always make full use of the prescribed instruments and did not adequately examine the price structure of the offers.
In the Czech Republic, there were complaints mainly about the aptitude test and the application of the evaluation criteria.
Conclusion of the award process
After examining and evaluating the bids, the award procedure is completed by awarding the contract or by cancelling the procedure.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption
In EU-wide procurement procedures, all bidders must be informed in advance of the planned award decision.
The companies have the opportunity to check the intended award in the case of information by electronic means or by fax within 10 days or in the case of other means of communication within 15 days and, if necessary, to initiate a review procedure.
A contract may not be concluded before the end of this information period.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
If a bidder submits a request for review within the information period, a contract can only be concluded after the final decision in the review procedure.
Companies can also have the award decision reviewed by an independent court as part of this review process.
The review procedure is intended to ensure the legal protection of companies and to encourage the contracting authority to comply with public procurement law throughout the procurement process.
To do so, he must document the procedure sufficiently.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have implemented EU rules on information and verification procedures.
In both countries, the awarding authority has to decide on the award of the contract.
However, it must not arbitrarily deviate from the result of a proper review and evaluation of the offers.
The client shall place the order within the announced award period,
Also because the bidders are no longer bound by their offers after the deadline.
In the case of open and non-open procedures or public and limited tenders, the client may not deviate from the content of the offer when concluding the contract.
The losing bidders must be informed promptly about the award decision and the reasons for not taking their bids into account.
Award procedures may only be cancelled under certain conditions, for example if the bid prices are excessive or the bids do not meet the requirements of the tender.
Differing regulations
In the Czech Republic, the 10-day and 15-day information and waiting period prior to the award of the contract also applies to non-Europe-wide construction services.
In Germany, these requirements only apply to EU-wide procurement.
In the other procedures in Germany, bidders can only be informed of the award decision after the award of the contract.
In the Czech Republic, an award procedure must be cancelled if only one offer has been received or only one offer could be evaluated.
In Germany, the contract must also be awarded in the case of only one valuable bid, provided that it complies with the conditions of the tender and is economical.
Essential test results
BRH
There were only a few complaints about the audited awards at the conclusion of the award procedures.
In some cases, EU-wide contracts were awarded to companies before the information deadlines expired, which may result in the ineffectiveness of the contract.
In individual cases, order letters according to open procedures also contained content that deviated from the content of the offer, such as changed dates.
In several cases, the contracting authorities did not meet the award deadlines.
In an open procedure, a contracting authority therefore awarded the contract for the second most advantageous offer, since a company with a 50% cheaper offer was no longer willing to carry out the services at the price originally offered after the deadline.
NK Catching up
In the case of a construction project in the higher education sector, the contracting authority deviated from the bidder's offer in terms of content.
For some contracts, for example for road maintenance construction measures, the construction of a motorway and a bypass road, the contracting authorities concluded the contracts after the statutory deadline.
When awarding construction services for the refurbishment of former military sites, the contracting authority only forwarded the notification of the award of the contract to all bidders after the statutory deadline.
Summary findings
Both countries have implemented the requirements of the EU at the end of the procurement process.
The legal protection of the defeated applicants or bidders increases the instruments of corruption prevention.
The scope of legal protection in Czech public procurement law is also extended to contracts below the EU thresholds.
In both countries, the deadlines for awarding contracts have been exceeded.
This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of manipulation.
In future, the construction authorities should avoid the shortcomings identified in the conclusion of their procurement procedures.
Documentation, reporting and reporting obligations
The award procedures must be documented in a comprehensible manner during their individual stages with regard to the relevant findings and the reasons for the individual decisions.
In EU-wide procedures, the contracts awarded must be made public.
The order data is also recorded in EU statistics.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption The documentation of procurement procedures implements a fundamental requirement of the EU-wide transparency requirement.
A carefully and promptly prepared documentation enables the traceability of the award decisions.
In particular, it also serves the effective legal protection of bidders in the event of contracts being awarded above the EU thresholds.
Proper documentation is also an essential part of avoiding corruption, as the obligation to justify award decisions in detail significantly restricts scope for manipulation.
The notice of a contract awarded in an EU-wide procurement procedure must be sent to the EU Publications Office within 48 days.
The Office publishes the notices in the Official Journal of the EU, also implementing the transparency requirement.
The contracting authorities also have to collect the essential data of their procurement procedures and report them to the EU Commission via the relevant national ministries.
On this basis, the EU Commission compiles annual EU statistics, which enable it to gain an overview of the development of the internal market in construction services.
Regulations of German and Czech procurement law
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have fully transposed the EU legal requirements for documentation and reporting requirements into national law.
The rules on documentation and reporting for EU statistics are largely the same in both countries.
Differing regulations
In the Czech Republic, the publication obligation for contracts awarded is not only limited to EU-wide contracts, but also extends to other procurement procedures.
The notice period is shortened to 15 days.
In Germany, in addition to the EU-wide awards, there is a publication obligation only for limited tenders and hands-free awards from value limits of 25,000 euros or 15,000 euros without VAT (so-called ex-post transparency).
Below these value limits and in the case of public tenders, only the companies involved in the competition procedure receive information about the awarding of contracts.
Essential test results
BRH
Documentation
A large number of the procurement procedures examined were not fully documented.
The award notices did not contain all the necessary information, such as the justification of product specifications or references to national regulations.
In a tendering procedure, the contracting authority did not explain why it awarded the contract to a company, even though its offer did not contain mandatory evidence.
In a few cases, the documents of the contracting authorities did not contain all the evidence required for the documentation of the award procedure.
Announcements of orders
In some EU-wide procurement procedures, the contracting authorities failed to publicise the awarding of contracts.
In the case of further award procedures, there was no evidence that the awarding authorities had made the contracts known.
Reporting and reporting obligations
The statistical statements viewed contained the required minimum information. They were prepared and sent on time.
Ex-post transparency
In most cases, the audited construction administrations published the contract data of the completed procurement procedures.
However, due to a transmission error, a construction administration did not publish this data.
The building administration only noticed this error after half a year,
As a result, the contract data of the procurement procedures completed so far have not been published.
NK Catching up
Documentation
The documentation of the award procedures for the construction of a major sporting event showed considerable shortcomings, mainly due to incorrect information, such as incorrect bid prices in the minutes of the evaluation commissions.
In addition, some minutes of the offer openings were not signed.
Announcements of orders
In the case of several road construction projects, announcements of awarded contracts were only published late or not at all.
Summary findings
The regulations on documentation and reporting and reporting requirements are largely identical in both countries and implement the EU requirements.
The transparency of procurement procedures, including the awarding of contracts, is thus guaranteed in principle.
The regulations to be applied in the Czech Republic go a little further than the requirements in Germany.
The shortcomings identified in the documentation and in the announcements significantly limited the anti-corruption effect of these instruments in the respective procurement procedures.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Construction administrations should further improve the transparency of their procurement procedures and contracts and fully comply with their reporting and reporting obligations.
Summary evaluation and recommendations
The parallel audits conducted by the NK and the BRH focused on two main areas that are essential in the Czech Republic and Germany for the awarding of works by contracting authorities: The application of EU procurement rules and the prevention of corruption.
The requirements of EU law enable cross-border competition to create a single European market.
Anti-corruption measures are not only intended to prevent or at least reduce corruption, but also to avert economic damage and a possible loss of trust in the integrity of the state.
The audit findings of the two courts of auditors on the application of procurement law in both countries and the comparison of these regulations provide information on similarities and differences, which can be helpful for both countries in the further development of their procurement law and its application.
Application of EU procurement rules
Both countries have transposed the EU requirements for awarding construction contracts into national law.
This gives the Czech Republic and Germany an important common basis for awarding construction contracts and taking into account the essential requirements of competition, equal treatment of the companies involved and the transparency of procurement procedures.
The construction administrations of both countries have partially supported these bids very extensively with further administrative regulations.
To a large extent, the Czech Republic has also transferred the requirements for construction services to be awarded throughout the EU to its nationally regulated procurement procedures below the EU threshold.
However, investigations by the courts of auditors have shown that the construction authorities have not fully complied with the requirements of EU law in all areas.
The construction administration in Germany should further improve the quality of its procurement procedures in order to be able to eliminate the objections identified when implementing the EU requirements.
Above all, the audits in the Czech Republic have identified risks that affect the profitability of the contracts.
Incomplete service descriptions necessitated additional services, which were often awarded in violation of legal regulations. In addition, the cost assessments were usually inadequately prepared. Excessive qualification requirements also reduced the number of potential bidders and restricted competition, especially in transport construction.
Prevention of corruption
The investigations did not aim to uncover cases of corruption,
This is also because the courts of auditors do not have the appropriate instruments.
However, the courts of auditors can check to what extent the administrations of both countries have taken precautions against corruption and manipulation when awarding construction contracts and how these requirements are applied.
The two countries have set different priorities for preventing corruption.
Above all, the German regulations provide for largely unrestricted competition as well as transparency and controls as key elements in preventing corruption.
The Czech regulations are primarily aimed at increasing the transparency of procedures.
BRH
In Germany, general principles of corruption prevention apply, which must be applied by the entire federal administration.
These principles are also implemented in the specifications for the award of construction services and are geared to their specific requirements.
In some cases, the relevant regulations specify very precisely how the bids for corruption prevention are to be taken into account in the course of the procurement procedures and in the selection of the persons involved.
In the opinion of the BRH, in particular the primacy of the principle of the open procedure or the public tender is a suitable instrument to significantly reduce the risk of corruption when awarding construction services. Restrictions on competition, on the other hand, increase the risk of manipulative interference.
Risk analyses and adequate controls (especially the multi-eyes principle), the requirements for transparency and documentation of procurement procedures and various organisational measures are also effective precautions to prevent corruption and manipulation.
The BRH therefore sees no need for fundamental changes to the corresponding requirements of the administrations when awarding construction services.
The rules for preventing corruption are largely taken into account in practice.
The shortcomings identified in some areas have highlighted shortcomings in the implementation of some benchmarks.
The construction authorities should further train their employees on the requirements for corruption prevention and make them even more aware of this problem.
A significant part of the complaints related to tasks that the construction authorities had delegated to freelancers.
Without controls and adequate safeguards, however, the risk of abuse increases when delegating tasks.
Tampering and corruption-prone tasks should therefore only be delegated to third parties if the administration can guarantee a sufficient level of protection against unauthorised interference.
NK Catching up
At government level, the Czech Republic adopted a strategy against corruption, in which public procurement is the most important component.
The Procurement Act and the associated implementing provisions have been substantially amended.
The audits of the NK Kr ä ger took place during the implementation of this strategy.
The strategy adopted and the new legal provisions should be effective improvement measures, since the contracting authorities must justify the profitability of the contracts, the calculation of the expected prices, the adequacy of the qualification requirements, the essential evaluation criteria and the nature of the evaluations, and all these aspects must be properly documented and published.
Recommendations
In principle, the NK K ä mpfe and the BRH assess the implementation of the EU requirements positively.
The widespread acceptance in practice has confirmed that the EU requirements of competition, equal treatment and transparency are an appropriate basis for awarding construction contracts within the European Union.
The supranational model implemented in the European Union can also serve as a basis for similar projects aimed at facilitating and promoting cross-border competition.
In view of the enormous material and non-material damage potential caused by manipulation and corruption in the awarding of construction services, both courts of auditors see the construction administrations in their countries as required to continue their measures against corruption and manipulation and, if necessary, to improve them.
In particular, the organisation and procedures of procurement procedures should be continuously examined for weaknesses and risks in order to identify the need for action and to take appropriate countermeasures.
The comparison of procurement practices in both countries suggests that the share of open procedures in the Czech Republic should be increased, as open procedures offer a wider scope for competition and can significantly reduce the risk of corruption.
A greater division of construction services into lots can also have a positive impact on supply prices, provided that this leads to greater competition with a higher number of bidders.
Ensuring the correct implementation of procurement procedures is an essential basis for efficient public procurement.
In Germany, the procurement procedures are carried out by specialised construction administrations. In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, with the exception of transport construction projects, these tasks are carried out by the departments themselves or by contractors commissioned by them.
Even after the completion of their joint project, the courts of auditors of both countries are keen to further develop the findings that are important to them and, if necessary, to bring them to the attention of their country's parliament and government.
Both courts of auditors are also convinced that the principles of public procurement law set out in this report and its implementation are also of interest at international level to the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), because the principles and findings presented are of general importance in order to effectively combat corruption and to ensure the economic award of works in a well-functioning and fair competition.

VAT administration in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany
Report on the audit
Preface
Taxes are the most important source of income for public budgets.
The audit of this area should therefore be a focus of the work of the courts of auditors.
This is especially true for VAT fraud.
This alone causes tax losses in the European Union of an estimated 100 billion euros1 per year.
At the 6th EUROSAI Congress in Bonn in 2005, the participants pointed out the need for enhanced cooperation.
This enables the courts of auditors to exchange audit approaches and optimise audit practice, for example.
VAT is particularly suitable for cooperation, as it is harmonised within the European Union.
In 2006, the courts of auditors of both countries audited the VAT for the first time in parallel.
The audit report was published in 2008.
Since VAT fraud is a widespread phenomenon in the European Union, close cooperation between the courts of auditors is required, which will allow a comprehensive assessment of whether the measures taken are suitable for effectively combating VAT fraud.
The two courts decided to continue their cooperation and conducted a second parallel audit. VAT administration in the Czech Republic and in the Federal Republic of Germany Report on the audit
1. Introduction
Examination number: (CZ) 09 / 11 (D) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892
Subject of the audit: (CZ) Administration of the VAT (D) Bilateral audit with the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as NKK), audit
Examination goal:
(CZ) The VAT administration and the treatment of selected transactions between entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as CZ) and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter referred to as Germany) should be examined. In addition, the procedures used by the tax authorities for intergovernmental administrative assistance should be examined.
(D) The audit was intended to evaluate how the financial administration has implemented the recommendations made by the audit institutions.
In addition, further examination fields linked to the VAT should be processed.
The findings should be compared in order to determine whether the tax procedures can be optimised.
The audit period was from 2006 to 2008, including relevant information from the period before the audit period until the completion of the audit.
2. Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel examination
The courts of auditors of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have agreed on an audit for the administration of VAT.
In the previous parallel investigation, they had uncovered suspected cases of intra-Community transactions,
Which made a re-examination seem appropriate.
Based on the audit findings, the two courts of auditors made recommendations on the administration of VAT.
The aim of the audit was to evaluate how these recommendations were implemented and to investigate the suspected cases.
The audit also dealt with other issues, including selected cases of high-risk intra-Community transactions, mutual assistance in the recovery of VAT receivables and the VAT audit of large companies.
The Court of Auditors found:
1. Recommendations made on the basis of the previous review
Recommendation 1: The rules for the registration of taxpayers should be harmonised within the EU
In the first audit, the courts of auditors compared the registration procedures for VAT in the two states and found differences that caused problems.
The courts therefore recommended harmonising the registration of taxpayers within the EU.
This has also been taken up at EU level.
The draft amendment to Council Regulation No 1798 / 2003 provides for the extension of the current databases in the EU, including a database with the identification number of VAT payers.
The draft also provided for common rules for the registration of taxpayers and their eventual cancellation.
The Courts of Auditors expected Member States to agree on appropriate rules, in line with their decision in principle, to remove unreliable entrepreneurs from the VAT system as early as possible.
The Member States reached political agreement in ECOFIN on the latest version of the draft.
The aforementioned common rules are no longer included, and the two courts of auditors regret that.
They still consider such regulations to be important in order to prevent VAT fraud.
Recommendation 2: Monthly submission of summary reports As a result of the first audit, the Court of Auditors recommended to the Member States that the summary reports (CM) should be submitted monthly in future.
The amounts of intra-Community transactions could then be reviewed more promptly.
Council Directive 2008 / 117 / EC amending Directive 2006 / 112 / EC on the common system of value added tax (VAT) for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-Community transactions has shortened the deadline for submitting the ZM to one month.
In the CZ, this requirement was implemented by an amendment to the VAT Act, which came into force on 1 January 2010.
In Germany, the implementation did not come into force until July 1, 2010. It has thus not transposed the obligation to submit the ZM monthly into national law on time.
Recommendation 3: Data comparison of VAT pre-registrations and ZM in Germany for more reliable MIAS data and proposal to examine the merging of the procedures for VAT pre-registrations and ZM The German tax administration has taken up the recommendation made by the Federal Court of Auditors and set up a working group to develop possible solutions.
The work has not yet been completed.
The Federal Audit Office will monitor further developments.
Recommendation 4: Exchange on successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level During the first audit, the two courts agreed that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by one Member State alone.
Successful criteria and elements or approaches of a risk management system must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State.
If this does not happen, fraudsters will focus on the Member State with the weakest risk management system.
The Court found that the two Member States apply different risk management systems, which have both strengths and weaknesses.
The NKU audited the information exchange system within the EU - EUROCANET, while the Federal Court of Auditors focused on Germany's participation in the "Platform for Risk Management".
2. Audit of selected intra-Community transactions
During the first audit, the courts of auditors jointly examined transactions in which it was doubtful whether they had actually been carried out or which had been explained differently by the taxpayers of the two states in the VAT declarations (or VAT declarations) or ZM.
The Court of Auditors selected nine cases of intra-Community deliveries of goods between the CZ and Germany for the audit.
The audits by the tax offices (F Ä) of both states had not yet been completed at the conclusion of the first parallel audit.
The audit has shown that the tax procedures for these selected transactions have now been completed, and the respective tax administrations have taken appropriate measures to this end (including subsequent VAT fixing or the prevention of VAT refunds).
3. Examination of selected, particularly risky intra-Community transactions
The audit also included highly risky intra-Community transactions between EU taxpayers covered by the EUROCANET system.
EUROCANET is used to identify taxpayers at risk.
Member States can participate in this system on a voluntary basis.
The CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET. Germany has a passive status, i.e. it does not participate in the data exchange within the framework of EUROCANET.
From the point of view of an active participant state, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to participate actively.
As a result, no information could be obtained about which suppliers with a German VAT ID would have been classified as high-risk cases.
The NKU found both normal business transactions and those with suspicion of VAT fraud, including carousel fraud, in the selected transactions.
The F Ä were only able to check transactions with high risk to a limited extent. This was especially true for so-called "missing traders", whereby an examination of the documents alone is hardly sufficient to prove fraud to the taxpayer.
Suspected carousel fraud in imports and exports
It is advisable for customs and tax authorities to work more closely together in order to be able to track the identity of the goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final customer.
Germany and a number of other countries have refused to actively participate in EUROCANET, as they do not believe there is a sufficient legal basis.
The Federal Court of Auditors found that the German financial administration uses other instruments to identify high-risk taxpayers.
However, there is a need for communication and exchange of experience between all EU Member States.
The Council of the EU agreed on a draft regulation:
Created by the Eurofisc.
The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should be incorporated into the planned network for combating VAT fraud.
4. Mutual assistance in the recovery of claims
Intergovernmental mutual assistance in debt recovery is subject to the same European legislation in all Member States.
Therefore, requests for intergovernmental administrative assistance in the recovery of claims in the CZ and Germany are processed in the same way.
The Federal Court of Auditors and the NKU compared the statistics that both Member States submitted to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.
These statistics contained inconsistencies.
The two courts of auditors consider a renewed discussion of the statistics at EU level to be useful in order to avoid future discrepancies.
If this does not happen, the statistics cannot be used appropriately for comparisons.
In addition, the statistics should contain more information about VAT.
An analysis of detailed data can help the Commission to support Member States in their efforts to combat VAT fraud.
Both courts believe that Member States with a low recovery rate should strive to achieve at least the average recovery rate.
The Commission should support the Member States in this if desired.
5. VAT testing at large companies
The courts of auditors analysed the legal situation with regard to the VAT audit of large companies in both states.
In addition, they used a questionnaire to collect information from the tax authorities that they considered important in this context.
It became clear that the situation in both countries is different.
The CZ has a system for selecting risky cases that includes a large amount of relevant data (including information on VAT audits, balance sheet data and profit and loss accounts).
Overall, VAT control can be effectively controlled and analyzed.
A special tax office for large companies is to be set up in 2012.
There is no comparable system in Germany. This makes it difficult to manage and analyse VAT control as a whole.
The German tax administration focuses more on the selection of relevant individual cases and relies in particular on data from the VAT pre-registrations or VAT declarations and the ZM.
Various risk management components, which are to be improved, support the evaluation of this data.
3. Examination procedure
3.1 Examination procedures in the Czech Republic
Department II - State Budget Revenue as well as the regional departments IX Pilsen, X eskk ä ufte Budjovice, XIII Brno and XV Ostrava examined in the period from May 2009 to February 2010.
The audited bodies were the Czech Ministry of Finance and 25 F Ä: Tax Office (FA) Brno II, FA Brno III, FA Brno IV, FA in Br ü cken eclav, FA in Doma Lice, FA in Hodonic n, FA in Hradec Kr ü ckloe, FA in Cheb, FA in Jablonec nad Nisou, FA in Karlovy Vary, FA in Kralupy nad Vltavou, FA in Kraslice, FA Ostrava I, FA Ostrava III, FA in Pablonec nad Nisou, FA in Psek, FA in Prague, FA Pilsen, FA in Prague, FA 1, FA in Sokolok, FA in Prague, FA in Sokolok, FA in Molok and FA in Prague.
The Senate of the Czech Court of Auditors approved the audit findings on 27 April 2010.
3.2 Examination procedures in Germany
The audit area traffic taxes and employees of the assigned P Ä B Berlin, Frankfurt / Main and Munich audited from February 2009 to February 2010.
After selecting the sample cases, they announced the examination in several countries:
Bavaria, Hamburg, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia, Saxony. They also conducted interviews in the Federal Ministry of Finance (Federal Ministry of Finance).
Tax files from the following departments were included in the audit: Erlangen, Zentralfinanzamt M ü nchen, Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Grafenau; Hamburg-Nord, Hamburg-Hansa, Sonderfinanzamt Hamburg for large companies; Wiesbaden I, Wiesbaden II, Darmstadt; Essen-NordOst, FA Essen for tax audits at large companies and corporations, L ü denscheid; L ü denscheid Chemnitz S ü d.
Discussions were also held with the F Ä M ü hlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-S ü d and the OFD Frankfurt / Main, Chemnitz and M ü nster.
The Federal Audit Office informed the Federal Ministry of Finance of the audit results in April 2010.
3.3 Cooperation between the two auditors
Prior to the parallel audit, the representatives of both audit institutions met in September 2008 to discuss and define the audit topics.
In December 2008, the presidents of both audit institutions signed the agreement on cooperation in parallel auditing.
At a meeting in Bonn in June 2009, the examination teams informed themselves about the first results obtained during exam preparation, discussed possible examination approaches and agreed on the further procedure.
A second meeting took place in Prague from 2 to 4 December 2009.
The audit teams exchanged the audit findings gained so far and agreed on the schedule for the preparation of the joint audit report.
The two courts of auditors defined the following topics for their parallel audit: Evaluation of the recommendations given in the previous report; examination of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between taxpayers from the CZ and Germany, which could not be fully clarified during the first parallel audit; examination of selected intra-Community transactions classified as risky between taxpayers from the CZ and Germany; examination of the procedures of the two tax administrations with regard to intergovernmental administrative assistance in the recovery of VAT receivables; VAT audits of large companies.
The report on the results of the parallel audit was prepared during a working meeting in June 2010.
4. Audit of VAT administration in selected areas
4.1 Implementation of the recommendations from the first joint examination
4.1.1 Implementation of recommendations in the Czech Republic
Recommendation 1
Harmonisation of requirements for registration of taxpayers within the EU Supported
Based on the results of the first audit, the Czech Court of Auditors recommended to adapt the requirements for VAT registration and to introduce new rules for the cancellation of registration in the CZ.
These revised rules should more effectively reduce the risk of possible tax evasion.
In certain cases, it was found that the F Ä did not delete the VAT registration of taxpayers if they did not comply with their obligations under Czech Law No. 235 / 2004 (hereinafter referred to as the "VAT Act").
So far, the Czech Ministry of Finance has not submitted an amendment to oblige the F Ä to delete if taxpayers repeatedly fail to submit VAT declarations.
According to the Czech VAT Act, the FA can delete the registration of a taxable person ex officio if a) the taxable person has not made any transactions for twelve consecutive months and has not informed the FA of the reasons for this; b) the taxable person has not fulfilled his obligations under the VAT Act; c) the taxable person no longer meets the requirements for tax liability.
The first examination had shown that due to the existing legal situation, the FA Prague 1 must delete the VAT registration of "foreign taxpayers" 3 with effect from 31 January of the following calendar year if they were not obliged to register and pay VAT in the current calendar year.
The FA Prague 1 often did not delete the VAT registration of these taxpayers because the relevant provision of the deadline could not be adequately implemented in practice.
The problem was solved by amending the VAT Act, which came into force on 1 January 2009.
Accordingly, the FA is entitled to delete the registration of a foreign taxable person if he has not provided taxable or tax-exempt goods or services with the right to deduct VAT in the previous calendar year.
Recommendation 2
Monthly delivery of the ZM
On the basis of the first audit, the courts of auditors had recommended the introduction of the monthly levy of ZM.
The Council Directive, which shortened the cycle for the surrender of the ZM to one month, was implemented in the CZ by the VAT Act, which came into force on 1 January 2010.
The ZM must now be submitted electronically.
In addition, a ZM must be provided if services, the place of performance of which is to be determined in accordance with Article 9 (1) of the VAT Act, are provided for a person registered in another Member State as subject to VAT.
The prerequisite for this is that the recipient is obliged to declare and pay VAT for these services. This obligation arises from Council Directive 2008 / 8 / EC amending Directive 2006 / 112 / EC with regard to the place of the service.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of the data of the VAT pre-registrations and the ZM to increase the reliability of the MIAS data This recommendation related to the German tax administration.
In its ATIS4 system, the Czech tax administration automatically compares the data on intra-Community transactions from the VAT declarations and the ZM.
Recommendation 4
Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level
The proper collection of VAT is a prerequisite for the proper functioning of the EU internal market.
That is why the fight against VAT fraud is of paramount interest and has received considerable attention in recent years.
The importance of this is demonstrated, among other things, by a study published by the European Commission in October 2009.
An external expert estimated the VAT loss for the 25 Member States in the period 2000 to 2006. After evaluating the available data, the tax loss for the mentioned period was estimated at 90 to 113 billion euros, based on the assumption that the EU-25 lose an average of 12% of the turnover taxes due to them each year.
The estimated tax loss for the CZ in 2006 was 18%.
The first audit found that a Member State cannot develop an effective risk management system (RMS) on its own.
Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each Member State.
With regard to the RMS, the Czech Court of Auditors has audited the information exchange system within the EU (EUROCANET).
Risky intra-Community transactions carried out by taxpayers within the EU and recorded in EUROCANET were selected (see Chapter 4.3).
The Eurofisc network aims to optimise administrative assistance in tax matters and combat VAT fraud more effectively. Cooperation between the competent authorities is to be improved in order to detect fraud as early as possible.
Later, Eurofisc could be used as a tool to assess the risk potential of intra-Community transactions.
The Ecofin Council6 already approved Eurofisc on 7 October 2008 and at the same time adopted the principles for the functioning of the system.
Eurofisc is modelled on EUROCANET, which was developed by the Belgian financial administration in cooperation with the other Member States and with the support of the European Commission and OLAF7.
The purpose of the system is to detect risky transactions and identify entrepreneurs involved in organised VAT fraud.
4.1.2 Implementation of the recommendations in Germany
The evaluation of the recommendations from the first report led to the following findings:
Recommendation 1
Harmonisation of the requirements for the registration of taxpayers within the EU
The German tax administration has developed a well-functioning system for the registration of taxpayers based on a detailed questionnaire.
The Federal Ministry of Finance presented this system to the Commission in October 2007.
The system itself is constantly improving.
The data provided in the questionnaire is now recorded electronically and will later be available for research. They are therefore part of the risk management during registration.
The Commission had made a proposal8 to amend Regulation 1798 / 2003, which included common standards for the registration and deletion of taxpayers.
The Member States still needed clarification and clarification.
The Federal Audit Office had recommended to the Federal Ministry of Finance not to fall short of the standards already achieved.
Recommendation 2
Monthly delivery of the ZM
On April 8, 2010, a law 9 was passed to transpose the EU directives into national law.
It contains, among other things, provisions for the monthly levy of the ZM for intra-Community deliveries
And comes into force on July 1, 2010.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of the data of the VAT pre-applications and the ZM for more reliable MIAS data and considerations for merging the previously separate procedures for filing the VAT pre-applications and the ZM
A joint federal-state working group has been set up,
Which has developed a concept for the automatic comparison of the data from the VAT pre-registrations and the ZM.
The concept is still being discussed with the countries.
This working group also looked at an approach to optimising the control procedure for intra-Community transactions.
Recommendation 4
Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level At EU level, relevant information is exchanged.
Germany participates in the risk management platform.
The European Commission supported the initiative and initiated the establishment of a risk management platform within the Fiscalis 2006-2007 Action Plan in the written procedure of 18 October 2006.
The members of the platform dealt with the following topics in 4 subgroups: Comprehensive risk management instruments, comprehensive influence on taxpayers' behaviour, comprehensive evaluation, comprehensive updating of the risk management guidelines.
New reports from the subgroups "Risk Management Instruments" and "Update of the Risk Management Guide" were published in early 2010.
4.1.3 Evaluation
Registration
The issue of the requirements for VAT registration and its deletion in various countries was dealt with at EU level.
The draft amended Council Regulation 1798 / 2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT and repealing Regulation (EEC) 218 / 92 provides for the expansion of current databases within the EU, including a database of VAT identification numbers.
This proposal also includes common standards for the registration and deletion of taxpayers.
The questions of registration and deletion are reserved for the national legislation of the EU member states until further notice.
The Member States still needed clarification and clarification.
The Federal Audit Office had recommended to the Federal Ministry of Finance not to fall behind the standards already achieved.
The Member States reached political agreement on the latest version of the draft in ECOFIN on 8 June 2010.
Common rules for the registration and deletion of taxpayers are no longer included.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The two courts of auditors regret this. They still consider such regulations to be important in order to prevent VAT fraud.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Monthly delivery of the ZM
With regard to international cooperation, as a result of the previous audit, it was recommended that all Member States introduce the monthly levy of the ZM in order to allow an earlier audit of the amounts of intra-Community transactions.
Council Directive 2008 / 117 / EC amending Directive 2006 / 112 / EC on the common system of value added tax (VAT) for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-Community transactions has shortened the cycle for the surrender of the relevant CM to one month.
In the CZ, this requirement was implemented by the amendment to the VAT Act, which came into force on 1 January 2010.
Germany did not implement the obligation to pay the monthly ZM levy until July 1, 2010, and thus not on time, while the CZ complied with the EU's requirements.
Comparison of the data of the VAT pre-registrations and the ZM for more reliable MIAS data and considerations for merging the previously separate procedures for submitting the VAT pre-registrations or the ZM
The German financial administration has taken up the recommendations of the Federal Audit Office and set up a working group to develop possible solutions.
The Federal Audit Office will monitor further developments.
Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level
Germany and CZ use different approaches to identify high-risk entrepreneurs.
The Czech Court of Auditors examined the application of the EUROCANET system in CZ (see section 4.3).
The Federal Audit Office focused on Germany's participation in the risk management platform.
4.2 Audit of selected intra-Community transactions
The first audit examined transactions where there were doubts as to whether they had actually been carried out or whether discrepancies had been found in the declarations of taxpayers in both Member States.
For the audit, the two courts selected nine cases of intra-Community deliveries of goods between the CZ and Germany for which the tax audit by the F Ä of the Member State concerned had not been completed at the time of the previous joint audit.
1)
In the first quarter of 2005, a Czech taxpayer purchased goods worth EUR 22,686 from a German taxpayer.
The Czech taxpayer did not declare the acquisition in his VAT declaration, as the German taxpayer did not have a VAT identification number, but only a tax number for intra-German transactions.
Through international administrative assistance in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the competent Czech FA had received information that, according to German VAT law, the supplier of intra-Community goods does not need a VAT identification number in order to claim the tax exemption for intra-Community goods deliveries.
The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that - according to the audit by the competent Czech FA - the Czech taxpayer submitted an additional VAT declaration in which he declared the purchase of goods of the above-mentioned value and at the same time asserted his right to deduct VAT at the same amount.
2)
A Czech taxpayer is said to have purchased goods worth 12,561 euros from a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004.
However, he stated that he did not purchase the goods and therefore did not declare them in his VAT declaration.
Citing a provision of Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the German financial administration refused to process the request because the turnover associated with the acquisition did not exceed the threshold of 15,000 euros.
Since the Czech FA could not obtain any documents, the tax audit was inconclusive and the original tax assessment remained in place.
The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech FA received two spontaneous information from Germany in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, according to which the German taxpayer had charged a Slovak addressee for the delivery of the goods in question.
The Czech taxpayer purchased the goods from the Slovak taxpayer and stated the purchase in his regular VAT declaration for the month of October 2004.
3)
In the fourth quarter of 2004, a Czech taxpayer is said to have purchased a car worth 48,500 euros from a German taxpayer.
However, he did not declare any intra-Community acquisition.
In addition, he had not made a VAT declaration since August 2004. Therefore, the FA set the VAT for the quarter in question at 0 CZK.
Based on information transmitted from Germany in the course of the international exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the FA asked the taxpayer in March 2007 to file a subsequent tax return, which the taxpayer omitted.
The audit established that the FA had carried out further audit actions in this tax case in 2007. It found that the car in question had been sold by the taxpayer to a used car dealer in the CZ.
The Czech FA carried out an assessment for the tax period December 2004, setting additional taxes of CZK 295 379 for the purchase and resale of goods from another Member State.
The competent Czech court decided to open insolvency proceedings against the assets of the Czech taxpayer; an insolvency administrator was appointed.
In the absence of significant assets, the outstanding tax liability is likely to be irrecoverable.
4)
In the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, a Czech taxpayer is said to have delivered new vehicles (passenger cars) to Germany with a total value of 198 167 euros.
In response to a request for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, it was stated that criminal proceedings against the German taxpayer were pending in Germany.
The audit of the Federal Court of Auditors revealed that after the conclusion of the proceedings, there was evidence of the German taxpayer's involvement in fraud.
The intra-Community purchase of goods was subject to acquisition tax of 182 424 euros (for 2004) and 369 690 euros (for 2005).
The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors revealed that the Czech taxpayer was involved in carousel fraud involving new vehicles.
On the basis of information provided by the German tax administration, a VAT audit of the Czech taxpayer took place for the tax periods of April, May and June 2005.
Based on the audit findings and information from the international exchange of information, the FA set an additional VAT of CZK 703 031 for May 2005 and CZK 726 551 for June 2005.
5)
Czech taxpayer A is said to have purchased a machine with a total value of 58,000 euros from a German taxpayer in February 2005.
In the third quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer is said to have supplied Czech taxpayer B with a machine worth 88,027 euros. However, B denied the acquisition.
The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors revealed that B had acquired the machine from a German company with a branch in the CZ.
The Czech taxpayer A did not specify the purchase of the goods from the German taxpayer mentioned in his VAT declaration.
The response of the German FA to a request for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 showed that the German taxpayer had not made an intra-Community delivery of a machine worth 58 000 euros, but a delivery within the CZ.
In the audit, the Federal Court of Auditors found that the intra-Community delivery of the machine was classified as domestic delivery after completion of an audit and the VAT exemption was subsequently refused.
6)
A German taxpayer is said to have delivered goods worth 11,600 euros to a Czech taxpayer in the third quarter of 2004.
The goods were purchased and later sold in Germany in 2005.
The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech FA had made its assessment on the basis of a supplementary VAT declaration, which unlawfully reported purchases from another Member State, including the purchases in the amount mentioned above.
The Federal Court of Auditors found that after receiving a reply to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the German FA corrected the VAT declaration of the German taxpayer and set an additional VAT of 1,600 euros.
Due to the resale of the goods in Germany and the corresponding VAT assessment there, an investigation is ongoing.
The ZM of the German taxpayer has not yet been corrected, as in Germany only the taxpayer who has surrendered the ZM can correct it.
7)
The competent Czech FA received a request for information from the German tax administration in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003 on the question of the purchase of a car worth EUR 47 400 by a Czech taxpayer in February 2005.
After an audit for the tax period 2005, the Czech FA set the tax liability of the Czech taxpayer at CZK 0 and informed the German FA that it could not confirm the purchase of the car by the Czech taxpayer.
The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors revealed that the registration of the Czech VAT payer had been cancelled because he had failed to meet his tax obligations.
The Czech FA had forwarded the documents to the Czech police.
The German taxpayer has not yet corrected his information in the ZM, but has appealed against the tax ruling.
8)
According to MIAS10, between the third quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, a German taxpayer delivered goods to a Czech taxpayer with a total value of EUR 33,205, which he did not declare to be an intra-Community acquisition.
The audit of the Czech Court of Auditors found that the Czech FA investigated the reasons for the discrepancies.
The Czech taxpayer repeatedly issued subsequent VAT declarations for the first quarter of 2005.
However, the Czech FA was not able to clarify the difference in the amount of 134 273 CZK in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005. It justified this on the grounds that sales for individual quarters could not be accurately allocated and accepted the VAT declarations made.
9)
In the third quarter of 2004, a German taxpayer delivered goods worth EUR 46 854 to a Czech taxpayer.
For the same period, the Czech taxpayer declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only EUR 14 856.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003, the Czech FA reviewed the actual value of the delivery.
With the German answer to this request, three invoices were sent showing a total value of the delivered goods of 31 998 euros, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech taxpayer and the MIAS data.
According to the results of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors, the Czech taxpayer submitted a subsequent VAT declaration for the July 2004 tax period in January 2007 following repeated warnings from the FA.
With this declaration, the taxpayer simultaneously asserted his right to deduct input tax. Therefore, his tax liability for the relevant tax period remained unchanged.
The audit confirmed that most of the tax procedures for the transactions selected for the audit had been completed and that the tax administrations in the CZ and Germany had taken appropriate measures (including subsequent VAT fixing or prevention of VAT refunds).
4.3 Examination of selected cases of risky intra-Community transactions
4.3.1 Findings in the Czech Republic
EUROCANET can be an important source of information for identifying taxpayers at risk in the Member State of acquisition.
In the CZ, the early warning information obtained from EUROCANET is checked by the competent FA with the purchasers.
Since the first quarter of 2008, CZ has included information on sales and taxable suppliers that are considered risky in the EUROCANET system.
Nine Czech taxpayers were selected for the audit,
Which had been entered into EUROCANET by the financial administrations of other Member States either as suppliers or purchasers.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Since the German tax administration did not participate in the data exchange via EUROCANET, it was not possible to determine whether suppliers with a German VAT identification number were classified as risky by the German tax administration.
The audit found both normal business transactions and those suspected of carousel fraud or other VAT fraud.
In the cases concerned, the FÄ exchanged information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798 / 2003,
For example:
The F Ä did not establish any suspicion of risky sales when examining the early warning information.
The taxpayers in question were constantly monitored because their data was stored in EUROCANET.
The F Ä did not succeed in verifying risky transactions on the basis of the submitted accounting documents to prove violations of the rules for calculating the tax base and VAT, even though they found inconsistencies in the transport and storage of the goods or revealed business relationships with letterbox companies from other Member States.
The review of individual business transactions was complicated because certain taxpayers did not cooperate with the FEA and could not be contacted.
The competent authorities reviewed most of the risky taxpayers and transactions mentioned in EUROCANET's early warning notifications.
However, your options for checking risky transactions, especially so-called "missing traders", are limited.
In particular, a mere examination of the documents can hardly provide proof of fraudulent action by the taxpayer.
Stricter requirements for the registration of taxpayers for VAT purposes and greater flexibility in deleting registrations would help to combat VAT fraud.
The taxpayers involved in fraudulent carousel transactions can be registered for VAT purposes in order to simulate fictitious goods deliveries across the EU or to issue other taxpayers with formally correct tax documents, with which they then assert unjustified claims for input tax deduction.
If there are suspicions of carousel fraud in connection with imports and exports, it is recommended that customs and tax authorities work more closely together in order to be able to track the identity of the goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final customer.
Member States can participate in EUROCANET on a voluntary basis.
The fact that three large Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not participate was seen by the European Parliament at the end of 200811 as a weakness of the system, which should be remedied by establishing a EUROFISC network with compulsory participation.
4.3.2 Findings in Germany
The Federal Audit Office evaluated data available at the Federal Central Tax Office, including data from EUROCANET.
They served as the basis for the selection of six German taxpayers whose files were reviewed.
Both Germany and a number of other countries refused to actively participate in EUROCANET.
That is why Germany has a passive status, i.e. it does not send data to Brussels itself, but is only the recipient of EUROCANET data.
The justification for this is that "from the point of view of the Federal Government
No unequivocal legal basis [exists] that would allow the tax secrecy existing in Germany to be broken.
In addition, the Federal Government does not have reliable information on how information sent by the Member States is processed within the framework of EUROCANET. "12 Since October 2007, the Federal Central Tax Office has been evaluating the EUROCANET data and transmitting it to the federal and state tax authorities on the basis of a coordinated procedure.
The German F Ä receive control notifications about the direct business relationships of the taxpayers registered with them with companies from other EU countries.
However, the relevant German FA does not receive any information as to whether the company from the aforementioned other EU Member State has business relations with a company established in another Member State, which is also in business relations with the German company from the control notification.
4.3.3 Evaluation
The CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has only a passive status.
From the point of view of an active participant, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to actively participate.
Accordingly, the audit had to be carried out differently in this area.
However, there were no significant differences in the success of the detection of VAT fraud. The reason for this is that EUROCANET is only one component of the risk management system.
However, the financial administrations of both countries have a variety of other tools at their disposal to detect fraudulent transactions. Nevertheless, it is necessary to develop a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.
The Council of the European Union agreed on a draft regulation13, which created Eurofisc, a network for combating VAT fraud.
The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should be exchanged at European level and fed into this network.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The cases brought before the courts at national and European level show that there is a need for discussion between the Member States and the Commission on the conditions for the exemption of intra-Community transactions.
4.4 Mutual assistance in debt recovery
4.4.1 Intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic
The legislation on intergovernmental mutual assistance for the recovery of certain claims in the EU is essentially based on
Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to measures forming part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as levies and duties;
Council Directive 2001 / 44 / EC amending Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to measures forming part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, levies and duties, VAT and certain excise duties, and
Commission Directive 2002 / 94 / EC laying down detailed implementing provisions for certain articles of Directive 76 / 308 / EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to certain duties, duties, taxes and other measures.
The CZ implemented Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC through Law No. 252 / 2000 on intergovernmental mutual assistance for the recovery of certain claims.
Following the adoption of Council Directive 2001 / 44 / EC, this also had to be transposed into Czech law. At the same time, the aforementioned law had to be amended.
In this context, the amendment to Law 191 / 2004 on intergovernmental administrative assistance for the recovery of certain claims was adopted.
A new relevant piece of legislation was adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1179 / 2008 of 28 November 2008.
The annexes to this regulation contain new application forms to be used from 1 January 2009. Furthermore, the regulation makes electronic transmission mandatory and obliges the requesting authority to certify the conformity of all documents sent with the respective original.
Key principles of international mutual assistance for the recovery of claims are:
1. The principle of reciprocity applies;
2. Administrative assistance shall only be provided on request and if all conditions are met;
3. Administrative assistance does not extend to claims that are considered a criminal sanction in the requested state;
4. The intergovernmental mutual assistance procedure for the recovery of claims must be carried out in accordance with the national law of the requested State;
5. In the recovery process, foreign claims do not take precedence over domestic claims;
6. Administrative assistance is provided only for the recovery of undisputed claims;
7. The principle of exhaustion applies: The requesting state must use all means to recover the claim to which it is entitled under national law.
Law 191 / 2004 provides for three forms of mutual assistance: Provision of information, notification of legal acts and actual recovery.
Procedure for outgoing requests to other EU member states
The competent FA has to transmit the request for information, the request for notification of legal acts or the recovery request together with the relevant documents electronically via the respective finance directorate to the Ministry of Finance of the CZ.
The Ministry of Finance of the CZ arranges the translation of the request into the relevant language, scans it with all attachments and transmits it via the communication network or the common interface CCN / CSI to the competent financial authority of the state concerned.
A request for recovery aid must meet the following condition: The claim must exceed EUR 1 500 and must not be older than five years.
The requested authority may refuse recovery if the requirements are not met.
Procedures for incoming requests from other Member States
The CZ Ministry of Finance must confirm receipt of requests from other Member States as soon as possible, at the latest within seven days.
If it decides not to grant the request, it must inform the requesting authority of the reasons for the refusal, specifying the specific provisions of the directive on which it is based.
The corresponding notification must be sent no later than three months after the date of receipt of the request.
Upon receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance will check whether the request meets all legal requirements.
If the recovery request is granted, the FA has to determine the financial circumstances of the debtor, e.g. by extracts from the land register, enquiries about existing bank accounts and registration of vehicles at the registration office.
After six months from the date of receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ shall inform the requesting authority of the result of the investigation.
The requesting authority must also be informed if the taxpayers in question are not available and the claim cannot therefore be recovered.
All sums successfully recovered must be transferred to the requesting authority within one month of recovery.
The Czech FA dealing with recovery may, with the consent of the requesting state, agree on the claim hours or instalments.
The interest or default surcharges imposed on the debtor for the period of default in accordance with Law No. 337 / 1992 on the administration of taxes and fees
Belong to the requesting state.
In 2006 and 2007 in particular, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ sent the recovery requests received to the competent FA with a delay.
The same applied to the forwarding of the recovery requests submitted by the Czech authorities to the competent authority in the requested state.
The audit found that the Ministry of Finance had breached the law on intergovernmental mutual assistance for the recovery of claims. It had failed to inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State of the state of play of the recovery procedure within six months of confirmation of receipt of the request.
The situation has improved since 2008.
Statistical data
In accordance with Act 191 / 2004 13 (4), the Ministry of Finance of the CZ compiles statistics for the European Commission by 15 March of each year. This includes the number of requests submitted in the previous year and the number of requests received for information, notification of legal acts and recovery, including the amount of the respective claims.
Based on the data provided by the Member States, the European Commission prepares its report to the Council and the European Parliament on the application of the provisions on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims.
The audit showed that in 2008 the Ministry of Finance of the CZ stated the claims by 5 250 000 euros too low. The reason was the incorrect information on the amount of a VAT claim introduced in 2008 (caused by the shift of a decimal point in the conversion of the claim from Czech crowns to euros).
The error was then reflected in the statistics of the European Commission.
Information on mutual recovery assistance is presented in the table below.
4.4.2 Intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in Germany
The legal basis for intergovernmental mutual assistance in tax matters is the Community standards Council Directive 2008 / 55 / EC of 26 May 2008 (EC Recovery Directive) 14 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1178 / 2008 of 28 November 2008 (EC Implementing Directive).
In order to improve readability and clarity, the EC Recovery Directive codified Council Directive 76 / 308 / EEC of 15 March 197616, the provisions of which had been substantially amended several times.
Among other things, the collection of VAT and taxes on income and assets, including the associated interest, fees and default surcharges, is regulated.
The EC Recovery Directive was transposed into German law by the Recovery Act (EC) 17 of 3 May 2003.
The enforcement procedure in Germany is regulated by the Tax Code (AO).
117 (2) AO stipulates that the tax authorities can provide intergovernmental legal and administrative assistance by virtue of international treaties and legal standards of the European Communities applicable in national law as well as by virtue of the EC Mutual Assistance Act.
Part Six of the AO contains the legislation for the enforcement procedure.
The administrative actions of the tax authorities are regulated in particular by the enforcement and enforcement order.
The Federal Ministry of Finance agreed with the representatives of the supreme tax authorities of the L ä nder on the principles of mutual assistance in tax matters and transferred its own responsibility in this area to the Federal Central Tax Office18.
General requirements for the admissibility of a recovery request are:
The legal requirements must be met (exactly 251, 254 AO).
All recovery funds available domestically have been exhausted.
The demands for the recovery of which administrative assistance is requested are indisputable.
The period between the issuance of the enforcement order or the date on which the claim or title became unappealable and the date of the request may not exceed five years.
The claim must be at least 1,500 euros.
Procedure for outgoing requests to other EU member states The German requests for the recovery of outstanding taxes are forwarded by the enforcement bodies of the F Ä via the competent central authority and the Federal Central Tax Office to the relevant foreign authority, e.g. the Czech CLO.
The details are set out in the leaflet on intergovernmental administrative assistance for tax collection (recovery) of 19 January 200419.
This leaflet is currently being revised by a federal-state working group and adapted to the new recovery directive.
In addition to attachments, the request is forwarded electronically by the FA to the central authority.
The latter checks whether the content and form are correct.
If not, the request will be returned to the relevant FA.
Otherwise, it will be forwarded to the Federal Central Tax Office.
The Federal Central Tax Office will then take over the necessary communication with the relevant foreign authority.
Procedure for incoming requests from other EU member states
Recovery requests from other Member States are recorded in the Federal Central Tax Office, which sends a receipt within ten days.
It also checks whether the formal requirements are met.
In principle, the Federal Central Tax Office forwards these requests to the central authority, which forwards them to the relevant FA and monitors the execution.
The Federal Central Tax Office also sends interim and final reports.
If the processing of a request takes longer than six months, it reminds the central authority of the obligation to submit an interim report in accordance with Article 16 of Commission Directive 2002 / 94 / EC.
After examining the formal and substantive requirements for the admissibility of the request, the enforcement authorities announce relevant measures.
All amounts collected must be transferred to the bank account specified in the request within one month of receipt.
Statistical data
Information on mutual recovery assistance between Germany and the CZ for the years 2006 to 2008 (as of 31 December 2008).
4.4.3 Examination of selected recovery cases
A total of 21 intergovernmental recovery requests between the CZ and Germany have been selected for the examination.
The following was noted:
1.
On 20 October 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for VAT debts of a Czech taxpayer from 2004 and 2005 totalling 3 883 euros (109 820 CZK).
It was not until 26 February 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the competent FA.
In order to secure the claim to be recovered, the Czech FA charged a property belonging to the taxpayer with a mortgage.
Since the encumbered property was not sufficient to pay the entire tax debt, an instalment payment agreement of at least CZK 2 000 per month was made with the debtor.
On August 31, 2009, an interim report was sent to the German FA. Accordingly, the taxpayer had paid tax debts amounting to CZK 49 600 (as of August 25, 2009).
The amount was transferred to Germany. Shortly afterwards, on August 28, 2009, another 3,000 CZK were transferred.

On 7 January 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a recovery request for tax debts (VAT, income tax) as well as interest and fees from a Czech taxpayer totalling 180 869 euros (= 4 434 915 CZK).
It was not until 27 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the competent FA.
After checking bank balances, securities, real estate, motor vehicles and other movable assets, the FA determined that the debtor did not have attachable assets.
Local investigations also revealed that the debtor had been absent from his permanent residence for almost a year.
His whereabouts in the CZ were unknown.
The Czech Ministry of Finance received this notification on 6 April 2009 and forwarded it to the German tax authorities on 16 April 2009.
3.
On November 21, 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for VAT in addition to interest and fees totaling 3 139 euros (= 84 846 CZK).
Only on August 6, 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the competent FA. On February 18, 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance from Germany was informed that the Czech tax debtor had paid the debt in the meantime.
On December 9, 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance informed the Czech FA that the case had been closed because the Czech tax debtor had fully paid his debt in Germany.
However, the debt was also settled in the CZ as part of the recovery procedure and the corresponding amount was transferred to Germany on October 27, 2008.
Because of the long time it took the Czech Ministry of Finance to pass on the information to the FA, the tax liability was paid twice - by the taxpayer himself in Germany and by means of recovery by the competent Czech FA.
In cooperation with the Federal Court of Auditors, it was established that the amount recovered will be offset against the tax liability from another procedure, which amounts to 6,649 euros and should be transferred to the CZ in September 2008.
In the documents of the Czech Ministry of Finance there was only a recovery request for the company in question amounting to 3 139 euros. The recovery request amounting to 6 649 euros could not be found there.
4.
On September 15, 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for income tax, VAT, interest and fees totalling 39 957 euros = 956 654 CZK.
It was not until 19 December 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the competent FA.
On 1 June 2009, the recovery procedure was initiated and a decision was taken to seize the Czech bank balance and the debtor's salary (CZK 7 000).
During the negotiations with the FA, the debtor did not agree with the amount of the tax liability and the amount was disputed.
According to the Czech FA, the debtor had been willing to pay 250 euros per month in the past, but the responsible German FA did not agree.
The taxpayer agreed to discuss his matter with the German FA in order to agree on another amount.
The recovery procedure was not completed at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.
5.
On 19 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for income tax in 2005 and VAT for the years 2003 to 2007, together with interest and fees totalling 113 444 euros = 3 116 304 CZK.
Only on November 14, 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the FA Prague 1, which is authorized to process tax cases of taxpayers not resident in the CZ; based on the available address, a locally competent FA could not be determined.
During its investigation, the FA received information and documents on 19 September 2008, according to which the debtor's income amounted to 4,704 euros. However, it was unable to issue an enforcement order because the recovery request had been received after this date.
On 26 January 2009, the Czech FA initiated the recovery procedure and issued an enforcement order to seize the debtor's assets from credit institutions.
The recovery procedure was not completed at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.
6.
On October 3, 2006, the competent Czech FA requested intergovernmental administrative assistance in the recovery of a VAT debt, together with legal costs totaling CZK 146 223 742.
It was not until 13 May 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German financial administration.
On 8 September 2008, the competent German FA transferred the amount of 17 700 euros = 439 226 CZK to the Czech authorities via the Bundesbank.
A conversion error was discovered during the review of the amounts recovered.
The amount to be recovered of 146 223 742 CZK was converted at the exchange rate of 1 Euro = 25.065 CZK, but a comma error resulted in an amount of 583 378 euros.
The correct amount to be recovered was 5 833 782 euros.
As a result, a recovery request of EUR 5 250 404 was made, which was too low.
7.
On March 1, 2007, the competent Czech FA requested recovery due to a VAT debt together with interest and fees of a Czech taxpayer totalling CZK 1 970 632 = EUR 79 847.
It was not until 10 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German financial administration.
On February 4, 2009, the German FA asked the debtor to pay the arrears.
Taking into account the significant reduction in the company's revenues in the second half of 2008 and in particular in the first half of 2009 as well as the corresponding liquidity situation, the following payments were made to settle the overdue tax liability: On April 8, 2009 - EUR 4 600, on May 6, 2009 - EUR 3 000 and on June 16, 2009 - EUR 2 500.
These payments were transferred to the account of the responsible FA in the Czech Republic.
On 23 June 2009, the debtor and the FA agreed on a further payment of 2,500 euros by 30 June 2009.
8.
On 22 May 2008, the competent Czech FA requested the recovery of tax debts totalling 398 653 euros = 9 832 779 CZK, which included property transfer tax.
It was not until 2 October 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German financial administration.
The request was returned in a letter from the German tax administration to the Czech Ministry of Finance on 3 April 2009.
The German tax administration justified this on the grounds that the real estate transfer tax is not a tax within the meaning of Article 2 (e), f), g) and h) of Directive 2008 / 55 / EC.
Article 2 (g) also concerns liabilities arising from taxes on income and assets.
Accordingly, Article 3 of Directive 2008 / 55 / EC applies to taxes on income and assets not mentioned in Articles 1, 3 and 4 of Directive 77 / 799 / EEC.
The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed to send a new recovery request to the German tax administration, which should no longer include the real estate transfer tax arrears in the amount of CZK 61 759, but the arrears in VAT, corporation tax and income tax.
The Czech Ministry of Finance received a new request from the competent FA for the recovery of tax debts of the same taxpayer amounting to CZK 7 079 735.
9.
On February 6, 2006, the competent Czech FA sent the Czech Ministry of Finance a recovery request for income tax and VAT totalling CZK 3,445 782 = EUR 123 328.
The VAT debt amounted to CZK 1 133 967.
Only on April 18, 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German financial administration
And it was only on 11 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance sent the Czech FA the reply of the German tax administration dated 9 July 2007,
According to which the German FA issued an enforcement order on 11 June 2007 to seize the bank account. The bank announced that it was not in business relationship with the named taxpayer.
This meant that the request for the German financial administration was deemed to have been settled.
10.
On 26 September 2005, the competent Czech FA sent the Czech Ministry of Finance a recovery request for VAT debts totalling CZK 1,296,845 = EUR 43 591.
The relevant Finance Directorate sent the request to the Ministry of Finance on 10 October 2005.
The Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request to the German financial administration on 15 December 2005.
Before submitting the request, the Czech FA enforced the tax requirement by seizing the accounts at banks and salary pledging as well as by debiting a property.
Prior to the recovery request, a request for information was sent to the German financial administration on 16 March 2005.
According to the reply letter of September 16, 2005 to the Czech FA, the Czech taxpayer was resident in Germany and had income from non-self-employed activities amounting to 8 437 euros. On April 20, 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a response to the recovery request and did not forward this to the competent Czech FA until February 12, 2008.
According to this, the tax liability in Germany is unrecoverable due to the debtor's insolvency.
No assets had been established, the income from non-self-employed activities was already the subject of other enforcement measures.
The German financial administration regarded the request as done.
4.4.4 Comparison and Evaluation
When it comes to recovery, the requirements of EU law apply to all EU Member States for intergovernmental mutual assistance.
The procedures for processing requests are therefore similar in the CZ and Germany.
The Federal Court of Auditors and the NK K ä rzte compared the statistics that the two Member States submitted to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.
There were discrepancies.
In its 200620 report, the European Commission recommended that Member States prepare their statistics more carefully.
In 200921, the Commission concluded that, despite a larger number of requests for assistance, discrepancies in the statistics have diminished.
Both courts of auditors believe that a renewed discussion at EU level on the statistics makes sense, so that the remaining discrepancies can be avoided in future.
If this does not happen, the statistics are conditionally meaningful and cannot be used for comparisons.
In addition, the Court of Auditors considers that the statistics should show both the annual number of requests and the type of claims (e.g. VAT, income tax) and the amount of amounts recovered per Member State.
Through a more detailed analysis of the statistics provided by Member States, the Commission could help Member States assess their measures to combat VAT fraud.
As the recovery rate can be calculated per Member State, the Court of Auditors argues that Member States with a low recovery rate should at least aim for the average recovery rate within the EU.
At the request of a Member State, the Commission could play an active role in this.
The foreign recovery requests received by the Ministry of Finance CZ were forwarded to the responsible F Ä with a delay, especially in 2006 and 2007.
The same applies to the recovery requests made by the Czech authorities.
The audit showed that the Czech Ministry of Finance was in breach of Law 191 / 2004 on intergovernmental recovery assistance in that it did not inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State of the progress of the recovery measures within the six-month period from receipt of the request.
4.5 VAT audit for large companies
4.5.1 VAT audit of large companies in the Czech Republic
General information
The tax procedure for large companies is subject to the same rules as for other taxpayers.
The audit of large companies is regulated by the Czech Law No. 337 / 1992, the "Tax and Fee Administration Act".
The Czech Ministry of Finance defines large companies as natural persons who have set up a business or legal persons who have been established to carry out a business and whose net turnover for the relevant tax period is at least CZK 2 billion according to the income or corporate tax return.
The taxpayer is classified as a large company based on the turnover according to income or corporate tax return in the respective tax period; for the first time for the year 2003.
A natural or legal person is no longer managed as a large company for the purposes of turnover taxation if, in three consecutive assessment periods, its net turnover in the tax period is less than CZK 2 billion. The period begins at the end of the tax period for which the conditions were met for the first time according to the tax return.
A taxpayer can only be removed from the list of large companies if at least one type of tax has been checked for a tax period.
Until the end of 2009, all large companies were audited at least every five years.
Since 2010, taxpayers have to be assessed in writing at least every two years. The subsequent control measures are intended to eliminate the tax risks and their negative effects on the proper assessment and collection of taxes.
The F Ä 's audits should focus on at least one type of tax; they usually include several tax periods.
The taxable large enterprises were audited by the special audit bodies or audit services of the responsible F Ä set up at a total of 13 F Ä.
A special audit body carried out audits in its local area of responsibility in accordance with the requirements of the head of the financial directorate.
In addition, she also examined
Taxpayers with unusual and special business activities and
Those whose examination required a high degree of expertise and time.
Taxpayers with complex location distribution and organisational structure are also audited,
Taxpayers suspected of large-scale tax evasion
As well as taxpayers belonging to chains and networks suspected of extensive tax evasion and unjustified deduction.
Information on the number of audits carried out by the special audit bodies of the F Ä and the additional tax results of these audits are shown in Table 3.
The Czech Ministry of Finance has submitted a proposal to amend Law No. 531 / 1990 for the regional tax authorities. In particular, the establishment of a special tax office with national responsibility for selected taxpayers (legal entities established for the purpose of economic activity, with a turnover of at least CZK 2 billion) is proposed.
4.5.2 VAT audit of large companies in Germany
General information
The VAT audit of large companies is not particularly regulated in Germany. For tax audits, the general provisions of the Tax Ordinance (AO), the Financial Administration Act (FVG) and the Audit Regulations (BPO) apply.
There are also work aids.
Levy order
The provisions of section 193 to 203 AO "Section 4 - External Audit" contain in particular rules for the admissibility of an external audit and its substantive scope, distribution of responsibilities, form and content of the audit announcement, audit principles, cooperation obligations of the taxpayer and requirements for final discussions and for the transmission of the audit report.
External audits are carried out by the responsible FE (accuracy 195 AO).
Tax Administration Act According to paragraph 1 no. 1 in conjunction with section 19, it is incumbent on the Federal Central Tax Office to participate in external audits of the F Ä.
The nature and scope of this cooperation will be agreed between the authorities involved.
In addition, the Federal Central Tax Office may require that certain companies designated by it be audited at a certain time.
In this case, it can establish rules for the external audit of these taxpayers.
Tax Audit Regulations In accordance with Article 108 (7) GG, the Tax Audit Regulations (BPO 2000) were issued with the consent of the Federal Council.
It applies to external audits by the state tax authorities and the Federal Central Tax Office.
Companies are regularly classified into size classes in accordance with the 3 BPO.
Large companies are to be subjected to a follow-up audit (Section 4.2 BPO).
In accordance with section 33.1 BPO, each responsible tax authority must maintain a group directory within the meaning of the provision.
Work aids for the administration
In addition, the following work aids have been published for the administration:
"Uniform Handbook for the VAT Special Examination";
VAT countries online - USLO (= dialogue system in the intra-Community VAT control procedure) with instructions on how to use the data contained in MIAS on intra-Community business relations;
Work aids for difficult and special situations.
Central database for storing and evaluating VAT fraud and developing risk profiles;
Taxpayers are classified into size classes based on criteria such as turnover and profit, although the limits vary depending on the business sector.
The figures are published by the Federal Ministry of Finance.
The values are reviewed every three years and set for the following three years.
The number of companies - not only large companies - can be determined regularly (last deadline: 1 January 2010).
In general, large companies must be fully audited.
The exams are announced and usually extend to VAT,
This means that the audit covers all relevant taxes, namely income and corporate tax as well as trade and VAT.
VAT can be audited either by tax auditors or by special VAT auditors.
The practice varies and depends on the administrative structure of the individual countries.
The number of tax periods covered by an audit usually varies between three and five years.
The BPO 2000 assumes three years.
All taxes to which a company has been assessed are subject to the audit.
4.5.3 Management of the VAT audit for large companies
According to the agreement, both courts of auditors did not audit individual cases. They investigated the question of how the financial administrations proceed in the VAT audit of large companies.
With the help of a questionnaire, they collected information from the tax authorities that is essential for auditing large companies.
Which statistical records and evaluations for the VAT audit of large companies are available to the management of the tax administration
In particular:
Are there any statistics or records on the extent to which a distinction is made between combating VAT fraud and general VAT auditing
CZ: No, the current version of the ATIS system does not allow such a distinction.
Germany: The tax administration makes no distinction between audits to combat VAT fraud and general VAT audits.
Are there any statistics or records about the timeliness of the tests
CZ: Information on the timeliness of audits of intra-Community acquisitions of selected VAT payers is recorded in the ATIS system;
The same applies to information about the beginning and end of the examination of the FA.
Germany: No, the statistics for auditors summarized at federal level only contain information about the so-called average last audit period (year).
This figure does not provide an overview of the audit periods selected for individual companies.
VAT special auditors focus on the last VAT assessment periods and are also authorised to audit large companies.
The statistics for VAT special auditors at federal level do not contain any information on the size class of the audited company.
Are there statistics or records about the type of multiple result; for example, divided by:
I. real additional result (e.g. application of a reduced VAT rate instead of the general VAT rate)
II. Untrue additional result (e.g. relocation / postponement of a matter not objectionable under VAT law to another tax period)
III. Cash effectiveness (payment of the fixed additional result)
CZ:
The Czech tax administration monitors the number of tax audits carried out, the amount of additional tax income broken down by tax type, the number of audited taxpayers and the number of audited tax periods.
Other tax procedures (on-site investigations, dunning procedures) are monitored in the same way.
Regardless of this, the amount of additional payments and incoming payments are recorded.
Statistics on tax liabilities are broken down by tax type. However, no distinction is made between tax liabilities arising from a tax return and those resulting from audit actions by the FA.
Germany: No, the statistics for tax auditors and VAT special auditors summarized at the federal level do not differ according to the above criteria.
Most tax authorities, where local surveys were carried out, did not differentiate in this regard.
Are promising test fields recorded
CZ: Yes, the FA can select examination cases based on criteria linked to selected indicators stored in the ATIS system.
Germany: There are no federal regulations.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for tax auditors and VAT special auditors do not provide such information.
However, the federal and state finance ministries have agreed on a joint approach.
According to this, tax auditors and tax investigators in the L ä nder must enter the additional tax result achieved by them in ZAUBER if a certain threshold is exceeded.
In this case, additional information must be provided, e.g. on the origin of the additional VAT result achieved.
What are the most common findings
CZ:
Large taxable companies have unjustifiably claimed input tax deduction for purchased goods and services,
Which have not been used for entrepreneurial activities in accordance with CZ 72 (1) UStG;
Which were used for representation expenses in accordance with the 75 (3) CZ UStG;
Due to invoices that do not comply with the requirements of CZ 73 (1) VAT
Taxable large companies have omitted the registration of VAT to be paid provided for in Article 21 (1) CZ UStG.
Germany: There are no federal regulations.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for tax auditors and VAT special auditors do not provide such information.
Findings on VAT from audits of large companies are not recorded separately by the countries.
However, the Federal Central Tax Office can evaluate the ZAUBER database, in which auditors and tax investigators of the L ä nder have to enter the additional tax result they achieve if a certain threshold is exceeded.
Does the financial administration analyze profitable audit areas and draw conclusions for strategic management
CZ: Yes, for example, nationwide audits are carried out with regard to risky goods and industries.
Germany: There are no federal regulations.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for tax auditors and VAT special auditors do not provide information on particularly "productive" audit fields.
There were different views among the survey bodies regarding the analysis of such information, the benefits and the way in which it was used.
Some senior finance directorates provide such information to the F Ä, but the F Ä is free to use it or not.
4.5.4 Comparison and Evaluation
As a result, large amounts of information are processed automatically in the CZ. Among other things, data from VAT audits, as well as key figures from balance sheets, profit and loss accounts are processed in the system.
The CZ is able to control the selection of risky cases based on a wide range of information.
The same applies to the evaluation and management of VAT audits in general.
The establishment of a special tax office for large companies is planned for 2012.
In Germany, the financial administration does not collect comparable amounts of data.
Accordingly, it is more difficult to perform these tasks in the same way.
The emphasis is more on the selection of individual cases.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
On the basis of the information in VAT pre-registrations or VAT declarations as well as test notes, qualified auditors select the cases to be examined and ensure the applicable taxation.
Appropriate management processes and risk management systems must be introduced in order to reduce revenue losses at VAT and at the same time increase the risk of being discovered for unreliable entrepreneurs.

5. Conclusions
The cooperation between the two audit institutions has proved its worth.
In this way, necessary insights into the systems used in both countries could be gained: This concerns in particular: Intra-community transactions, risk management at the VAT in particular with regard to the selection of risky transactions, debt recovery of VAT receivables and VAT audit of large companies.
The audit revealed differences in VAT fraud detection strategies and in the systems described above.
These findings can be used to improve existing procedures.
They can also be used to initiate a discussion with the interested parties as to which audit approaches and strategies can be used to combat fraud, for example in the relationship within and between the Member States and the EU Commission.
The experience and insights gained should encourage us to continue to jointly examine the administration of VAT in the future.
6. Communique
The report was prepared in Czech, English and German and signed by the presidents of the Czech Court of Auditors and the Federal Court of Auditors.
State of information: June 2010.
