High-quality transport networks are essential for maintaining and raising the standard of living in Europe.
Ensuring fast, safe, reliable and economic passenger and freight transport is an important task of the state.
This segment ISIN tention ally left blank
It requires a high level of organizational, technical and financial efforts.
When establishing and developing a sustainable European transport infrastructure, difficult compromises with European and national policy objectives often have to be made, such as the preservation of the environment.
Especially because of the necessary environmental protection measures, the construction of the transport infrastructure is complex.
When planning and awarding the construction of transport routes, administrations can save considerable financial resources and use them for other useful purposes through careful action and decision-making.
One of the tasks of state audit authorities is to identify deficiencies that prevent an Optimum level of economy, efficiency and effectiveness in spending on the construction of transport facilities.
The audit authorities should not only draw the attention of the administrations to the shortcomings identified, but also make suggestions for improvement for the benefit of the citizens and for the benefit of Europe.
Summary
In 2005 and 2006, the two Supreme Audit Institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic, the Federal Audit Office (BRH) and the Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad (Nkú), carried out parallel audits of expenditure on the construction of the Prague – Dresden motorway (D 8 motorway in the Czech Republic and a 17 motorway in the Federal Republic of Germany).
The two highways are connected by a border bridge jointly financed by both states.
The cooperation with the NKÚ enabled the BRH to carry out an in-depth examination of the cost-effectiveness of the use of funds in the construction of the border bridge.
In the course of its cooperation with the BRH, the NKÚ received data from German bridges and tunnels for its own cost comparisons.
In 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany signed a contract for the construction of the border bridge.
According to the Planning Progress, the date of completion was finally set for the end of 2006.
However, during the procurement procedure, the road and motorway Directorate of the Czech Republic (RMD) made mistakes that delayed the procedure and shortened the available construction time.
The contract with the contractor was therefore concluded later than planned.
The contractor ensured the accelerated construction of the bridge by the end of 2006.
However, the RMD had to accept considerable additional costs.
As part of the joint examination activity, the prices of motorway bridges on the D 8 and the A 17 were compared. The benchmark for the price comparison of the Bridges was the size of the bridge area.
A price analysis using statistical methods identified bridges with high costs per square meter.
The analysis showed that the border bridge, the most expensive was among the large bridges with lengths of about 100 m.
This was also due to the price increase resulting from the delays in the award.
The comparison of the prices of the tunnel structures showed that the prices of the tunnels in the course of the D 8 are significantly higher than the prices of comparable tunnels in Germany.
Both BRH and NKÚ can rely on a data collection of bridge and tunnel prices for future checks on the cost - effectiveness of transport infrastructure spending.
Both courts recommend to standardize bridge constructions and to carry out steel composite and special constructions only where prestressed concrete constructions are inexpedient.
The examination process was characterized by teamwork and an open approach.
During the parallel examination, the examiners from both sides exchanged their expertise and skills.
Introduction
The subject of this report is the parallel testing of expenditure on the construction of the motorway from Dresden to Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and a 17 in Germany).
The focus of the examination was on economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of funds.
The parallel tests were conducted by the BRH in Germany and the Nkú in the Czech Republic
in 2005 and 2006 by.
The NKÚ tested the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the expenditure for the near-border section 0807 of the D 8 motorway amounting to approx. 20 billion CZK gross (approx. 690 million €).
Of this amount, € 64 million will be made available from EU structural funds (ISPA).
The BRH had independently of the parallel tests with the NKÚ in the years 2003 to 2005 already examined the planning and construction of the motorway a 17.
Of the financial volume for the construction of all three sections of the A 17 of approx.€ 670 million, € 277 million will be co-financed by European funds (ERDF).
The Prague-Dresden motorway is part of the pan – European Transport Corridor IV Dresden - central and South – Eastern Europe-Istanbul.
The D 8 runs from Prague via Usti nad Labem to the Czech / German border,
the A 17 from the border to Dresden.
At the time of the test, the sections of the motorways near the border were under construction.
Both sections were opened to traffic on 21 December 2006.
While the motorway is thus completed on the German side to Dresden, the D 8 remains incomplete on the Czech side, as the section 0805 over a length of 16.4 km between Rehlovice and Lovosice is still in the planning phase.
Here the crossing of a protected landscape area in the bohemian low mountains is planned.
According to Czech forecasts from 2001, the traffic volume in 2008 in the border section 0807 of the D 8 motorway will amount to 22 940 cars per day.
German forecasts estimate the volume of traffic on the A 17 at the Czech border in 2010 at around 20%. 25 000 cars per day.
In 2000, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic concluded an agreement on the merger of the German a 17 motorway and the Czech D 8 motorway at the common state border by establishing a border bridge.
Since both States are involved in the construction of this bridge, this single construction project, an important aspect of the parallel audits of both SAIs.
Cooperation between BRH and NKÚ
From the middle of 2005, the two audit offices made joint considerations for cooperation in the examination of the construction of the Prague – Dresden motorway.
Both sides had important reasons for this cooperation:
1.
Germany partly finances the construction of the border bridge.
Planning and construction are the responsibility of the Czech road administration.
There was no possibility for the BRH to examine this construction project itself.
2.
The NKÚ did not have any comparative data to assess whether the funds were used sparingly in view of the total construction costs of the bridges and tunnels on the D 8.
3.
The NKÚ also had to check the effectiveness of the expenditure. For this purpose, the essential technical parameters of the bridges and tunnels should be examined, which should ensure the same quality of use on both sides of the border.
After preparatory negotiations, the presidents of the two courts of auditors concluded an agreement on the Coordination of inspections of the Prague – Dresden motorway on 4 January 2006. 
In the course of 2006, the auditors of both audit courts met at approximately six to eight-week intervals.
They dealt with current problems and tasks. They developed a uniform methodology for the examination of bridge and tunnel prices, exchanged examination results for the construction of the border bridge and prepared joint reports.
Essential to the cooperation was the ongoing exchange of information.
While the BRH focused primarily on the comparison of the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels as well as the procurement procedures, the NKÚ mainly developed the methodology for the analysis of bridge and tunnel prices.
In Germany and the Czech Republic, the legal basis for financial control differs, and thus also the way in which the two audit offices complete their audits.
For this reason, both authorities prepared separate national reports on their examination results.
This report takes into account the results of the two parallel tests.
The cooperation ends with the signing of a final communiqué in the first half of 2007.
Construction of the border bridge
In the Treaty of 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed to complete the border bridge in 2005 if possible.
Later they postponed the date until the end of 2006.
The RMD acted as the client of the construction project.
Germany is co-financing 42.13% of the bridge construction.
Initially, the RMD envisaged a prestressed concrete construction for the border bridge.
In 1999, however, the RMD agreed with its German Partner on the construction of a steel composite structure.
They based this decision on the possible reduction of the number of pairs of pillars from seven to five and the associated ecological benefits for the valley floodplain.
In addition, a comparative calculation of the RMD had indicated the steel composite construction as the more cost-effective solution.
However, this was due to a calculation error.
The calculation was based on a length of the new steel composite construction of only 397 m,
however, it is actually 5% longer.
During the procurement procedure, the RMD made serious errors,
by insufficiently preparing the procurement documents and inaccurately describing both evaluation criteria and sub-criteria.
These errors led to subjective and ambiguous assessments by the evaluation commission and the Director General of the RMD.
An unsuccessful bidder contested the outcome of the award procedure.
The subsequent investigation by the Czech cartel authority, delayed the signing of the construction contract for the border bridge.
As a result, the following summer construction season following the Tender Review was lost in 2004 and the available total construction time was shortened.
The contractor agreed to build the bridge in less time. This led to a significant price increase.
The measures offered included the double Assembly of the superstructures, the modification of the pillar shape and the construction of an assembly hall.
In addition, the contractor was unable to procure the originally intended steel grade.
The new steel grade - the higher costs of approx. The client alone contributed € 4 million - making it possible to shorten the construction time planned for corrosion protection and thus the overall construction time.
Compared to the offer price of approx. The total construction costs of the border bridge will increase significantly by € 18.3 million net as a result of the acceleration measures and other additions.
The shortened construction period alone led to a price increase of about €5.9 million.
The costs are currently approx. € 25.9 million net (as of October 2006).
Comparison of the prices of bridges and tunnels
Both courts examined the bridge prices on the D 8 and the A 17 in order to identify the bridges, which were characterized by particularly high prices and to compare the bridge prices on the German and Czech side.
The study was based on mathematical statistical methods.
The tunnels on the D 8 were compared with similar tunnels on the German motorways a 71, a 38 and a 4, as there were no comparable tunnels on the A 17.
When preparing this part of the exam, a precise definition of the price term was important.
For the comparison of bridge prices, both courts agreed on detailed specifications, such as: to use the current price paid for the bridge without VAT.
(VAT rates in the Czech Republic and Germany are different and may change.), not to take into account the costs of special start-up measures, to use the exchange rate of the European Central Bank of 30.12.2005 for currency conversion. (29 CZK = 1€).
Bridges of different types (reinforced concrete, prestressed concrete, steel composite and steel) and of different sizes are available on both the D 8 and the A 17.
In order to ensure the comparability of the tested bridge structures, the bridges were grouped according to their design.
The analyses also took into account the bridge size within these groups.
Concrete bridges were by far the most common on both sides of the border (20 bridges on the D 8 and 36 bridges on the A 17).
The study focused on this type of bridge because the size of the sample allowed the application of mathematical statistical methods and improved the reliability of the results.
The investigation showed that the m2-price of concrete bridges on the D 8 / A 17 depends on the bridge size (length, road surface area): the bigger the bridge, the lower the square metre price.
For German bridges, the correlation between price and size is more pronounced than for Czech bridges (see figures below).
On the A 17, two bridges and on the D 8 four bridges with a significantly increased price could be identified.
These bridges were determined partly by a method for determining significant deviations within a sample and partly by regression analysis of the correlation between Bridge price and size (atypical expensive bridges can be identified based on the distance to the regression curve).
However, the atypical high price of these bridges should only serve as an indication of which bridges to focus on.
In order to draw final conclusions, the causes for the respective high price have to be determined in individual cases.
This could be due, for example, to uneconomical administrative action, but also to the requirements for the protection of the environment or other legitimate reasons.
Taking into account the greater average length of Czech concrete bridges compared to Germans (see Table 1), the proven negative correlation between Bridge price and length led to the expectation that Czech concrete bridges would be cheaper.
In addition, labour costs in the Czech Republic were lower than in Germany.
However, the evaluation of the results showed that the price of the concrete bridges on the D 8 is higher than on the A 17.
During joint discussions, two causes for this situation were identified:
1.
In Germany, construction contracts for bridges are mainly awarded separately.
This also enables medium-sized companies to participate in the award competition.
In the Czech Republic, many bridge constructions are awarded as part of larger contracts for the construction of several kilometres of motorway sections.
Orders of this size cannot be handled by medium-sized companies.
2.
In the Czech Republic, the variety of bridge structures built is greater than in Germany.
In this context, the NKÚ noted that the construction of Bridges is determined long before construction begins,
this was already the case when the RMD submitted the application for planning approval.
At this time, it selects a specific bridge construction variant from several alternatives. However, economic efficiency plays a minor role in this decision.
Only by means of a thorough analysis of the construction industries of both countries would a final conclusion with regard to bridge prices in the Czech Republic and Germany have been possible. However, this would have blown up the scope of this examination.
The border bridge is the most expensive steel composite bridge on the D 8 and A 17.
The prices for the tunnels on the D 8 are about twice as high as in Germany.
A comparison of the technical parameters between the tunnels on the D 8 and the tunnels in Germany revealed no significant difference.
The significant price differences may result from underdeveloped competition for tunnel construction in the Czech Republic.
However, the small number of tunnels did not allow any generalizing conclusions.
Efficiency and effectiveness of the Dresden – Prague motorway
The independent Czech Republic was founded in 1993.
In the same year, the government adopted the plan for the expansion of the highway network.
It was planned to gradually extend the D 8 from Prague to the state border with Germany.
The section 0805 through the bohemian central mountains was to be built in front of the border section 0807.
The Czech Republic finances the D 8 within the framework of the programme financing.
In the program number 327 220 “construction of highway D 8 Prague – Ústí nad Labem – Czech-German state border” defined two objectives :
1.
as a national goal: to improve the connection between Prague and Ústi nad Labem;
2.
as an international destination: the connection between Prague and Berlin as part of the pan-European transport corridor IV Berlin-Istanbul.
The plan was to complete the construction of the section through the bohemian Highlands in June 2008 and the construction of the section near the border 0807 in June 2007.
It should be noted that the end of the construction work is not identical to the date of commissioning.
The NKÚ determined that the planning decision had already been issued for the construction of the section leading through the bohemian uplands.
Environmental associations have appealed against this decision.
A final judgment is still pending.
Compared to the schedule provided for in the program documentation, a delay of several years in the completion of Section no.0805 could not be ruled out.
In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of transport proposed a postponement of the completion date of the construction section No. 0805 for the year 2010.
As a result, the construction of the border section did not achieve the national objective of improving the connection between Prague and Usti nad Labem.
In the years 1999 to 2001, the RMD carried out an economic assessment of the border section No. 0807 of the D 8 and Section No. 0805 through the bohemian uplands.
As investment costs, it set approx. € 639 million for both sections no. 0805, and no. 0807 of.
Table 2: results of the profitability analysis ( EIRR = internal rate of return)
Variant opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.
Traffic volume in the northern part of the border section 18 000 cars per day in 2010.
Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.
Traffic volume in the northern part of the border section 22 000 cars per day in 2010.
Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.
Traffic volume in the northern part of the border section 25 000 cars per day in 2010.
The economic feasibility study from 2001 was based on the assumption that the section near the border and the section through the bohemian central mountains will be subject to traffic at the same time.
At the time of the examination it was obvious that the section through the bohemian uplands would not be opened at the original date.
This reduces the aforementioned EIRR values.
The costs of both sections were € 897 million excluding VAT as at 31.12.2005, 27.4% higher than in the profitability analysis of 2001.
In addition, there is a risk that section 0805 will have a different, more complex course of action, which would affect the profitability of the project.
The economic analysis showed that the construction of both sections of the motorway is economically justified with a daily traffic volume of at least 18,000 vehicles per day in 2010.The forecast for 2008 had predicted 22 940 cars per day.
However, a study on diversion routes as an Alternative to the missing section through the bohemian central mountains assumes a traffic volume of 12,600 to 13,750 cars per day in 2007. The project is then below the profitability limit.
A higher volume of traffic on the routes intended to replace the missing section with the bohemian Uplands is highly likely to result in congestion and thus increased external costs, which were not taken into account in the original economic analysis.
The aforementioned reduction in revenues and increase in costs means that the already low EIRR for the construction of the border section of the D 8 will not be achieved.
The construction of the border section of the D 8 is, therefore, uneconomical.
Also with the construction of the A 17 there were cost increases as with the construction of the two above mentioned sections of the D 8.
As part of the overall economic assessment for the federal transport infrastructure plan 1992, the Federal Ministry responsible for Transport assumed investment costs of approx. € 320 million.
Thus, it determined a benefit/cost ratio of 4.6.
Meanwhile, the costs have increased to approx. € 670 million and reduced the benefit/cost ratio by more than half.
The BRH had independently of the parallel tests with the NKÚ in the years 2003 to 2005 the economics of the planning and construction of the motorway a 17 examined.
He noted that the authority responsible for the permit requested an unnecessary landscape tunnel for the third section of the A 17.
In the course of the examination, the BRH succeeded in convincing the Federal Ministry and the road construction administration of the superfluity of the landscape tunnel.
As a result, € 10 million in construction costs and € 150,000 in annual operating costs could be avoided.
During the examination of the first section of the A 17, the BRH found that the construction project was insufficiently prepared.
The following example illustrates this:
In the planning phase, the road administration did not measure the condition of the rock on the surface of the Dölzschen wall, as it was difficult to access.
Only when the tunnelling reached the wall did it catch up.
This showed that the Rock was more weathered than was assumed in the tender.
Elaborate measures such as anchorages, injections and rockfall protection nets for around€ 3.3 million were necessary.
The road construction administration not only bore the costs for additional, already required eistungen such as securing the Dölzschener wall, but also for those, which would not have been necessary at all with a perfect construction preparation.
This includes expenses due to disrupted construction processes (€3.2 million), additional training of the tunnelling team (€0.5 million) and increased wages and material prices due to the extension of construction time (€7 million).
These additional expenditures of around € 10.7 million do not represent any lasting added value.
The BRH took these and other measures as an opportunity to call on the Federal Ministry to exercise better the technical supervision for major road construction measures which was incumbent upon it.
In this context, it should urge that road construction administrations introduce quality assurance systems.
Advantages of the cooperation for BRH and NKÚ the cooperation fulfilled the expectations of both courts of auditors.
The BRH received insights into the planning, procurement and implementation of the construction of the border bridge.
Both audit offices developed a database on Bridge and tunnel prices, which will be helpful in future audits.
The NKÚ found that the most important structural parameters for bridges, tunnels and carriageway of the D 8 did not differ from those of the A 17.
The auditors of both audit offices involved in the cooperation gained valuable experience that will be of use in future audits.
Report on the results of the parallel audit of the administration of VAT of the Czech Republic and Germany
Preface
The Lima Declaration, adopted in 1977, stresses that the courts of auditors are empowered to audit all public finances.
The declaration requires that the courts of auditors have the power to examine the tax collection as much as possible.
The organisation of European supreme audit institutions (EUROSAI) regards taxes as an important component of public revenue.
The thematic focus of the sixth EUROSAI Congress, which took place in Bonn in 2005, was the audit of public revenues by the court of auditors.
One of the most important steps on the way to optimizing the audit activities of a court of Auditors is the development of a special strategy for the audit of public revenue.
This is especially true for taxes as the largest source of public revenue with a high risk of default.
As the national economies are increasingly interlinked and interdependent, a Situation may arise in which the National Audit offices can only carry out their audit work in cooperation with the audit offices of other countries.
As an example, the examination of internationally organized fraud can be considered, which can lead to significant revenue losses in many states.
Cooperation between the authorities is required in the fight against such crimes.
Courts of auditors that audit in this area must be prepared to cooperate closely with each other.
The idea for an examination of the value added tax and the MIAS system originated at the 6th EUROSAI Congress in Bonn. This audit was carried out in cooperation between the court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Audit Office.
In the course of thorough preparation, the participating audit offices first had to familiarize themselves with the legal framework and procedures of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.
On the basis of the evaluation of the available information, we selected the subjects for the examination planning.
Achieving the efficient and effective management of VAT is a long-standing Problem and individual states (especially the EC member states) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify the collection of VAT and create greater transparency in this area.
We are convinced that the results of our audit will not only contribute to improving the work of the financial administration, but can also form the basis for a proposal for an improved system of international exchange of information.
Report on the results of the parallel audit of the administration of VAT of the Czech Republic and Germany
Introduction
Reference number: CZ) 06/27 (de) VIII 2 – 2005 – 1215
Subject of examination -:
(CZ) administration of VAT after the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union
(En) examination of administrative cooperation in the field of Value Added Tax pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003 and 1925/2004
the commission's audit objective:
(CZ) the purpose of the audit in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedures applied by the tax administration in the field of Value Added Tax following the Integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter “EC”) with free movement of goods and services and the use of MIAS1, in particular the control of the use of the VAT exemption for intra - community deliveries.
(DE) The purpose of the audit was to examine the system of intra-community VAT control with a focus on administrative assistance in the field of VAT in accordance with the above-mentioned regulations.
As a result of the audit, vulnerabilities should be identified and recommendations made to remedy them.
VAT information exchange system the audits were carried out jointly by the court of Auditors of the Czech Republic ("Nkú") and the Federal Audit Office ("BRH") of the Federal Republic of Germany on the basis of an agreement concluded on 8 June 2006. 
The cooperation focused on the review of selected business transactions between entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the exploitation of information obtained through international administrative assistance between the financial administrations and the comparison of VAT management systems in the two countries.
A joint final report on the results of the audits has been prepared in accordance with European Guideline No. 31 on the implementation of INTOSAI audit standards.
The period under review covered the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005. 
Summary of results and evaluation of parallel testing
The parallel audit of the VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two accounting offices.
In addition to the focus on "information exchange" in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003 and Commission Regulation (EC) no 1925/2004, other closely related aspects were also examined, such as the registration of taxpayers, tax returns and summary declarations.
In addition, the audit also covered the legal situation regarding cross-border passenger transport by bus and the comparison of statistical data.
When comparing the systems of VAT administrations in the two states, differences were found in the following areas::
1) registration for VAT purposes.
While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, among others, the main criterion for registration is exceeding the turnover threshold specified in the VAT Act.
In the Czech Republic, taxpayers receive only one tax identification number, which they also use for intra-community transactions.
In Germany, the taxable person receives a tax number valid only for domestic sales for VAT purposes.
If the German taxpayer wants to make intra-community transactions, he must issue a special identification number, the so-called VAT ID number., request.
As problems arise from the different registration procedures, the regulations should be standardized within the EC (see 4.1).
2) international passenger transport by bus.
In the Czech Republic, cross-border passenger transport by bus is VAT-free, but there is a right to deduct input tax.
In Germany, the transport service, insofar as the route passes through Germany, is subject to VAT.
Efforts should be made at EC level to harmonise the situation in accordance with Article 393 of Council Directive 2006/112/ EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of Value Added Tax (see 4.2).
3) tax returns.
Whereas in the Czech Republic taxable persons are required to submit VAT returns only for tax periods during the year (month or quarter), in Germany taxable persons (monthly or quarterly)
Pre-registrations of sales tax and a declaration of sales tax after the end of the calendar year.
In contrast to the Czech Republic, taxpayers in Germany have to submit VAT pre-registrations electronically.
The introduction of the obligation to submit VAT returns electronically in the Czech Republic would improve the efficiency of the Czech financial administration (see 4.3).
4) Summary Messages.
While taxpayers in the Czech Republic have to submit their summary reports to the tax authorities (FÄ), German taxpayers have to submit the summary reports to CLO2.
Accordingly, FAS in the Czech Republic have access to the information from the summary reports immediately after their submission.
The information from the summary reports is only available to German FÄ after their processing by the CLO.
To combat VAT fraud, updated information on intra-community sales is needed as soon as possible.
The monthly submission of summary reports would shorten the period between the time of sales and the update of MIAS data.
This would allow a timely examination of taxation in the member state of the acquirer (see 4.4), but only if all EC member states introduce the same deadlines.
5) International exchange of Information in the field of VAT.
For incoming requests for information, the Czech CLO monitors compliance with the three-month deadline.
The German CLO does not monitor processing times.
As a result, the German financial administration has completed a significantly lower percentage of the requests for information received within the specified period.
Because of these problems, the BRH has recommended to the German CLO a constant monitoring of the deadlines (see 4.6).
6) risk management.
Each of the two member states is to develop its own risk management system (RMS) with corresponding strengths and weaknesses.
The NKÚ and the BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by a member state alone.
Successful criteria, elements or approaches of an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in all EC member states. Otherwise, scammers will choose the member state with the weakest RMS (see 5.).
Within the framework of the cooperation, the two audit offices examined selected cases of intra-community transactions carried out between Czech and German tax entities.
Of these, 31 cases were examined jointly by using the legal possibilities of the CLO, in which there were doubts about the correct taxation or the suspicion of VAT fraud.
The court of auditors noted the following::
In some cases, the FA used the information obtained in the international exchange of information and redefined the VAT liability of the taxable persons concerned.
In these cases, the taxpayers had either unlawfully claimed the VAT exemption or had not reported the purchase of goods in their VAT return.
In some cases, the FA could not use the information obtained in the exchange of information because it was incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be used because of different legal regulations in the two member states.
In some cases, the financial administration of another member state refused to provide the requested information.
A number of cases have been uncovered in which taxpayers misrepresented sales in their summary reports.
As a result, the data in the MIAS were correspondingly incorrect, so that the clerks (the FA) had to determine in these cases (see 6).
Test procedure
Examination procedure in the CR
The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by Department II – "state budget revenue" and the Territorial audit departments of Central Bohemia, North-West Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.
The audit bodies were: the Ministry of Finance and the 10 FÄ Humpolec, Jihlava, Kadaň, Liberec, Nymburk, Otrokovice, Prague 1, Prague 4, Sokolov and Třinec.
The College of the NKÚ approved the examination findings on 23 April 2007.
Examination procedure in Germany
The examination was carried out in the period July 2006 to February 2007 by the examination area traffic taxes and employees of the assigned PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt/Main and Munich.
It was part of the work plan for 2006 and was therefore announced to the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2006.
After a test phase, the actual testing began in the 4th quarter of 2006.
According to the cases selected by the BRH and later by the NKÚ, the BRH had to announce the examination in several federal states.
Apart from Interviews in the BMF and the CLO, the examination was conducted in the following federal states:
Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.
Tax files from the following FA were included in the audit:
Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, München-Körperschaften, München II, IV und München V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-Nord und Hamburg für Großunternehmen, Hannover-Nord, Winsen-Luhe, Bonn-Innenstadt, Köln-Mitte, Köln-Porz, Köln-Süd, Sankt Augustin, Pirmasens, Bautzen, Chemnitz-Süd, Dresden II, Freiberg, Leipzig I and Zschopau.
Discussions were also held with the FÄ Augsburg-Stadt, Aurich, Düsseldorf-Altstadt, Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.
The examination results were communicated to the BMF in May 2007.
Cooperation between the two courts of auditors
In the run-up to the parallel audit, several meetings of representatives of both audit courts took place.
The participants in these meetings familiarized themselves with the organization of the tax administration, the legislation on sales tax and the system of sales tax administration in the other country.
The subject of the test phase was agreed at the meeting in May 2006.
The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint Meeting in August 2006.
At this meeting, a timetable for the further procedure was drawn up and the following examination topics were determined for the parallel examinations: 1.
Registration of Taxpayers.
2.
Cross - border passenger transport by bus – legislation in the Czech Republic and Germany.

An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, Registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic whose turnover exceeds CZK 1,000,000 in the last 12 consecutive calendar months shall be liable for payment on the first day of the third month after the month in which he has exceeded the threshold (section 94 (1) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., with regard to VAT; hereinafter referred to as “Law No. 235/2004”).
The person concerned must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he or she has crossed the registration threshold.
The current legislation does not allow the retroactive registration of a taxpayer if the latter has exceeded the application deadline for registration.
An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, Registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic who provides services subject to VAT or services exempt from VAT with the right to deduct input tax must register for VAT even if his turnover does not exceed CZK 1 million, but he fulfils other conditions specified in Law No. 235/2004.
An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, Registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic who does not fulfil any of the conditions set out in the law may voluntarily apply for registration for VAT.
Upon receipt of the registration application by the local tax officer, the registration procedure according to Act No. 337/1992 begins.
If you want to register voluntarily for VAT, you must specify in your application the reference date from which you apply for registration as a VAT-liable person.
The financial officer must check the information provided by the entrepreneur, i.e. the completed application for registration with all attachments.
If he has doubts about the information provided therein, he shall request the applicant to explain, supplement or substantiate the information provided.
If the tax officer has ascertained by verification that the entrepreneur meets the requirements for registration, he must issue a written notification of registration and the allocation of a tax number.
In the communication, the tax officer must indicate the date of entry into force of the registration for VAT and the assessment period for VAT.
The assessment period is the calendar quarter, unless the turnover of the entrepreneur for the previous calendar year has reached the amount of at least CZK 10,000,000.
If this is the case, the assessment period is the calendar month.
An entrepreneur whose turnover has reached at least CZK 2,000,000 in the previous calendar year is entitled to choose the calendar month as the assessment period and must inform the tax officer of this change.
The issue of a tax number in the registration certificate is always constitutive.
The taxpayer is required to provide the tax number for all communications (including payments) with the tax officer, as well as in cases where a special law requires this (e.g. Law No. 235/2004, concerning the preparation of tax documents)3.
The tax number contains the code " CZ " and a basic component in the form of a general identification mark.
In the case of natural persons, this is the number of the birth certificate or another general identification mark, insofar as this is determined by a special law. For legal entities, the general identification mark is the company identification number (according to the provisions of § 33 (12) of law no.337/1992).
If the entrepreneur has not fulfilled his obligation despite a request from the tax official, the locally competent tax official has to register him ex officio.
A notification is also issued to the Taxable Person.
In the Czech Republic, every entrepreneur authorised to do business receives a tax number for any type of tax on his first registration.
This also applies to registration as a VAT payer.
According to Law No. 235/2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, in the event of non-compliance with the duty to register Value Added Tax, the tax officer may require that the taxpayer receive up to 10% of the proceeds of the taxable turnover that the person concerned has unlawfully effected without taxation, for the period from the date on which the entrepreneur should have been registered as a taxable person until the date on which the registration as a taxable person took place by order of the tax officer (§ 98 (1) of Law No. 235/2004).
The payment of the amount thus determined shall be considered as a tax payment within the meaning of § 98 (3) of Law No. 235/2004, i.e. it is not a fine or penalty.
If the legal requirements are met, the registration of a person liable for VAT can be deleted for two reasons:
1)
Cancellation of registration at the request of the taxpayer, i.e. mainly for the reason that the turnover does not reach the threshold for registration (§ 106 (1) of Law No. 235/2004).
A taxpayer may request the cancellation of his registration at the earliest one year after the date of entry into force specified in the registration notice.
2) cancellation of registration ex officio (Section 106 (7) of Law No. 235/2004), if: (a) the taxpayer has not performed any service for 12 consecutive months and has not informed the tax officer of the reasons for doing so; (B) the taxpayer has not fulfilled his obligations under Law No. 235/2004; (C) the previous taxpayer no longer fulfils the requirements for tax liability.
B) taxable persons without legal domicile, Registered office or business premises in the Czech Republic a person who is registered for tax purposes in another member state and who does not have his legal domicile, Registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic or a taxable foreigner who provides services in the Czech Republic and who has to file a tax return and pay taxes for these services or supplies in accordance with Section 108 of Act No. 235/2004 ("non-resident entrepreneur") becomes taxable upon the provision of the relevant service.
At the latest on the day of the delivery in question, the customer must submit an application for registration with the Prague 1 company.
In this application, he is obliged to provide all VAT ID numbers assigned to him in other member states or third countries. specify.
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration later than on the day of the first taxable performance in the Czech Republic, the Prague 1 company has to register him retroactively, as he became subject to VAT in accordance with Law No. 235/2004 on the day of the first taxable performance in the Czech Republic.
In the case of retroactive registration, the Prague 1 company must request proof (invoices or written explanations) from the entrepreneurs concerned for the proof of performance.
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration in the Czech Republic before performing a service for the first time, the Prague 1 company must request the presentation of the performance-based contract documents.
As of 31 December 2004, 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered with FA Prag 1, 124 of them from Germany. As of December 31, 2005, a total of 951 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered, 233 of them from Germany.
According to the provisions of § 106 (9) of Law No. 235/2004, the tax officer is authorized to delete the registration of a non-resident entrepreneur on January 31 of the following calendar year if the latter does not accept the obligation to submit tax applications or declarations and to pay tax. 
During the examination of the NKÚ, it turned out that if a tax return is submitted by Post with dispatch abroad on January 25, i.e. according to the mandatory deadline for submitting a tax return, this declaration has not yet been received by the FA by January 31. 
In cases where these facts, which are relevant for the possibility of cancellation of the registration, become known to the FA later than January 31, it is no longer possible to cancel the registration of the non-resident entrepreneur for VAT in the Czech Republic in the relevant calendar year. 
Registration of taxpayers in Germany
According to the provisions of the Tax Ordinance (§§ 137, 138 AO), every business must be registered with the municipality and/ or the competent tax office.
This registration must be made at the latest one month after commencement of business activities.
The municipality forwards the application to the tax authorities.
If the competent tax office finds that a business activity has commenced but has not been declared, it may also register the taxpayer ex officio retroactively.
In Germany taxpayers, regardless of whether they are resident or non-resident, are obliged to register for Zwekke of the value added tax if they meet the requirements of § 2 of the German Value Added Tax Act (Ustg).
This does not depend on the amount of revenue generated.
There is no voluntary registration in Germany.
Special FÄ are responsible for entrepreneurs resident abroad.
For example, the CHEMNITZSÜD FA is responsible for those entrepreneurs who have their headquarters in the Czech Republic.
A total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered as of 30 April 2004; 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered as of 1 March 2006.
According to the findings of the BRH, this ABIL denied with special responsibilities, often the registration of so-called Bogus self-employed resident in the new mid. Eastern European member states of the EC.
Since the free movement of workers is still restricted after the accession of these ten countries to the EC, these self-employed persons tried to circumvent these restrictions by setting up their own business.
These (sham)self-employed persons do not fulfil the requirements for recognition as entrepreneurs as defined in § 2 UStG, since they are usually dependent on a single client who determines their working time and the type of work performed.
In order to be registered, the entrepreneur must complete a questionnaire from the relevant FA and provide information on the company and the business carried out.
The questionnaire is a form that is binding for all FÄ in Germany.
It is processed either in special organisational units within the FA or in the organisational units generally responsible for tax assessment.
With the help of this form, a risk assessment is carried out for the individual taxpayer before the allocation of a tax number.
The structure of the tax number for domestic sales is based on certain specifications:
The first three digits are the identification number for the competent FA, the following three (or four) digits indicate which department is responsible within the FA, the following five (or four) digits are the identification feature for the taxpayer, the last digit is always a control digit.
If an entrepreneur wants to participate in intra-community trade, he needs a VAT ID number in order to be able to make tax-free intra-community deliveries.
This is allocated by the CLO on request if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany for VAT purposes.
The VAT-IdNr. is automatically allocated by the CLO if the taxable person declares intra-community deliveries in his VAT pre-registrations or in his annual VAT declaration.
The VAT-IdNr. consists of the country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.
The registration of an entrepreneur can be deleted: 1. on request (e.g. if he stops doing business), but only after processing all tax transactions (assessment of all financial years) or 2. if the financial administration determines that he no longer operates a business.
As a rule, the validity of the VAT ID number depends. from the validity of the VAT number.
In these cases, the FÄ must inform the CLO about the deletion of the VAT number, so that there the validity of the VAT ID number. at this time can be terminated.
According to the value added tax act (§ 19 (1) UStG), domestic taxpayers do not have to pay any value added tax in the following cases: 1. the turnover of the previous calendar year plus the subsequent value added tax did not exceed the amount of € 17,500 and 2. will probably not exceed the amount of € 50,000 in the following year.
The so-called small entrepreneurs are not entitled to charge VAT to other entrepreneurs, nor are they entitled to deduct VAT.
Although you do not have to pay any sales tax, small business owners are required to register with the tax office and submit an annual sales tax return.
A small business owner may declare the non-application of § 19 (1) UStG.
This declaration is binding for the following five years.
He may then invoice the value added tax and deduct the input tax.
Non-resident taxpayers may appoint a fiscal representative (§22a UStG).
The prerequisite for this is that you make exclusively tax-free sales and waive the input tax deduction.
The fiscal representative fulfils the tax obligations of the foreign entrepreneur, so that he does not have to register for VAT purposes.
The invoices shall indicate that a fiscal representative has been appointed.
Comparison and evaluation
The Situation in the two countries is different.
While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the first requirement for registration (among others) is the exceeding of the threshold amount specified in the VAT Act.
If an entrepreneur does not exceed this threshold, he can register voluntarily.
The registration procedure in Germany is standardized, but differences can occur due to different organizational structures in the individual federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the taxpayer receives a tax number for any tax at the time of his first registration.
In the case of registration for VAT, this tax number also applies to intra-community transactions.
In Germany, an entrepreneur who registers for VAT purposes receives a tax number exclusively for internal German sales.
If the German entrepreneur wants to carry out intra-community transactions, he must specifically allocate a VAT ID number. request.
Both the NKÚ and the BRH noted that the German two-stage registration system in other member states such as the Czech Republic, which issues a single identification number for both national VAT registration and intra-community transactions, can lead to significant misunderstandings.
On the other hand, the two-stage system allows retroactive (national registration) in cases where the taxpayer does not register his business with the municipality or the competent FA.
This retroactive registration allows a correct assessment of VAT for previous assessment periods, in particular an accurate estimate of VAT liability.
Since the different registration procedures lead to problems, the regulations for the whole EC should be standardized.
The German parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number.
This should be allocated by the federal Central Tax Office to each natural person after birth.
This number is valid for life for natural persons resident in Germany.
If a natural person starts a business activity, the competent FA applies for a commercial tax identification number, which is registered as a VAT ID number. serve.
In the future, therefore, there should be no delay between the National Registration of a taxpayer and the allocation of the VAT ID number. give.
Work on the implementation of an IT procedure for managing the numbers has not yet been completed.
Cross-border passenger transport by bus
Legal regulations in the Czech Republic
According to the provisions of Section 70 of Act No. 235/2004, since 1 May 2004, the transport of passengers between member states and between member states and third countries in the Czech Republic has been exempt from VAT and there is a right to deduct input tax. 
Exemption from Value Added Tax shall also apply where the carriage is carried out by persons registered as taxable persons in other member states or by foreigners taxable in the territory of the country.
The return journey is considered a separate transport process.
If non-resident entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic do not carry out any economic activity other than cross-border passenger transport by bus, they are not obliged to register as liable to VAT in the Czech Republic.
International passenger transport in the Czech Republic has been exempted from VAT due to the act of accession of the Czech Republic Annex V, Chapter 5 (1) (B). The cited body States in the wording:
"For the purpose of applying Article 28(3) (b) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Czech Republic may, in accordance with point 17 of Annex F to the directive, maintain the exemption for cross-border passenger transport until the condition of Article 28(4) of the directive is fulfilled or until the same exemption is applied by any of the present member states.“
The legal regulations in Germany
Pursuant to Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006, as implemented in Germany by § 3b (1) UStG, a transport service is carried out where the transport is effected. 
Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and cross-border passenger transport.
Only the domestic part of the transport service is taxable in Germany.
German taxation also does not distinguish between resident and non-resident (Bus)entrepreneurs.
If a non-resident taxable person travels through Germany, the part of the transport attributable to Germany shall be deemed to be taxable transport.
Before providing its services in Germany, the non-resident entrepreneur must report his intention to provide passenger transport services to the competent FA.
The latter registers it for tax purposes (see 4.1.2) and issues a special certificate for each bus mentioned in the taxpayer's registration.
The entrepreneur must indicate his taxable transport services in a German VAT return.
As of 1 March 2006, 741 Czech bus operators were registered with Chemnitz-Süd.
If the transport service is provided for an entrepreneur resident in Germany, the non-resident taxpayer does not have to pay the VAT to the FA himself.
In its place, the domestic customer of the services has to pay the VAT to the tax office and the net amount invoiced to the non-resident taxpayer. This process is referred to as" shifting the tax liability partnership " and is in line with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC.
In addition to the registration by a non-resident taxpayer and his income tax return, the German tax administration has several means of verifying the correctness of the tax return with regard to taxable passenger transport:
Mobile control groups of customs check the certificates of buses registered abroad, which are used for passenger transport through Germany.
After each inspection, the mobile control groups send an inspection report to the FA responsible.
If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group may require the bus driver to pay VAT before continuing his journey.
The non-resident taxable person may deduct the VAT paid in this way from the tax liability specified in his VAT return.
If the FA has doubts about the correctness of a VAT return, it may order an audit to be carried out in the FA or may use the means of administrative assistance referred to in Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003 (see point 4.6).
Even if the foreign taxpayer refuses to pay the legally established VAT, the FA may request assistance in accordance with council directive 76/308/EEC.
The BRH considers these means of administrative assistance in tax matters for the verification of the VAT return or compliance with the tax obligation by a non-resident bus operator to be too costly in relation to the low revenue from VAT on taxable passenger transport.
In particular, the examination of the books of a non-resident taxpayer incurs disproportionately high costs for the taxpayer himself and for the financial administration.
The latter must examine the foreign books, which requires not only knowledge of the foreign language, but also of foreign accounting principles.
Accordingly, such an audit is to be expected to take more time than that of a resident taxpayer, although the audit is limited to passenger transport in Germany.
On the other hand, the non-resident taxpayer must not only accept the audit rights of his national tax administration, but also those of the other member states to the extent that he carries out passenger transport there.
In addition, for each member state where only one passenger transport is carried out, the Taxable Person must fulfil all existing tax obligations in the various languages and on the basis of the forms provided by the tax administrations of the EC member states concerned.
Thus, the correct taxation of cross-border Passenger Transport Services leads to a disproportionately high administrative burden.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation is different in the two states.
In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between different EC member states as well as between member states and third countries is exempt from VAT under the act of accession of the Czech Republic to the EC.
In Germany, the transport service is subject to VAT in accordance with the transport route covered by German national territory.
If a non-resident taxpayer provides such a transport service for the first time, he must notify the competent FA in advance.
This registers the taxable person who must declare the taxable portion of the transport service in a tax return in Germany.
Law enforcement in Germany is very time-consuming.
At least three out of four Czech taxpayers registered with Chemnitz-Süd have passenger transport as a business purpose.
The tax revenue in question is quite low in relation to administrative expenses.
Member states – which collect VAT pursuant to Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of Value Added Tax-have a high administrative burden in relation to the relevant tax revenue. 
In order to avoid the disproportionately high costs of assessment of Value Added Tax, cross-border passenger transport should only be subject to taxation in one member state.
This could be the state in which the promotion begins or in which the service provider is located.
Such a type of taxation would require an amendment to Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006. 
VAT returns
Filing and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic
Unless the law provides otherwise, the entrepreneur is obliged to submit a VAT return on the form specified by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days of the end of the tax period, even if no tax liability has arisen.
The tax liability arises upon expiry of the deadline for submitting the VAT return. According to Law No. 235/2004, VAT on the import of goods is excluded from this provision. Here, the due date of the tax is determined according to the customs regulations.
If, as a result of an above-average deductible input tax, a claim for a refund is made, this amount will be refunded to the taxpayer within 30 days of the determination of this input tax deduction, without any application having to be made.
The time limit shall not be applied in cases where the tax officer initiates a tax procedure with regard to the taxpayer's tax liability.
According to § 73 (11) of Law No. 235/2004, the right to deduct input tax can be asserted at the latest with the regular tax return for the last tax period of the calendar year in which the right to deduct input tax arose.
After expiry of this period, the input tax deduction can still be asserted within three years after the end of the tax period in which the assertion would have been possible for the first time.
However, this requires the submission of a supplementary income tax return.
An amendment to Act No. 235/2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, allows the submission of a supplementary VAT return only for the period in which the right to deduct input tax could have been claimed for the first time.
A taxable person must submit a supplementary VAT return if: a) the sum of the corrections leads to an increase in the tax liability, b) he makes corrections which do not change the last known tax liability but only change previous information, c) he makes corrections to the VAT rate and the tax liability in accordance with Section 49 of Law No. 235/2004.
A taxable person may submit a supplementary VAT return if the sum of the corrections reduces the tax liability.
The Taxable Person must submit the supplementary tax return by the end of the month following the month in which the relevant facts were established.
The VAT return can be submitted electronically either via the Internet or by means of data carriers.
The submission via the Internet can be done with a certified electronic signature or without it.
If it is made without an electronic signature, it must also be submitted on data carriers.
The VAT return form contains separate lines indicating the value of intra-community deliveries and purchases.
The value of services purchased must be indicated in separate lines of the VAT return.
Some sections are used for automated primary controls within the ATIS system.
The value of goods delivered to other EC member states to persons registered as taxable there is compared with the data provided by Czech taxpayers in their summary declarations.
The value of purchases of goods from other member states from persons registered as taxable there is compared with the information contained in the summary declarations of taxable persons from other EC member states by means of the MIAS.
Within the framework of the ATIS system, the FA carries out a credibility check of the VAT returns.
This is done automatically, as the VAT return cannot be processed without the prior examination.
The credibility check includes a calculation of the standards for credibility and an assessment of the risks of VAT returns.
According to the provisions of Section 37 (1) of Act No. 337/1992, the FA May repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 million on persons who do not comply with their non-monetary obligations under this or a special Tax Act or a decision under this act.
Automated tax information system – automated tax information system used by Czech tax authorities to provide technical support for tax collection.
The NKÚ found during its examination that the FA rarely made use of the possibility of imposing a fine on the taxpayer concerned if the VAT return was not submitted.
Filing and processing of VAT returns in Germany
In Germany, a distinction is made between monthly or quarterly VAT returns and annual VAT returns.
Those taxpayers who are obliged to submit advance VAT returns must nevertheless submit an annual VAT return.
Even small business owners who are not obliged to pay VAT must submit an annual VAT return.
The taxable persons are generally obliged to submit a VAT registration before the 10th day after the end of the calendar quarter in which the value added tax arises (§ 18 (2) UStG).
However, if the VAT liability in the previous year amounted to more than € 6,136 or if it is a newly founded company, the entrepreneur is obliged to submit monthly VAT registrations no later than the 10th day after the end of the respective month. 
The taxable person can also opt for the submission of prior monthly VAT registrations if he has received a refund of € 6,136 in the previous year (§ 18 (2a) UStG).
If the annual value added tax has not been more than € 512, neither VAT registrations nor VAT returns are to be submitted.
A resulting VAT liability must be paid 10 days after the end of the tax period.
A refund can lead to a more thorough audit by the financial administration.
There are no (legal) deadlines for processing VAT returns and for refunding VAT overpayments.
In order to receive a timely refund, a security for the refund amount may be offered.
In principle, VAT returns, including refund cases, must be processed quickly.
The German Value Added Tax Act allows an extension of these (tax or payment)periods (§ 18 (6) UStG).
The extension of the deadline must be requested separately.
If it is granted, the submission of sales tax pre-registrations and the corresponding payments may take place one month later. In the case of monthly notifications, however, a special advance payment is to be made.
This payment will be offset against the VAT liability determined for the December pre-registration period.
If an error is discovered, the entrepreneur must submit a corrected VAT registration.
There is no" supplementary " VAT return.
If the VAT return to be submitted by 31 May of the following year has once been submitted to the tax office, the entrepreneur can no longer correct an incorrect VAT registration, but only the incorrect annual VAT return. 
Corrections of this VAT return to the advantage or disadvantage of the taxpayer are possible within four years after the end of the year in which the first VAT return was submitted.
After the expiry of this four-year period, a VAT return can usually only be corrected in cases of reckless tax reduction or tax evasion.
The taxable persons must submit the VAT pre-registration by electronic means.
The FA may grant exceptions to this rule in order to avoid unfair hardships.
The annual VAT return can be submitted in paper form or via the internet with or without certification.
If the tax is paid without certification, the taxpayer must also submit the declaration on paper and with his personal signature.
If no advance VAT declarations or declarations are made, the tax administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the turnover achieved by the taxable person6.
In the event of late submission, the taxpayer may be subject to a late surcharge (up to 10% of the tax liability or up to an amount of €25,000).
In an earlier examination, the BRH found that Faes often do not charge this delay surcharge.
In the cases where the FA collected the late surcharges, the determination of the amount was inconsistent and arbitrary.
The delay surcharge therefore misses its purpose of reducing the average delay, especially when submitting the annual VAT return.
The form of the VAT return contains separate lines for value information on intra-community deliveries or purchases.
There are also separate lines for the purchase of services.
Non-taxable sales must be indicated in a separate line of the VAT return.
The VAT returns submitted on paper must either be scanned or electronically recorded by specially designated personnel.
The data of electronically filed tax returns are immediately available to the tax administration.
This segment ISIN tention ally left blank
After all data is collected electronically, they are subjected to a risk management procedure and a case selection is made on the basis of certain standards.
The sales tax returns selected in this way must be checked by the responsible officer on the basis of the automatically generated audit notes (see 5.2).
Although the tax administration only has to make a rough estimate of the VAT liability, it still has to be as accurate as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, taxpayers must submit their VAT returns no later than 25 days after the end of the tax period.
Depending on the Taxable Person's turnover, the tax period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
In Germany, depending on the amount of their tax liability in the previous year, taxpayers must file their pre-registration at the latest 10 days after either the end of the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
The annual VAT return must be submitted by 31 May of the following year at the latest. 
The obligation to submit an annual VAT return has some advantages and disadvantages:
+ After the end of the calendar year, the taxpayer can correct the errors in the monthly pre-registrations by submitting a single VAT return;
- If the Taxable Person corrects his information on intra-community transactions, the correction cannot be assigned to a specific reporting period of the ZM;
- The federal states do not equalize MIAS data on intra-community acquisitions of German taxpayers until the annual VAT returns have usually been processed.
According to the registration (see 4.1.3), German entrepreneurs must submit a VAT return regardless of the amount of their turnover.
This tax obligation enables the German tax administration to verify compliance with the sales ceiling for small businesses.
In addition, the competent FA may reconcile the annual sales tax declaration with the corresponding declarations for direct taxes and with the annual financial statements of the company concerned.
In the Czech Republic, the tax administration can only check the amount of turnover on the basis of the Income Tax Return issued.
In contrast to the regulations in force in the Czech Republic, German taxpayers are obliged to submit VAT registration electronically.
The introduction of the obligation to file tax returns electronically in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech financial administration.
Summary Messages
Submission and processing of summary declarations in the Czech Republic
In accordance with the provisions of Section 102 of Law No. 235/2004, an entrepreneur who delivers goods to a person registered for tax purposes in another member state is required to submit corresponding summary declarations (hereinafter referred to as “CM”).
The value of the delivered goods is always stated in the CMM in Czech currency, broken down by VAT IdNr7, the individual taxable persons under whom they are registered in the other member state.
Information on services is not provided in the ZM.
Taxpayers with a calendar month or quarterly tax period must submit the tax return to the local competent FA no later than the 25th day after the end of each quarter. 
Incorrect data must be corrected in a correction ZM within 15 days of the finding of the error.
Incorrect data in the ZM will always be replaced by the data from the correction ZM.
Similar to tax returns, taxpayers can also submit the tax return electronically.
If a taxpayer does not submit a tax return or correction tax return, even though he is obliged to do so under Law No. 235/2004, the tax officer must ask him to submit the relevant tax return, referring to the consequences of the non-tax return. In the event of non-compliance with non-monetary obligations, the tax officer is entitled to impose repeated fines of up to CZK 2 million in accordance with Section 37 of Act No. 337/1992.
The Nkú found in its audit that the FA did not usually use their power to impose fines on their defaulting taxpayers.
In particular, taxpayers are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their obligations when submitting a tax return, as the failure to submit a tax return does not affect the amount of their VAT liability.
According to § 102 (5) of Law No. 235/2004, the tax officer is obliged to check the information in the CMM or corrective CMM, to remove any ambiguities and to use the information to determine the tax liability.
In Case Of Non-Conformity
8 of the information in the financial statements with which the taxpayer corrects incorrect information in the financial statements by submitting a corrective financial statement either on his own Initiative or upon request.
The Financial Officer shall correct the data on deliveries of goods to other member states in the ATIS system if::
- the taxpayer does not prove the accuracy of the information reported in the CMM (or correction CMM) and therefore corrects it by submitting a correction CMM,
-the tax officer has proved the inaccuracy of the information reported by the taxable person in the CTM or correction CTM.
Corrections entered by the tax officer, without a correction ZM from the taxpayer, do not replace the duty of the taxpayer to submit a correction zm, but only lead to the correction of the data in the MIAS, so that they are up-to-date, complete and accurate.
The data from the CM will be forwarded to the member states concerned.
Only the National Tax Authority designated for cooperation with the other member states in the field of Value Added Tax may transmit and receive this data.
This is the CLO (in the Czech Republic this function is performed by the Department of international administrative assistance in the field of VAT in the Ministry of Finance). The message "O_MCTL" automatically receives the CLO from the other member states.
It contains all incorrect USt-IdNr. which were specified in the transmitted ZM lines.
If the incorrect VAT-IdNr. used in some of the transmitted lines of the ZM or the corrected ZM, an entry in the list of the wrong VAT ID number takes place.
The list contains a " notification of doubts concerning USt-IdNr.“.
The financial officer checks the data and enters the result of the check into the System.
When purchasing goods from another member state, the Taxable Person must state this in his VAT return and enter the value of the acquisition in the designated lines of the VAT return.
Selected cases of differences between the values of the purchases made by the Czech taxpayer in its VAT return and the values of the goods delivered by the supplier from the other member state in its VAT return shall be forwarded by the CLO to the competent FA for examination.
The clerks there must examine the deviations.
Three different situations can then occur:
a) the value indicated by the Czech purchaser in the relevant headings of his VAT return is lower than the value of the supplies indicated by suppliers from other EC member states.
In this case, the financial officer checks the accuracy of the information.
b) the difference is zero.
This Situation can result either from a change in the information within the EC (the foreign supplier corrects its ZM) or from a change in the information in the VAT return (the Czech taxpayer in the meantime submits a supplementary VAT return on his own Initiative).
In this case, it is at the discretion of the tax officer to verify the accuracy of the information in the VAT return anyway.
( C) the value of goods acquired from other member states which the Czech taxpayer has declared in his VAT return is higher than the value of the goods delivered by the suppliers of the other EC member states.
Here again, it is at the discretion of the tax officer to check the accuracy of the information.
After reviewing the differences and clarifying the reasons for their occurrence, the financial officer enters the results of his review into ATIS.
These results are forwarded to the CLO.
The number of transactions sent by the CLO for audit is shown for the individual quarters of 2005 in Graph 1 (source: Czech Ministry of Finance).
Graph 1 above shows that the number of cases reported by the CLO to the FA for the individual quarters of 2005 has decreased.
The significant reduction in the number in the fourth quarter of 2005 is due, among other things, to the fact that the Czech CLO has raised the threshold for Case Selection, taking into account the minimum amount limit for a request for information to the other EC member states.
Deviations between the information in the VAT returns and the data from the EC do not always have to be based on an error of the domestic acquirer.
There may also be an error by the taxable person in another member state or an error caused by the fact that certain types of deliveries are indicated differently in the CM in the individual EC member states.
The most common reasons for deviations in the value of reported business transactions found in the FA audited are shown in Table 1.
Submission and processing of summary reports in Germany
Entrepreneurs who make intra-community deliveries from Germany to other EC member states or participate in triangular transactions must submit quarterly ZM, in which the intra-community deliveries are listed by purchaser (§ 18a (1) UStG).
The ZM must be submitted no later than the 10th day of the month following the calendar quarter in question. 
If a long-term extension is granted for the submission of sales tax pre-registrations, this also applies to the ZM.
The ZM must be handed over to the CLO.
The electronic tax has been mandatory since 1 January 2007. 
The FA may allow exemptions for individual taxpayers to avoid unfair hardship.
If the taxpayer finds that the ZM was faulty, he is obliged to submit a corrective ZM within one month.
In case of non-submission of the ZM, the CLO initiates a coercive procedure.
This includes the following steps: - first reminder-second reminder, connected with the threat that a penalty payment will be fixed and – fixing the penalty payment.
Although the German tax code allows a penalty payment of up to € 25,000 (§ 329 AO), the CLO sets penalty payments of € 125, € 250 and € 500 in three stages.
In addition, § 26a (1) No. 5 UStG stipulates that the taxpayer acts in an irregular manner if he intentionally or recklessly fails to deliver a ZM correctly, not completely or not in time, or if he fails to correct a ZM or not in time.
This violation can be punished with a fine of up to € 5,000.
Data on intra-community deliveries cannot be entered by the FA into the MIAS, because the CLO is exclusively responsible for the processing of the ZM.
The data of the ZM is only stored at the CLO.
The information from the summary messages is only available to FÄ after their processing by the CLO.
The deadlines for processing ZM are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003.
The data of the ZM must be stored within three months after the relevant calendar quarter (in MIAS).
In case of incorrect VAT-IdNr. in the ZM German Taxpayer, the German CLO receives a message "O_MCTL" of the other member state.
The CLO then turns to the entrepreneur and requests the right data.
If the CLO fails to obtain the correct information, the case will be submitted to the relevant FA.
It is then his task to request the correct information.
In the course of its audit, the BRH found that most entrepreneurs have the VAT ID number. at the Request of the CLO, corrected.
However, reminding and threatening and imposing up to three consecutive fines takes too much time if a taxpayer may be involved in a cross-border merry-go-round scam.
The cases that were ultimately reported to the relevant FA were usually concluded within one to two months.
The relevant FA refused the tax exemption for the reported intra-community deliveries in 73% of these Cases9.
The taxpayer submitted the correct VAT ID number. before, the FA asked him to submit a corrected ZM to the CLO, because the FA cannot correct the MIAS data themselves.
The BRH found that neither the FA nor the CLO controlled the delivery of the corrected ZM.
Therefore, taxpayers often did not comply with the request. Since the CLO does not have access to the data of the VAT returns, no comparison of the information on goods deliveries made in the VAT pre-declarations or the VAT return with the corresponding information in the CTM takes place before these data are forwarded to the CLO of the other member states.
This comparison can only be made by the FA. This usually happens when preparing a VAT special audit.
Data received from other member states will be processed by the CLO.
Incorrect VAT-IdNr. are recognised and reported to the member states concerned.
The data are used for the control of acquisition taxation in the FÄ.
As soon as they are available in the system, the CLO compares them with the data of previous calendar quarters.
If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control messages are created and transmitted to the competent FA.
This happens continuously, whereas a list of the acquisition data of all VAT-liable persons is compiled later and forwarded to the FA.
The risk management system (RMS) for the assessment procedure then compares these data with those for intra-community acquisitions.
The System completely checks (only) those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct input tax.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, taxable persons who have made intra-community deliveries to a person registered for VAT in another member state must, within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter, submit a tax return to the local competent FA.
The FÄ process the ZM and forward the data to the CLO.
The values of intra-community deliveries declared by the taxable persons in the CECs are compared with the values of intra-community deliveries declared by the same taxable persons in their VAT returns.
The results of the reconciliation are taken into account in the context of the tax assessment.
In Germany, taxable persons who have made intra-community deliveries are obliged to submit quarterly tax returns within the first 10 days of the following calendar Quarter10.
Since 1 January 2007, taxpayers have had to submit the ZM electronically to the CLO.
The data from the ZM are only available to FÄ after their processing by the CLO.
In the Czech Republic as well as in Germany, the tax payers only state the deliveries of goods in the ZM.
The provision of services is not specified in the ZM. Unlike the Czech FÄ, the German Fä cannot correct incorrect information in individual lines of the submitted ZM itself.
Due to this limited access to the German MIAS data, incorrect USt-IdNr. even if the taxpayer does not correct the correct VAT ID number. to the FA.
The German tax administration does not equalize the information on intra-community deliveries that German taxpayers provide in their VAT pre-registrations with the information provided by the corresponding ZM.
Differences between the data of the pre-registration and the ZM are regularly not revealed before the German CLO forwards the MIAS data to other member states.
Based on these findings of the BRH, it is obvious that a comparison would improve the reliability of the transmitted MIAS data.
The data transmitted by other member states on the supply of goods to Czech taxpayers will be compared in the Czech Republic with the data on the purchase of goods which Czech taxpayers have indicated in their VAT returns.
The Czech CLO carries out the comparison for each calendar quarter separately.
The most serious cases of deviations are forwarded to the FA for examination.
Unlike the Czech tax administration, the German tax administration does not generally examine the taxation of intra-community acquisitions.
Such general control is only carried out for taxpayers who are not fully entitled to deduct input tax.
In addition, the German tax administration controls the taxation of intra-community acquisitions of other taxpayers only if the RMS has created an audit notice or the taxpayer has been selected for an audit anyway.
This procedure relieves FA from clarifying the reasons for differences.
On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
To combat carousel fraud, updated information on intra-community acquisitions must be available as early as possible.
The current system of the ZM, in particular MIAS, provides financial authorities with information that may well be half a year old.
This delay could be reduced to up to four months if the taxpayers had to submit monthly tax returns.
The monthly tax would only increase the bureaucratic burden immeasurably, since most taxpayers in the Czech Republic and Germany are obliged to submit monthly VAT returns or pre – registrations anyway and no more information is required for the ZM than for the VAT returns or pre –registrations.
In order to avoid bureaucracy, the submission of the ZM could be combined with the submission of VAT returns or pre –registrations.
However, a duty to provide ZM on a monthly basis would create more periodic discrepancies between the data on intra-community deliveries and those on intra-community purchases and would increase the data flows between the CLO.
In 2006, the Federal government considered the General introduction of monthly ZM.
The implementation failed due to the concerns of the federal states.
They feared that monthly transmission of MIAS data to the CLO of other member states could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In order for the obligation to pay monthly fees to be effective, it is necessary to agree on a uniform monthly fee at European level, so that a monthly update of the MIAS data is possible.
Statistical information on goods deliveries and acquisitions between the Czech Republic and Germany
In foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the Czech Republic.
The total turnover of intra-community trade between the Czech Republic and Germany is shown in Table No. 2.
Both courts requested data on the number of incorrect tax numbers or VAT ID number. in the O_MCTL messages exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany for the individual quarters audited.
These data can be found in the following tables.
They have significant differences.
The reason for the differences can be a different calculation basis for the number of O_mctl messages.
While the Czech CLO refers the figures to the calendar quarter for which the ZM was submitted, the German CLO refers its figures to the calendar quarter in which the O_mctl message was received.
International exchange of information at Level 3
International exchange of information in the Czech Republic
The international exchange of information enables tax officials to obtain information from other member states on intra-community transactions and on the taxpayers who have carried them out.
Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003 on mutual assistance in the field of Value Added Tax, which repealed directive (EEC) no 218/92 (hereinafter referred to as “Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003”), distinguishes between two basic types of exchange of information: the exchange of information on request and the spontaneous exchange of information (without prior request).
The international exchange of information on request takes place through a request for information (engl.: request for information RFI) using the standardized SCAC form.
Tax officials in the Czech Republic send their RFI or their answers to a received RFI through the financial Directorate to the CLO. This ensures that the information provided in the standardised SCAC form is translated into the foreign language and forwarded to the other member states.
In addition, the CLO receives requests for information (RFI) from other member states and answers to requests sent. It arranges their translation into Czech and their distribution to the competent FA for processing.
Article 8 of Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003 sets a maximum period of three months from receipt of the request for its processing.
All RFIs exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany in the period under review were audited by NKÚ.
Out of the total number of 94 RFI received from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were processed within the three-month period; in a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) this processing period was exceeded.
In the remaining one case, no answer had been sent to Germany until the Nkú had examined it. More detailed information on the time limits within which requests made by Germany were answered by the Czech Republic can be found in Figure 2.
Out of the total number of 335 requests for information (RFI) sent to Germany from the Czech Republic, 136 (i.e. 40.6%) received a reply within the three-month period; a further 179 (i.e. 53.4%) were processed after this period and in 19 cases no reply had been received from Germany at the time of the Nkú's examination (in the remaining one case, it was not possible to determine when Germany answered the request for information on the basis of the information provided).
More detailed information on the deadlines within which requests for information from the Czech Republic were answered from Germany can be found in graph No. 3.
The percentages of intra-community sales reported in the requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in Figure 4.
The graph above shows that the sales audited in connection with requests for information usually had values of more than € 60,000.
The international exchange of information without prior request is either automatic, structured automatically or in the form of spontaneous information.
The tax officials of other member states are often provided with information without prior request that is important for determining the VAT liability.
In the Czech Republic, All information is collected at the CLO.
The exchange of information between the individual member states takes place electronically.
"Automatic exchange" in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003 means the systematic transmission of pre-determined information to other member states at regular, pre-determined intervals without prior request.
"Structured automatic exchange" means the systematic transmission of previously defined information to another member state without its prior request as soon as the relevant information becomes available.
The Czech Republic shall inform the other member states in an automatic exchange of information about deliveries of new vehicles.
The tax officer receives this information from the form notification of the delivery of a new vehicle pursuant to Section 19 of Law No. 235/2004 and from the copy of the invoice issued.
When processing this form, the financial officer enters the required data into the corresponding document template and forwards it directly to the responsible employee of the financial Directorate, where this data is collected and sent to the CLO for further processing. Thereafter, these data will be transmitted to the other member states within the specified period, namely no later than two months after the end of the quarter in which they were obtained.
The Czech Republic also provides other member states with information on mail order transactions that are tax - free in the country of origin, on intra-community transactions that appear to be illegal and on potential "Missing Traders".
This information is transmitted to the other member states by means of a SCAC form in a spontaneous exchange of information.
Implementation of the international exchange of information in Germany
In Germany, the initiative for information requests and spontaneous exchange of information originates from the locally responsible FA.
The FA send the completed form SCAC 2004 by e-mail directly to the German CLO, which forwards the SCACVordrucke to the foreign CLO.
FÄ are instructed to write their requests for information or spontaneous information only in German, even the used SCACVordruck is one-way.
Half of the German requests for information examined by the BRH were submitted in order to ensure the taxation of acquisitions in the other member state or to demonstrate the tax exemption of intra-community deliveries from Germany to the other member state.
If the German CLO receives a request for information from another member state, it checks whether the value of the deliveries mentioned in the request exceeds the minimum amount limit of € 15,000.
If there is no adequate justification for the request, the German CLO refuses to provide information regarding a turnover that is below the minimum amount limit.
In addition, the German CLO provides the translation of the freely formulated texts in the SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)], if they are neither written in German nor in English.
To answer the request for information, the CLO forwards it to the FA responsible and refers to the three-month period.
No further deadlines are set at the various levels of the German financial administration.
Although the German CLO has the technical means to monitor compliance with the deadline, it does not have the necessary personnel capacities to remind FÄ to respond to the unfinished requests for information.
Faes receive the required information by letter from the taxpayer or by carrying out an external audit.
The external auditors usually choose between two types of audit: the VAT special audit, which covers all taxable transactions within a period of several months, or the so-called VAT review, which may only relate to a recent transaction.
With this short and flexible form of audit, an announcement to the taxpayer is not required and it has proven itself in the investigation of a single turnover.
In the case of automatic exchange of Information, Germany shall transmit the following information to the other member state: – via VAT-IdNr., which have been allocated to undertakings established in other EC member states,-on the refund of input tax to entrepreneurs established in other EC member states.
In addition, Germany has undertaken to provide the following information to the other EC member states within the framework of the structured automatic exchange of information::
a. The delivery of new vehicles to the entrepreneurs without VAT no., B. distance sales (mail order) to other EC member states which are not subject to VAT in Germany, c.significant differences between the purchases reported by a taxable person and the MIAS data transmitted by other member states, d. intra-community deliveries of goods which have been subject to taxation in Germany by the taxable person incorrectly, e. potential "Missing Traders" who have made intra-community transactions, regardless of whether their UStIdNr. is still valid or has already been deleted and F. taxable persons who have made intra-community deliveries to potential "Missing traders" or to customers who have a VAT ID number. used abusively.
Comparison and evaluation
Requests for information or spontaneous information are sent both in the Czech Republic and in Germany on the Initiative of the local FA, who transmit the corresponding SCACVordrucke to the CLO.
While the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCACVordrucke (Czech-English) and translates information given into English or German, the German FA follows the instruction to write requests for information or spontaneous information on a monolingual form only in German.
The German CLO does not produce translations of German texts.
When examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany in the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005, the NKÚ found that the Czech financial administration completed 74.5% of the requests for information received within the three-month period, while the German financial administration only completed the requests for information addressed to Germany in 40.6% of the cases within that period. 
Although the German CLO refers the FA to the three-month period, it does not monitor its compliance.
Due to the lack of reminders, there is a high proportion of requests for information that are answered within a time limit.
Therefore, the BRH has recommended a continuous reminder procedure to the German CLO.
The Situation has now changed.
According to the information available to us, the German CLO is now reminding the tax authorities to respond to the outstanding requests for information.
VAT Risk Management
Risk management in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, several organisational units at different levels of financial management are involved in risk management in the field of VAT.
Within the Czech Ministry of finance, the following organisational units are responsible for risk management and combating VAT fraud:
The Department for methodology and economic management of Value Added Tax and its risk management unit deals with the identification of potential risk areas for tax revenues and evaluates the Trends in these risks in domestic and intra-community trade.
At the national level, this body coordinates the requirements for the "credibility of sales tax returns" criterion and uses the MIAS data to detect possible tax evasion in the context of intra-community deliveries and acquisitions.
Based on data on the Czech Republic's trade balance, it evaluates high-risk goods, prepares the concept of risk management in the field of Value Added Tax and cooperates in this area with the relevant EC institutions and other member states.
The Department for International administrative assistance in the field of Value Added Tax provides inter alia for the exchange of information, contributes to the creation and maintenance of a relevant information database, evaluates the data available in the system MIAS of other member states, carries out public relations work and is responsible for other forms of intergovernmental administrative assistance within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003.

The tax audit and tax enforcement methodology department carries out risk analyses within the framework of the methodological management of tax audits, sets priorities for the work planning of the financial directorates with regard to the selection of cases to be audited, creates risk analyses to combat tax evasion and, in this context, collects information from the financial administration and other sources and makes proposals for measures to combat tax evasion.
Tax investigation agencies exist at the finance directorates. Its tasks include the search for taxpayers and industries that are at risk with regard to the frequency of tax evasion (e.g. Internet business, Gold, pharmaceutical industry), the search for unregistered taxpayers (e.g. in the sectors of internet services, employment services, electronic and print media, etc.), the investigation of linkages in chain fraud cases and informing local tax authorities.
Special examination units were set up in 12 selected FA.
These have a regional competence and carry out tax audits also outside the local area of competence of the FA on the basis of appropriate authorisation.
The need to set up the special audit units resulted from the increase in identified new and "improved" forms of tax evasion, particularly in connection with chain transactions.
These special units examine according to the needs of the tax investigation agencies or focus on taxpayers with certain activities, multinational companies and taxpayers with particularly high turnover.
The following mechanisms for reducing VAT risks have been integrated into the ATIS system: – the task of "credibility of VAT returns" to assess the risk – bearing nature of tax returns submitted; – the task of "selecting the taxable persons to be audited", selecting the taxable persons to be audited on the basis of certain criteria;-the task of "MIAS", which gives tax officials access to the data provided by the other EC member states.
The task "MIAS" allows among other things the following: - verification of the validity of the VAT-IdNr. of Taxable persons from other member States, – confirmation of the value of the to a Czech Taxpayer supplied Goods, as specified in the ZM of all of the supplier of the Taxable person from other member States, – preparation of a list of Taxpayers that have not delivered the ZM, – formal control of the information, the Taxable person in the Czech Republic in your ZM have made before this information is transmitted to other member States, – preparation of a list of the Taxable person, in their VAT returns the data on deliveries of goods to other member States, not with the data in the ZM match, – creation of a list of Taxpayers in their VAT returns the data to the value of the other member States Goods purchased does not match the information in the ZM of all of your suppliers from other member States übereinstimmen13.
As part of their duties to combat tax evasion, tax officials have access to data from state authorities such as Commercial Registers, Land Registry, motor vehicle registers, trade register, etc.
More detailed information can be found in Section 4.4.1 submission and processing of summary declarations in the Czech Republic.
Risk management in Germany
Due to their federal structure, both the federal financial authorities (in particular the CLO) and the financial administrations of the 16 federal states are involved in the development and implementation of an RMS in the Federal Republic of Germany.
Although there are joint working groups for development, neither the CLO nor the financial administrations of the federal states have a complete uniform database.
At the level of the CLO, unit ST I 2 (hereinafter referred to as "Kiss" – Coordination Office for VAT special audits and tax investigation measures) collects the audit findings on fraud cases in the Opus database.
In cooperation with the countries, another database called ZAUBER was set up during the kiss. There, the tax offices can enter and query the names of discovered missing Traders or VAT fraudsters.
The KUSS coordinates both related cases of VAT fraud at the national level and cases of cross-border VAT fraud.
The experiences of KUSS are brought into the development of the RMS through their participation in the working groups.
In addition, experts from several other organisational units of the CLO and the BMF are also involved.
The formal Review of the composition of signed for and on behalf. other member states that appear in the ZM German tax payers are carried out at the CLO.
This formal review takes place before the CM is transmitted to other member states in order to improve the reliability of the MIAS data and thus its benefits (see 4.4.2).
Checking the validity in the ZM mentioned VAT-IdNr. done on the basis of the o_mctl identifiers transmitted by the other member states (for the procedure of correcting invalid VAT ID no. see also 4.4.2).
In addition, CLO RMS relies on MIAS data provided by other member states and generates various types of notifications to detect suspected missing Traders. As a guide, certain features are used, which usually occur in Carousel shops.
The FA of the federal states are instructed to process these communications and have to forward the result of their investigations to the CLO in certain cases.
The BRH audit has confirmed that all available features must be taken into account in order to conclude with sufficient probability on a case of tax fraud (rather than focusing mainly on the turnover of a company).
Accordingly, the BRH has recommended to the BMF to work with combinations of different indications when preparing the notifications.
The risk management system should also take into account other indications, such as the payment behaviour of the taxpayer, the economic sector or the company's shareholding relationships.
A second level of risk management exists in the federal states ' financial administrations and focuses on the processing of sales tax pre-registrations and annual declarations.
For example, the System creates a list of those taxpayers who have indicated intra-community deliveries in their VAT registration or annual declaration.
This list is sent to the CLO to monitor the complete submission of the ZM.
Furthermore, in this type of risk management, the acquisitions specified by the taxpayer in its annual VAT return are compared with the data in the MIAS.
The tax administrations of the federal states avoid a comparison of the quarterly data, as these would result in too many discrepancies, which are due to factors other than tax evasion or tax fraud; e.g.:
- Supplier and Purchaser assume different times for the execution of intra-community turnover;
– different accounting and tax Declaration of discounts and discounts.
In addition to comparing the information from the sales tax returns with the MIAS data, many federal states have certain risk management mechanisms that are based on information in the sales tax returns and certain other indications (e.g. company wording, age of the owner/partner, number of employees and method of payment of the taxpayer).
Bavaria has introduced a risk management system based on fixed rules, which enables a team of specialists in the fight against tax fraud (hereinafter referred to as "risk managers") to program their own rules in such a way that suspected tax fraudsters are filtered out.
This System is used in the processing of VAT registrations by FÄ.
This gives the competent FA the advice of the RMS before the value added tax is fixed.
Since this System is not capable of learning, the risk managers have to adapt the rules according to the feedback from the FA.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has developed an adaptive neural network based on the data of discovered evasion cases.
Based on this data, the RMS is able to learn the features for tax evasion.
The system creates a monthly list of tax cases where there is evidence of tax evasion.
On the basis of this list, the competent FA decides on the examination of the taxable persons concerned.
After the audit, the tax auditors must report their results so that the RMS can learn from the results of the audits it proposes.
In North Rhine-Westphalia, an adaptive neural network is used in combination with a rule-based Fuzzy System.
Based on a lot of data from processed sales tax returns and some other clues, this Neuro-Fuzzy system (also called Datamining System) calculates how likely it is that a taxpayer is involved in tax fraud.
It then creates a monthly list of suspected tax fraudsters.
On the basis of this list, the FA selects the relevant taxpayers for the examination and reports the examination results to the relevant data centre.
The introduction of these three RMS is underway in the federal states.
Since each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three systems for the fight against fraud seems to be effective.
It remains to be seen whether the hoped-for effects will materialize during actual use.
Comparison and evaluation
Although it is not possible in this report to address the specific criteria of the RMS in the Czech Republic and Germany, the NKÚ and BRH have noted that each member state has developed its own RMS.
Like the different approaches in the three German federal states mentioned above, the RMS of each European state has its particular strengths and weaknesses.
An exchange of experience is currently taking place between the tax authorities of the European member states on new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.
VAT fraud – especially carousel fraud-has proven to be not a national but a European Problem.
The persons involved in fraud coordinate their actions not only in one but in several member states.
A member state alone cannot develop an effective RMS.
Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each EC member state. If this does not happen, fraudsters choose the member state with the weakest RMS for their crimes.
The tax losses caused by Europe-wide VAT fraud do not necessarily affect the member state in which the Initiator is based.
Any other member state involved in the fraud may be affected.
Therefore, there should be a European exchange of experience about the RMS.
Selected results from the examination of individual sales the nkú and the BRH examined the quality and usability of information on selected deliveries and sales in parallel tests.
International exchange of information between the tax administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.
In addition, the two courts jointly examined the processing of several deliveries, about the execution of which there were doubts, or which the taxpayers of both states explained differently in the tax returns or ZM.
At the request of the BRH, NKÚ examined a total of eight transactions between eight Czech and eight German taxpayers.
In addition, on the basis of information from the BRH, the NKÚ examined in 43 cases the values of intra-community transactions with Germany, which Czech taxpayers had stated in their tax returns and ZM.
At the request of the NKÚ, the BRH checked a total of 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech taxpayers.
The relevant information was exchanged exclusively on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 on the CLO.
The examination of the selected cases showed, inter alia, that the different registration procedures in the EC member states lead to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:
1.
According to MIAS data, a Czech taxpayer purchased goods worth € 60,500 from a German taxpayer in the third quarter of 2004.
When the Czech taxpayer declared an acquisition of only € 29,869, the Czech Tax Administration sent a request for information to Germany to check the value of the goods delivered.
In its reply to the Czech request for information, the German side stated that the German taxpayer in question had delivered goods to its Czech business partner in the second quarter of 2004 to the value of € 27,381, in the third quarter to the value of € 31,997 and in the fourth quarter to the value of € 10,276. 
Furthermore, it emerged from the answer that the VAT-IdNr. of the German taxpayer was only valid from 28 September 2004. However, the German CLO had granted a further application by the German taxpayer and the validity of the VAT ID no. retroactively to 1 May 2004.
The German Taxpayer corrected the ZM.
On the basis of this Information, it was a (intra-community) acquisition of goods by the Czech taxpayer.
In a request to the competent tax office in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that in 2004, the Czech taxpayer had submitted supplementary VAT returns for the individual (annual) tax periods in which he declared a higher value of purchases from other member states and at the same time sought the deduction of input tax from purchases from other member states.
On the basis of these additional VAT returns, the competent clerk of the Czech tax office could not clearly determine whether the declared purchases also included the value of the deliveries of the above-mentioned German supplier.
In response to a request for information from the NKÚ, the BRH found that the German supplier had been registered as liable for VAT in September 2003.
However, he did not have the allocation of a VAT ID number when registering., but only applied for a tax number that is exclusively valid for Germany.
Although it is usually not possible in Germany to provide a taxpayer with a VAT ID number retroactively. this was done in 2006 by the Responsible Officer of the German financial administration retroactively as of 1 May 2004.
The German CLO shares a USt-IdNr. retroactively, if the German entrepreneur did not cause the delayed allocation; for example, if the CLO caused the delay after the taxpayer's request for a VAT ID number. manmade.
In this case, the CLO issues the USt-IdNr. retroactive, because the entrepreneur according to § 6 UStG for an intra-community delivery no valid VAT-IdNr. requires.
Conversely, a German acquirer does not need the (valid) VAT ID number. of its supplier to declare the intra-community acquisition.
Because of these procedural differences between the member states, the German CLO granted the USt-IdNr. in this particular case retroactive.
2.
As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech tax official requested a review of the VAT registration of the German entrepreneur.
From the MIAS data, the date of registration is 5 March 2005, while a registration certificate issued by the locally competent German FA indicates 1 October 2004. 
The German authorities stated in their reply that the German taxpayer had been registered on 1 October 2004, but for organisational reasons did not have a VAT ID number in Germany until 16 February 2005.  get assigned.
The NKÚ learned from a request made to the local Czech tax official that the tax official had carried out a VAT audit on the Czech taxpayer for the tax periods from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.
During this audit, the Tax Office found that the Czech taxpayer had declared in his VAT return services worth CZK 9,897 that he had provided to the German taxpayer before its VAT registration (i.e. before 1 October 2004).
The (Czech) tax office established a tax liability of CZK 1,880 against the Czech taxpayer for the third quarter of 2004.
On the basis of the Nkú's request, the BRH found that the German taxpayer had the VAT ID no. he was only assigned when he registered his company founded in 2004 with the FA on February 16, 2005. 
In addition, the FA registered him retroactively from October 1, 200415 for VAT purposes in order to be able to monitor the filing of the VAT return for 2004.
In this VAT return, the taxable person stated intra-community acquisitions from the Czech Republic in the value of € 160 (approx.CZK 5,000).
3.in his VAT return for September 2004 as well as in his tax return for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech taxpayer stated deliveries of goods worth CZK 114,615 to a German taxpayer.
When checking the registration of the German taxpayer in the MIAS System, the Czech tax official stated that this registration was only valid from November 11, 2004, and thus after the delivery of goods to Germany. 
The Czech taxpayer submitted a supplementary VAT return in which he declared sales from domestic deliveries to the value of CZK 114,615 and VAT of CZK 21,777, which he paid.
Through a request to the local competent FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer subsequently filed an application for resumption of the tax procedure in respect of the supplementary VAT return. As evidence, he submitted a confirmation from the German tax administration that the German taxpayer had been registered since 1 January 2000. 
Accordingly, the Czech tax official checked the validity of the registration of the German taxpayer in the context of the international exchange of information.
From the German information it emerged that the German taxpayer only on 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods a VAT ID no. had been assigned.
As a result, the Czech tax official rejected the request for resumption of tax proceedings.
The BRH found that in this case no intra-community acquisition of goods had taken place, because the German taxpayer had not received a VAT ID number until 11 November 2004.  had received.
However, the German recipient declared both the acquisition as an intra-community acquisition as well as the VAT on this and also demanded the refund of input taxes in the same amount.
Because this did not lead to a change in the amount of the German taxpayer's tax liability, the German tax official did not correct the information in the VAT return.
Furthermore, the BRH found that the German taxpayer's company mentioned in the request for information was changed in Germany during the processing of the reply, which led to confusion between two German taxpayers.
This change in the name of the German taxpayer also confused the Czech tax official.
4.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax official reviewed the acquisition of goods by a Czech taxpayer from a German taxpayer in the first quarter of 2005, worth €22,686.
Through a request to the local tax official in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech tax official had examined the Czech taxpayer during an external audit whether the intra-EU delivery had actually taken place and whether the Czech taxpayer had booked and paid the invoice for the delivery of the goods.
The Czech taxpayer did not declare the intra-EU acquisition in his VAT return because the German supplier did not provide his VAT ID number in the invoice. but only gave his tax number, which is intended for business within Germany.
According to MIAS data, the German taxpayer is registered for VAT in connection with intra-community transactions only as of 21 April 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech taxpayer. 
The Czech tax official also requested that the German tax administration send a copy of the registration certificate of the German taxpayer so that he could initiate the appropriate tax procedure.
The Czech FA considered this business as the acquisition of goods from a non-entrepreneurial (private)person in Germany and therefore did not set a Value Added Tax for the acquisition of goods from Germany.
The BRH found that under German law a taxpayer who delivers goods to other member states does not have a VAT ID number. for intra-community deliveries, in order to be able to claim the VAT exemption for such a delivery.
The supplier must only signed for and on behalf. of the purchaser in the other member state and can prove the Transport of the goods in question to the other member state.
In this case, according to German tax law, turnover is a (tax-exempt) intra-community delivery that should be subject to tax on acquisition in the Czech Republic.
In any case, it is important that the Czech tax official took note of this transaction because the delivery of a machine of this value was not part of the core business of the German supplier.
As described in Section 4.6.2, the German CLO rejects requests for information on intra-community transactions if these are below the minimum amount limit of € 15,000: 5.
According to MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004, a Czech taxpayer acquired goods worth € 12,561 from a German taxpayer.
The Czech tax official carried out an audit for this tax period.
As part of the Intergovernmental assistance, the Czech financial administration requested the examination of this delivery of goods by means of an SCAC form.
The Czech taxpayer stated that he had not received the goods, that he had never been in business relations with the German company, and that the purchase of the goods in question had not been recorded with him.
The German financial administration rejected the request for the transmission of supporting documents – contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents – because the turnover was below € 15,000 and no other justification had been given.
Since the Czech tax official did not receive any documents for subsequent taxation of the acquired goods, the tax audit was fruitless and the original tax assessment was successful.
On the basis of a request from the NKÚ, the BRH found that the German taxpayer acted as "fiscal Representative17" (§ 22 (A) – (e) UStG).
The German taxpayer declared these deliveries in his VAT return and in the ZM.
His right to tax exemption was recognized.
On the basis of the notification by the BRH, the German FA will send the documents required for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods to the Czech Republic.
In Section 4.6.1 it was shown that the answers of the German financial administration to requests for information exceeded the three-month period more frequently than the answers of the Czech financial administration:
6. in its audit, the NKÚ found that on 5 October 2005 the Czech financial administration had submitted a request for information on the value of goods delivered to Germany in the 4th quarter of 2004. 
In the ZM for this quarter, the German taxpayer had reported a delivery of goods to the Czech taxpayer to the value of € 86,307; however, the Czech taxpayer only declared the purchase of goods to the value of €35,314 in his VAT return for the same period.
In response to the request for information received by the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, i.e. after expiry of the maximum processing period laid down in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) no 1798/2003, the German side stated that the request for information could not be processed because the German company had been dissolved at the end of 2005. 
Because the German tax administration did not meet the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech tax administration did not have the necessary documents for taxation in the Czech Republic.
7.in 2005, a Czech tax official requested, by means of an SCAC form, the verification of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German taxpayer in the third and fourth quarters of 2004 to the value of € 1,265,554, with indications of carousel fraud.
The NKÚ stated that at the time of its examination a German response to the request for information had not yet been received.
Through a request to the local tax officer, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer had not declared in his VAT return the delivery of new motor vehicles to this German taxpayer in the value of CZK 11,816,103.
The Czech tax official corrected the information in the tax return and the Czech taxpayer submitted a corrected tax return.
Due to technical problems, the German CLO did not forward this request for information to the local FA for examination.
Following the notification by the BRH, a special VAT audit was carried out at the German acquirer in Germany. It was determined that the purchase of all the motor vehicles in question had been correctly taxed and that the vehicles were resold to other taxpayers in Germany.
8. according to MIAS data, in the 4th quarter of 2004, the Czech taxpayer acquired a passenger car worth €48,500 from a German taxpayer.
However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare an intra-community acquisition.
By asking the local tax officer in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer had not filed a VAT return since August 2004.
The Czech taxpayer did not submit any tax returns even after being requested by the tax official. As a result, on 23 May 2005, the FA set the value added tax liability at zero for the period October to December 2004. 
On 2 June 2005, the CLO issued an instruction to examine the said delivery from the German taxpayer.
Since the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the tax official, the tax official sent a request for information on the above-mentioned delivery to Germany.
Since the reply to the request for information was received only on 7 February 2007, it was not known until the end of the Nkú audit how the Czech tax official used the information obtained in the international exchange of information.
Due to non-compliance with the obligations under the Czech VAT Act, the VAT registration of the Czech taxpayer was deleted with effect from 23 August 2005. 
In some cases, only a partial answer was sent because at the time of the examination of the NKÚ and BRH, the competent FA had not yet completed the external examination:
9.
In 2005, the Czech tax official requested, by means of an SCAC form, the verification of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German taxpayer worth € 16,991 in the third quarter of 2004, with indications of carousel fraud.
In his reply to the request for information, the German tax official stated that he had only received invoices for deliveries worth € 16,335 issued by the Czech taxpayer.
On the basis of the Nkú's request, the BRH found that the external audit carried out by the German FA at the acquirer in Germany had not yet been completed.
The German acquirer declared the acquisition of goods worth € 16,335 twice in its VAT pre-registrations for the months of August and September 2004.
10.in 2005, a Czech tax official requested, by means of an SCAC form, that the deliveries of motor vehicles to a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005 be reviewed to the value of € 198,167, showing signs of carousel fraud.
The German tax administration submitted a partial response to the request for information to the Czech Republic, in which it confirmed that the German taxpayer had acquired several motor vehicles and that, moreover, the investigation in Germany had not yet been completed.
The NKÚ found that the local FA had carried out several external audits of the Czech taxpayer in order to verify the deduction of above-average input taxes.
However, an unjustified claim was not established.
The BRH found that the German taxpayer had declared in his VAT returns for the period in question the acquisition of goods from other member states with a total value of € 579,114, and that the examination of the German FA with the acquirer in Germany has not yet been completed.
Section 4.4.1 describes the reasons for discrepancies between the declaration of intra-community acquisitions in the recipient's VAT return and the information in the supplier'S tax return.
In the cases examined, it was found that periodic inconsistencies or the incorrect declaration of a turnover as an intra-community delivery of goods were not the most frequent reasons for the differences.:
11.
According to MIAS data, in the first quarter of 2005, the Czech taxpayer acquired goods worth € 35,716 from the German taxpayer, but the Czech taxpayer did not declare this acquisition.
Since the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the tax official and there was no business activity at the company's legal headquarters, the Czech tax official requested verification of how the German taxpayer had communicated with the Czech as part of the international exchange of information.
The German response to the request for information revealed that according to the findings of the German tax administration, the Czech taxpayer was unknown at the specified address and the goods were picked up by an agreed forwarder.
The total value of the order was 155,000 €, but the German taxpayer only supplied goods worth 21,659 €.
The Czech tax payer sent the German taxpayer a false payment confirmation for the amount of € 155,153 in favor of the German taxpayer.
After detection of the fraudulent behaviour of the Czech buyer, the German taxpayer, with the support of his other Czech customers, managed to get back the delivered Material with the exception of a part worth 7,916€.
Through a request to the local competent FA in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that the tax administration, on the basis of the information received from the Czech taxpayer, among other things, subsequently taxed the turnover of goods delivered from other member states in the amount of CZK 388,522.
On the basis of a request from NKÚ, the BRH confirmed that the German supplier had reported only one delivery of goods to the Czech taxpayer worth € 7,916 after corrections.
In accordance with German law, the German taxpayer declared the cancellation of the delivery and the reduction of the tax base in the quarter of the cancellation.
His CMM contained the following information concerning the Czech taxpayer:
12.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German financial administration requested the verification of a delivery of goods and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005 by means of a Scacvordruck.
According to the request for information, during the period in question, the Czech taxpayer had supplied the German taxpayer with goods with a total value of € 396,126 and provided services with a value of € 11,885.
The NKÚ found that the Czech tax administration had carried out an audit on the Czech taxpayer in order to investigate this delivery.
In response to the request for information, the Czech Tax Administration reported that the Czech taxpayer had supplied and installed a production plant to the German.
The Czech taxpayer supplied the individual parts of the production plant before the accession of the Czech Republic to the EC and the production plant was assembled on the basis of the order after May 1, 2004. 
The German taxpayer did not take off the assembled production plant and claimed defects.
In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech taxpayer charged the German for the production plant for € 107,100 and € 11,885 for services.
The German taxpayer received the invoices, but did not recognize them and did not pay them.
By asking the local tax officer in the Czech Republic, the NKÚ found that all invoices had been properly recorded in the accounts of the Czech taxpayer.
VAT returns for the third quarter of 2005 included only amounts documented by the Czech taxpayer relating to invoices invoiced after the first of May 2004.
The BRH noted that, based on the response of the Czech tax administration, the local FA came to the conclusion that these transactions were a uniform (goods) delivery of the Czech taxpayer to the German, including the assembly performed.
In this particular case, the place of performance of this so-called factory delivery is the place where the production plant is assembled.
The German recipient of the work delivery owes the value added tax in accordance with the German Value Added Tax Act.
At the same time, the recipient can claim an input tax deduction of the same amount.
Since the VAT liability of the German taxpayer remained unchanged, the German FA did not require a correction of the VAT return.
13. according to MIAS data, Czech taxpayer a purchased a machine worth € 58,000 from German taxpayer C in February 2005.
The Czech tax official sent a request to Germany to verify this information.
In response to the request for information, the German side stated that the German taxpayer C had delivered this machine to the Czech taxpayer B in 2004, but that he had returned it to the German taxpayer C in October 2004.
According to the German tax administration, the machine was not returned to Germany, but transported to the branch of the German taxpayer C in the Czech Republic.
The reply to the request for information also revealed that the German taxpayer C had delivered the machine to Czech taxpayer A in February 2005.
The latter received the machine at the headquarters of the German taxpayer's branch in the Czech Republic.
Since this delivery (from C to A) took place only within the Czech Republic, there was no intra-community delivery of goods.
By asking the local tax officer responsible for taxpayer B, the NKÚ found that according to MIAS data, German taxpayer C had delivered goods (another machine) worth € 88,027 to the Czech taxpayer in the third quarter of 2004.
Taxpayer B stated that he had not received the goods, so the local Czech tax official sent a request for information to Germany.
The answer was that the machine had been delivered.
In the course of further investigations at taxpayer B, the tax officer found that the machine, valued at € 88,027, had not been booked at taxpayer B and that it could be the same type of machine that the branch of German taxpayer C had delivered to Czech taxpayer A in February 2005.
The NKÚ also noted that the Czech tax official responsible for taxpayer A had carried out an audit on the tax official.
The tax officer had at his disposal the invoice of the German Taxable Person C dated 7 February 2005, in which the Taxable Person A is indicated as the recipient of the machine. 
The Czech tax official noted that taxpayer A had not booked this invoice.
Taxpayer A had concluded a lease agreement with another Czech company whose object was a machine of the same type.
The leasing company delivered the machine on February 9, 2005 and also provided the Transport.
The Czech FA did not use the information provided in the reply to the request for information to determine the tax liability of taxpayer A.
The BRH found that the German taxpayer C had not delivered the machine worth € 88,027 to the Czech Republic, but to another German taxpayer D.
Accordingly, there was no intra-community delivery of goods, but a taxable delivery within Germany.
Consequently, the German tax official did not recognise the German tax - payer C's claim for VAT exemption and corrected the information in his tax return.
The German taxpayer d delivered the machine to the Czech taxpayer B.
Under German law, this delivery was not subject to tax in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.
The BRH also noted that the German taxpayer C had stated in its ZM for the first quarter of 2005 the delivery of a machine worth € 58,000 to the Czech taxpayer A.
This delivery was not checked during the tax audit carried out by the German FA.
The figure below shows the contractual relationships between the business partners involved in the above-mentioned transactions.
14.
When examining requests for information received, the NKÚ found that on 4 October 2005, the Czech tax administration had received a request for information from Germany, in which a German tax official requested the verification of intra-community deliveries of a German taxpayer worth € 879,680,625 to a Czech taxpayer. 
The German tax official stated that there was a suspicion that this was a fictitious intra-community delivery of goods.
The German taxpayer had not carried out any active business activity since 1999.
The NKÚ found that the Czech tax official had carried out an external audit on the Czech taxpayer.
The head of the Czech company stated that this was probably a claim by the German taxpayer against the German tax administration, which the Czech taxpayer had asserted to the German FA as a shareholder in the German company.
According to the information provided to the NKÚ, the Czech tax official has so far no Information that the German tax administration is handling the case with respect to the Czech taxpayer.
From the information available, it appears that it was not a delivery of goods; nevertheless, the amount in question is still stored in the MIAS as an intra-community delivery of goods from Germany to a Czech taxpayer.
The main reason for these discrepancies was the failure to mention the intra-community acquisition in the tax returns of the recipients (see also Section 4.4.1).):
15.according to MIAS data, a German taxpayer supplied goods with a total value of €33,205 to a Czech taxpayer in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005.
However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare the intra-community acquisition.
The Czech tax official requested an examination of the delivery of goods from Germany as part of the international exchange of information.
In its reply to this request for information, the German side stated that the German taxpayer had sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech taxpayer and that the other goods had been picked up by the latter personally.
By asking the local Czech financial officer, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer had submitted a supplementary VAT return for the relevant period before receiving a reply to the request for information.
Nevertheless, the differences in the values of the acquisitions could not be clarified, so the Czech tax official recommended a tax audit with the Czech taxpayer.
This test has not yet been carried out.
16. According to the MIA's data, a German tax had paid in the third quarter of 2004, a Czech Taxpayer at a value of 46.854€.
For the same period, a Czech taxpayer declared the intra-community acquisition of goods worth only €14,856.
As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech tax official asked for verification of the actual value of the delivery.
With the German response to this request, three invoices were sent showing a total value of the delivered goods of € 31,999, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech taxpayer and the MIAS data.
By asking the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ found that after receiving the reply from Germany, the latter had contacted the Accountant of the Czech taxpayer and remained with her in such a way that, after checking the invoices, she wanted to talk with the company owner about submitting a supplementary VAT return for the third quarter of 2004.
So far no supplementary VAT return has been submitted.
The Czech tax official informed the NKÚ that he would proceed in such a way that the deadlines for a retroactive VAT determination for the relevant tax period were respected.
17.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer delivered goods worth € 11,600 to the German taxpayer.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax official asked to verify whether the Czech taxpayer mentioned actually existed, as the alleged owner of the German taxpayer had set up a number of shell companies in Germany.
In the course of the FA's review of the transaction, the Czech taxpayer confirmed the purchase of the goods.
According to the Czech taxpayer, however, the goods were not delivered from Germany to the Czech Republic, but were resold in Germany in 2005.
The Czech taxpayer submitted supporting documents for the sale in January 2005.
The Czech taxpayer was not registered as liable to VAT in Germany and had not taxed the sale of the goods in question either in the Czech Republic or in Germany.
All of these facts pointed to tax evasion within Germany and the Czech tax official forwarded these details to the German tax administration in his response to the request for information.
By asking the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer had submitted a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004 on the basis of a tax audit, in which he declared, among other things, the value of the goods he had acquired from a German taxpayer and at the same time asserted the right to deduct input tax for the acquisition from other member states.
In his Czech VAT return, he did not declare VAT on the sale of goods in Germany.
On the basis of a supplementary VAT return submitted after the external audit, the Czech tax official fixed the VAT liability unchanged.
In this case, the Czech legislation did not provide for the purchase of goods from other member states, as the goods were not dispatched or transported from another member state to the Czech Republic.
Thus, the Czech tax official has drawn a wrong conclusion during the external audit.
The BRH noted that immediately after receiving the reply to the request for information, which showed that the goods had not left Germany, the German tax official corrected the tax return of the German taxpayer and demanded the payment of VAT worth € 1,600.
In addition, the relevant FA sent a control notice to the FA responsible for the actual recipient of the goods to ensure that the resale of these goods is properly taxed.
In the following cases, entrepreneurs declared intra-community deliveries that may not have been carried out:
18.
The Czech tax official received a request for information from the German tax administration on the question whether the Czech taxpayer had purchased a car worth € 47,400 from the German taxpayer in February 2005.
The request for information was accompanied by a print of the VAT registration certificate of the Czech taxpayer.
A photocopy of the passport of the person who was supposed to have transferred the vehicle was also attached.
In the course of his investigation, the Czech tax official discovered that the passport had been stolen, that the person named in it had not imported a vehicle into the Czech Republic and stated that he had had no contact with a German taxpayer.
The VAT registration certificate, the print of which had been sent from the German side, had not been issued by the Czech tax administration.
With this information, the Czech tax official answered the request for information and at the same time stated that he could not confirm the acquisition of the car.
By asking the local Czech tax official, the NKÚ found that the Czech taxpayer is not domiciled at the address indicated in the commercial register and that the managing director of the company is not available.
After a tax appeal procedure for the Tax Period February 2005, the Czech tax official set the tax liability of the Czech taxpayer at zero.
In the course of a further investigation, the Czech finance official found that the vehicle in question had been sold to another Czech person who had purchased it on the basis of an internet advertisement.
The BRH found that the locally competent German tax officer had rejected the German taxpayer's claim for exemption of this delivery from VAT on the basis of the Czech reply to the request for information.
19.in the course of an external audit, a German FA was unable to clarify a difference of € 3,000 between the value of the purchased goods as stated in the VAT return and the reported values from other member states.
A Czech taxpayer should have delivered goods worth € 89,424 to a German taxpayer in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005.
Since the acquisition declared by the German taxpayer did not correspond to the MIAS data, the German tax official requested the verification of the deliveries and their payment as part of the international exchange of information.
In his reply to the request for information, the Czech tax official stated that the sole managing director of the Czech company had been deleted from the Commercial Register on 8 July 2005 and that a new managing director had not yet been registered. 
The German recipient of the goods was allegedly a Relative of the shareholder of the Czech company.
The Czech taxpayer submitted a VAT return and a tax return, which, after the deletion of the managing director in the Commercial Register, had been signed by an unauthorised person, namely this shareholder of the company.
The Accountant of the Czech taxpayer informed the tax official that the owner of the capital had deposited the payment received for the invoiced goods in euros into the company's account.
Cash receipts were not issued.
By asking the local Czech FA, the NKÚ found that the tax officer had recognised the Czech taxpayer's right to VAT exemption for goods delivered to other member states in the value of CZK 1,326,307 in the first quarter of 2004 and CZK 1,416,180 in the first quarter of 2005.
The BRH found that the German tax official did not correct the VAT return of the German acquirer, since a German court had meanwhile confirmed the insolvency of the German taxpayer.
Since the previous external audit showed no signs of tax fraud, there was no prospect of actually being able to collect a determined VAT liability.
20. according to MIAS data, in 2005, a German taxpayer acquired goods from the Czech Republic worth € 4,251,196, after which he had acquired goods worth € 43,274 in the previous year.
The German taxpayer did not declare the intra-community acquisitions either in his 2004 VAT return or in the 2005 return.
In addition, he did not declare any value-related initial sales.
Due to these discrepancies, the German FA submitted a request for information regarding the 4th quarter of 2005 and the 1st quarter of 2006. 
In the ZM for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-community goods deliveries with a total value of CZK 167,246,083.
On 6 September 2006 the request for information was received, in which the German side requested to check whether the delivery reported by the Czech taxpayer had actually taken place.
In response to this request for information, the Czech financial administration stated that the German request could not be complied with because the Czech company did not have a managing director (or other legal representative).
From the documents provided to the NKÚ by the Responsible Tax officer, it can be seen that on 30 March 2006, together with the managing director of the Czech taxpayer, a protocol had been drawn up on the start of the VAT audit for the 4th quarter of 2004 and the period January to December 2005. 
At the same time, the tax officer asked the taxpayer to submit all accounting and tax documents for this period, but he failed to do so.
According to the commercial register, the term of office of the sole managing director expired on May 16, 2005, without the appointment of a new managing director. 
The Czech taxpayer has not submitted any tax returns on sales since April 2006.
As part of the parallel investigation, the NKÚ, in cooperation with the BRH, investigated several cases of intra-community deliveries between the Czech Republic and Germany which were not the subject of a prior exchange of information between the two countries.
The two courts of auditors exchanged information about the cases examined via the CLO of both countries.
21.a Czech company (UCR), which is not based in Germany, informed the competent company (Chemnitz-Süd) that it wanted to conduct taxable business in Germany.
Based on this Information, the company was registered as of June 2005, but did not receive a German VAT number.
The (UCR) accepted an order from a Danish company (UDK) for the production of wind turbines and their delivery to Austria on behalf, at the risk and for the account of the Danish Customer.
Due to insufficient own production capacities, the Danish company passed on part of the order to a German taxpayer (Ude) based in Germany.
The following figure shows the contractual relations and the transport route of the wind turbines:
According to German law, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as described below:
- The Danish company (UDK) sent the wind turbines to Austria for installation on its behalf, at its risk and for its own account.
Because of the installation, its delivery takes place in Austria, i.e. the delivery of the wind turbines is controllable in Austria.
- Because the freight forwarder was commissioned by the Danish company (UDK) and the latter had the Transport carried out in its own name, at its own risk and for its own account, the place of delivery of the German sub-contractor (Ude) is where the Transport began, i.e. in Germany.
Although the wind turbines were delivered to another EC member state (AU) and the recipient is registered as taxable in an EC member state (CR), no tax exemption could be claimed for the delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE), since the EC member state for which the delivery was intended is different from the country of residence of the Czech Company19.
Accordingly, this delivery is properly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (UCR) claimed the input tax deduction in its VAT returns.
The place of delivery of the Czech company (UCR) also depends on the place where the Transport started.
However, some of the wind turbines were transported from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.
- The delivery of wind turbines produced in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.
- The delivery of the remaining wind turbines, which were manufactured in Germany, took place in Germany.
Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) supplied both intra-community deliveries from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-community deliveries from Germany to Austria.
The BRH noted that the Czech company (UCR) did not declare intra-community deliveries either in its German tax returns or in its ZM delivered to the German CLO.
Thus, the Czech company may have treated all its intra-community deliveries uniformly as intra-community deliveries from the Czech Republic.
The NKÚ found that (UCR) did not report intra-community deliveries to Austria, but intra-community deliveries to Denmark.
In order to ensure the taxation of intra-community acquisitions in Austria, the cooperation of at least four financial administrations (Austrian, Czech, Danish and German) would be required, although in this case there is no evidence of tax fraud or tax evasion.
In addition, the NKÚ and BRH reviewed case designs to determine the magnitude of the differences between the information in the sales tax returns and the MIAS data caused by the different legislation in 2004.
The cases examined also show that it takes some time for the taxpayers and the FA to apply the new legal regulations:
22.in its ZM for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2004, a Czech taxpayer reported goods deliveries with a total value of CZK 792,977,452 to a German taxpayer.
During the same period, another Czech taxpayer reported intra-community deliveries to another German taxpayer with a total value of CZK 18,157,265.
From the information provided by the BRH to the NKÚ, it emerged that in both cases electricity deliveries were involved.
Both Czech taxpayers took into account the above-mentioned deliveries in their ZM in accordance with Czech Law No. 235/2004 in force in 2004.
In a further examination of these transactions, an audit group of the NKÚ found that in 2004 different legal regulations on the supply or purchase of electrical energy between the Czech Republic and Germany applied.
Whereas in the Czech Republic, the taxable persons declared deliveries of electrical energy as intra - community deliveries of goods in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 235/2004 in force in 2004, according to the German legal provisions in force in 2004, it was not an intra-community acquisition of goods, but taxable and taxable transactions in Germany.
The differences in the legal provisions in the Czech Republic were eliminated by the adoption of Law No. 635/2004, which amended some tax provisions with effect from 1 January 2005. 
23.in the examination of intra-community deliveries or acquisitions in cooperation with the BRH, it was further established that a Czech taxpayer declared intra-community deliveries to a German taxpayer with a total value of CZK 240,411,163 in its CM for the first and fourth quarters of 2005 and another Czech taxpayer declared intra-community deliveries to another German taxpayer with a value of CZK 263,470,776 in its CM for the same period.
Information transmitted by the BRH to the NKÚ showed that in both cases it had been deliveries of electrical energy.
In accordance with the wording of Law No. 235/2004, which will apply from 1 January 2005, the place of performance for the supply of electrical energy shall be the place where the purchaser has his legal domicile, Registered office or permanent establishment for which this supply takes place. 
Therefore, the Czech taxpayers should not have reported the electricity deliveries in their ZM for 2005.
The fact that both taxpayers treated the supply of electrical energy in their ZM as intra-community supplies led to a difference in the amount of CZK 503,881,939 in MIAS.
Final remark
Through the cooperation, the goals of the BRH and the NKÚ were achieved.
Both audit offices gained in-depth knowledge of VAT management systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The cooperation revealed differences in the two systems and in the legal regulations governing VAT administration.
During the parallel tests, interesting cases of intra-community deliveries or acquisitions came to light.
Some of them are worth further observation.
On the basis of the audit results, both audit courts developed recommendations for the management of VAT.
The follow-up of these recommendations in the form of a control audit should be part of the further observation.
The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of the two accounting courts are the basis for the successful execution of future audits in the field of VAT administration.

Public procurement of construction services and Prevention of corruption
Joint report of the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on their parallel audits
Introduction and Overview
The award of services by contracting authorities is of great importance for the state as well as for the economy.
The state has the task to use public funds as economically and economically as possible and to ensure fair and regulated competition.
In the European Union (EU), the award of services by contracting authorities is an important element in the creation of a single Economic Area.
In order to be able to guarantee largely unlimited competition across borders, contracting authorities must comply with EU requirements for their contracts above certain value limits (thresholds).
To this end, the EU member states have to transfer and apply the EU procurement law into national law.
This has already happened in both the Czech Republic and Germany.
Below the EU thresholds, it is up to the individual countries to regulate the awarding of public contracts themselves.
The award of services is also a corruption-prone area.
Due to the fundamentally high potential for damage, the contracting authorities must therefore take appropriate measures to prevent and prevent corruption and undue advantages in the award of their contracts.
In January 2011, the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed to conduct parallel audits on the EU-wide award of construction services as well as on corruption prevention.
The focus of the audits was on the application of the EU procurement law, which has been transposed into national regulations, as well as preventing corruption in the award of construction services in building construction and road construction or transport infrastructure.
The awards below the EU thresholds were also included in the considerations in order to prevent corruption.
The audit results of both audit courts are summarised in this joint report.
The report should also be addressed to international institutions, such as the International Organization of supreme audit institutions (INTOSAI).
Audit areas and audited bodies the evaluations of the Federal Court of auditors on the listed topics are mainly based on cross - sectional audits that it carried out in 2011/2012 with the building administrations responsible for the Federal Road and building construction in Germany.
He examined, for example, the construction of motorways and large building projects.
In addition, the Federal Audit Office used results from previous investigations.
The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic based its evaluations on examination findings from the years 2008 to 2011. The tests included construction measures in road construction, railway infrastructure construction, hydraulic engineering, building construction (hospitals, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc.) as well as other construction sectors in the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the public contracts awarded by the federal government are mainly carried out by the building administrations of the federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the State Building administration is centrally responsible for awarding contracts in the field of transport infrastructure.
In building construction, the awards are carried out decentrally by those bodies that use state budget funds.
In both countries, freelancers are also involved for parts of the procurement procedures.
When comparing the evaluations, differences in the procurement law and in the market structure for construction services of both countries must be taken into account.
Development of Public Procurement Law in both countries
In Germany, the implementation of EU-wide procurement procedures is laid down in laws and regulations.
Procurement procedures limited to the national field are governed by budgetary law and the administrative regulations based on it.
For both EU-wide and national procurement, many additional individual regulations are also specified by internal administrative provisions,
such as the so-called" procurement manuals " of the federal government, in which the legal requirements are supplemented or more precisely formulated in compliance with procurement law case law.
In the Czech Republic, the procurement procedure is governed exclusively by the Procurement Act and other statutory provisions which apply both to the area above and below the EU thresholds.
The procurement law was significantly amended in 2012.
The new regulation increased transparency in the handling of public funds, enabled greater competition and limited the possibilities of corruption in the procurement procedure.
Principles of Public Procurement Law in both countries
In both countries, the open procedure, the restricted procedure and the negotiated procedure are to be used in particular for EU-wide contracts.
In Germany, the National Award types (public tender, restricted tender, open tender) are to be used for Measures below the EU threshold, but these largely correspond to the EU-wide award types mentioned above.
Public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of priority of the open procedure (for EU-wide contracts) and the public tender (for national contracts).
In the open procedure and in the public tender, any interested company can submit an offer.
Another essential feature of German public procurement law is the promotion of medium-sized companies.
Above all, the division of an overall construction project into specialist and partial lots serves this purpose.
The individual award of these lots is intended to enable as many companies as possible to participate in the competition.
Both of the aforementioned features of German public procurement law are proven instruments for achieving economic results.
More than 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees are active in Germany.
In the Czech Republic, EU-wide procurement procedures are also applicable to construction projects below the EU threshold.
An exception here is the simplified procedure, in which a less stringent procedure may be used below the thresholds and under certain conditions.
Czech public procurement law, in accordance with EU law, contains provisions according to which contracts are to be concluded when competition is guaranteed and a favourable price is achieved.
The current legal provisions in the Czech Republic allow contracting authorities to choose between open and restricted procedures.
There are over 85,000 construction companies in the Czech Republic, including about 1,900 companies with 20 or more employees.
Construction volume of contracting authorities and shares of the procurement types in both countries
In Germany, the total construction volume in 2011 amounted to 307 billion euros.
Of this amount, 45.5 billion euros were spent on public construction (15 %), which, in addition to federal construction, also includes the construction measures of the federal states and municipalities.
The construction volume of the federal government in building construction and trunk road construction (excluding rail transport infrastructure and hydraulic engineering) amounted to 8.5 billion euros.
In 2011, the volume of contracts for construction work in building construction and highway construction in the Federal Republic of Germany was distributed among the types of contracts as follows: 80.7% open procedures and public tenders, 12.7% restricted procedures and restricted tenders, and 6.6% negotiated procedures and open tenders.
Of these, 33.2% were awarded Europe-wide.
The volume of public construction projects in the Czech Republic amounted to 4.7 billion euros in 2011, which represented about 25% of the total volume of all construction projects in the Czech Republic.
In 2009, the volume amounted to 7.8 billion euros, which represented 37% of the total construction volume.
Breakdown by type of award for 2011: 65.1% open procedures 14.3% non-public procedures 9.5% negotiated procedures 8.4% simplified procedures for order volumes below the threshold 2.7% other procedures
The data refer to all public contracts for supplies, services and works awarded by public procurement agencies in 2011.
The above-mentioned data show that the parallel audits of both countries are directed towards a significant part of public procurement, the Prevention of corruption to be observed in all contracts has a great financial impact and the open procedure and the public tender are of outstanding importance in the award of contracts
Summary of results of parallel tests
The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (Nkú) and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have carried out parallel audits in their countries on the EU-wide award of construction services and on corruption prevention.
In this context, the working groups of both audit bodies compared the corresponding legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and Germany as well as the results of their parallel audits, which they carried out in particular in the areas of building construction and road construction.
In doing so, they essentially stated::
The EU directives on the award of works by contracting authorities have been transposed into national law in both the Czech Republic and Germany (no. 1 and 3.1).
In addition to the EU regulations, the procurement regulations of both countries also serve to prevent corruption, which partly differ in their focus and in their detail (No. 3.2).
In both countries, an essential requirement for the procurement documents is that they must contain all the information required for the proper preparation of tenders.
The performance specifications must be neutral and must not have any restrictions on competition.
In Germany, the procurement documents have largely met these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, it is still a Problem to determine the subject of the contract sufficiently.
In Germany, construction work must be divided into lots, if possible, in order to promote competition.
According to the findings of the BRH, this requirement was largely implemented in Germany.
The Nkú found in its tests, especially in the field of road construction, that the award of extensive services without lots or with only very large lots can affect competition and lead to a restriction to only a few large companies.
Narrowing the market potential can result in significant cost increases and carry the risk of price or other agreements.
In accordance with the provisions of both countries, the contracting authorities may, under certain conditions, agree in principle with the companies already commissioned additional or amended services that prove necessary after conclusion of the original contract (No. 4.1).
The respective specifications for determining the type of award were largely followed in both countries.
According to the regulations of the Czech Republic, the contracting authorities are free to choose between open and restricted procedures.
In Germany, on the other hand, the legal and budgetary primacy of the open procedure applies to EU-wide contracts or the public tender, which corresponds to the open procedure for national contracts.
This allows more companies to submit offers.
This reduces the risk of corruption, complicates price agreements between bidders and leads to the most economical results.
In the case of construction projects whose estimated total contract values reached or exceeded the EU threshold, the audited building authorities awarded the construction services in principle throughout Europe.
The correct estimation of the expected value of the contract is an essential basis for choosing the right type of contract.
In Germany, cost databases are used for the cost determination of public buildings, especially in building construction,
based on the evaluations of completed construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, a database is used in the field of road construction, but it is not yet an effective Instrument (No. 4.2).
For construction works to be awarded throughout Europe, preliminary information and announcements must be published. This is intended to strengthen competition by enabling interested companies to adapt to the planned Awards at an early stage.
As a rule, the audited building administrations complied with this requirement.
In individual cases, incorrect information, incorrect applications or missing controls may affect competition (No. 4.3).
The selection of candidates for participation in public procurement procedures is particularly susceptible to manipulation.
According to EU law, the number of invited applicants must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not discriminate and must be announced in advance.
In addition to the requirements of the EU, the awarding authorities in both countries should switch between the companies to be invited as often as possible when selecting applicants.
In order to counter the risk of manipulation, there are sometimes very detailed specifications in Germany.
The audited administrations disregarded these requirements in some cases.
In the Czech Republic, decisions on the selection of candidates were not always comprehensible (No. 4.4).
In both countries, in the interest of equal competition, it is necessary to ensure that the companies interested in submitting a bid receive the same information during the bidding phase.
In order to avoid anticompetitive agreements, contact between these companies and with freelancers who were involved in the preparation of the service description must be avoided as far as possible.
The corresponding regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.
The certified building authorities in Germany partially did not comply with these requirements (No. 4.5).
When opening the offers in both countries, the multi-eye principle and the principle of transparency must be observed in particular.
The specifications for the marking, documentation, safekeeping and confidentiality of the offers are intended to limit the scope for manipulation and are particularly detailed in Germany.
The tests in both countries revealed only a few complaints (No. 4.6).
Examination and evaluation of the offers are defined in both countries by requirements for the structure and process Organization.
The regulations in Germany are more comprehensive, but have not been consistently observed by the audited contracting authorities.
For example, procurement agencies handed over offers for examination to third parties without having to look through the offers beforehand and sufficiently document abnormalities.
The offers were thus insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulation (No. 4.7).
At the conclusion of the EU-wide procurement procedures, the companies involved in the competition should be informed of the intended assignment before the award of the contract.
This legal protection also has a preventive function against corrupt behaviour.
The Czech Republic also provides for judicial review for non-EU-wide procurement procedures.
Only in a few cases did the contracting authorities not comply with the specified deadlines for the award of contracts or deviated from the bidders ' offer in terms of content (No. 4.8).
The documentation of the procurement procedures was not always complete or comprehensible with the audited building administrations in both countries.
The EU-wide transparency requirement was not sufficiently implemented in the procurement notes of some procedures.
Some of the shortcomings identified also reduced the anti-corruption function of the documentation.
The contracting authorities of both countries largely fulfilled their reporting and reporting obligations (No. 4.9).
Fundamentals of EU procurement law and Prevention of corruption
EU procurement law
In order to ensure unrestricted competition within the European Union with the free movement of services and goods, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, among other things, the procurement coordination directive and the remedies directive, which had to be transposed into national law by the member states.
The general procurement principles of the European Union are in particular the competition law, the Equal Treatment Law or the Prohibition of discrimination as well as the transparency law.
In order to achieve these objectives, the procurement coordination directive contains special provisions for construction services to be awarded throughout the EU for construction projects.
For this purpose, their estimated order amounts must reach or exceed a current volume of 5,000,000 euros.
The regulations concern, in particular, documents the content of the Award, the publication of certain information before, during, and after the award, to Comply with deadlines, including for the receipt of tenders, the documentation of the procurement procedure, the requirements that can be placed on the qualifications of the applicants and The remedies Directive provides the basis for the legal protection of candidates and tenderers.
In the event of possible infringements of Public Procurement Law, the companies concerned may have the decisions of the contracting authorities reviewed in review proceedings.
Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the directives of the European Union into national law.
Prevention of corruption
Importance of preventing corruption
In both countries there is no legal Definition of corruption.
In general, corruption is the abuse of a position of trust for private benefit,
which is usually initiated by the beneficiaries of these decisions.
Corruption can impede competition and cause significant economic damage.
It is estimated that the global cost of corruption is 5% of world economic output.
For the European Union, the scale of these costs is estimated at 1%.
In the case of public clients, restrictive agreements or unfair conduct may call into question trust in the integrity and functioning of the administration.
Preventing corruption is therefore one of the fundamental tasks of public authorities.
They have to check the structure and process Organization of their administrations for areas particularly at risk of corruption in order to make appropriate safeguards against corruption there.
Preventive measures and effective controls can significantly reduce the vulnerability of decision-making processes to corrupt abuse.
The award of Public Works is generally regarded as a particularly corrupt field of work.
Measures to prevent corruption
In Germany, corruption – in particular bribery and bribery as well as acceptance and approval of benefits-is prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
In order to prevent corruption, the federal government has adopted a directive and recommendations on the Prevention of Corruption12 in the federal administration. In addition to risk analysis, the following principles must be observed for the procurement area: priority of public tenders and open procedures, multi-eyes principle and transparency, fundamental separation of planning, awarding and billing, precise and complete documentation of the procurement procedures.
In addition, further anti-corruption provisions have been incorporated into the procurement regulations.
In 2011, for example, the Federal Ministry responsible for procurement in the area of federal highways introduced an electronically supported control system,
with the award data − such as the estimated costs and the order totals-as well as information on the freelancers involved are collected comprehensively and evaluated for abnormalities.
Corruption is also prosecuted under criminal and labour law in the Czech Republic.
The legal requirements of transparency and equal treatment of bidders as well as the Prohibition of any discrimination form the most important foundations of preventing corruption.
For public procurement, the Czech government has defined anti-corruption measures in a strategy paper on combating corruption for the years 2011 to 2012 and updated them for the years 2013 to 2014.
Some of the measures recommended in it have already been transposed into national procurement law and corresponding administrative regulations.
The new legislation contains essentially the following provisions: reduction of the thresholds for smaller contracts, obligation to publish the contracts in advance by the awarding authority, including the reasons for the tender, Prohibition of limiting the number of tenderers in restricted procedures and thus abolition of the possibility of selecting tenderers by lot, introduction of the obligation to publish the contract documents and all annexes, introduction of the obligation to publish the actual price and the list of subcontractors.
Examination results for the individual phases of the award procedure
Procurement documents
Procurement documents the procurement documents must contain all the information that the bidders need for the proper preparation of the tender.
In particular, the procurement documents must enable a correct calculation.
No risks may be transferred to bidders that are not calculable for them.
The procurement documents consist in particular of the service description and the contract conditions.
In addition, they contain the specifications for proving the qualification (suitability) of the bidders as well as the criteria that are decisive for the selection of the most economical offer.
Requirements of EU law and Prevention of corruption
The requirements of EU law for the procurement documents are directed in particular to the technical specifications.
These must be equally accessible to all bidders and should limit competition as little as possible.
The service description must be product-neutral.
Therefore, information on products or manufacturers as part of the service description is only permitted under strict conditions.
The avoidance of restrictions on competition in the procurement documents is also a fundamental principle of preventing corruption.
In addition, unclear or incorrect information in the procurement documents must be avoided, as they open up scope for speculation when preparing the tenders and for manipulation of their valuation.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations in both countries, the EU legal requirements for the technical specifications have been transposed into national law.
The services are generally product-neutral without specification.
In the service descriptions, the individual services must usually be subdivided in detail into service units with respective quantities.
The prices are to be agreed on the basis of performance units (e.g. Euro per m2 or per piece).
Only in exceptional cases may performance be defined by functional targets.
In any case, the service descriptions must be complete and unambiguous.
They must contain precise quantities and must not include services for which it is not clear whether they are needed.
Compensation according to flat rates or according to time expenditure must be avoided as far as possible.
These provisions are intended to prevent speculation and manipulation based on unspecified specifications in the procurement documents.
The service descriptions must enable the bidders to create their offers safely and without extensive preparatory work.
The tender shall only be made public when the tender documents have been completed.
Differing regulations
There is no obligation to tender for construction works in lots in the Czech Republic.
If it is possible according to the type of service to be commissioned, the public procurement authorities may subdivide construction services into several lots.
In Germany, construction services are generally to be divided into lots, separated by quantity (partial lots) and/ or by type or subject area (specialist lots).
This should enable medium-sized companies to participate in the competition, expand the number of possible providers and make price agreements more difficult.
This type of award is usually considered the most economical.
In the Czech Republic, evaluation criteria must be indicated in the procurement documents for both EU-wide and national procedures.
This should allow applicants to be fully and conclusively aware of the criteria according to which their offers are to be evaluated.
In Germany, the specification of evaluation criteria in EU-wide notices, but at the latest in the procurement documents, is only required in EU-wide procurement procedures.
In national procurement procedures, the evaluation criteria are to be recorded only in an internal administrative procurement note.
Procurement documents drawn up by authorised freelancers may not contain references to these offices or involved planners or experts in Germany with the building construction and some road construction administrations.
This is intended to prevent individual companies from gaining additional information or other undue competitive advantages without the knowledge of the client through contact with these freelancers.
This is also the reason why freelance procurement documents may neither send nor interpret planning documents for inspection.
The contact person of the companies is solely the client.
There is currently no regulation on this in the Czech Republic.
Additional or amended services that prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (supplements) are almost always required for large construction projects.
In both countries, the statutory provisions allow, to a certain extent, the award of supplements to the company already commissioned, without the need for a public procurement procedure.
According to the EU regulations and the German regulations, the remuneration of the supplementary services may not exceed half of the main contract.
In addition, the additional services must not be separated from the main order without significant disadvantages or must be absolutely necessary.
In the Czech Republic, a narrower limit of 20% applies for a corresponding award without public notice.
However, this may increase the risk of delayed completion of the construction project or the need to involve an additional contractor in the construction work already underway.
If supplementary services are also transferred to the already commissioned company, an arbitrary price increase for these services by the contractor is generally not possible under the regulations in Germany.
In determining the remuneration for the additional services, the agreed prices and the basis of the price determination of the order already issued must be assumed.
In addition to supplementary benefits, there may also be a reduction in the scope of benefits.
In the Czech Republic, reduced quantities cannot be offset against additional additional services.
Essential Examination Results
BHR
Technical specifications and product-neutral tender
In individual cases, the service descriptions contained references to national technical approvals or standards that had already been replaced by Europe-wide standards.
Some performance descriptions also contained product-related specifications – for example for graffiti protection, joint tapes or noise protection panels-without this being necessary.
In some cases, performance requirements were described so accurately that only one product was eligible.
Tables of services broken down according to partial services
The BRH has not found in any of the audited procedures violations of the requirement to tender services in principle in a list of services subdivided according to partial services.
Completeness of the service descriptions
In the vast majority of the procedures, the procurement documents were completed before the start of the tenders.
In some procedures, the procurement documents had to be corrected during the tender phase, as some positions or deadlines had changed.
In some cases, the service lists contained items that did not determine whether they were needed.
A list of services for demolition work even consisted almost half of such demand items.
Lots and evaluation criteria
With many awards, the prescribed reason was missing, why the predominantly after unprofessional advertised services were not further divided into partial lots.
There were no complaints when specifying the criteria to be used in the evaluation of the offers.
References to freelancers
A small part of the service descriptions contained references to the involved freelancers.
Their names were partly on the covers or in attached plans or reports.
In one case, the awarding authority even explicitly asked the applicants to contact the architect "on questions of the tender".
In the building sector in particular, the contracting authorities attributed the complaints mentioned predominantly to the failures of the freelancers commissioned with the preparation of the service descriptions.
The Construction Services pointed out the lack of capacities in order to be able to adequately control the service descriptions.
NKÚ
Technical specifications and product-neutral tender in the public procurement for the construction of a residential building with 12 residential units, a supplier and a specific product brand were specified in the service description.
The awarding authority did not allow the use of comparable products without justifying this.
During the construction of several university buildings, suppliers and products were also specified in the tender.
Performance descriptions with performance units
In the case of construction projects in some industrial areas, the awarding authority did not clearly specify the scope and type of services required in the specifications.
As performance units, it only specified the converted space of the individual buildings in cubic meters.
Completeness of the service descriptions
During the construction of a motorway bypass, the performance specifications were changed four times in the period from August to September 2009 as part of a restricted procedure,
since the scope of services had increased considerably and the technical requirements had changed.
Tender documents for Social buildings contained inaccurate location information, insufficient preliminary structural studies and incomplete design drawings, which meant that additional services had to be commissioned.
During the construction of a large library building, the interior specification contained no requirements for product quality.
As a result of these missing specifications, some subcontractors installed overpriced and inappropriately high-quality equipment.
Lots and selection criteria
In the Czech Republic, the division of construction measures into partial lots or the award of partial contracts is not mandatory.
An examination of the three major sections of the construction of a motorway ring revealed that savings of up to 31.6 million euros at a total cost of 620.3 million euros would have been possible if selected parts were awarded in batches.
For example, six different buildings that were the subject of a single contract could have saved 2.5 million euros (25 %) if the contract had been awarded in batches.
With a loose allocation of 20 bridges, savings of 11.5 million euros (25 %) would have been possible compared to a total allocation.
When awarding construction services in road construction, the central awarding authority specified very extensive reference requirements as selection criteria.
In the case of the construction of a part of a motorway, the awarding authority required the tenderers to provide evidence of at least three road construction projects, each worth 28 million euros, carried out over the past five years.
In the Czech Republic, a maximum of nine providers met these requirements.
The public award of another section of a motorway comprised six separate construction projects, in which the awarding authority had specified an annual construction volume of at least EUR 480 million in the last three years as the selection criterion for the companies.
Two thirds of the funds spent on road construction projects in 2008 and 2009 (i.e. 2.5 billion euros out of a total of 3.7 billion euros) were allocated to contracts from a total of five companies that carried out the contracts alone or as a working group.
In 46 procurement procedures with an order volume of 528 million euros, only two or even only one bidder submitted an offer.
The NKÚ showed that a narrowing of the market potential can lead to significant cost increases.
Additional Services
In the case of the construction of a motorway bypass, the awarding authority did not apply any of the legally prescribed procedures when awarding additional services in two cases and did not conclude any written contracts for the additional services.
Due to unclear quantity and quality requirements, additions were made in the first case of up to EUR 63.7 million (net) and in the second case of up to EUR 165.4 million (net), which increased the respective order volume by 21% and 91% respectively.

For several university buildings, some services were not listed in the procurement documents, although their necessity was already known when the contract was awarded.
Although the scope of these additional services exceeded the limit of 20% of the original contract value laid down in national procurement law, the contracting authority conducted negotiated procedures with the contracted companies without a contract notice.
During the construction of a large courthouse, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional construction services in negotiated procedures without a tender.
During the construction period, the awarding authority expanded the scope of the works by 2 million euros.
The unit prices for the additional construction services awarded without competition were significantly higher than comparable services provided by the same company.
Further Findings
Based on a sample survey of construction projects, the NKÚ found that the average cost of building a four-lane motorway kilometre in the Czech Republic is up to EUR 14.6 million.
In Germany, however, the average cost of a four-lane motorway kilometre is up to 10.4 million euros, according to an evaluation of long-term data from the Federal Ministry of construction.
This comparison indicates that highway construction in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.
Summary Findings
In both countries, the basic rules on procurement documents are largely identical and take into account the EU requirements.
They serve both a comprehensive and fair competition as well as the Prevention of corruption.
For example, the requirement for the sufficient certainty of the service descriptions should enable the bidders to calculate and prepare their offers appropriately,
protect the client from additional services to be agreed subsequently and also limit speculation.
In Germany, the common basic specifications for the procurement documents are supplemented by regulations that are intended to further reduce restrictions on competition and opportunities for manipulation.
There are no requirements to this extent in the Czech Republic, but transparency is increased by publishing the evaluation criteria for non-EU-wide procurement procedures.
The requirements for the description of services have been largely complied with in both countries.
In some cases, however, deviations had to be objected to, which may also have led to restrictions of competition.
The existing requirement to form lots in Germany promotes competition and leads to economic results.
In the Czech Republic, according to the audit findings of the NKÚ, the award of extensive services without lots or with only very large lots can result in restrictions of the provider field on only a few large companies.
The extensive reference requirements for road construction in the Czech Republic have meant that public contracts are awarded only to a narrow range of suppliers and that small and medium-sized enterprises are not allowed to participate in the competition.
Also, a limited number of competitors often leads to higher prices and increases the risk of price or other agreements.
The regulatory approaches in both countries differ with regard to the award and remuneration of additional or amended services.
According to the EU regulations as well as the German regulations, supplementary services with a value of up to half of the main contract can be awarded under certain conditions without a procurement procedure with public announcement.
In the Czech Republic, a narrower limit of 20% applies, up to which additional services can be awarded to the original contractor in a negotiated procedure without notice.

This limit is often exceeded,
since the scope of services for public contracts is often insufficiently determined.
If the excess is greater than 20 %, the additional services must be tendered with public notice.
By dividing services into lots, restrictions of competition and the resulting adverse consequences can be avoided.
Defining the type of award and taking into account the EU threshold
By defining the type of award, the client determines the amount of the number of companies participating in the competition.
It may leave the range of possible candidates and tenderers largely Unlimited, for example by choosing an open procedure or by limiting the scope of non-public procurement procedures.
For construction projects where a threshold set by the EU is reached or exceeded, Europe-wide procurement procedures shall be applied.
Requirements of EU law and Prevention of corruption
When choosing the type of contract, the contracting authority must take into account, in particular, the European law requirements on competition and transparency.
If the estimated total contract value of the construction services of a project is equal to or above the EU threshold of currently 5,000,000 euros, the construction services are generally to be awarded throughout Europe according to open or restricted procedures.
In exceptional cases, negotiated procedures or competitive dialogue are also possible.
In the case of construction projects that reach or exceed the EU threshold, the contracting authority may deviate to a limited extent from the principle of Europe-wide procurement and may award construction services in national procurement procedures, provided that the estimated contract value of the respective lot is less than EUR 1,000,000 and the sum of these lots does not exceed 20% of the estimated total contract value of all construction contracts.
A uniform construction project must not be divided into individual measures without compelling reason or deliberately estimated at too low cost values in order to withdraw it from the obligation to award the construction services throughout Europe.
Since restrictions on competition significantly increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of the type of award is of great importance in preventing corruption.
The detailed justification of the chosen type of contract as well as the examination of the obligation to apply EU procurement rules are important elements of the documentation of the contract award procedure.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have fully transposed the EU legal requirements on procurement procedures and the threshold value into national law.
Differing regulations
The Czech Republic has also transferred the fundamental equality of open and non-open procedures contained in the EU directive to its construction contracts, which are not subject to EU requirements.
There is freedom of choice between the open and the restricted procedure, without the decision having to be documented or justified. Other procedures, however, are only possible under certain legally defined conditions.
In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure or – in the case of national contracts − the public tender generally take precedence. This is determined by the budget and procurement law as well as by the guidelines for preventing corruption.
Other types of procurement – such as the open procedure or the Restricted Tender − are only possible in exceptional cases, which are finally regulated in the procurement law.
The existence of an exceptional case must be substantiated and documented in a comprehensible manner.
The principle of priority of the open procedure or the public tender is intended to ensure the most unrestricted competition possible, to exclude the possibility of manipulation by defining certain tenderers and to make possible price agreements between tenderers more difficult.
The principle of public tendering is a central Element in preventing corruption in Germany.
The correct estimation of the expected value of the contract is an essential basis for choosing the right type of contract.
The construction services in Germany can use planning and cost databases of public administrations as well as other organizations to determine the expected costs in the field of Public Building Construction.
These databases are based on evaluations of completed construction projects. The databases contain, among other things, cost parameters for building categories, usage units, components or individual construction services.
On the basis of such cost parameters, the estimated contract value of a planned project or a construction work to be awarded can be determined.
Corresponding cost databases for road construction have only some construction administrations in Germany.
However, a nationwide introduction for all road construction administrations is planned.
Contracting authorities in the Czech Republic cannot rely on central databases or average price estimates of comparable construction measures when determining the expected costs of construction services.
In most cases, the cost estimates are based on estimates made by the financing agency or result from the amount of funds made available to the Building Services Agency.
Measures to standardize cost assessment procedures are still in their infancy.
As part of the Anti - Corruption Plan for 2011-2012, the relevant ministries were commissioned to create a database for standardised building materials and materials.
This segment ISIN tention ally left blank
In this database, information on material expenditure and construction and finishing works as well as other cost - relevant data are to be recorded in order to enable cost estimates and provisions of unit prices.
The Czech Ministry of Transport has also issued a data collection for construction projects to improve cost control,
which is intended to serve as a benchmark for pricing in the financing plan and is currently being updated.
Essential test results BRH
Choice of award procedure
The audited contracting authorities largely wrote out the construction works in an open procedure or in a public tender and thus followed the budgetary and procurement requirements.
In 2011, 59.5% of the construction work of the federal government in building construction was put out to public tender or in an open procedure.
In road construction, this proportion was 94.8%.
In the selection of non-public types of procurement, detailed reasons were sometimes lacking as to why the contracting authorities had to deviate from the principle of open procedure or public tendering.
In a cross-sectional investigation, the BRH found on the basis of more than 16,000 procurement procedures that non - public procurement methods have significant disadvantages in terms of competition compared to open procedures and public tenders and increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.
In building construction, more than twice as many tenders were submitted in public tenders as in restricted tenders and almost three times as many tenders as in private tenders.
The study also showed that the offer prices were on average 6% and 10% higher for restricted tenders and hand-over tenders than for public tenders.
Parallel investigations by the Federal Ministry of construction and a State Audit Office confirmed the economic differences between public and non-public procurement methods.
As a result of its studies on economic efficiency, the Federal Ministry of construction even found twice as many differences between public and non-public procurement procedures.
Taking into account the EU threshold
For the construction projects for which they had calculated an estimated total contract amount of more than 5,000,000 euros, the audited contracting authorities usually drew up procurement plans in which they defined the construction services to be awarded in accordance with EU-wide as well as national procurement procedures.
According to the procurement plans, a share of more than 80% of the construction work was to be awarded throughout the EU.
Circumventing the obligation to award contracts across the EU through too low cost estimates was not detectable.
However, partly as a result of incorrect calculations, the minimum proportion of EU-wide procurement procedures fell below the de facto level.
During construction, some contracting authorities inadmissibly changed the specifications of their procurement plans.
They did not justify these changes and did not prove that the minimum proportion of EU-wide procurement procedures was still adhered to.
For most of the construction measures examined, the proportion of EU-wide contracts awarded according to the settlement results was usually lower than foreseen under the procurement plan.
In some cases, for construction projects above the EU threshold, the contracting authorities violated the requirement to tender all 1,000,000 euros and more of the single lots in EU-wide procedures,
and instead chose national procedures.
NKÚ
Choice of award type
For several major construction projects, such as the construction of some sections of the motorway, construction projects in the context of a major sporting event and housing projects, the contracting authorities divided construction services into several partial contracts, although these services were similar or comparable.
As a result of these divisions, the individual services were no longer above the threshold value and were subsequently awarded in simplified procedures or even in disregard of legal requirements.
Calculation methods for the estimated order value
In road construction, the existing price databases for this area were only an insufficient Instrument to determine the expected order values.
The data were based on construction projects that had just been completed, but where there were indications of a lack of economic efficiency, unnecessary additional performance expenditure or excessive profits of the commissioned companies.
For three sections of a motorway ring, actual prices were about 37% lower than the estimated order values determined using the database.
In the meantime, the Ministry of transport revised the databases in order to be able to take into account not only the offer prices of recent years, but also comparable market prices and price increase indices in the construction sector.
In building construction, the expected order values were based on cost values estimated by the project architects or on estimates by the investors.
The actual order values deviated greatly from the estimated values.
The estimated price for the conversion or expansion of a large library was twice as high as the later agreed order value, however, eight additions in the course of construction led to an increase in costs of 2.1 million euros or 27 %.
Similarly, the actual value of the contract for the construction of a library depot was 33% lower than the estimated price, although here too costs increased during the construction phase.
In other cases, the offer prices exceeded the estimated values and increased during construction.
When building a large library, the estimated price was exceeded by 16 million euros or 22%. In the construction of a judicial building, costs rose disproportionately at 139%, as the usable area had only increased by 12%.
Summary Findings
Both countries have implemented the EU rules for determining the type of award and for taking into account the EU threshold into national law. Therefore, the respective regulations largely correspond.
However, the priority of the open procedure or public tender in Germany goes beyond the EU requirements and the regulations in force in the Czech Republic.
Compared to the non-public procurement procedures, more companies have the opportunity to participate in the competition in public procedures or public tenders.
The public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of Offers and the most economical results.
The risk of corruption is significantly improved by not restricting the candidate field by regulations of the client that are susceptible to manipulation and by making price agreements between the bidders more difficult.
The investigations have confirmed the advantage of the priority of the open procedure or public tender in Germany.
According to Czech legislation, contracting authorities may award contracts in open or restricted procedures.
According to the latest changes in procurement law, the number of tenderers may no longer be limited in Proceedings Involving previous competition.
Thus, the non-open procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.
In Germany, the awarding authorities have largely followed the guidelines on the priority of the open procedure or the public tender. In the Czech Republic, some services were improperly allocated in order to circumvent the requirements for the choice of the type of award.
When taking into account the EU threshold value, errors had to be detected in Germany that resulted in a fall below the minimum proportion of services advertised throughout the EU.
In the Czech Republic, there is still no satisfactory solution to accurately determine the expected costs of construction services and construction projects.
If necessary, the building authorities should ensure by means of further checks that the specifications for the choice of the type of contract as well as the scope of services to be written out throughout the EU are complied with or that the conditions for appropriate cost assessments are created.
Prior information and announcement
In the case of construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe, the public builder must inform interested companies about the planned Awards in advance of the tender.
Preliminary information and announcements form an important basis for a Europe-wide competition.
Requirements of EU law and Prevention of corruption
The preliminary information shall contain the essential information under public procurement law relating to the planned construction projects.
They are required for those construction projects for which the estimated total contract value reaches or exceeds the EU threshold and for which the client wishes to shorten the offer periods of open or non-open procedures.
In notices, the client must provide further details on the planned construction contracts to be awarded throughout Europe in a binding manner.
This segment ISIN tention ally left blank
In it, he has to make known, among other things, the scope of services, the process and execution dates, the special requirements as well as the evaluation criteria and their weighting.
The common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV Codes), which is standardized throughout Europe, must be used to describe the object of the contract.
Preliminary information and notices are published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the buyer profile of the client.
In order to prevent any discrimination against foreign interested parties, announcements at national level may not contain any additional information and may only be issued after the text of the announcement has been sent to the office for official publications of the European Union.
Incomplete or incorrect information in the notice may affect competition and may even support manipulation.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have fully transposed the EU legal requirements for prior information and publication into national law.
Differing regulations
In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and notices must also be published for construction works not to be awarded throughout Europe.
Procurement procedures may be started no earlier than one month after the sending of the preliminary information to the EU official journal (for EU-wide contracts) or to the National Official Journal (for all contracts).
Only in exceptional cases can the publication of a preliminary information be dispensed with.
In Germany, no prior information is required for non-EU-wide procurement procedures.
In national procurement procedures, notices for public tenders and participation competitions must be published before restricted tenders on the federal government's internet portal and, if applicable, in newspapers or magazines.
In the case of restricted tenders without a competition, notices of services to be awarded from 25,000 euros are required (ex-ante transparency).
All planned lots of the construction projects must be listed in the preliminary information.
In Germany, this is of particular importance because of the small-scale nature of the loose construction contracts.
In the Czech Republic, this regulation has only a small impact, as much less construction work is divided into lots.
Essential Examination Results
BRH
Pre-information
The examined contracting authorities published preliminary information for all tested construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe.
In some open proceedings, however, they shortened offer periods, although the 52-day period necessary between the sending of the preliminary information and the announcements had not yet expired.
Other shortened procedures were only tendered after the twelve-month period of validity of the prior information had already expired and before it had been extended.
Many published preliminary information lacked references to the planned division of construction services into lots.
Notice
The notices of the audited entities partly contained CPV Codes that deviated from the information provided in the preliminary information or that did not accurately record the required services.
In individual cases, notices at national level were published earlier or contained more information – e.g. on the deadlines for implementation – than the notices in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Ex-ante transparency
The contracting authorities of an audited building administration had commissioned a service company to publish the national procurement procedures.
It published the reports on its own fee-based procurement platform.
However, the awarding authorities did not check whether the company had forwarded the reports to the free internet portal of the federal government as required.
Samples showed that only one third of the reports of the audited administration were published on this Portal.
NKÚ
Notice
When building a sewage treatment plant, the contracting authority did not specify in its notice the criteria on the basis of which it wanted to select the tenderers.
The awarding authority could not prove how the bidders were selected.
The limitation of the number of bidders was permissible under the law in force at the time.
In the case of the construction of a motorway ring, the awarding authority did not specify in any detail in the contract notice or in the documentation of the contract award procedure, according to which it would assess the qualification of the applicants and how many applicants it wanted to admit to the competition.
In its assessment, the awarding authority concluded that all six applicants met the qualification requirements, but excluded the applicants with the worst ratings from the further procedure.
The procedure of the awarding authority was not transparent because it had not disclosed information on the qualification criteria and the evaluation procedure at any time during the procedure.
Publication of notices
During the renovation of former military sites, the awarding authority did not publish the tender.
Summary Findings
The two-stage Information System with prior information and publicity is an important component in order to implement the transparency requirement for Europe-wide procurement, to strengthen competition and thus also to prevent corruption.
Both countries have implemented the EU requirements and increased the transparency of their procurement procedures also in the national procurement area:
Selection of candidates for non-public procurement
In contrast to public procurement procedures, in non-public procurement procedures, not every company that is interested in performing the services to be awarded can participate in the competition.
In the case of non-public procurement procedures, the awarding authority must make a selection in advance of which companies are to be invited to submit tenders.
Requirements of EU law and Prevention of corruption the EU regulations allow a limit on the number of applicants in EU-wide non-public procurement procedures.
However, in the case of restricted procedures, at least five companies are to be invited to submit tenders.
At least three companies must be invited to participate in negotiated procedures with a contract award notice.
In any case, the number of invited applicants must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be announced in advance.
The selection of companies to be invited is a process within the procurement procedure that is highly susceptible to manipulation, for example by allowing certain companies to be unilaterally preferred.
In addition, restricting competition to a few companies also favours possible agreements between the applicants.
In both cases, the award result may be significantly affected at the expense of the customer.
The contracting authorities must therefore take special precautions against possible manipulation, carry out sufficient checks and, in particular, ensure the transparency and traceability of this procedural step.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
The rules for selecting applicants are similar in both countries.
In addition to the EU requirements, the awarding authorities should switch among the companies to be invited as often as possible when selecting candidates.
Nor may Competition be limited to companies located in certain regions.
The awarding authorities shall justify the selection of applicants and document the course of the selection procedure in their award notes.
Differing regulations
In Germany, at least three suitable candidates are to be invited to submit tenders in the case of restricted tenders and, in principle, several suitable candidates in the case of free-handed tenders.
Under the new Czech regulations, it is inadmissible − apart from two special areas − to limit the number of bidders in restricted and negotiated procedures.
In Germany, the multi-eyes principle must be observed when selecting companies.
If, for example, an employee has proposed a number of companies for a non - public procurement procedure, the management level of the building services department or an agent from the procurement agency must generally amend this proposal by, for example, removing a proposed company and/ or supplementing a new company.
This is intended to prevent a single Person from being able to determine the final circle of companies to be involved in the competition.
Otherwise, in the case of manipulative intentions, this could enable far-reaching agreements between the parties involved.
The list of companies to be invited is to be treated confidentially – also towards freelancers – and not to be made generally accessible.
This segment ISIN tention ally left blank
In the Czech Republic, there are no corresponding regulations for the establishment and secrecy of candidate lists.
According to the German regulations, freelancers are not allowed to determine the companies to be called upon, but can only submit proposals to the awarding authority.
There is a regulatory gap in Czech legislation.
Essential Examination Results
BRH
Number of applicants
With a few exceptions, the requirement to request a minimum number of companies to submit tenders in the case of non-public contracts was met.
An evaluation of the BRH of almost 7,000 non-Europe-wide procurement procedures for construction services in building construction revealed that the awarding authorities invited an average of 6.6 companies to submit tenders for restricted tenders from the federal government in Germany and an average of 4.4 companies for open - ended tenders.
Change of companies and regional restrictions
Especially for trades with few suppliers, the awarding authorities did not always change the circle of selected applicants.
Above all, they took into account companies already known to them and proven in their view.
As a reason for this, they stated that, in the case of non-public proceedings, the suitability of the companies to be invited to compete must be ensured before the invitation to submit an offer.
The BRH did not find an inadmissible restriction to regional bidders in the non-public procurement procedures, but a higher proportion of regional companies than in public tenders.
The contracting authorities attributed this above all to the fact that the scope of services in the non-public procurement procedures is on average much smaller and therefore, for example, longer access routes are more important than in public tenders.
Multi-eyes principle and suggestions of freelancers
Contrary to the regulations, the contracting authorities mostly failed to have the proposed list of companies to be requested amended by an independent person.
They justified this in particular with a lack of processing capacities, deadline pressure or insufficient knowledge of alternative suitable companies.
It was also often not documented who had proposed the companies invited to submit a bid.
Some samples showed that freelancers had drawn up the candidate lists and that these proposals had been adopted unchanged by the awarding authorities.
Thus, the awarding authorities did not protect themselves to the extent required from possible manipulation.
Confidential treatment of bidder lists
At a procurement office, the lists of the companies to be requested were recorded in a data processing system that could be viewed by all employees of this office.
In the case of manipulative intentions, the names of the designated or approved companies could have been passed on without authorisation and, for example, could have enabled agreements between these companies.
Documentation
The documentation of the award procedures contained only in a few cases justifications for the selection of applicants.
NKÚ
Selection of applicants
During the construction of a motorway ring, the bidders received no information on the evaluation criteria and the evaluation procedures.
In the restricted procedures for the expansion and modernisation of waterways and ports, the notices did not specify how the selection of candidates should be carried out.
In one procedure, all eight participating applicants met the qualification requirements, thus exceeding the specified maximum number of companies to be admitted.
The procurement committee then carried out a lottery process to select the companies.
However, this procedure, which was in principle permissible at the time, should have been mentioned as one of the criteria in the notice.
Summary Findings
Due to the high risk of manipulation in the selection of candidates in non-public procurement procedures, both countries have taken special precautions to prevent undue restrictions on competition.
With the multi-eyes principle, the secrecy of the bidding lists and the sole authority of the awarding authorities to propose the companies to be invited, the German regulations restrict such possibilities of abuse.
In the case of the Czech regulations, the newly introduced requirement of the largely unlimited number of bidders in non-public proceedings can in particular counteract possible manipulative restrictions.
However, the audit findings have shown that some of these requirements have been insufficiently implemented and that the potential for manipulation of an abusive restriction of the number of participants has not been sufficiently reduced in these cases.
The contracting authorities should completely eliminate the identified deficits.
Offer phase
With the announcement of the award or with the invitation to submit a bid, the tender phase begins, in which the companies can create offers on the basis of the procurement documents sent to them.
Applicants may submit their offers until the deadline set by the awarding authority.
Requirements of EU law and Corruption Prevention
There are no separate EU legal requirements for this phase of the procurement procedure.
The contracting authorities must observe the national regulations with which the possibilities of manipulation existing during the tender phase are to be counteracted.
These are mainly organizational specifications and controls.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
The procurement documents on the basis of which the companies are to prepare their tenders are only to be sent by the awarding authority.
Freelancers involved in the procurement procedure may not perform this task.
The awarding authority shall ensure that all applicants receive the same information during the bidding phase.
In the event of ambiguities in the procurement documents or other questions relating to the tender, only the awarding authority may provide information to the applicants.
Freelancers commissioned with the preparation of the procurement documents may not provide any information.
During the entire offer phase, contact between the commissioned freelancers and the applicants must be prevented.
The freelancers must not become a hub of the procurement procedure, through which contacts with anticompetitive consequences can be established.
Offers sent by Post or directly must be submitted in a sealed envelope.
Electronically transmitted offers have a technical encryption.
Differing regulations
In Germany, the awarding authority may also Commission external service companies with the printing and dispatch of the procurement documents, whose employees are obliged to keep the offers confidential and to conscientiously fulfil the contractual obligations.
The received offers shall be marked with an entry stamp in Germany and forwarded directly, immediately and unopened to a staff member responsible for safekeeping.
This staff member may not be involved in the award.
The received offers must be kept under lock and key until the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, the received offers are marked with a reference number.
The awarding authority records the offer data including order numbers as well as the creation and receipt data in a log.
The safekeeping of offers is not regulated in detail in the Czech Republic.
Essential Examination Results
BRH
The tests for the tender phase focused primarily on the procurement procedures of a building administration.
Dispatch of procurement documents
The contracting authorities of the certified building administration sent the procurement documents themselves or had them printed and sent by an external service company.
Freelancers did not send any procurement documents.
Information to applicants
The tested building management mostly did not comply with the requirements for the separation of planning and allocation when naming the contact persons for queries and information.
In the service descriptions, contrary to the specifications, she did not specify employees from the procurement office, but from the project managers as contact persons.
Some procurement documents even contained the names of the freelancers who had created the service descriptions.
In individual cases, not all applicants received the same information when asking questions during the bidding phase.
Marking of tenders
All received offers were stamped and marked with the entry stamp of the building administration.
In some hands - free Awards, however, the offers were received by freelancers, which contradicted the pretensions to prevent corruption.
Safekeeping of offers
After their identification, not all offers came directly and immediately to the employee responsible for the custody, who included the offers in a steel cabinet.
In a construction department, the offers were meanwhile stored in an open compartment of the post office to which every employee had access.
Another department had hung up a mailbox in a corridor that was not constantly monitored, in which the offers submitted there sometimes even stayed overnight.
Since the insertion slot of this letterbox was large and unsecured, not only staff members, but also visitors to the department would have had the opportunity to remove offers received and, if necessary, to manipulate them.
NKÚ
No defects were reported on the Czech side.
Summary Findings
During the tender phase, contacts between interested companies and freelancers involved in the procurement procedure are to be prevented in both countries.
By providing all bidders with the same information, the principle of equal treatment shall also be respected.
The regulations for the receipt, safekeeping and secrecy of the offers appear suitable in order to be able to counteract Manipulation and corruption.
The corresponding requirements in Germany are somewhat more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
The results of the investigation in Germany have revealed violations of the regulations in some areas.
These shortcomings could be eliminated with little effort.
Opening of offers
Opening of offers
During the opening date, the previously closed offers will be opened and their contents will be read out and thus made known.
From the opening date, the bidders are bound to their offers until the deadline set by the awarding authority expires.
Requirements of EU law and Prevention of corruption
No separate EU legal regulations are specified for the opening of the offers.
For this highly sensitive phase of the procurement procedure, however, the national regulations on corruption prevention contain extensive provisions for the protection of offers and competition.
The multi-eyes principle as well as the transparency and traceability of the Offer Opening are intended to prevent manipulation and changes to the submitted offers.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
The opening date is to be carried out by several persons to be determined by the awarding authority.
The multi-eye principle is intended to prevent individuals from uncontrollably manipulating the offers when opening the offers.
In most procurement procedures, bidders can participate in the opening date.
Only offers which were available to the negotiator at the opening of the first offer are permitted.
Offers received late May in principle no longer be taken into account.
In order to ensure the transparency of the opening date, the actions taken and the results of the opening of the offer must be recorded in a minutes, in which, among other things, the names of the bidders and the offer prices must be recorded.
The minutes shall be read out and signed by the negotiator.
It can also be signed by the bidders present.
Differing regulations
In the Czech Republic, a committee conducts the opening of tenders.
Freelancers can also participate.
The committee may also be entrusted with further phases of the procurement procedure, such as the evaluation of tenders.
In Germany, a negotiator and a secretary conduct the opening of the offer.
The negotiator must be a staff member of the tendering body.
The negotiator and, in the case of contracts in building construction, also the Secretary shall not be involved in the processing of the contract documents as well as in the award and contract execution.
According to German regulations, the minutes of the opening date must include information on discounts and discounts as well as special features − such as damaged or delayed offers − in addition to the offer prices.
In the Czech Republic, in addition to the offer price, only the language of the offer and the applicant's right to sign it are recorded.
The German regulations provide that the open offers are to be marked in all parts in such a way that subsequent changes and additions are prevented.
The offers are usually marked by perforations with the date of the opening date. They must be kept secret after the opening date and may only be made accessible to persons directly responsible for processing them.
Appropriate Czech regulations do not exist.
If only one offer is received in a procurement procedure in the Czech Republic, it must not be opened and must be returned unvalued.
There is no such regulation in Germany. If only one offer is received, this is to be opened and then evaluated.
Essential Examination Results
BRH
Multi-Eye Principle
The audited awarding authorities implemented the specifications for the multi-eye principle at the opening dates.
They each carried out the opening dates with negotiators and clerks who were not tasked with any other procurement procedures.
However, in the case of hands-free contracts with a lower scope of services, there were isolated cases in which freelancers opened offers sent to them without the participation of the awarding authority.
Protocol
In the minutes of the opening dates, the opening of the offers was not always fully documented.
In some cases, for example, the late submitted offers were not registered, in some cases even signatures were missing.
Marking of tenders
In accordance with the specifications, the awarding authorities examined in the framework of the cross-sectional examination marked the tenders with the date of the opening date through a perforation.
In the case of tests carried out by some recipients of grants, insufficient markings had been found.
However, these contracting authorities changed their marking practice after the complaint by the BRH.
NKÚ
Offer period
In the case of the award of road maintenance measures, an offer was only received by the awarding authority one month after the expiry of the offer period. Nevertheless, the awarding authority accepted this offer.
Summary Findings
The regulations of both countries for the opening of the offers agree in relevant parts. They take into account both the multi-eye principle and the principle of transparency. As a result, the risks of corruption and manipulation can be significantly limited when the offers are opened.
The requirements in Germany are more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
In particular, the requirements for the exact documentation of the procedure as well as for the marking, the safe storage and the secrecy of the offers significantly restrict manipulation possibilities such as subsequent changes to the offers.
In addition, the persons responsible for opening the offers may not perform any other tasks in connection with the service to be awarded.
The overall only few complaints prove the high acceptance of the specifications for the opening of the offer.
Examination and evaluation of offers
Examination and evaluation of the offers the client shall examine and evaluate the offers available at the opening date.
He shall determine the offer for the award of the contract that best meets the requirements according to the specified award criteria.
Requirements of EU law and Prevention of corruption
The requirements of the EU provide for a multi-stage procedure:
The suitability of the bidders must first be determined.
Bidders must be economically and financially efficient and have the necessary professional and technical expertise.
Companies that are legally convicted of bribery or fraud offences, for example, are to be excluded from participation in the procurement procedure.
The offers of the non-excluded bidders must be checked mathematically, technically and economically and evaluated on the basis of the previously announced award criteria.
The client shall determine the most economically advantageous offer. Offers with unusually low prices must be examined by the client in particular.
The examination and evaluation of the offers is a particularly vulnerable phase of the award procedure.
For example, bidders may be unfairly excluded or offers that do not meet the requirements may be left in competition.
Due to the preference or disadvantage of bidders, the result of the evaluation can be impermissibly impaired and thus the determination of the economically most advantageous offer can be prevented.
The awarding authority must therefore take special precautions to ensure that the persons responsible for the examination and evaluation meet the requirements for integrity and expertise.
It must also ensure the transparency and traceability of the procedure and the decisions taken.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
In accordance with the requirements of the EU, the offers in both countries are to be examined and evaluated in multi-stage procedures.
The requirements for the suitability certificates to be submitted by the companies as well as the award criteria to be taken into account in the evaluation and their weighting are specified in the notices or in the procurement documents and can no longer be changed during the procedure.
After checking the suitability of the bidder, the selection criteria may no longer be used in the evaluation of the offers.
The evaluation must be limited to the award criteria.
The submitted offers must first be formally checked as to whether they are complete and whether they contain, for example, abnormalities that could indicate possible manipulation intentions.
If bidders are excluded from the further examination and evaluation of their offers, they must be informed immediately.
If the evaluation of the offers results in an unreasonably low price, the bidder must be given the opportunity to comment before a possible exclusion of his offer.
The decisions taken during the examination and evaluation of the offers are to be documented comprehensibly.
Differing regulations
In Germany, the offers to be kept secret may only be made available to persons directly commissioned with the processing.
The review of the offers as well as the calculation of the offers may only be carried out by the awarding authority.
It shall only employ staff who are not involved in the award decision or the implementation of the measure.
The performance of further examination and evaluation tasks is not regulated in detail.
If freelancers are commissioned with the examination and evaluation, they must treat the offers confidentially.
They may only make proposals for the decisions to be taken by the awarding authorities.
In the Czech Republic procurement committees are to be set up for the examination and evaluation of tenders.
The committees draw up evaluation reports with award proposals.
Ultimately, as in Germany, only the awarding authorities have to decide on the contract awards.
If proofs or declarations required for the submission of tenders in Germany are submitted only incompletely, the awarding authority shall give the tenderers the opportunity to submit the missing documents within six days.
Only if the documents are still not available after the deadline, the offer is excluded from the evaluation.
In the Czech Republic, it is at the discretion of the awarding authority whether it gives the tenderers the opportunity to complete missing evidence or explanations.
If a bidder fails to do so, he must be excluded.
In Germany, in addition to the total price, the unit prices (prices for partial services) of the offers must also be examined.
If, due to the price structure of the offer, there are indications of too low or too high prices for partial services, the bidder must be asked to clear up these ambiguities.
If he fails to do so and the awarding authority can provide proof of a mixed calculation of the prices, this offer shall be excluded.
This is intended to prevent bidders from speculating on significant changes in the volume of partial services when calculating their bid, which can result in significant cost increases for the construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, the total price is evaluated, but not the appropriateness of the prices for partial services.
A mixed calculation cannot justify the exclusion of an offer.
A contract may not be awarded in Germany for offers with unreasonably high or low prices.
If one or more offers fall below the correct price determination of the customer or the offer amounts of the other bidders by 10% or more, the bidders must prove the correct calculation of their offers.
If this is not possible for you, the awarding authority may exclude the relevant offers.
In the Czech Republic, the tender can be cancelled after the economic efficiency test if only offers with unjustifiable low prices are available.
In contrast to the German procurement law, the contract can not be refused for offers with prices substantially above the calculation of the customer for this reason.
If in Germany there is a suspicion of anticompetitive behaviour, the awarding authority must report immediately to the leading level of technical supervision.
The latter has to decide which measures are to be taken and whether the Antitrust Authority or the public prosecutor's office should be informed.
The technical supervision leading level must also agree, for example, for works over 50,000 euros, if a contract is to be awarded by hand, a contract is not to be awarded on the tender with the lowest price or the tender is to be cancelled.
There are no corresponding regulations in the Czech Republic.
Essential Examination Results
BRH
Suitability and evaluation criteria
The majority of the procurement procedures audited complied with the listed specifications.
For some of the companies proposed by freelancers, the contracting authorities did not check the suitability of the companies themselves.
A beneficiary commissioned companies without the required proof of suitability being fully available.
In some cases, it was not clear whether the awarding authority had taken all the announced award criteria into account in its selection decision or whether it had based its award decision solely on the criterion "price".
Selection of the persons involved and confidentiality of the offers
Some awarding bodies used non-approved persons for this purpose when examining the offers.
Thus, freelancers or employees involved in the planning or execution of a construction project carried out tasks that were only to be carried out by employees of the awarding authority.
The construction services justified this with insufficient personnel capacities in the respective areas.
In some cases, employees who were not obliged to keep the offers confidential and to conscientiously fulfil their contractual obligations also participated in the freelance work commissioned to examine the offers.
For the construction services, it was usually also not comprehensible whether the offers of the freelancers were only accessible to the persons directly commissioned with the processing.
Review and calculation of offers
Some awarding bodies handed over the open offers to freelancers for further examination, without having previously carried out the prescribed review of the offers and the mathematical examination itself and documented their results.
In the case of manipulative intentions, third parties could have made changes to the offers without this being comprehensible to the awarding authorities.
In the examined documents, abnormalities or missing price or product information were partially not or only insufficiently marked.
Performance audits
In a sample in a building administration, the cheapest offers in three quarters of the procurement procedures examined differed more than 10% from the previously determined estimate costs.
Every twentieth award procedure was cancelled due to inappropriate offer prices.
Not all tender reviews and clarification discussions with the bidders were comprehensible or sufficiently documented.
In many cases, more detailed explanations were missing, such as the unit prices of the most important positions.
Often the deviations were only justified on a flat-rate basis, e.g. by references to changed market prices or increased material costs.
The construction services explained that it was difficult to detect and prove mixed calculations.
In the case of an invitation to tender issued by an institution under public law, the offer price of the cheapest offer was 66% lower than the previously determined estimated value of these services.
Further calculation tests or investigations into the causes of this deviation were not documented.
In a reconnaissance meeting, the awarding authority found no evidence of price dumping by the then commissioned company.
This left it unclear whether the estimated value was excessive or whether the offer price was too low.
Later, the client rated the commissioned company as a" low-cost company", which could neither maintain quality nor deadlines.
In another tender, a construction service agency awarded the contract to an offer whose price was 35% higher than the value of the cost calculation.
She did not cancel the tender and cited the non-pertinent reason that this company could be concluded on an adequate calculation.
Suspected irregularities
In an audited construction administration, there were two cases of irregularities, both of which were reported to the technical supervision leading level.
In one of the cases, the calculation of two bidders was identical in a tender, so that the awarding authority excluded both bids from the procedure.
In the application of the remaining regulations, the tests did not result in any significant complaints.
NKÚ
Aptitude test
For many of the construction projects examined, including university construction, road construction and the expansion of the rail network, the contracting authorities did not exclude bidders from the procedure, even though they did not meet the requirements specified in the tender documents or could not prove their suitability to the prescribed extent. On the other hand, in one case a contracting authority could neither prove nor explain why it had excluded a bidder who had fulfilled the requirements.
Rating
When awarding works for a water treatment plant, the awarding authority disregarded the specified evaluation criteria when examining and evaluating the tenders.
In the case of a construction project for the expansion of the rail network, the awarding authority determined the weighting of the Evaluation Criteria Only at the beginning of the evaluation.
In the case of road maintenance measures, the specified criterion "shortening of the construction phase" was wrongly evaluated in a procedure.
As a result, the offered reduction was insufficiently taken into account by the bidders in second and third positions.
Documentation of the selection of offers
In three procurement procedures within the framework of the housing promotion, the awarding authority did not document which criteria it had applied and on which basis it had selected the successful bidder.
In the case of the construction of a motorway, the awarding authority selected the companies for smaller orders of up to 20,000 euros solely on the basis of telephone surveys on prices and delivery terms.
Tests of this selection were not possible because the surveys were not documented.
Summary Findings
The regulations for the examination and evaluation of the offers comply with the requirements of the EU in both countries.
However, the respective regulations differ with regard to details of the procedure and the selection of the persons involved.
In Germany, the procedure is more regulated than in the Czech Republic by detailed requirements, in particular for the implementation of the multi-eyes principle and for the protection of offers.
The same applies to the specifications on the basis of which the appropriateness of the prices offered is to be checked.
In both countries, some of the procurement procedures examined had to be found to be insufficient or not sufficiently documented for essential procedural steps in the examination and evaluation of tenders.
However, possible manipulative interventions are favoured without comprehensibility and transparency of the examination and evaluation decisions.
A particularly serious defect was the handing over of all offers to third parties without the contracting authority having sufficiently looked through and documented the offers beforehand and thus protected them from possible manipulation in the further procedure.
If contracting authorities have tasks carried out by third parties during the examination and evaluation of the offers, sufficient precautions and an increased inspection effort are required in order to counter the increased risk of manipulation.
When assessing the appropriateness of prices, the audited services in Germany did not always make full use of the specified instruments and did not adequately examine the price structure of the offers.
In the Czech Republic, complaints arose above all in the aptitude test and in the application of the evaluation criteria.
Conclusion of the procurement procedure
After the examination and evaluation of the offers, the award procedure is concluded by granting the award or by cancelling the procedure.
Requirements of EU law and Prevention of corruption
In EU-wide procurement procedures, all tenderers must be informed in advance of the envisaged award decision.
The companies have the possibility to examine the intended award by electronic means or by fax within 10 days or, in the case of other means of communication, within 15 days and, if necessary, to initiate a review procedure.
A contract may not be concluded before the expiry of this information period.
This segment ISIN tention ally left blank
If a bidder submits a request for review within the Information period, the conclusion of a contract is only possible after the final decision in the review procedure.
The companies may also have the award decision reviewed by an independent court as part of this review process.
The review procedure shall ensure the legal protection of the companies and shall require the client to observe the procurement law throughout the procurement procedure.
To do this, he must document the procedure sufficiently.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have implemented the EU rules on information and review procedures.
In both countries, the awarding authority has to decide on the award of the contract.
However, it may not arbitrarily deviate from the result of a proper examination and evaluation of the offers.
The client shall place the order within the stated deadline,
also because the bidders are no longer bound by their offers after the expiry of the deadline.
In the case of open and restricted procedures or public and restricted tenders, the client may not deviate from the content of the offer when concluding the contract.
The unsuccessful tenderers shall be informed promptly of the decision to award the contract and of the reasons for not taking into account their offers.
Procurement procedures may only be cancelled under certain conditions, e.g. if the offer prices are excessive or the offers do not meet the requirements of the tender.
Differing regulations
In the Czech Republic, the 10 - or 15-day information and waiting obligation before the contract is awarded also applies to construction services not to be awarded throughout Europe.
In Germany, these requirements apply only to the area of EU-wide procurement.
In other proceedings in Germany, tenderers can only be informed of the award decision after the award of the contract.
In the Czech Republic, a procurement procedure must be terminated if only one offer has been received or only one offer has been evaluated.
In Germany, the contract must also be awarded in the case of only one valuable tender, provided that it complies with the terms of the tender and is economically viable.
Essential Examination Results
BRH
There were only a few complaints about the audited contracts at the end of the procurement procedures.
In some cases, companies received letters of order for EU-wide contracts before the expiry of the information periods, which may result in the ineffectiveness of the contract.
In individual cases, Order letters also contained content that deviated from the content of the offer, such as changed dates.
In several cases, the clients did not comply with the award deadlines.
In an open procedure, a contracting authority therefore awarded the contract for the second cheapest offer, since a company with a 50% cheaper offer was no longer willing to perform the services at the originally offered price after the expiry of the contract period.
NKÚ
In the case of a construction project in the higher education sector, the contracting authority deviated from the bidder's offer in terms of content.
For some contracts, for example for the construction of road maintenance, for the construction of a motorway and a bypass, the contracting authorities concluded the contracts after expiry of the statutory period.
In the case of the award of works for the renovation of former military sites, the awarding authority forwarded the notification of the award of the contract to all bidders only after expiry of the statutory period.
Summary Findings
Both countries have implemented the EU guidelines at the conclusion of the procurement procedure.
The legal protection of the unsuccessful candidates or tenderers increases the instruments of preventing corruption.
The scope of legal protection in Czech procurement law is also extended to contracts below the EU thresholds.
In both countries, the deadlines for placing orders were exceeded.
This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of manipulation.
In the future, the building authorities should avoid the identified defects when concluding their procurement procedures.
Documentation, reporting and reporting obligations
The award procedures must be comprehensibly documented during their individual stages with regard to the relevant findings as well as the justifications of the individual decisions.
For EU-wide procedures, the contracts awarded must be made known.
The order data are also recorded in EU statistics.
Requirements of EU law and Prevention of corruption by documenting the procurement procedures, a fundamental requirement of the EU-wide transparency requirement is implemented.
A carefully and promptly prepared documentation only enables the traceability of the procurement decisions.
In particular, it also serves the effective legal protection of bidders in the case of contracts above the EU thresholds.
Proper documentation is also an essential component to avoid corruption, since the compulsion to justify procurement decisions in detail significantly restricts scope for manipulation.
The contract notice for an EU-wide procurement procedure has to be sent by the respective contracting authority to the office for official publications of the EU within 48 days.
The Office publishes the notices in the Official Journal of the EU and thus also implements the transparency requirement.
The contracting authorities must also collect the essential data of their procurement procedures and report them to the EU Commission via the relevant national ministries.
On this basis, the EU Commission draws up an annual EU statistics, through which it can obtain an overview of the development of the internal market in construction services.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations
Both countries have fully transposed the EU legal requirements for documentation and reporting obligations into national law.
The rules for documentation and reporting for EU statistics are largely the same in both countries.
Differing regulations
In the Czech Republic, the obligation to publish contracts awarded is not limited to EU-wide contracts, but also extends to other procurement procedures.
The publication period is shortened to 15 days.
In Germany, in addition to the EU-wide awards, there is a publication obligation only for restricted tenders and for free-handed awards above value limits of 25,000 euros or 15,000 euros without VAT (so-called Ex-post Transparency).
Below these value limits, as well as in the case of public tenders, only the companies involved in the competition procedure receive information about the orders placed.
Essential Examination Results
BRH
Documentation
A large number of the audited procurement procedures were not fully documented.
The procurement notes did not contain all the necessary information, such as the justification of product specifications or references to national regulations.
In a procurement procedure, the awarding authority did not explain why it awarded the contract to a company, even though its offer did not contain mandatory evidence.
In a few cases, the documents of the awarding authorities did not contain all the evidence required for the documentation of the award procedure.
Notices of orders
In some EU-wide procurement procedures, the contracting authorities failed to make the awarding of contracts public.
In the case of further procurement procedures, there was no evidence that the contracting authorities had made the awarded contracts public.
Reporting and reporting obligations
The statistical tables consulted contained the required minimum information. They were drawn up and sent on schedule.
Ex-post Transparency
In most cases, the audited building authorities published the order data of the completed procurement procedures.
However, due to a transmission error, this data was not published in a construction administration.
The construction management noticed this error only after half a year,
so that the order data of the procurement procedures completed up to that time were not published.
NKÚ
Documentation
In the case of construction work for the organisation of a major sporting event, the documentation of the award procedures showed considerable shortcomings. These were mainly incorrect information, such as incorrect offer prices in the minutes of the valuation commissions.
In addition, some minutes of the openings were not signed.
Notices of orders
In the case of several road construction projects, notices of contracts awarded were only published late or not at all.
Summary Findings
The regulations on documentation and reporting and reporting requirements are largely identical in both countries and implement the EU requirements.
The transparency of the procurement procedures, including the award of contracts, is thereby guaranteed in principle.
The regulations to be applied in the Czech Republic for publication go somewhat further than the requirements in Germany.
The deficiencies identified in the documentation and in the notices partially substantially limited the orruption - preventing effect of these instruments in the respective procurement procedures.
This segment ISIN tention ally left blank
The building authorities should further improve the transparency of their procurement procedures and orders and fully comply with their reporting and reporting obligations.
Summary evaluation and recommendations
The parallel tests carried out by the NKÚ and BRH focused on two main areas that are essential for the award of construction services by public authorities in the Czech Republic and Germany: the application of EU procurement rules and the Prevention of corruption.
The requirements of EU law enable cross-border competition to create a single European market.
Anti-corruption measures do not only serve to prevent or at least reduce corruption. You should also avert economic damage and a possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the state.
The audit findings of the two courts of auditors on the application of public procurement rules in both countries, as well as the comparison of these rules, provide information on similarities and differences that can be helpful for both countries in the further development of their public procurement law and its application.
Application of EU procurement rules
Both countries have transposed the EU requirements for the award of construction services into national law.
This means that in the Czech Republic and Germany there is an important common basis for the award of construction services and the consideration of the essential requirements of competition, equal treatment of the participating companies and transparency of the award procedures.
The building administrations of both countries have partially supported these bids very extensively by further administrative regulations.
The Czech Republic has to a large extent also transferred the specifications for the construction services to be awarded throughout the EU to its nationally regulated procurement procedures below the EU threshold.
However, the court of auditors ' investigations have shown that the building authorities have not fully complied with the requirements of EU law in all areas.
The construction administration in Germany should further improve the quality of its procurement procedures in order to be able to eliminate the complaints identified when implementing the EU requirements.
The tests in the Czech Republic have shown above all risks that affect the economic viability of the contracts.
Thus, incomplete service descriptions made additional services necessary, which were often awarded in violation of legal regulations. In addition, the cost assessments were usually insufficiently prepared. Excessive qualification requirements also reduced the number of potential bidders and restricted competition, particularly in the transport sector.
Prevention of corruption
The investigations have not had the goal of uncovering corruption cases,
also because the courts of auditors do not have the appropriate instruments for this.
However, the courts of auditors can examine the extent to which the administrations of both countries have taken precautions against corruption and Manipulation in the award of construction services and how these requirements are applied.
Both countries have set different priorities in preventing corruption.
Above all, the German regulations provide for largely unrestricted competition as well as transparency and controls as central elements of preventing corruption.
The Czech regulations aim above all at increased transparency of procedures.
BRH
In Germany, general principles of prevention of corruption apply, which the entire federal administration has to apply.
These principles are also implemented in the specifications for the award of construction services and are geared to their special requirements.
In some cases, the corresponding Regulations specify very precisely how the bids for corruption prevention are to be taken into account when the procurement procedures are completed and when the persons involved are selected.
In the view of the BRH, the primacy of the principle of open procedure or public tender is a suitable Instrument in order to significantly reduce the risk of corruption in the award of construction services. Restrictions on competition, on the other hand, increase the risk of manipulative interventions.
Risk analyses and sufficient controls (especially the multi-eyes principle), the requirements for transparency and documentation of procurement procedures as well as various organizational measures are also effective precautions to prevent corruption and Manipulation.
The BRH therefore sees no fundamental need to change the corresponding specifications of the administrations when awarding construction services.
The regulations for preventing corruption are largely taken into account in practice.
The shortcomings identified in some areas have highlighted shortcomings in the implementation of some specifications.
The building authorities should further train their employees on the requirements for corruption prevention and raise them even more awareness of this problem.
A substantial part of the complaints related to tasks delegated by the building authorities to freelancers.
However, without controls and sufficient safeguards, the risk of abuse increases when delegating tasks.
Therefore, tasks at risk of manipulation and corruption should only be entrusted to third parties if the administration can guarantee a sufficient level of protection against inadmissible interference.
NKÚ
At government level, the Czech Republic adopted a strategy against corruption, in which public procurement is the most important component.
The Procurement Act and its implementing rules have been substantially amended.
The audits of the NKÚ took place during the implementation of this strategy.
The strategy adopted and the new legal provisions are likely to be effective improvement measures, since the contracting authorities must justify the cost-effectiveness of the orders, the calculation of the expected prices, the adequacy of the qualification requirements, the essential evaluation criteria and the type of evaluations, and properly document and publish all these aspects.
Make recommendations
The NKÚ and the BRH assess the implementation of the EU requirements in principle positively.
The widespread acceptance in practice has confirmed that the EU's requirements of competition, equal treatment and transparency are a suitable basis for the award of construction services within the European Union.
The supranational model implemented in the European Union can also serve as a basis for similar projects aimed at facilitating and promoting cross-border competition.
In view of the enormous material and immaterial damage potential caused by Manipulation and corruption in the award of construction services, both courts of auditors see the building authorities in their countries as being called upon to continue and, if necessary, improve their measures against corruption and Manipulation.
In particular, the Organisation and procedures of the procurement procedures should be continuously examined for weaknesses and risks in order to identify the need for action and to initiate appropriate countermeasures.
The comparison of procurement practices in both countries suggests that the proportion of open procedures in the Czech Republic should be increased, as open procedures offer a wider scope for competition and can significantly reduce the risk of corruption.
A greater division of construction services into lots can also have a favourable effect on the offer prices, provided that this leads to greater competition with a higher number of bidders.
Ensuring the correct implementation of procurement procedures is an essential basis for the efficient procurement activities of contracting authorities.
In Germany, the procurement procedures are carried out by the specialised building administrations. In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, these tasks – with the exception of transport construction projects – are performed by the departments themselves or by contractors commissioned by them.
The courts of Auditors of both countries have the intention, even after the completion of their joint project, to further develop the relevant findings for them and, if necessary, to refer them to the parliament and government of their country.
Both audit bodies are also convinced that the principles of procurement law set out in this report and its implementation are also of interest at the international level of the International Organization of supreme audit institutions (INTOSAI). This is because the principles and findings set out are of general importance in order to effectively combat corruption and to ensure the economic allocation of construction services in a well-functioning and fair competition.

Administration of VAT in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany
Report on the audit
Preface
Taxes are the most important source of income for public budgets.
One focus of the activity of the courts of auditors should therefore be on the audit of this area.
This applies in particular to VAT fraud.
This alone creates annual tax losses in the European Union of an estimated 100 billion Euro1.
At the sixth EUROSAI Congress in Bonn in 2005, the participants already pointed out the need for enhanced cooperation.
This allows the audit courts to exchange audit approaches and optimize audit practice.
VAT is particularly suitable for cooperation as it is harmonised within the European Union.
In 2006, the courts of Auditors of both states examined the USt for the first time in parallel.
The corresponding audit report was published in 2008.
Since VAT fraud is a widespread phenomenon in the European Union, close cooperation between the audit offices is required. This enables a comprehensive assessment to be made of whether the measures taken are suitable for effectively combating VAT fraud.
The two audit courts decided to continue their cooperation and conducted a second parallel audit. Administration of VAT in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany audit report
1. Introduction
Examination number: (CZ) 09/11 (d) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892
Subject of audit: (CZ) administration of VAT (d) bilateral audit with the court of Auditors of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as NKÚ), control audit
Audit objective:
(CZ) the VAT administration and the treatment of selected transactions between entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic (hereinafter CZ) and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter Germany) should be examined. In addition, the procedures used by the tax authorities for inter-state assistance should be examined.
(D) the audit should evaluate how the financial administration has implemented the recommendations made by the auditors.
In addition, further examination fields linked to the VAT should be processed.
The findings made here should be compared in order to determine whether the taxation procedures can be optimized.
The examination period was the years 2006 to 2008, including relevant information from the period before the examination period until the conclusion of the examination.
2. Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel audit
The courts of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have agreed on a control audit for the administration of the VAT.
In the previous parallel examination, they had uncovered suspected cases involving intra-community transactions,
which made a further examination appear expedient.
On the basis of the audit findings, the two audit courts made recommendations for the administration of the VAT.
The aim of the audit was to evaluate how these recommendations were implemented. In addition, the suspected cases identified should be investigated.
The examination also dealt with other matters. These included selected cases of risky intra-community transactions, Mutual Administrative Assistance in the recovery of USt claims and USt verification in large companies.
In doing so, the audit courts have determined:
1. Due to the previous testing recommendations
* Recommendation 1: the rules for the registration of taxpayers should be harmonised within the EU
In the first audit, the courts compared the registration procedures for VAT in the two states and found differences that caused problems.
The court of auditors therefore recommended harmonising the registration of taxpayers within the EU.
This was also taken up at EU level.
The draft amendment to council regulation no 1798/2003 provides for the extension of the current databases in the EU, including a database with the VAT identification number.
The draft also provided for common rules for the registration of taxpayers and their possible deletion.
The court of auditors expected member states to agree on appropriate rules in accordance with their policy decision to remove unreliable entrepreneurs from the VAT system as early as possible.
The member states reached political agreement on the final version of the draft in ECOFIN.
The aforementioned common regulations are no longer contained therein. The two courts of auditors regret this.
They still consider such regulations important in order to prevent VAT fraud.
* Recommendation 2: monthly submission of summary reports as a result of the first audit, the court of auditors recommended to the member states that summary reports (CM) should be submitted on a monthly basis in future.
The amounts of intra-community transactions could then be checked more precisely.
Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112 / EC on the common system of Value Added Tax for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-community transactions has reduced the deadline for submitting the CM to one month.
In the Czech Republic, this requirement was implemented by an amendment to the VAT Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010. 
In Germany, the implementation only came into force on 1 July 2010. It has thus not transposed the duty to pay the monthly fee of the ZM into national law in due time.
* Recommendation 3: data comparison of the USt pre-registrations and the ZM in Germany for more reliable MIAS data and proposal to examine the consolidation of the procedures for USt pre-registrations and ZM the German financial administration has taken up the recommendation made by the Federal Audit Office and set up a working group to develop possible solutions.
The work has not yet been completed.
The Federal Audit Office will monitor further developments.
* Recommendation 4: Exchange on successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level during the first audit, the two audit bodies agreed that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by one member state alone.
Successful criteria as well as elements or approaches of a risk management system must be exchanged and implemented in every EU member state.
If this does not happen, fraudsters will focus on the member state with the weakest risk management system.
The court of auditors noted that the two member states apply different risk management systems that have both strengths and weaknesses.
The NKU examined the system of information exchange within the EU-EUROCANET, while the Bundesrechnungshof focused on the German participation in the "platform for risk management".
2. Control examination of selected intra-community transactions
During the first audit, the courts of auditors jointly examined transactions for which it was doubtful whether they had actually been carried out or which had been declared differently by the taxpayers of the two states in the USt pre-declarations (or ust declarations) or ZM.
The courts of auditors selected nine cases of intra-community deliveries of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany for the inspection.
The examinations by the tax offices (FÄ) of both states had not yet been completed at the conclusion of the first parallel examination.
The audit has shown that the tax procedures for these selected transactions have now been completed. The respective tax administrations had taken appropriate measures to this end (including subsequent VAT determinations or the Prevention of input tax refunds).
3. Audit of selected, high-risk intra-community transactions
The audit also included highly risky intra-community transactions between EU taxpayers that were recorded in the Eurocanet System.
EUROCANET is used to identify risky taxpayers.
Member states may participate in this System on a voluntary basis.
CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET. Germany has a passive Status, i.e. it does not participate in the exchange of data within the framework of EUROCANET.
From the point of view of an active participating state, it is unsatisfactory that other member states refuse to participate actively.
As a result, no information could be obtained about which suppliers with German VAT ID would have been classified as high-risk cases.
The NKU found both normal transactions and those with suspected USt fraud, including carousel fraud, in the selected transactions.
The FA were only able to check high-risk sales to a limited extent. This was especially true for so-called "Missing Traders", whereby an examination of the documents alone is hardly enough to prove the taxable fraud.
In case of suspected carousel fraud in imports and exports
it is recommended that Customs and tax authorities cooperate more closely in order to be able to track the identity of the goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final customer.
Germany and a number of other countries have rejected an active participation in EUROCANET because they do not believe that there is a sufficient legal basis.
The German Federal Audit Office (Bundesrechnungshof) found that the German tax administration uses other instruments to identify high-risk taxpayers.
Nevertheless, there is a need for communication and exchange of experience between all EU member states.
The EU Council agreed on a draft regulation,
created by EUROFISC.
The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should be incorporated into the planned network for combating USt fraud.
4. mutual assistance in the recovery of claims
Intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims is subject to the same European legislation in all member states.
Therefore, requests for intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic and Germany are processed in the same way.
The Bundesrechnungshof and the NKU compared the statistics submitted by both member states to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.
These statistics contained discrepancies.
The two court of auditors consider a renewed discussion on the statistics at EU level to be useful in order to avoid any discrepancies that may still exist in the future.
If this is not done, the statistics cannot be used appropriately for comparisons.
In addition, the statistics should contain more information on VAT.
An analysis of detailed data can make it easier for the commission to support member states in their efforts to combat USt fraud.
Both courts of auditors believe that member states with a low recovery rate should strive to achieve at least the average recovery rate.
The commission should assist the member states in this, if so desired.
5. VAT testing in large companies
The court of auditors analysed the legal situation with regard to the VAT audit of large companies in both states.
In addition, they used a questionnaire to collect information from the tax authorities, which they considered important in this context.
It became clear that the Situation in both countries is different.
CZ has a system for the selection of high-risk cases that includes a large amount of relevant data (including information on VAT audits, balance sheet data and profit and loss statements).
Overall, the USt control can be effectively controlled and analyzed.
A special tax office for large companies is to be set up in 2012.
There is no comparable System in Germany. This complicates the control and analysis of the USt control as a whole.
The German tax administration focuses more on the selection of relevant individual cases and relies in particular on data from the USt pre-registrations or ust declarations and the ZM.
Various risk management components, which are to be improved, support the evaluation of this data.
3. Test procedure
3.1 examination procedure in the Czech Republic
Department II - state budget revenue and regional departments IX Pilsen, X České Budějovice, XIII Brno and XV Ostrava audited in the period from May 2009 to February 2010.

The Senate of the Czech court of auditors approved the audit findings on 27 April 2010.
3.2 examination procedure in Germany
The audit area traffic taxes and employees of the assigned PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt/Main and Munich examined from February 2009 to February 2010.
After selecting the sample cases, they announced the examination in several countries:
* Bavaria, * Hamburg, • Hesse, • North Rhine-Westphalia, * Saxony. They also conducted Interviews at the Federal Ministry of Finance.
Tax files from the following FA were included in the audit: • Erlangen, Central Tax Office Munich, Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Grafenau; * Hamburg-Nord, Hamburg-Hansa, special tax office Hamburg for large companies • * Wiesbaden I, Wiesbaden II, Darmstadt; • Essen-NordOst, FA Essen for tax audits of large companies and corporations, Lüdenscheid; * Chemnitz-Süd.
Discussions were also held with the FÄ Mühlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-Süd and the OFD Frankfurt/Main, Chemnitz and Münster.
The Federal Audit Office informed the Federal Ministry of Finance of the audit results in April 2010.
3.3 cooperation between the two courts of auditors
Prior to the parallel audit, the representatives of both audit courts met in September 2008 to discuss and define the audit topics.
In December 2008, the presidents of both courts signed the agreement on cooperation in parallel audit.
At a meeting in Bonn in June 2009, the examination teams learned about the first results obtained during the exam preparation, discussed possible examination approaches and agreed on the further procedure.
A second meeting took place from 2 to 4 December 2009 in Prague. 
The examination teams exchanged the examination findings gained up to that point and agreed on the schedule for the preparation of the joint examination report.
The two courts of auditors identified the following topics for their parallel audit • * evaluation of the recommendations made in the previous report; • review of selected cases of intra-community transactions between tax authorities from the Czech Republic and Germany that could not be fully clarified during the first parallel audit; • review of selected intra-community transactions between tax authorities from the Czech Republic and Germany classified as risky; • review of the procedures of the two tax administrations with regard to intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of VAT claims; • VAT audits for large companies.
The report on the results of the parallel audit was prepared during a working meeting in June 2010.
4. Audit of the administration of the VAT in selected areas
4.1 implementation of the recommendations from the first joint test
4.1.1 implementation of recommendations in the Czech Republic
Recommendation 1
Harmonisation of conditions for the registration of taxable persons within the EU supported
following the results of the first audit, the Czech court of auditors recommended to adapt the requirements for VAT registration and to introduce new rules for the cancellation of registration in the Czech Republic.
These amended rules should more effectively limit the risk of possible tax evasion.
In certain cases, it was found that FÄ did not delete the VAT registration of taxpayers who did not comply with their obligations under Czech Law No. 235/2004 (hereinafter referred to as the "VAT law").
So far, the Czech Ministry of Finance has not submitted an amendment to oblige FIES to cancel if taxpayers repeatedly do not submit VAT declarations.
Under the Czech VAT Act, the FA may ex officio delete the registration of a taxpayer if: (a) the taxpayer has not made any transactions for 12 consecutive months and has not informed the FA of the reasons for doing so; (B) the taxpayer has not fulfilled his obligations under the VAT Act; (C) the taxpayer no longer fulfils the requirements for tax liability.
The first examination revealed that due to the existing legal situation, Prague 1 must delete the VAT registration "foreign taxable person"3 with effect from 31 January of the following calendar year if they were not obliged to register and pay VAT in the current calendar year. 
The Prague 1 company often did not delete the VAT registration of these taxpayers because the relevant provision of the deadline could not be adequately implemented in practice.
The problem was solved by the amendment of the VAT Act, which came into force on 1 January 2009. 
Accordingly, the FA is authorised to delete the registration of a foreign taxpayer if the latter has not provided taxable or tax-exempt goods or services with a right to deduct input tax in the previous calendar year.
Recommendation 2
Monthly fee of the ZM
Due to the first audit, the audit courts had recommended the introduction of the monthly levy of ZM.
The council directive, which reduced the frequency of tax collection to one month, was implemented in the Czech Republic by the VAT Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010. 
The ZM must now be submitted electronically.
In addition, a ZM must be provided if services, the place of performance of which is to be determined in accordance with § 9 (1) VAT law, are provided for a person registered as liable to VAT in another member state.
The condition is that the recipient is obliged to declare and pay the VAT for these services. This obligation arises from council directive 2008/8/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC as regards the place of Service.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of the data of the USt pre-registrations and the ZM to increase the reliability of the MIAS data this recommendation related to the German financial administration.
In its system ATIS4, the Czech tax administration automatically compares the data on intra-community transactions from the VAT declarations and the CM.
Recommendation 4
Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level
The proper collection of VAT is an indispensable prerequisite for the smooth functioning of the EU internal market.
Therefore, the fight against USt fraud is of primary interest and has received considerable attention in recent years.
The significance of this is demonstrated, among other things, by a study published by the European Commission in October 2009.
In it, an external expert estimated the USt loss for the 25 member states in the period 2000 to 2006. After evaluation of the available data, the tax loss for the period mentioned was estimated at 90 to 113 billion euros. It was based on the fact that the EU-25 loses an average of 12% of their turnover taxes each year.
The estimated tax loss for the Czech Republic in 2006 was 18%.
The first audit found that a member state alone could not develop an effective risk management system (RMS).
Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each member state.
With regard to the RMS, the Czech court of Auditors has examined the system for the exchange of information within the EU (EUROCANET).
For this purpose, risk-bearing intra-community transactions exported by taxpayers within the EU and recorded in EUROCANET were selected (see Chapter 4.3).
The Eurofisc network aims to optimise administrative assistance in tax matters and combat VAT fraud more effectively. The cooperation of the competent authorities should be improved in order to detect fraud cases as early as possible.
Later, EUROFISC could be used as a tool to estimate the risk potential in intra-community transactions.
The ECOFIN Rat6 already approved EUROFISC on 7 October 2008 and at the same time adopted the principles for the functioning of the system. 
Eurocanet, developed by the Belgian tax administration in cooperation with the other member states and with the support of the European Commission and OLAF7, serves as a model for EUROFISC.
The purpose of the system is to detect risky sales and identify entrepreneurs involved in organized USt fraud.
4.1.2 implementation of recommendations in Germany
The evaluation of the recommendations from the first report led to the following findings:
Recommendation 1
Harmonisation of conditions for the registration of taxable persons within the EU
Based on a detailed questionnaire, the German tax administration has developed a well-functioning system for the registration of taxpayers.
The Federal Ministry of Finance presented this System to the commission in October 2007.
The System itself is constantly being improved.
The data provided in the questionnaire is now recorded electronically and will be available for later research. They are therefore part of the risk management during registration.
The commission had made a Proposal8 to amend regulation 1798/2003. This included common Standards for the registration and deletion of taxpayers.
The member states still needed clarification and clarification.
The Federal Audit Office had recommended to the Federal Ministry of finance not to fall behind the Standards already achieved.
Recommendation 2
Monthly fee of the ZM
On 8 April 2010, a Law9 implementing the EU directives into national law was adopted.
Among other things, it contains provisions on the monthly levy of the ZM for intra-community deliveries
and will enter into force on 1 July 2010.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of the data of the USt pre-registrations and the ZM for more reliable MIAS data and considerations on the consolidation of the previously separate procedures for the submission of the USt pre-registrations and the ZM
A joint federal-state working group has been established,
which has developed a concept for the Automatic Comparison of the data from the USt pre-registrations and the ZM.
The concept is still being discussed with the countries.
In addition, this working group dealt with a concept for optimising the control procedure for intra-community transactions.
Recommendation 4
Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level relevant information is exchanged at EU level.
Germany participates in the risk management platform.
The European Commission supported this Initiative and initiated the establishment of a risk management platform within the "Fiscalis 2006-2007"action plan by means of a written procedure dated 18 October 2006. 
The members of the platform addressed the following topics in 4 subgroups: • risk management tools • * influencing the behavior of taxpayers, • evaluation, • updating the risk management guide.
New reports of the subgroups "risk management instruments" and "update of the risk management guidelines" were published in early 2010.
4.1.3 evaluation
Registration
The question of the requirements for USt registration and its deletion in various countries was dealt with at EU level.
The draft amended council regulation 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of Value Added Tax and repealing regulation (EEC) 218/92 provides for the extension of current databases within the EU, including a database of VAT identification numbers.
This proposal also includes common Standards for the registration and deletion of taxpayers.
The questions of registration and deletion are subject to the national legislation of the EU member states until further notice.
The member states still needed clarification and clarification.
The Federal Audit Office had recommended to the Federal Ministry of finance not to fall behind the Standards already achieved.
The member states reached political agreement on the final version of the draft in ECOFIN on 8 June 2010. 
Common rules for the registration and deletion of taxpayers are no longer contained therein.
This segment ISIN tention ally left blank
The two courts of auditors regret this. They still consider such regulations important in order to prevent VAT fraud.
This segment ISIN tention ally left blank
Monthly fee of the ZM
With regard to international cooperation, as a result of the previous examination, it was recommended that all member states introduce the monthly tax of the CM in order to allow an earlier examination of the amounts of intra-community transactions.
Council Directive 2008/117 / EC amending Directive 2006/112 / EC on the common system of Value Added Tax for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-community transactions has reduced the frequency for the submission of the relevant CECs to one month.
In the Czech Republic, this requirement was implemented by the amendment to the VAT Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.
Germany did not implement the obligation to pay the monthly ZM levy until 1 July 2010 and thus not on time, while the CZ complied with the requirements of the EU.
Comparison of the data of the USt pre-registrations and the ZM for more reliable MIAS data and considerations on the consolidation of the previously separate procedures for the submission of the USt pre-registrations and the ZM
The German financial administration has taken up the recommendations of the Bundesrechnungshof and set up a working group to develop possible solutions.
The Federal Audit Office will monitor further developments.
Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level
Germany and the CZ use different approaches to identify entrepreneurs at risk.
The Czech court of auditors examined the application of the EUROCANET system in CZ (see section 4.3).
The Bundesrechnungshof focused on German participation in the risk management platform.
4.2 inspection of selected intra-community transactions
In the first examination, transactions were examined jointly for which there were doubts as to whether they had actually been carried out or where discrepancies had been found in the declarations of taxable persons in both member states.
The two courts of auditors selected nine cases of intra-community deliveries of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany for the audit, where the tax audit by the FA of the member state concerned had not been completed at the time of the previous joint audit.
1)
In the first quarter of 2005, a Czech taxpayer purchased goods worth 22 686 euros from a German taxpayer.
The Czech taxpayer did not declare the acquisition in his VAT declaration,since the German tax obligation in the period mentioned had no VAT identification number, but only a tax number for domestic sales.
Through international assistance under Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the competent Czech FA had received information that under German VAT law the supplier of intra-community goods does not need a VAT identification number in order to qualify for tax exemption for intra-community goods deliveries.
The audit by the Czech court of auditors revealed that - according to the audit by the competent Czech FA-the Czech taxpayer submitted an additional VAT declaration in which he declared the purchase of goods of the above value and at the same time asserted his right to deduct input tax in the same amount.
2)
In the fourth quarter of 2004, a Czech taxpayer is said to have purchased goods worth 12,561 euros from a German taxpayer.
However, he stated that he had not purchased the goods and therefore did not explain them in his USt statement.
Citing a provision of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the German tax administration refused to process the request because the turnover associated with the acquisition did not exceed the threshold of EUR 15 000.
Since the Czech FA could not obtain any documents, the tax audit was unsuccessful and the original tax assessment was passed.
The audit by the Czech court of auditors revealed that the Czech FA received two spontaneous reports from Germany in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, according to which the German taxpayer had invoiced the relevant delivery of goods to a Slovak addressee.
The Czech taxpayer acquired the goods from the Slovak taxpayer and indicated the acquisition in his regular VAT declaration for the month of October 2004.
3)
In the fourth quarter of 2004, a Czech taxpayer is said to have purchased a car worth 48,500 euros from a German taxpayer.
However, he did not declare any intra-community acquisition.
In addition, he had not made a USt declaration since August 2004. Therefore, the FA set the VAT for the quarter in question at CZK 0.
On the basis of information provided from Germany in the course of the international exchange of information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the FA requested the taxpayer to submit a subsequent tax return in March 2007, but the taxpayer refrained from doing so.
The audit found that the FA had carried out further audits in this tax case in 2007. It had established that the car in question had been sold by the taxpayer to a used car dealer in the Czech Republic.
The Czech FA carried out an assessment for the tax period December 2004, fixing additional taxes of CZK 295 379 for the purchase of goods from another member state and their resale.
The competent Czech court decided to open insolvency proceedings on the assets of the Czech taxpayer; an insolvency administrator was appointed.
In the absence of significant assets, the outstanding tax liability is likely to be irrecoverable.
4)
In the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, a Czech taxpayer is reported to have delivered new vehicles (passenger cars) with a total value of 198,167 euros to Germany.
In response to a request for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, it was stated that a tax criminal proceedings were pending against the German taxpayer in Germany.
The audit of the Bundesrechnungshof found that after the conclusion of the procedure there was evidence of involvement of the German taxpayer in fraud.
The intra-community acquisition of goods was subject to taxation of 182 424 euros (for 2004) and 369 690 euros (for 2005).
The audit by the Czech court of auditors revealed that the Czech taxpayer was involved in carousel fraud involving new vehicles.
On the basis of information from the German tax administration, a VAT audit of the Czech taxpayer took place for the tax periods April, May and June 2005.
Based on the audit findings and the information from the international exchange of information, the FA set additional VAT of CZK 703 031 for May 2005 and CZK 726 551 for June 2005.
5)
Czech taxpayer A is said to have purchased a machine with a total value of 58,000 euros from a German taxpayer in February 2005.
In the third quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer is said to have supplied Czech taxpayer B with a machine worth 88 027 euros. However, B denied the acquisition.
The audit by the Czech court of auditors revealed that B had acquired the machine from a German company with a branch in the Czech Republic.
Czech taxpayer A did not state the purchase of goods from the aforementioned German taxpayer in his VAT declaration.
The response of the German FA to a request for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 showed that the German taxpayer had not made an intra-community delivery of a machine worth 58 000 euros, but a delivery within the Czech Republic.
In the inspection, the German Federal Audit Office (Bundesrechnungshof) found that the intra-community delivery of the machine was classified as domestic delivery after completion of an audit and the exemption from VAT was subsequently refused.
6)
In the third quarter of 2004, a German taxpayer was reported to have delivered goods worth 11,600 euros to a Czech taxpayer.
The goods were acquired and later, i.e. in 2005, sold in Germany.
The audit carried out by the Czech court of auditors revealed that the Czech FA had made its assessment on the basis of a supplementary VAT declaration, which inadmissibly identified acquisitions from another member state, including those in the amount mentioned above.
The Bundesrechnungshof found that after receiving a reply to a request for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the German FA corrected the VAT declaration of the German taxpayer and fixed additional VAT of 1,600 euros.
Due to the resale of the goods in Germany and the corresponding VAT assessment there, an examination is ongoing.
The ZM of the German taxpayer has not yet been corrected, since in Germany only the taxpayer who has surrendered the ZM can also correct it.
7)
The competent Czech company received from the German tax administration a request for information pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 on the issue of the purchase of a car worth 47,400 euros by a Czech taxpayer in February 2005.
After an audit for the tax period 2005, the Czech FA determined the tax liability of the Czech taxpayer with CZK 0 and informed the German FA that it could not confirm the purchase of the car by the Czech taxpayer.
The audit by the Czech court of auditors revealed that the registration of the Czech VAT-payer had been cancelled because he had not fulfilled his tax obligations.
The Czech FA had forwarded the documents to the Czech police.
The German taxpayer has so far not corrected his information in the ZM, but has appealed against the tax notice.
8)
According to MIAS10, between the third quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, a German taxpayer delivered goods to a Czech taxpayer with a total value of 33,205 euros, which the latter did not declare as an intra-community acquisition.
In the audit of the Czech court of auditors, it was found that the Czech FA investigated the reasons for the discrepancies.
The Czech taxpayer repeatedly issued subsequent VAT declarations for the first quarter of 2005.
However, the Czech FA was unable to clarify the difference in the amount of CZK 134 273 acquired in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005. It justified this by the fact that sales for individual quarters could not be accurately attributed, and accepted the submitted VAT declarations.
9)
In the third quarter of 2004, a German taxpayer delivered goods worth 46 854 euros to a Czech taxpayer.
For the same period, the Czech taxpayer declared the intra-community acquisition of goods worth only 14 856 euros.
As part of the international exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the Czech FA checked the actual value of the delivery.
With the German response to this request, three invoices were sent showing a total value of the delivered goods of 31 998 euros, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech taxpayer and the MIAS data.
According to the results of the audit carried out by the Czech court of auditors, the Czech taxpayer submitted a subsequent VAT declaration for the July 2004 tax period in January 2007, following repeated reminders from the FA.
With this declaration, the taxpayer simultaneously asserted his right to deduct input tax. His tax liability for the relevant tax period therefore remained unchanged.
The audit confirmed that most of the tax procedures relating to the transactions selected for the audit had been completed and that the tax authorities in the Czech Republic and Germany had taken appropriate measures (including subsequent VAT fixing or prevention of VAT refunds).
4.3 examination of selected cases of risky intra-community transactions
4.3.1 findings in the Czech Republic
EUROCANET can be a significant source of information to identify high-risk taxpayers in the member state of acquisition.
In the CZ, the early warning information obtained from EUROCANET is checked by the competent FA with the acquirers.
Since the first quarter of 2008, CZ has introduced information on sales and taxable suppliers deemed to be at risk into the Eurocanet System.
Nine Czech taxpayers were selected for the audit,
which had been entered into the EUROCANET by the financial administrations of other member states either as suppliers or purchasers.
This segment ISIN tention ally left blank
Since the German tax administration did not participate in the data exchange via EUROCANET, it could not be determined whether suppliers with a German VAT identification number were classified as risky by the German tax administration.
During the audit, both normal business transactions and those suspected of carousel fraud or other USt fraud were detected.
In these cases, the FA exchanged information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003,
E. G.:
* The FA did not detect any suspicion of risky sales during the examination of the early warning information.
The relevant taxpayers were constantly monitored because their data was stored in EUROCANET.
* During the verification of risky transactions, FAs were unable to prove, on the basis of the accounting documents submitted, violations of the rules on the calculation of the tax base and the VAT, although they found discrepancies in the Transport and storage of the goods or uncovered business relationships with letterbox companies from other member states.
* The review of individual transactions was complicated because certain taxpayers did not cooperate with the FAS and could not be contacted.
The competent FA reviewed most of the risky taxpayers and transactions mentioned in Eurocanet's early warning reports.
However, your options for checking risky sales, especially so-called "Missing Traders", are limited.
In particular, a mere examination of the documents can hardly prove that the taxpayer acted fraudulently.
Stricter requirements for the registration of taxpayers for USt purposes and greater flexibility in deleting registrations would be helpful to combat USt fraud.
Taxpayers involved in fraudulent merry-go-round transactions can be registered for VAT purposes in order to fake fictitious deliveries of goods throughout the EU or to issue formally correct tax documents to other taxpayers, with which they can then assert unjustified claims for deduction of input tax.
In case of suspected carousel fraud in connection with imports and exports, it is recommended that Customs and tax authorities cooperate more closely in order to be able to track the identity of the goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final customer.
Member states may participate in EUROCANET on a voluntary basis.
The fact that three large member states (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not participate was seen by the European Parliament at the end of 200811 as a weakness of the system, which should be remedied by setting up a eurofisc network with mandatory participation.
4.3.2 findings in Germany
The Federal Audit Office evaluated data available at the federal Central Tax Office, including data from EUROCANET.
They served as the basis for the selection of six German Taxpayers whose files were reviewed.
Both Germany and a number of other countries refused to actively participate in EUROCANET.
That is why Germany has a passive Status, i.e. it does not send data to Brussels itself, but is only the recipient of EUROCANET data.
This is justified by the fact that "from the point of view of the Federal government
no unquestionable legal basis [exists] that would allow the existing tax secrecy in Germany to be broken.
In addition, the federal government does not have reliable information on how information sent by the Member States is processed within the framework of EUROCANET.“12 since October 2007, the federal Central Tax Office has been evaluating the EUROCANET data and transmitting them to the federal and state tax authorities on the basis of a coordinated procedure.
The German Faes receive control notifications about the direct business relationships recorded in EUROCANET between the taxpayers registered with them and companies from other EU countries.
However, the respective German FA does not receive any information as to whether the company from the aforementioned other EU member state has business relations with a company resident in another member state which is also in business relations with the German company from the control notification.
4.3.3 evaluation
CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has only a passive Status.
From the point of view of an active participant, it is unsatisfactory that other member states refuse active participation.
Accordingly, the examination had to be carried out differently in this area.
However, significant differences in the success of the detection of VAT fraud could not be determined. The reason for this is that EUROCANET is only one component of the risk management system.
However, the financial administrations of both countries have a variety of other instruments at their disposal to detect fraudulent transactions. Nevertheless, it is necessary to develop a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.
The Council of the European Union agreed on a draft Regulation13 which created EUROFISC, a network for combating VAT fraud.
The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should be shared by the member states at European level and incorporated into this network.
This segment ISIN tention ally left blank
The cases brought to court at national and European level show that there is a need for discussion between the member states and the commission on the conditions for tax exemption for intra-community transactions.
4.4 mutual assistance in the recovery of claims
4.4.1 intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic
The legislation on intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of certain claims in the EU is essentially based on:
Council Directive 76/308 / EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to measures forming part of the system of financing the European agricultural guidance and guarantee fund, and of levies and customs duties;
Council Directive 2001/44 / EC amending Council Directive 76/308 / EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to measures forming part of the system of financing the European agricultural guidance and guarantee fund, as well as levies and customs duties and VAT and certain excise duties; and
Commission directive 2002/94 / EC laying down detailed implementing rules for certain articles of Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to certain taxes, duties, taxes and other measures.
CZ implemented Council Directive 76/308/EEC by Law No. 252/2000 on intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of certain claims.
After the adoption of council directive 2001/44 / EC, this too had to be transposed into Czech law. At the same time, an amendment to the aforementioned law was required.
In this context, legislative amendment No. 191/2004 concerning intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of certain claims was adopted.
A new relevant legislation was adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) no 1179/2008 of 28 November 2008. 
The annexes to this regulation contain new application forms to be used from 1 January 2009.  Furthermore, the regulation makes electronic transmission mandatory and obliges the requesting authority to certify that all documents sent are in conformity with the respective Original.
Essential principles of international administrative assistance for the recovery of claims are:
1. It is the principle of reciprocity applies ;
2. Mutual Assistance shall only be provided upon request and upon fulfilment of all requirements;
3. Administrative Assistance does not extend to claims that are considered a criminal sanction in the requested state;
4. The procedure of the inter-governmental mutual assistance for the recovery of the receivables must be carried out in accordance with the national law of the requested state ;
5. In the recovery process foreign claims do not have priority over domestic claims;
6. The assistance will only be provided for the recovery of indisputable claims ;
7.the principle of exhaustion shall apply: the requesting state shall use all means available to it under national law to recover the claim.
Law No. 191/2004 provides for three forms of administrative assistance: provision of Information, Notification of legal acts and actual recovery.
Procedure for outgoing requests to other EU member states
The competent FA shall transmit the request for information, the request for notification of legal acts or the request for recovery together with the relevant documents electronically to the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic via the relevant financial Directorate.
The Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic shall arrange for the translation of the request into the relevant language, scan it with all attachments and transmit it to the competent tax authority of the state concerned via the communication network or the common interface CCN/CSI.
A request for recovery assistance must meet the following requirement: the claim must exceed 1,500 euros and must not be older than five years.
The requested authority may refuse recovery if the requirements are not met.
Procedure for incoming requests from other member states
The Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic must confirm receipt of requests from other member states as soon as possible and within seven days at the latest.
If it decides not to grant the request, it shall inform the requesting authority of the reasons for the refusal, indicating the specific provisions of the directive on which it is based.
The corresponding notification shall be sent no later than three months after the date of receipt of the acknowledgement of receipt of the request.
Upon receipt of the request, the Ministry of finance checks whether the request meets all legal requirements.
It shall then forward the request to the competent FA via the relevant financial Directorate. If the request for recovery is granted, the FA shall, among other things, determine the debtor's financial situation, e.g. by extracts from the land register, inquiring about existing bank accounts and registering cars with the registration office.
After six months from the date of receipt of the confirmation of receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic shall inform the requesting authority of the result of the investigations carried out.
The requesting authority must also be informed if the relevant taxpayers are not available and the claim cannot therefore be recovered.
All sums successfully recovered must be transferred to the requesting authority within one month of recovery.
The Czech FA dealing with recovery May, with the consent of the requesting state, agree on the demand for hours or instalments.
Interest or surcharges imposed on the debtor for the period of delay pursuant to Act No. 337/1992 on the management of taxes and fees
to the requesting state.
In particular, in 2006 and 2007, the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic delayed sending the recovery requests to the competent FA.
The same applied to the forwarding of requests for recovery made by the Czech FA to the competent authority in the requested state.
The audit revealed that the Ministry of Finance has violated the law on intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of claims. It had failed to inform the Competent Authority of the requesting member state of the status of the recovery procedure within six months of confirmation of receipt of the request.
The Situation has improved since 2008.
Statistical Data
Pursuant to Section 13 (4) of law 191/2004, the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic produces statistics for the European Commission by 15 March of each year.  This contains the number of requests for Information, Notification of legal acts and recovery, including the amount of the respective claims, submitted in the previous year and received.
On the basis of the data provided by the member states, the European Commission shall draw up its report to the council and the European Parliament on the application of the provisions on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims.
The audit revealed that in 2008 the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic reported the claims to be 5 250 000 Euros too low. The reason for this was the incorrect indication of the amount of a VAT claim submitted in 2008 (caused by the postponement of a decimal point in the conversion of the claim from Czech crowns into euros).
The error was subsequently reflected in the statistics of the European Commission.
Information on mutual recovery assistance is shown in the table below.
4.4.2 intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in Germany
The legal basis for intergovernmental assistance in tax matters is council directive 2008/55/EC of 26 May 2008 (EC recovery directive)14 and Commission Regulation (EC) no 1178/2008 of 28 November 2008 (EC implementing directive).
In order to improve readability and clarity, the EC recovery directive codified Council Directive 76/308/EEC of 15 March 197616, the provisions of which had been substantially amended several times. 
Among other things, it regulates the recovery of VAT and taxes on income and assets, including The Associated interest, fees and late payment surcharges.
The EC recovery directive was transposed into German law by the Recovery Act (eg)17 of 3 May 2003. 
The enforcement procedure in Germany is regulated in the tax code (AO).
 Section 117 (2) AO provides that the tax authorities may provide intergovernmental legal and administrative assistance by virtue of international treaties and legal norms of the European Communities applicable in national law and by virtue of the EC Mutual Assistance Act.
Part Six of the AO (§§ 249-346) contains the legal provisions for the enforcement procedure.
The administrative actions of the tax authorities are governed in particular by the enforcement and enforcement instructions.
The Federal Ministry of Finance agreed with the representatives of the highest tax authorities of the Länder on the principles of administrative assistance in tax matters and transferred its own responsibility in this area to the federal Central Office for Taxes18.
General conditions for the admissibility of a request for recovery assistance are::
* The legal requirements must be fulfilled (§§251, 254 AO).
* All recovery funds available in the country have been exhausted.
* The claims for which mutual assistance is requested are undisputed.
* The period between the issue of the enforcement title or the date on which the claim or title became undisputed and the date of the request shall not exceed five years.
* The claim must be at least 1 500 euros.
Procedure for outgoing requests to other EU member states the German requests for recovery of back taxes are forwarded by the enforcement authorities of the FA through the competent central authority and the federal Central Tax Office to the foreign authority concerned, e.g. the Czech CLO.
The details are set out in the Information Sheet on intergovernmental assistance in tax collection (recovery) of 19 January 200419. 
This leaflet is currently being revised by a federal-state Working Group and adapted to the new recovery directive.
The request, together with annexes, is forwarded electronically by the FA to the central authority.
The latter checks whether it is correct in terms of content and form.
If not, the request will be returned to the relevant FA.
Otherwise, it will be forwarded to the federal Central Tax Office.
The federal Central Tax Office then takes over the necessary communication with the foreign authority concerned.
Procedure for incoming requests from other EU member states
Recovery requests from other member states are recorded in the federal Central Tax Office, which sends a confirmation of receipt within ten days.
It also checks whether the formal requirements are met.
In principle, the federal Central Tax Office forwards these requests to the central authority, which forwards them to the FA concerned and monitors the execution.
The federal Central Tax Office also sends interim or final reports.
If the processing of a request takes longer than six months, it shall remind the agency of the obligation to submit an interim report in accordance with Article 16 of Commission directive 2002/94/EC.
After examination of the formal and substantive requirements for the admissibility of the request, the enforcement authorities shall announce relevant measures.
All amounts recovered must be transferred to the bank account specified in the request within one month of their receipt.
Statistical Data
Information on mutual recovery assistance between Germany and the Czech Republic for the years 2006 to 2008 (as of December 31, 2008).
4.4.3 examination of selected enforcement cases
A total of 21 intergovernmental requests for recovery between the Czech Republic and Germany were selected for the examination. Ten cases are listed below in which, inter alia:
The following has been determined:
1.
On 20 October 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German request for recovery of VAT debts of a Czech taxpayer from 2004 and 2005 in the total amount of 3 883 euros (109 820 CZK).
Only on February 26, 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the competent FA.
In order to secure the claim to be recovered, the Czech FA charged a property belonging to the taxpayer with a lien.
Since the encumbered land was not sufficient to pay the entire tax debt, an instalment payment agreement of at least CZK 2,000 per month was made with the debtor.
An interim report was sent to the German FA on August 31, 2009.  As a result, the taxpayer had meanwhile paid tax debts of CZK 49 600 (as of August 25, 2009).
The amount was transferred to Germany. Shortly thereafter, on August 28, 2009, a further CZK 3,000 was transferred.
2.
On 7 January 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for recovery of tax debts (VAT, income tax) as well as interest and fees of a Czech taxpayer amounting to a total of 180 869 euros (= CZK 4 434 915).
It was only on 27 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the competent FA. 
After checking the bank balance, securities, real estate, motor vehicles, and other movable property, the FA determined that the debtor did not have pledgable assets.
Local investigations also revealed that the debtor had been absent from his permanent residence for almost a year.
His whereabouts in CZ were unknown.
The Czech Ministry of Finance received this notification on 6 April 2009 and forwarded it to the German Finance Administration on 16 April 2009. 
3.
On 21 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for VAT plus interest and fees totalling EUR 3 139 (= CZK 84 846).
It was not until 6 August 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the competent FA. On 18 February 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance was informed from Germany that the Czech tax debtor had paid the debt in the meantime.
On 9 December 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance informed the Czech FA that the case was closed because the Czech tax debtor had fully paid his debt in Germany.
However, the debt was also settled in the Czech Republic under the recovery procedure and the corresponding amount was transferred to Germany on 27 October 2008.
Due to the long time required by the Czech Ministry of finance to forward the Information to the FA, the tax debt was paid twice - by the taxpayer himself in Germany and by means of recovery by the competent Czech FA.
In cooperation with the Federal Audit Office, it has been determined that the amount recovered will be offset against the tax liability from another procedure, which amounts to 6 649 euros and should be transferred to the CZ in September 2008.
In the documents of the Czech Ministry of finance, there was only a request for recovery of EUR 3 139 for the company in question. The recovery request in the amount of 6 649 Euro was not to be found there.
4.
On 15 September 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for income tax, VAT, interest and fees totalling 39 957 euros = 956 654 CZK.
Only on 19 December 2008 did the Czech Ministry of Finance forward the recovery request to the competent FA.
The recovery procedure was initiated on 1 June 2009. A decision was taken to seize the Czech bank balance and the debtor's salary (CZK 7 000).
During the negotiations with the FA, the debtor did not agree with the amount of the tax liability and the amount was disputed.
According to the Czech FA, the debtor had been willing to pay 250 euros per month in the past, but the responsible German FA did not agree with this.
The taxpayer agreed to discuss his matter with the German FA in order to agree on a different amount.
The recovery procedure was not yet completed at the time of the audit by the Czech court of auditors.
5.
On 19 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for income tax in 2005 and VAT for the years 2003 to 2007 together with interest and fees amounting to a total of 113 444 euros = 3 116 304 CZK.
Only on November 14, 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request for recovery to Prague 1, which is authorised to deal with tax cases of non-resident taxpayers; a locally competent FA could not be determined on the basis of the available address.
During its investigation, the FA received information and documents on September 19th, 2008, stating that the debtor's income was 4,704 euros. However, it could not issue an enforcement order because the request for recovery had been received after that date.
On 26 January 2009, the Czech FA initiated the recovery procedure and issued an enforcement order for the seizure of the debtor's assets with credit institutions.
The recovery procedure was not yet completed at the time of the audit by the Czech court of auditors.
6.
On 3 October 2006, the competent Czech FA requested inter-state assistance in the recovery of a VAT debt together with procedural costs amounting to a total of CZK 146 223 742.
Only on 13 May 2008 did the Czech Ministry of Finance forward the recovery request to the German financial administration.
On 8 September 2008, the competent German FA, through the Bundesbank, transferred to the Czech authorities the amount of 17,700 euros = 439 226 CZK recovered through account attachment.
A conversion error was discovered when checking the amounts recovered.
The amount to be recovered was 146 223 742 CZK converted at the exchange rate of 1 euro = 25.065 CZK, but due to a comma error the amount was 583 378 Euro.
The correct amount to be recovered was 5 833 782 euros.
As a result, a recovery request was submitted that was 5 250 404 euros too low.
7.
On 1 March 2007, the competent Czech FA requested recovery of a VAT debt together with interest and fees of a Czech taxpayer amounting to a total of CZK 1,970,632 = EUR 79,847.
Only on 10 November 2008 did the Czech Ministry of Finance forward the recovery request to the German financial administration.
The German FA asked the debtor to pay the arrears on February 4, 2009.
Taking into account the significant reduction in the company's sales in the second half of 2008 and in particular in the first half of 2009, as well as the corresponding liquidity situation, the following payments were made to settle the overdue tax debt. On 8 April 2009 - 4 600 euros, on 6 May 2009 -3 000 euros and on 16 June 2009 - 2 500 euros. 
These payments were transferred to the account of the competent FA in the Czech Republic.
On June 23, 2009, a further payment of 2,500 euros was agreed between the debtor and the FA until June 30, 2009. 
8.
On 22 May 2008, the Czech FA requested recovery of tax debts totalling 398 653 euros = CZK 9 832 779, which included property transfer tax.
Only on 2 October 2008 did the Czech Ministry of Finance forward the recovery request to the German financial administration.
In a letter dated 3 April 2009 from the German tax administration to the Czech Ministry of finance, the request was returned. 
The German tax administration reasoned that the real estate transfer tax was not a tax within the meaning of Article 2 (e), (f), (g) and (h) of Directive 2008/55/EC.
In addition, Article 2 (g) concerns liabilities arising from taxes on income and property.
Accordingly, Article 3 of Directive 2008/55 / EC applies to taxes on income and property not mentioned in Article 1, paragraphs 3 and 4 of Directive 77/799/EEC.
The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed that a new request for recovery be sent to the German tax administration, which should no longer include the property transfer tax arrears in the amount of CZK 61 759, but instead the arrears in VAT, corporation tax and income tax.
The Czech Ministry of Finance received a new request from the competent FA for recovery of tax debts of the same taxpayer in the amount of CZK 7 079 735.
9.
On 6 February 2006, the Czech FA sent the Czech Ministry of finance a request for recovery of income tax and VAT totalling CZK 3 445 782 = 123 328 euros.
The VAT debt was 1 133 967 CZK.
Only on 18 April 2007 the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German financial administration
and it was only on 11 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded to the Czech FA the response of the German Finance Administration of 9 July 2007,
according to which the German FA had issued an enforcement order for the seizure of the bank account on 11 June 2007.  The Bank stated that it was not in business relations with the named taxpayer.
The request was therefore deemed to have been settled for the German financial administration.
10.
On 26 September 2005, the Czech FA sent the Czech Ministry of finance a request for recovery of VAT debts totalling CZK 1,296,845 = 43,591 euros.
The competent Finance Directorate sent the request to the Ministry of Finance on 10 October 2005. 
The Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request to the German Finance Administration on 15 December 2005. 
Before submitting the request, the Czech FA executed the tax claim by seizing the bank accounts and salary seizing as well as by encumbering a property.
Prior to the request for recovery, a request for information was submitted to the German tax administration on 16 March 2005. 
According to a reply to the Czech FA dated September 16, 2005, the Czech taxpayer was resident in Germany and had income from non-self-employment amounting to 8,437 euros.  On 20 April 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a response to the recovery request and only forwarded it to the relevant Czech FA on 12 February 2008. 
According to this, the tax debt in Germany is irrecoverable due to the debtor's insolvency.
No property had been determined, the income from non-self-employment was already subject to other enforcement measures.
The German financial administration thus considered the request to be settled.
4.4.4 comparison and evaluation
In the case of recovery, the requirements of EU law apply to all EU member states for intergovernmental assistance.
The procedures for processing requests are therefore similar in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The Federal Court of justice and the NKÚ have compared the statistics submitted by the two member states to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.
There were discrepancies.
In its 200620 report, the European Commission recommended that member states take greater care in compiling their statistics.
In 200921, the commission came to the conclusion that, despite a greater number of requests for assistance, the discrepancies in the statistics had become less pronounced.
Both courts of auditors consider a renewed discussion at EU level on the statistics to be useful, so that the remaining disagreements can be avoided in the future.
If this does not happen, the statistics are conditionally meaningful and cannot be used for comparisons.
In addition, the court of auditors considers that the statistics should show both the annual number of requests and the type of claims (e.g. VAT, income tax) and the amount of amounts recovered per member state.
By analysing more closely the statistics presented by the member states, the commission could help member states to assess their measures to combat VAT fraud.
Since the recovery rate can be calculated per member state, the court of auditors advocates that member states with a low rate should aim at at least the average recovery rate within the EU.
At the request of a member state, the commission could play an active role in this.
The foreign recovery requests received by the Ministry of Finance CZ were forwarded to the competent FAS with delay, especially in 2006 and 2007.
The same applies to the recovery requests submitted by the Czech FA.
The audit showed that the Czech Ministry of Finance violated law no. 191/2004 on inter-state recovery assistance in so far as it did not inform the Competent Authority of the requesting member state of the progress of recovery measures within the six-month period following receipt of the request.
4.5 VAT verification at large companies
4.5.1 VAT audit at large companies in the Czech Republic
General
The tax procedure for large companies is subject to the same rules that apply to other taxpayers.
The audit of large companies is regulated in Czech Law No. 337/1992, the "tax and Fee Administration Act".
The Czech Ministry of Finance defines large enterprises as natural persons who have set up a business or legal persons who have been set up to carry out a business and whose net turnover for the tax period concerned is at least CZK 2 billion according to income tax returns or corporate tax returns.
The Taxable Person is classified as a large company on the basis of the turnover according to income or corporate tax return in the respective tax period; for the first time for the year 2003. 
A natural or legal person will no longer be run as a large business for the purposes of VAT if, in three consecutive Tax Periods, its net turnover during the tax period is less than CZK 2 billion. The period begins at the end of the tax period for which, according to the tax return, the conditions were fulfilled for the first time. 
A taxpayer can only be removed from the list of large companies if at least one type of tax has been previously checked for a tax period.
By the end of 2009, all large companies had been audited at least every five years.
Since 2010, taxpayers have to be assessed in writing at least every two years. The subsequent control measures are intended to eliminate the tax risks and their negative effects on the proper tax determination and collection.
The Fä audits should focus on at least one type of tax; they usually cover several tax periods.
The large companies subject to tax were audited by the special audit bodies or audit services of the competent FA, which were set up for a total of 13 FA.
A special audit body carried out audits in its local area of responsibility in accordance with the specifications of the head of the financial Directorate.
In addition, it also tested
Taxpayers with unusual and special business activities; and
those whose examination required a high degree of expertise and time.
Taxpayers with complex location distribution and organizational structure are also examined,
Taxpayers suspected of large-scale tax evasion
as well as taxpayers belonging to chains and networks suspected of extensive tax evasion and unjustified deduction of input tax.
Information on the number of tests carried out by the special examination bodies of the FA and the additional tax results of these tests are shown in Table No. 3.
The Czech Ministry of Finance has submitted a proposal to amend Law No. 531/1990 for the regional tax authorities. In particular, the establishment of a special tax office with nationwide jurisdiction for selected taxpayers (legal entities established for the purpose of economic activity, with a turnover of at least € 1 million) will be considered. 2 billion CZK).
4.5.2 VAT audit at large companies in Germany
General
The VAT audit of large companies is not particularly regulated in Germany. The general regulations • of the Tax Ordinance (AO), • of the Finance Administration Act (fvg) and • of the audit regulations (BPO) apply to audits.
There are also work aids.
Tax regulations
The provisions of § § 193 to 203 AO "Section 4-external audit" contain in particular rules for the admissibility of an external audit and its scope, allocation of responsibilities, Form and content of the audit notice, audit principles, obligations of the taxpayer to cooperate and requirements for final discussions as well as for the transmission of the audit report.
External audits are carried out by the competent FA (§ 195 AO).
Financial Administration Act according to § 5 Paragraph 1 No. 1 in conjunction with § 19, it is the responsibility of the federal Central Tax Office to participate in external audits of the FÄ.
The nature and scope of this cooperation shall be agreed between the authorities involved.
In addition, the federal Central Tax Office may require that certain companies it designates be audited at a certain time.
In this case, it may lay down rules for the external audit of these taxpayers.
Audit regulations in accordance with Article 108 paragraph 7 GG, the audit regulations (BPO 2000) were adopted with the approval of the Federal Council.
It applies to external audits of the state financial authorities and the federal Central Tax Office.
According to § 3 BpO, companies are regularly classified in size classes.
Large companies are to be subjected to a connection test (Section 5). 4.2 BpO).
Pursuant to Section 33.1 BpO, each competent tax authority is required to keep a group directory within the meaning of the regulation.
Working aids for the administration
In addition, the following work aids were issued for the administration:
* "Uniform Manual for the USt special examination“;
* VAT-countries - online USLO (=dialogue system in the intra-community VAT control procedure) with instructions on the use of the data contained in the MIAS on intra-community business relations;
* Work aids for difficult and special situations.
* Central database for the storage and evaluation of VAT fraud cases and development of risk profiles-spells;
Taxpayers are classified in size classes. These are based on criteria such as turnover and profit, although the limits vary depending on the branch of business.
The Figures are published by the Federal Ministry of Finance.
The values are reviewed every three years and determined for the following three years.
The number of companies - not only large companies - is to be determined regularly (last reporting date: 1 January 2010).
In general, large companies are to be checked without gaps.
The examinations are announced and usually also extend to the USt,
this means that the examination covers all relevant taxes, namely income tax, corporation tax, commercial tax and VAT.
The value added tax can be checked either by auditors or VAT special auditors.
The practice is different and depends on the administrative structure of the individual countries.
The number of tax periods covered by an audit usually varies between three and five years.
The BPO 2000 assumes three years.
All taxes to which a company has been assessed are subject to audit.
4.5.3 management of the VAT audit at large companies
According to the agreement, both audit courts did not examine individual cases. They investigated the question of how the tax authorities proceed with the VAT audit of large companies.
With the help of a questionnaire, they collected information from the tax authorities that is essential for the audit of large companies.
* Which statistical records and evaluations for VAT audit of large companies are available to the management of the tax administration?
Especially:
* Are there Statistics or records on the extent to which a distinction is made between VAT fraud prevention and general VAT audit?
CZ: no, the current version of the ATIS system does not allow such a distinction.
Germany: the tax administration does not distinguish between audits to combat VAT fraud and general VAT audits.
* Are there Statistics or records of the timeliness of exams?
CZ: information on the timeliness of audits of intra-community acquisitions of selected VAT-payers is recorded in the ATIS System;
the same applies to information about the beginning and end of the examination of the company.
Germany: no, the statistics for auditors summarized at federal level only contain information about the so-called average last audit period (year).
This figure does not give an overview of the audit periods selected for individual companies.
VAT special auditors focus on the last VAT assessment periods and are also authorised to audit large companies.
The statistics for VAT special auditors kept at federal level do not contain information on the size class of the audited company.
* Are there Statistics or records of the type of surplus result; e.g. divided by:
i. real surplus result (e.g. application of a reduced rate instead of the general VAT rate)
II. incorrect surplus result (e.g. relocation/postponement of a matter not to be objected to under VAT law to another tax period)
III. Cash effectivity (payment of the set more income)
CZ:
The Czech Tax Administration monitors the number of tax audits carried out, the amount of tax surplus broken down by type of tax, the number of audited taxpayers and the number of audited tax periods.
Other tax procedures (on-site investigations, Dunning procedures) are monitored in the same way.
Regardless of this, the amount of additional payments and incoming payments are recorded.
Statistics on tax liabilities are broken down by type of tax. However, there is no distinction between tax debts incurred as a result of a tax return and those arising from audit procedures of the FA.
Germany: no, the statistics compiled at federal level for auditors and VAT special auditors do not distinguish according to the above criteria.
Most tax authorities, where local surveys were carried out, did not differentiate in this respect either.
* Are Exam fields with results recorded?
CZ: yes, the FA can select examination cases on the basis of criteria linked to selected indicators stored in the ATIS System.
Germany: There are no regulations at the Federal level.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at federal level for auditors and VAT special auditors do not provide such information.
However, the federal and state finance ministries have agreed on a common approach.
Accordingly, auditors and tax investigators of the Länder have to enter the additional tax result they have achieved when a certain threshold value is exceeded in ZAUBER.
In this case, additional information must be provided, e.g. on the origin of the VAT surplus.
* Which are the most common findings?
CZ:
- Large taxable companies have unjustifiably claimed input tax deduction for purchased supplies and services,
* which were not used for an entrepreneurial activity according to § 72 (1) CZ UStG;
* which were used for representation expenses in accordance with § 75 (3) CZ UStG;
* due to invoices that do not comply with the requirements of § 73 (1) CZ UStG
- large companies subject to tax have failed to register the VAT to be paid as provided for in § 21 (1) CZ UStG.
Germany: There are no regulations at the Federal level.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at federal level for auditors and VAT special auditors do not provide such information.
Findings on VAT from audits of large companies are not recorded separately by the countries.
However, the federal Central Tax Office can evaluate the ZAUBER database, in which auditors and tax investigators of the Länder have to enter the additional tax result they have achieved if a certain threshold is exceeded.
* Does the financial administration analyse audit fields with significant results and draw conclusions for Strategic Management?
CZ: yes, for example, nationwide inspections are carried out with regard to risky goods and industries.
Germany: There are no regulations at the Federal level.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at federal level for auditors and VAT special auditors do not provide any information about particularly "productive" audit fields.
With regard to the analysis of such information, the usefulness and the way in which it was further used, there were different views among the survey bodies.
Some financial directorates provide such information to FAs, but FAs are free to use it or not.
4.5.4 comparison and evaluation
As a result, large amounts of information are processed automatically in the CZ. Among other things, data from VAT audits, as well as key figures from balance sheets, profit and loss accounts are processed in the System.
CZ is able to control the selection of high-risk cases based on a wide range of information.
The same applies to the evaluation and Management of VAT audits in general.
In the Czech Republic, the establishment of a special tax office for large enterprises is planned for 2012.
In Germany, the financial administration does not collect comparable amounts of data.
Accordingly, it is more difficult to fulfill these tasks in the same way.
The emphasis is more on the selection of relevant individual cases.
This segment ISIN tention ally left blank
On the basis of the information in USt pre-registrations or ust declarations as well as audit instructions, qualified auditors select the cases to be examined and ensure the correct taxation.
Appropriate management processes and risk management systems should be introduced to reduce revenue shortfalls at VAT and at the same time increase the risk of discovery for unreliable entrepreneurs.

5. Conclusions
The cooperation between the two courts of Auditors has proved its worth.
In this way, it was possible to gain necessary insights into the systems used in both countries: this concerns in particular: • intra-Community Sales, • Risk Management at USt in particular with regard to the selection of risky sales, • recovery of UST claims and • USt audit of large companies.
The audit revealed differences in the strategies for detecting USt fraud and in the systems described above.
These findings can be used to improve existing procedures.
They can also be used to initiate a discussion among interested parties about which audit approaches and strategies can be used to combat fraud. This applies, for example, to the relationship within and between the member states and the EU Commission.
The experience and knowledge gained should encourage us to continue to jointly examine the administration of the USt in the future.
6. Communique
The report was drawn up in Czech, English and German and signed by the presidents of the Czech court of auditors and the Federal Court of auditors.
Status of Information: June 2010.
