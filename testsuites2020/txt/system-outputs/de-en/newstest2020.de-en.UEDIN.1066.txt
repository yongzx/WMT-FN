Joint report on parallel audits of expenditure on the construction of the Prague – Dresden motorway Preliminary remark Without trans-European motorways, the modern, united Europe could only cope with the high volume of traffic between the partner countries with considerable restrictions and quality losses.

High-quality transport networks are essential for maintaining and increasing living standards in Europe.
Ensuring fast, safe, reliable and economic passenger and freight transport is an important task for the state.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
It requires a high degree of organizational, technical and financial effort.
The establishment and development of a sustainable European transport infrastructure often requires difficult compromises with European and national policy objectives, such as the preservation of the environment.
It is precisely because of the necessary environmental protection measures that the construction of the transport infrastructure is time-consuming.
When planning and awarding the construction of transport routes, administrations can, through careful action and decision-making, save considerable financial resources and use them for other useful purposes.
One of the tasks of state auditing authorities is to identify defects that stand in the way of optimum cost-effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and effectiveness in spending on the construction of transport facilities.
The audit authorities should not only draw the attention of administrations to the shortcomings that have been identified, but also propose improvements for the benefit of citizens and for the benefit of Europe.
Summary
In 2005 and 2006, the two Supreme Audit Institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic, the Bundesrechnungshof (BRH) and the Nejvyi kontrolnad (NK), carried out parallel audits of the expenditure for the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway (motorway D 8 in the Czech Republic and motorway A 17 in the Federal Republic of Germany).
The two motorways are connected by a border bridge jointly financed by both states.
The co-operation with the NKE enabled the BRH to carry out an in-depth assessment of the cost-effectiveness of the use of funds in the construction of the border bridge.
In the course of the cooperation with the BRH, the NKx received data from German bridges and tunnels for its own cost comparisons.
In 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany signed a contract for the construction of the border bridge.
In line with the planning progress, the date of completion was finally set for the end of 2006.
During the award procedure, however, the Road and Highway Directorate of the Czech Republic (RMD) made mistakes that delayed the procedure and shortened the available construction time.
The contract with the contractor was therefore concluded later than planned.
The contractor secured the accelerated construction of the bridge until the end of 2006.
For this, however, the RMD had to accept considerable additional costs.
As part of the joint audit activity, the prices of motorway bridges on the D 8 and the A 17 were compared. The benchmark for the price comparison of the bridges was the size of the bridge area.
A price analysis using statistical methods identified bridges with high costs per square meter.
The analysis showed that the border bridge under the large bridges with lengths of over 100 m was the most expensive.
This was also due to the increase in prices as a result of delays in awarding contracts.
The comparison of the prices of the tunnels showed that the prices of the tunnels in the course of the D 8 are considerably higher than the prices of comparable tunnels in Germany.
In future audits of the cost-effectiveness of transport infrastructure expenditure, both BRH as well as NKE can rely on a data collection of bridge and tunnel prices.
Both audit offices recommend standardizing bridge constructions and carrying out steel composite and special constructions only where reinforced concrete constructions are unsuitable.
The test process was characterized by teamwork and an open approach.
During the parallel examination, the examiners from both sides exchanged their expertise and skills.
Introduction
The subject of this report is the parallel testing of expenditure on the construction of the motorway from Dresden to Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and A 17 in Germany).
The focus of the audit was on cost-effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and effectiveness of the use of funds.
The parallel tests were carried out by the BRH in Germany and the National Chamber of Commerce in the Czech Republic
in 2005 and 2006.
It examined the economy, cost-effectiveness and effectiveness of expenditure on the borderline section 0807 of the D8 motorway, amounting to approximately CZK 20 billion gross (approx. EUR 690 million).
Of this amount, EUR 64 million will be made available from EU Structural Funds (ISPA).
The BRH had already examined the planning and construction of the A17 motorway in the years 2003 to 2005 independently of the parallel tests with the NK.
Of the financial volume for the construction of all three sections of the A 17 of approximately 670 million euros, 277 million euros will be co-financed by European Funds (ERDF).
The Prague – Dresden motorway is part of the Pan-European Corridor IV Dresden – Central and Southeastern Europe – Istanbul.
The D 8 runs from Prague via Usti nad Labem to the Czech/German border,
the A 17 from the border to Dresden.
At the time of the test, the border sections of the motorways were under construction.
Both sections were opened to traffic on 21 December 2006.
While the motorway is thus completed on the German side to Dresden, the D 8 on the Czech side remains incomplete, since the section 0805 over a length of 16.4 km between Rehlovice and Lovosice is still in the planning phase.
Here the crossing of a protected landscape area in the Bohemian Central Mountains is planned.
According to Czech forecasts from 2001, the traffic volume in 2008 in the border section 0807 of the D 8 motorway will amount to 22,940 vehicles per day.
German forecasts estimate the volume of traffic on the A 17 at the Czech border in 2010 to be around 25,000 vehicles per day.
In 2000, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic signed an agreement to merge the German A17 motorway and the Czech D8 motorway on the common state border by erecting a border bridge.
Since both states are involved in the construction of this bridge, this individual construction measure represented an important aspect of the parallel audits of both audit institutions.
Cooperation between BRH and NK
From mid-2005, the two courts of auditors jointly considered cooperation in the examination of the construction of the Prague-Dresden motorway.
Both sides had important reasons for this cooperation:
1.
Germany is partly financing the construction of the border bridge.
Planning and construction are the responsibility of the Czech Road Administration.
There was no possibility for the BRH to examine this construction project itself.
2.
In order to be able to assess whether the funds were used sparingly with regard to the total construction costs of the bridges and tunnels on the D 8, the NKx had no comparative data at its disposal.
3.
It also had to check the effectiveness of the expenditure. To this end, the essential technical parameters of the bridges and tunnels should be examined, which should ensure the same quality of use on both sides of the border.
After preparatory negotiations, the presidents of the two courts of auditors closed on 04. January 2006 an agreement on the coordination of the tests of the motorway Prague – Dresden.
The auditors of both audit institutions met in the course of 2006 at about six to eight-week intervals.
They dealt with current problems and tasks. They developed a uniform methodology for checking bridge and tunnel prices, exchanged test results for the construction of the border bridge and produced joint reports.
A key aspect of the cooperation was the ongoing exchange of information.
While the BRH mainly focused on the comparison of the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels as well as the procurement procedures, the NKO mainly developed the methodology for the analysis of bridge and tunnel prices.
In Germany and the Czech Republic, the legal basis for financial control differs, and so does the way in which the two audit bodies complete their audits.
For this reason, both authorities drew up separate national reports on their audit results.
This report takes into account the results of the two parallel tests.
The cooperation ends with the signing of a final communique in the first half of 2007.
Construction of the border bridge
In the 2000 treaty, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed to complete the border bridge as far as possible in 2005.
Later they postponed the appointment by mutual agreement until the end of 2006.
The RMD acted as the client of the construction project.
Germany is co-financing 42.13% of the bridge construction.
Initially, the RMD provided for a prestressed concrete construction for the border bridge.
In 1999, however, the RMD and its German partner agreed on the construction of a steel composite structure.
They justified this decision with the possible reduction of the number of pairs of pillars from seven to five and the associated environmental benefits for the Talaue.
In addition, a comparative calculation of the RMD had identified the steel composite construction as the more cost-effective solution.
However, this was based on a calculation error.
The calculation was based on a length of the new steel composite construction of only 397 m,
In fact, however, it is 5% longer.
During the award procedure, the RMD made serious mistakes,
by insufficiently preparing the award documents and describing both evaluation criteria and sub-criteria inaccurately.
These errors led to subjective and ambiguous assessments by the Evaluation Commission and the Director General of the RMD.
An inferior bidder contested the outcome of the award procedure.
The subsequent investigation by the Czech Antitrust Office delayed the signing of the construction contract for the border bridge.
As a result, the summer construction season following the offer test was lost in 2004 and the total construction time available was shortened.
The contractor agreed to build the bridge in less time. This led to a significant price increase.
The measures offered included the double assembly of the superstructures, the modification of the pillar shape and the construction of an assembly hall.
In addition, the contractor was unable to procure the originally planned steel grade.
The new type of steel – the higher costs of which were borne by the client alone – made it possible to shorten the construction time intended for corrosion protection and thus the total construction time.
Compared to the offer price of approx. EUR 18.3 million net, the acceleration measures and further additions will significantly increase the total construction costs of the border bridge.
The shortened construction period alone led to a price increase of around ’5.9 million.
The costs are currently approx. 25.9 million euros net (as of October 2006).
Comparison of the prices of bridges and tunnels
Both audit offices examined the bridge prices on the D 8 and the A 17 in order to identify the bridges, which were characterized by particularly high prices and to compare the bridge prices on the German and Czech sides.
The study was based on mathematical statistical methods.
The tunnels on the D 8 were compared with similar tunnels on the German motorways A 71, A 38 and A 4, as there were no comparable tunnels on the A 17.
In the preparation of this part of the examination, a precise definition of the concept of price was important.
For the comparison of bridge prices, both courts of auditors agreed on detailed specifications, for example: to use the current price paid for the bridge without VAT.
(The VAT rates in the Czech Republic and Germany are different and may change), not to take into account the costs of special start-up measures, to use the exchange rate of the European Central Bank of 30.12.2005 for the currency conversion. (29 CZK - 1 euro).
Bridges of different types (steel concrete, reinforced concrete, steel composite and steel) and different sizes are available on both the D 8 and the A 17.
In order to ensure the comparability of the tested bridge structures, the bridges were grouped according to their design.
The analyses also took into account the bridge size within these groups.
The most common were concrete bridges on both sides of the border (20 bridges on the D 8 and 36 bridges on the A 17).
The study focused on this type of bridge, as the size of the sample allowed the application of mathematical statistical methods and improved the reliability of the results.
The study showed that the m2 price of the concrete bridges on the D 8 / A 17 depends on the bridge size (length, road surface): the larger the bridge, the lower the square meter price.
For German bridges, the correlation between price and size is more pronounced than for Czech bridges (see illustrations below).
On the A 17 two bridges could be identified, on the D 8 four bridges with a significantly increased price.
These bridges were determined partly by a method for determining significant deviations within a sample and partly by regression analysis of the correlation between bridge price and size (based on the distance to the regression curve, atypically expensive bridges can be identified).
However, the atypically high price of these bridges should only serve as an indication of which bridges to focus on.
In order to draw final conclusions, the causes for the respective high price have to be determined in individual cases.
This could be due, for example, to uneconomic administrative action, but also to the requirements for the protection of the environment or other legitimate reasons.
Taking into account the larger average length of Czech concrete bridges compared to the German ones (see Table 1), the proven negative correlation between the bridge price and the length indicated that the Czech concrete bridges are cheaper.
This was also supported by lower labour costs in the Czech Republic compared to Germany.
However, the evaluation of the results showed that the price of the concrete bridges on the D 8 is higher than on the A 17.
During joint meetings, two reasons for this situation were identified:
1.
In Germany, construction contracts for bridges are predominantly awarded separately.
This also enables medium-sized companies to participate in the award competition.
In the Czech Republic, many bridge constructions are awarded as part of larger contracts for the construction of several kilometers of motorway sections.
Orders of this size cannot be handled by medium-sized companies.
2.
In the Czech Republic, the variety of bridge constructions built is greater than in Germany.
In this context, the NKE noted that the construction of bridges will be determined long before construction begins,
already at the time of the submission of the application for planning approval by the RMD.
At this time, it selects a specific bridge construction variant from several alternatives. However, economic efficiency plays a subordinate role in this decision.
Only through a thorough analysis of the construction sectors of both countries would a final conclusion have been possible with regard to bridge prices in the Czech Republic and Germany. However, this would have blown up the scope of this examination.
The border bridge is the most expensive steel composite bridge on the D 8 and A 17.
The prices for the tunnels on the D 8 are about twice as high as in Germany.
However, a comparison of the technical parameters between the tunnels on the D 8 and the tunnels in Germany showed no significant difference.
The significant price differences can be the result of an underdeveloped competition for tunnel constructions in the Czech Republic.
However, the small number of tunnels did not allow general conclusions.
Economic efficiency and effectiveness of the Dresden – Prague motorway
The independent Czech Republic was founded in 1993.
In the same year, the government adopted the plan for the expansion of the motorway network.
The plan was to gradually expand the D8 from Prague to the state border with Germany.
The section 0805 was to be built by the Bohemian Central Mountains in front of the border section 0807.
The Czech Republic finances the D8 under the programme financing.
In the program number 327 220 “Construction of the motorway D 8 Prague – "st" nad Labem – Czech German state border" two objectives are defined:
1.
as a national objective: to improve the link between Prague and the Oesti nad Labem;
2.
as an international destination: the connection between Prague and Berlin as part of the Pan-European Transport Corridor IV BerlinIstanbul.
The programme provided for the completion of the construction of the section leading through the Bohemian Central Mountains in June 2008 and the construction of the border section 0807 in June 2007.
It should be noted that the end of the construction work is not identical with the time of commissioning.
For the construction of the section leading through the Bohemian Central Mountains, the NKE noted that the planning approval decision had already been issued.
Environmental associations have brought an action against this decision.
A final verdict is still pending.
Compared to the timetable provided for in the programme documentation, a delay in the completion of section No.0805 could not be ruled out for several years.
In the summer of 2006, the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed a postponement of the completion date of the construction phase No.0805 to 2010.
As a result, the construction of the border section did not achieve the national goal of improving the connection between Prague and Usti nad Labem.
The RMD underwent an economic analysis of section no. 0807 of the D 8 near the border and section no.0805 of the Bohemian Central Mountains between 1999 and 2001.
As an investment cost, it invested around 639 million euros for both sections No. 0805 and No. 0807.
Table 2: Results of the Economic Performance Survey (EIRR)
Variant opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.
Traffic volume in the northern part of the border section 18 000 cars per day in 2010.
Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.
Traffic volume in the northern part of the border section 22 000 cars per day in 2010.
Opening of all planned motorways and expressways, as well as both D 8 sections in 2007.
Traffic volume in the northern part of the border section 25 000 cars per day in 2010.
The economic feasibility study from 2001 was based on the assumption that the section close to the border and the section leading through the Bohemian Central Mountains would go under traffic at the same time.
At the time of the examination it was obvious that the section through the Bohemian Central Mountains would not be opened at the original date.
This reduces the aforementioned EIRR values.
The costs of both sections as at 31.12.2005 amounted to 897 million euros without VAT, which is 27.4% higher than the cost-effectiveness assessment of 2001.
In addition, there is a risk that Section 0805 will get another more elaborate in-service course, which would affect the economic viability of the project.
The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that the construction of both sections of the motorway with a daily traffic volume of at least 18,000 vehicles per day in 2010 is economically justified.The forecast for 2008 had predicted 22,940 vehicles per day.
However, a study on diversion routes as an alternative to the missing section through the Bohemian Central Mountains assumes a traffic volume of 12 600 to 13 750 vehicles per day in 2007. The project is then below the cost-effectiveness limit.
Higher traffic volumes on the routes, which are intended to replace the missing section with the Bohemian Central Mountains, are highly likely to result in traffic jams and thus increased external costs, which were not taken into account in the original cost-effectiveness study.
The aforementioned reduction in revenue and increase in costs means that the already low EIRR for the construction of the border section of the D 8 will not be achieved.
The construction of the border section of the D 8 is therefore uneconomical.
Cost increases also occurred in the construction of the A 17 as in the construction of the two above-mentioned sections of the D 8.
As part of the macroeconomic assessment for the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan 1992, the Federal Ministry responsible for transport assumed investment costs of around 320 million euros.
It thus determined a benefit/cost ratio of 4.6.
In the meantime, the costs have increased to around 670 million euros and the benefit/cost ratio has been reduced by more than half.
In the years 2003 to 2005, the BRH examined the cost-effectiveness of the planning and construction of the A17 motorway, regardless of the parallel tests with the NK.
He noted that the authority responsible for the permit required an unnecessary landscape tunnel for the third section of the A 17.
In the course of the examination, the BRH succeeded in convincing the Federal Ministry and the road construction administration of the superfluousness of the landscape tunnel.
As a result, 10 million euros in construction costs and 150,000 euros in annual operating costs could be avoided.
During the examination of the first section of the A 17, the BRH found that the construction project was insufficiently prepared.
The following example illustrates this:
In the planning phase, the road construction administration refrained from recording the condition of the rock on the surface of the Dölzschen wall, as it was difficult to access.
Only when the tunnel propulsion reached the wall did it catch up.
It turned out that the rock was more weathered than assumed in the tender.
Extensive measures such as anchorages, injections and stone impact protection nets for around 3.3 million euros were necessary.
The road construction administration not only bore the costs for additional, already necessary services such as securing the Dölzschener wall, but also for those that would not have been necessary for a perfect construction preparation.
These include expenses due to disturbed construction processes (3.2 million euros), additional training of the tunnelling team (0.5 million euros) and increased wages and material prices due to the construction time extension (7 million euros).
There is no lasting added value compared to these additional expenditures of around 10.7 million euros.
The BRH took these and other measures as an opportunity to call on the Federal Ministry to better exercise its specialist supervision for major road construction measures.
In this context, it should insist that road construction administrations introduce quality assurance systems.
Benefits of the cooperation for BRH and NK’ The cooperation met the expectations of both audit institutions.
The BRH received insights into the planning, procurement and implementation of the construction of the border bridge.
Both audit institutions developed a database on bridge and tunnel prices, which will be helpful in future audits.
It was noted that the most important structural parameters for bridges, tunnels and roadways of the D 8 do not differ from those of the A 17.
The auditors of both audit institutions involved in the cooperation gained valuable experience, which will be useful in future audits.
Report on the results of the parallel audit of the management of VAT of the Czech Republic and Germany
Foreword
The Lima Declaration, adopted in 1977, stresses that the Court of Auditors has the power to audit all public finances.
The declaration requires that the courts of auditors have the power to examine tax collection as much as possible.
The Organisation of European Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers taxes to be an important part of public revenue.
The thematic focus of the 6th EUROSAI Congress, which took place in Bonn in 2005, was the audit of public revenues by the Court of Auditors.
One of the most important steps towards optimising the audit activities of a Court of Auditors is the development of a special strategy for auditing public revenue.
This is especially true for taxes as the largest source of public revenue with a high risk of default.
As national economies become increasingly interconnected and interdependent, a situation may arise in which national audit bodies can only carry out their audit activities in cooperation with the audit bodies of other states.
As an example, the examination of internationally organised fraud can be considered, which can lead to significant revenue losses in many states.
Cooperation between the authorities is needed in the fight against such crimes.
Audit institutions in this area must be prepared to cooperate closely with each other.
The idea for an audit of the sales tax as well as the system MIAS arose at the VI EUROSAI Congress in Bonn. This audit was carried out in cooperation between the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic and the German Federal Audit Office.
In the course of thorough preparation, the participating audit institutions first had to familiarize themselves with the legal framework and the procedures of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany.
Based on the evaluation of the available information, we made the selection of the examination subjects for the examination planning.
Achieving efficient and effective management of VAT is a long-standing problem and individual states (particularly the EC Member States) are looking for solutions to improve the system, simplify the collection of VAT and create greater transparency in this area.
We are convinced that the results of our audit can not only contribute to improving the work of financial management, but can also form the basis for a proposal for an improved system of international exchange of information.
Report on the results of the parallel audit of the management of VAT of the Czech Republic and Germany
Introduction
Reference number: CZ) 06/27 (DE) VIII 2 – 2005 – 1215
Subject of examination:
(CZ) Management of VAT after the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union
(DE) Examination of administrative cooperation in the field of VAT in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and 1925/2004
the Commission's audit objective:
(CZ) The aim of the audit in the Czech Republic was to examine the procedures applied by the financial administration in the field of VAT following the integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter referred to as the "EC") with the free movement of goods and services and the use of MIAS1, in particular the control of the use of the VAT exemption for intra-Community deliveries.
(DE) The aim of the audit was to examine the system of intra-Community VAT control with a focus on mutual assistance in the area of VAT in accordance with the above-mentioned regulations.
As a result of the audit, weaknesses should be identified and recommendations made to remedy them.
VAT Information Exchange System The audits were carried out on the basis of an agreement concluded on 8 June 2006 jointly by the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic ("NK") and the Bundesrech-nungshof ("BRH") of the Federal Republic of Germany.
The focus of the cooperation was the review of selected business transactions between entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, the exploitation of information obtained through international mutual assistance between the financial administrations as well as the comparison of the VAT management systems in the two states.
A joint final report on the results of the audits was prepared in accordance with European Guideline No. 31 for the implementation of INTOSAI testing standards.
The audited period covered the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005.
Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel audit
The parallel audit of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two courts of auditors.
In addition to the "exchange of information" priority in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and 1925/2004 of the Commission, other closely related aspects were also examined, such as the registration of taxable persons, tax returns and summary notifications.
In addition, the audit also covered the legal situation regarding cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach and the comparison of statistical data.
When comparing the systems of VAT administrations in the two countries, differences were found in the following areas:
1) Registration for VAT purposes.
While in Germany the entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic, among others, the essential criterion for registration is the exceedance of the turnover threshold laid down in the VAT Act.
In the Czech Republic, taxpayers only receive a single tax identification number, which they also use for intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, the taxable person receives a tax number valid only for domestic transactions for the purpose of VAT.
If the German taxpayer wishes to make intra-Community transactions, he must apply for a special identification number, the so-called USt-IdNr.
As problems arise from the different registration procedures, the rules should be harmonised within the EC (see 4.1).
2) Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach.
In the Czech Republic, cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach is free of VAT, but there is a right to deduct input tax.
In Germany, the transport service, insofar as the route passes through Germany, is subject to VAT.
Efforts should be made at EC level to standardise the situation in accordance with Article 393 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common VAT system (see 4.2).
3) Tax returns.
While taxable persons in the Czech Republic only have to file VAT returns for periods of under-year taxation (month or quarter), taxable persons in Germany (monthly or quarterly)
VAT pre-registrations and after the end of the calendar year to submit a VAT annual declaration.
In contrast to the Czech Republic, taxable persons in Germany have to submit VAT pre-registrations electronically.
The introduction of the obligation to issue VAT declarations electronically in the Czech Republic would improve the efficiency of the Czech financial administration (see 4.3).
4) Summary messages.
While taxable persons in the Czech Republic have to submit their summary notifications to the tax authorities (FÄ), German taxable persons have to submit the summary notifications to the CLO2.
Accordingly, the information from the summary notifications will be available to FÄ in the Czech Republic immediately after their submission.
The information from the summary notifications is only available to German FÄ after their processing by the CLO.
In order to combat VAT fraud, updated information on intra-Community transactions is needed as soon as possible.
The monthly submission of summary reports would shorten the period between the date of turnover and the update of the MIAS data.
This would allow for a timely examination of taxation in the purchaser's Member State (see 4.4), but only if all EC Member States introduce the same deadlines.
5) International exchange of information in the field of VAT.
In the case of incoming requests for information, the Czech CLO monitors compliance with the three-month period.
The German CLO does not monitor the processing times.
As a result, the German financial administration has completed a significantly lower percentage of requests for information received within the specified period.
Because of these problems, the BRH has recommended that the German CLO constantly monitor the deadlines (see 4.6).
6) Risk management.
Each of the two Member States is developing its own risk management system (RMS) with corresponding strengths and weaknesses.
The NCC and BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by one Member State alone.
Successful criteria, elements or approaches of an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in all EC Member States. Otherwise, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5.).
Within the framework of the cooperation, the two audit bodies examined selected cases of intra-Community transactions that were realized between Czech and German tax entities.
Of these, 31 cases were examined jointly by using the legal possibilities of the CLO, in which there were doubts about the correct taxation or the suspicion of VAT fraud.
The Court of Auditors found that:
In some cases, the FÄ used the information obtained in the international exchange of information and redefined the VAT liability of the taxable persons concerned.
In these cases, the taxable persons had either unlawfully claimed the VAT exemption or had not indicated the purchase of goods in their VAT return.
In some cases, the FÄ could not use the information obtained in the exchange of information because it was incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be used because of different legal provisions in the two Member States.
In some cases, the financial administration of another Member State refused to provide the requested information.
A number of cases were uncovered in which taxable persons incorrectly reported sales in their summary reports.
As a result, the data in the MIAS were correspondingly incorrect, so that the clerks (of the FÄ) had to determine in these cases (see 6).
Examination procedure
Examination procedures in the CR
The audit was carried out between June 2006 and March 2007 by Division II – "State Budget Revenue" and the Territorial Audit Departments of Central Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, South Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.
Verified bodies were: The Ministry of Finance and the 10 FÄ Humpolec, Jihlava, Kadai, Liberec, Nymburk, Otrokovice, Prague 1, Prague 4, Sokolov and Tinec.
On 23 April 2007, the College of the National Committee approved the findings of the audit.
Examination procedures in Germany
The examination was carried out in the period July 2006 to February 2007 by the examination area traffic taxes and employees of the assigned PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt/Main and Munich.
It was part of the work plan for 2006 and was therefore announced to the Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) in 2006.
After a test phase, the actual examination began in the 4th quarter of 2006.
In accordance with the cases selected by the BRH and later by the NK, the BRH had to announce the examination in several federal states.
Apart from interviews in the BMF and the CLO, the examination was conducted in the following federal states:
Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.
Tax files from the following cases were included in the audit:
Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, München-Körperschaften, München II, IV and München V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-Nord and Hamburg for large companies, Hanover-Nord, Winsen-Luhe, Bonn-Innenstadt, Cologne-Mitte, Cologne-Porz, Cologne-Süd
Discussions were also held with the FÄ Augsburg-Stadt, Aurich, Düsseldorf-Altstadt, Eisleben, Kelheim and Verden.
The examination results were communicated to the BMF in May 2007.
Cooperation between the two audit institutions
In the run-up to the parallel audit, several meetings of representatives of both courts of auditors took place.
The participants in these meetings familiarized themselves with the organisation of the financial administration, the legislation on VAT and the system of VAT administration in the other country.
The subject of the test phase was agreed at the meeting in May 2006.
The results of the test phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.
At this meeting, a timetable for the further procedure was drawn up and the following examination topics were determined for the parallel examinations: 1.
Registration of taxable persons.
2.

An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic, whose turnover in the last 12 consecutive calendar months exceeds the amount of CZK 1,000,000, will be liable to pay on the first day of the third month after the month in which he has exceeded the threshold (Section 94 (1) of Law No. 235/2004 Coll., concerning VAT; hereinafter “Law No. 235/2004“.
The person concerned must apply for registration within 15 days of the end of the month in which he has exceeded the registration threshold.
Current legislation does not allow the retroactive registration of a taxable person if he has exceeded the application deadline for registration.
An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic, who provides services subject to VAT or exempt from VAT with the right to deduct input tax, must register for VAT even if his turnover does not exceed CZK 1 million, but he meets other requirements specified in Law No. 235/2004.
An entrepreneur with a legal domicile, registered office or permanent establishment in the Czech Republic, who does not meet any of the requirements set out in the law, may voluntarily apply for registration for VAT.
The registration procedure under Law No. 337/1992 begins upon receipt of the registration application by the local tax officer.
If you want to register voluntarily for VAT, you must indicate in your application the deadline from which you apply for registration as a VAT payer.
The financial officer must check the information provided by the entrepreneur, i.e. the completed application for registration with all investments.
If he has doubts about the information given therein, he must ask the applicant to explain, supplement or substantiate the information provided.
If the financial officer has verified that the trader meets the requirements for registration, he must issue a written notification of registration and the allocation of a tax number.
In the communication, the tax officer must indicate the date of entry into force of the registration for VAT and the assessment period for VAT.
The investment period is the calendar quarter; unless the turnover of the entrepreneur for the previous calendar year has reached the amount of at least CZK 10,000,000.
If this is the case, the assessment period is the calendar month.
An entrepreneur whose turnover reached at least CZK 2,000,000 in the previous calendar year is entitled to choose the calendar month as the investment period and must inform the tax officer of this change.
The issuance of a tax number in the registration notice is always constitutive.
The taxpayer must provide the tax number for each communication (including payments) with the tax officer, as well as in cases where a special law requires it (e.g. Law No. 235/2004, concerning the preparation of tax documents)3.
The tax number contains the encoding "CZ" and a basic component in the form of a general identification mark.
In the case of natural persons, this is the number of the birth certificate or another general identification mark, insofar as a special law determines this. In the case of legal entities, the general identification mark is the company identification number (in accordance with the provisions of Section 33 (12) of Law No. 337/1992).
If the entrepreneur has not fulfilled his obligation despite a request from the tax officer, the local tax officer must register him ex officio.
A communication will also be issued, which will be sent to the taxpayer.
In the Czech Republic, each trader admitted to a business activity receives a tax number for any type of tax when registering for the first time.
This also applies to registration as a VAT payer.
In accordance with Law No. 235/2004, which entered into force on 1 January 2005, the tax officer may, in the event of non-compliance with the duty to register the value added tax, require the taxable person to pay up to 10% of the proceeds from the taxable turnover, which the person concerned unlawfully made without taxation, for the period from the date from which the entrepreneur should have been registered as a taxable person, until the date on which the registration as a taxable person took place by order of the tax officer (Section 98(1) of Law No.
The payment of the amount fixed in this way shall be deemed to be a tax payment within the meaning of Section 98(3) of Law No. 235/2004, i.e. it is not a fine or penalty.
If the legal requirements are met, the registration of a VATable person can be deleted for two reasons:
1)
Deletion of registration at the request of the taxpayer, i.e. mainly for the reason that the turnover does not reach the threshold for registration (Section 106 (1) of Law No. 235/2004).
A taxable person may request the deletion of his registration at the earliest one year after the date of entry into force specified in the registration notice.
2) Deletion of registration ex officio (Section 106(7) of Law No. 235/2004), if: a) the taxable person has not rendered a service for a period of 12 consecutive months and has not informed the tax officer of the reasons for this, b) the taxable person has not fulfilled his obligations under Law No. 235/2004, c) the previous taxable person no longer meets the requirements for tax liability.
B) Taxable persons without legal domicile, place of business or business premises in the Czech Republic A person who is registered for tax purposes in another Member State and has no legal domicile, place of business or place of business in the Czech Republic or a taxable foreigner who provides services in the Czech Republic and has to file a tax return and pay taxes for these services or deliveries in accordance with Section 108 of Law No. 235/2004 ("non-resident entrepreneur") becomes taxable with the provision of the service in question.
He must file an application for registration with FA Prague 1 at the latest on the day of the delivery in question.
He is obliged to indicate in this application all USt-IdNr. assigned to him in other Member States or third countries.
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration later than on the day of the first taxable service provision in the Czech Republic, the FA Prague 1 has to register him retroactively, as he became liable for VAT on the day of the first taxable service provision in the Czech Republic in accordance with Law No. 235/2004.
In the event of retroactive registration, FA Prague 1 shall require the entrepreneurs concerned to provide evidence (invoices or written explanations) for proof of performance.
If a non-resident entrepreneur applies for registration in the Czech Republic before performing a service for the first time, FA Prague 1 shall require the submission of the performance-based contract documents.
As of December 31, 2004, 473 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered with FA Prague 1, 124 of them from Germany. As of 31 December 2005, a total of 951 non-resident entrepreneurs were registered, 233 of them from Germany.
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 106(9) of Law No. 235/2004, the tax officer is authorised to delete the registration of a non-resident entrepreneur as of 31 January of the following calendar year if he does not accept the obligation to file tax applications or declarations and to pay taxes.
During the examination of the NK, it turned out that in the case of the filing of a tax return by post with dispatch abroad on 25 January, i.e. according to the mandatory deadline for the filing of a tax return, this declaration has not yet been received by the FA until 31 January.
In cases where these facts, which are decisive for the possibility of deletion of the registration, become known to the FA later than on 31 January, it is no longer possible to delete the registration of the non-resident entrepreneur for VAT in the Czech Republic in the calendar year in question.
Registration of taxable persons in Germany
In accordance with the provisions of the tax regulations (section 137, 138 AO), each business operation must be registered with the municipality and/or the competent tax office.
This registration must be made no later than one month after commencement of business activities.
The municipality forwards the application to the tax authorities.
If the competent tax office determines that a business activity has been commenced but has not been notified, it may also register the taxable person retroactively on its own initiative.
In Germany, taxable persons, regardless of whether they are resident or non-resident, are obliged to register for Zwekke the value added tax if they meet the requirements in Section 2 of the German VAT Act (UStG).
This does not depend on the amount of revenue generated.
There is no voluntary registration in Germany.
Special FÄs are responsible for entrepreneurs based abroad.
For example, the FA ChemnitzSüd is responsible for those entrepreneurs who are based in the Czech Republic.
As of 30 April 2004, the company had registered a total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs; as of 1 March 2006, 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered there.
According to the BRH, these FÄ with special responsibilities often refused to register so-called false self-employed persons residing in the new Central and Eastern European Member States of the EC.
Since the free movement of workers is still restricted after the accession of these ten states to the EC, these self-employed people tried to circumvent these restrictions by setting up their own business.
These (ticket) self-employed persons do not meet the conditions for recognition as an entrepreneur specified in Section 2 UStG, since they are usually dependent on a single client who determines their working time and the type of work execution.
In order to be registered, the entrepreneur must complete a questionnaire of the responsible FA and provide information about the company and the business activities carried out.
The questionnaire is a mandatory form for all FÄ in Germany.
It is processed either in special organizational units within the FÄ or in the organizational units generally responsible for tax assessment.
With the help of this form, a risk assessment for the individual taxpayer is carried out before the allocation of a tax number.
The structure of the tax number for domestic sales is based on certain requirements:
The first three digits are the identification number for the responsible FA, the following three (or four) digits indicate which department is responsible within the FA, the following five (or four) digits are the identification feature for the taxpayer, the last digit is always a control number.
If an entrepreneur wants to participate in intra-Community trade, he needs a VAT ID number in order to be able to make tax-free intra-Community deliveries.
This is allocated by the CLO on request if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany for VAT purposes.
The VAT ID no. is automatically assigned by the CLO if the taxpayer declares intra-Community deliveries in his VAT pre-registrations or in his VAT annual declaration.
The USt-IdNr. consists of the country code (DE) and a sequence of nine digits.
The registration of an entrepreneur can be deleted: 1. Upon request (e.g. if he ceases to do business), but only after completion of all tax transactions (assessment of all financial years) or 2. if the financial administration determines that he no longer conducts business.
As a rule, the validity of the VAT ID no. depends on the validity of the VAT number.
In these cases, the FÄ must inform the CLO of the deletion of the VAT number so that the validity of the VAT ID no. can be terminated there at this time.
According to the Value Added Tax Act (Section 19 (1) UStG), domestic taxable persons do not have to pay VAT in the following cases: 1. the turnover of the previous calendar year plus the resulting value added tax has not exceeded the amount of 17,500 euros and 2. will probably not exceed the amount of 50,000 euros in the following year.
The so-called small entrepreneurs are not entitled to charge VAT to other entrepreneurs, nor are they entitled to deduct VAT.
Although they do not have to pay VAT, small entrepreneurs are obliged to register with the tax office and file an annual VAT return.
A small business owner may declare the non-application of Section 19 (1) UStG.
This declaration is binding for the following five years.
He may then invoice the sales tax and deduct the input tax.
Non-resident taxpayers may appoint a fiscal representative (Section 22a UStG).
The prerequisite for this is that they only make tax-free transactions and waive the deduction of input tax.
The fiscal representative fulfils the tax obligations of the foreign entrepreneur, so that he does not have to register for VAT purposes.
In the invoices it must be stated that a fiscal representative has been appointed.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation in the two countries is different.
While in Germany entrepreneurs are registered regardless of the amount of their turnover, in the Czech Republic the first requirement for registration (among others) is the exceedance of the threshold amount specified in the VAT Act.
If an entrepreneur does not exceed this threshold, he can register voluntarily.
The registration procedure in Germany is standardized, but differences can occur due to different organizational structures in the individual federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the taxpayer receives a tax number for any tax at the time of his first registration.
In the case of registration for VAT, this tax number also applies to intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, an entrepreneur who can be registered for VAT purposes receives a tax number exclusively for intra-German sales.
If the German entrepreneur wants to carry out intra-Community transactions, he must specifically apply for the allocation of a USt-IdNr.
Both the NK and the BRH noted that the German two-stage registration system in other Member States, such as the Czech Republic, which assigns a single identification number for both national registration for VAT and intra-Community transactions, can lead to considerable misunderstandings.
On the other hand, the two-stage system allows retroactive (national registration) in cases where the taxpayer does not register his business activities with the municipality or with the relevant FA.
This retroactive registration enables a correct assessment of the value added tax for previous investment periods, in particular an accurate estimate of the value added tax liability.
As the different registration procedures lead to problems, the rules for the whole EC should be harmonised.
The German Parliament recently decided to introduce a tax identification number.
This is to be allocated by the Federal Central Tax Office to every natural person after birth.
This number applies to natural persons resident in Germany for life.
If a natural person takes up a business activity, the responsible FA applies for a commercial tax identification number, which serves as USt-IdNr.
In future, there should therefore be no delay between the national registration of a taxable person and the allocation of the VAT ID no.
Work on the implementation of an IT procedure for the management of numbers has not yet been completed.
Cross-border passenger transport by bus and coach
The legal regulations in the Czech Republic
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 70 of Law No. 235/2004, since 1 May 2004, the carriage of passengers between the individual Member States and between the Member States and third countries in the Czech Republic has been exempt from VAT and there is a right to deduct VAT.
The exemption from VAT also applies if the carriage is carried out by persons registered as taxable persons in other Member States or by foreigners who are taxable domestically.
The return journey is considered a separate transport process.
If non-resident entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic carry out no other economic activity than the cross-border carriage of passengers by bus and coach, they are not obliged to register in the Czech Republic as subject to VAT.
Cross-border passenger transport in the Czech Republic was exempted from VAT due to the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic Annex No. V, Chapter 5 (1) (b). The text of the above passage reads as follows:
"For the purpose of applying Article 28(3)(b) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Czech Republic may, in accordance with point 17 of Annex F of the Directive, maintain the tax exemption for cross-border passenger transport either until the condition of Article 28(4) of the Directive is met or until the same tax exemption is applied by any of the current Member States."
The legal regulations in Germany
Pursuant to Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006, as implemented in Germany by Section 3b(1) UStG, a transport service shall be carried out where the carriage is effected.
Accordingly, German taxation does not distinguish between domestic and cross-border passenger transport.
Only the domestic part of the transport service is taxable in Germany.
German taxation also does not distinguish between resident and non-resident (bus) entrepreneurs.
If a non-resident taxable person transports through Germany, the part of the transport attributable to Germany shall be regarded as taxable transport.
Before providing its services in Germany, the non-resident entrepreneur must notify the competent FA of his intention to provide passenger transport services.
It registers it for tax purposes (compare 4.1.2) and issues a special certificate for each bus named in the taxable person's application.
The entrepreneur must indicate his taxable transport services in a German VAT declaration.
As of 1 March 2006, 741 Czech bus operators were registered with FA Chemnitz-Süd.
If the transport service is provided for a domestic entrepreneur, the non-resident taxable person does not have to pay the VAT himself to the FA.
In its place, the domestic purchaser of the services must pay the VAT to the tax office and the net amount invoiced to the non-resident taxpayer. This process is known as the "shifting of tax liability" and is in line with Article 196 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC.
In addition to the registration by a non-resident taxable person and his income tax return, the German tax administration has several means to check the correctness of the tax return with regard to taxable passenger transport:
Mobile control groups of customs check the certificates of buses registered abroad, which are used for passenger transport through Germany.
After each check, the mobile control groups transmit an inspection protocol to the responsible FA.
If the bus driver does not have a valid certificate, the mobile control group may require the bus driver to pay VAT before continuing his journey.
The non-resident taxable person can deduct the VAT paid in this way from the tax liability stated in his VAT return.
If the FA has doubts about the accuracy of a VAT return, it may order an examination to be carried out in the FA, or may use the means of mutual assistance referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 (see point 4.6).
Even if the foreign taxpayer refuses to pay the legally established VAT, the FA may request mutual assistance in accordance with Council Directive 76/308/EEC.
The BRH considers these means of mutual assistance in tax matters for checking the VAT return or compliance with the tax obligation by a non-resident bus operator to be too costly in relation to the low volume of VAT on taxable passenger transport.
In particular, the examination of the books of a non-resident taxable person causes disproportionately high costs for the taxpayer himself and for the financial administration.
The latter must examine the foreign books, which requires not only knowledge of the foreign language, but also of the foreign accounting principles.
Accordingly, such an examination is expected to involve a higher amount of time than that of a resident taxable person, although the examination is limited to the passenger transport operations taking place in Germany.
On the other hand, the non-resident taxable person must not only accept the audit rights of his national financial administration, but also those of the other Member States, insofar as he carries out passenger transport there.
In addition, for each Member State in which a single passenger transport is carried out, the taxpayer must fulfil all existing tax obligations in the various languages and on the basis of the forms of the financial administrations of the EC Member States concerned.
Thus, the correct taxation of cross-border passenger transport services leads to a disproportionate administrative burden.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation is different in the two states.
In the Czech Republic, passenger transport between different EC Member States as well as between Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT under the Act on the Accession of the Czech Republic to the EC.
In Germany, the transport service is subject to VAT in accordance with the transport route falling within German territory.
If a non-resident taxable person provides such a transport service for the first time, he must notify the competent FA beforehand.
This registers the taxable person who must declare the taxable share of the transport service in a tax return in Germany.
Law enforcement in Germany is very time-consuming.
At least three out of four Czech taxable persons registered with the FA Chemnitz-Süd have passenger transport as a business purpose.
The tax revenue in question is quite low in relation to the administrative burden.
Member States – which levy VAT under Article 46 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common VAT system – have a high administrative burden in relation to the relevant tax revenue.
In order to avoid the disproportionate cost of investing in VAT, cross-border passenger transport should only be subject to tax in one Member State.
This could be the state in which the carriage begins or in which the service provider is located.
Such a form of taxation would require an amendment to Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006.
VAT returns
Delivery and processing of VAT returns in the Czech Republic
Unless otherwise specified by law, the entrepreneur is obliged to file a VAT return on the form prescribed by the Ministry of Finance within 25 days of the expiry of the tax period, even if no tax liability has arisen.
The tax liability arises at the end of the period for filing the VAT return. According to Law No. 235/2004, VAT on the import of goods is excluded from this regulation. Here the due date of the tax is determined according to the customs regulations.
If, as a result, an above-average amount of deductible input tax results in a refund claim, this amount will be refunded to the taxpayer within 30 days of the determination of this deduction without the need for an application.
The time limit is not applied in cases where the tax officer initiates a tax procedure with regard to the tax liability of the taxpayer.
Pursuant to Section 73 (11) of Law No. 235/2004, the claim for deduction of input tax may be asserted at the latest with the regular tax return for the last tax period of the calendar year in which the claim for deduction of input tax arose.
After expiry of this period, the deduction of input tax may still be claimed within three years after the end of the tax period in which the assertion would have been possible for the first time.
However, this requires the submission of a supplementary VAT return.
An amendment to Law No. 235/2004 which entered into force on 1 January 2005 permits the filing of a supplementary VAT return only for the period in which the claim for deduction of input tax could have been asserted for the first time.
A taxable person must file a supplementary VAT return if: (a) the sum of the corrections leads to an increase in the tax liability; (b) he makes corrections which do not alter the last known tax liability, but only change previous information; (c) he makes corrections to the VAT rate and the tax liability in accordance with Section 49 of Law No. 235/2004.
A taxable person can file a supplementary VAT return if the sum of the corrections reduces the tax liability.
The taxpayer must file the supplementary tax return by the end of the month following the month in which the facts in question were established.
The VAT declaration can be submitted electronically either via the Internet or by means of data carriers.
The delivery via the Internet can be done with a certified electronic signature or without it.
If it is carried out without an electronic signature, it must additionally be submitted to data carriers.
The form for the VAT return contains separate lines for indicating the value of intra-Community deliveries and purchases.
The value of related services must be specified in separate lines of the VAT return.
Some categories are used for automated primary controls within the ATIS system.
The value of the goods delivered to persons registered as taxable in other EC Member States is compared with the data provided by the Czech taxable persons in their summary notifications.
The value of purchases of goods from other Member States by persons registered as taxable is compared with the information in the summary notifications of taxable persons from other EC Member States with the help of MIAS.
Within the framework of the ATIS system, the FA carries out a credibility check of the VAT declarations.
This is done automatically, as the VAT return cannot be processed without the prior examination.
The credibility check includes a calculation of the benchmarks for credibility and an assessment of the risks of VAT returns.
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 37(1) of Law No. 337/1992, the FA may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2 million on persons who fail to comply with their non-monetary obligations under this or a special tax law or a decision under this Act.
Automated tax information system – Automated tax information system used by Czech tax authorities to provide technical support for tax collection.
In its examination, the NKO found that the FÄ rarely made use of the possibility of imposing a fine on the taxable person in question if the VAT return was not filed.
Delivery and processing of VAT declarations in Germany
In Germany, a distinction is made between monthly or quarterly VAT pre-registrations and the annual VAT return.
Those taxable persons who are obliged to submit VAT pre-registrations must nevertheless file an annual VAT return.
Even small entrepreneurs who are not obliged to pay VAT must file an annual VAT return.
Taxable persons are generally obliged to file a VAT pre-registration until the 10th day after the end of the calendar quarter in which the VAT is generated (Section 18 (2) UStG).
However, if the VAT liability in the previous year exceeds 6,136 euros or if it is a newly founded company, the entrepreneur is obliged to submit monthly VAT pre-registrations at the latest by the 10th day after the end of the respective month.
The taxable person can also opt for the submission of monthly VAT pre-registrations if he has received a refund of 6,136 euros in the previous year (Section 18 (2a) UStG).
If the annual value added tax is not more than 512 euros, neither VAT pre-registrations nor VAT declarations must be submitted.
A resulting VAT liability must be paid 10 days after the end of the tax period.
A refund can lead to a more thorough audit by the financial administration.
(Legal) There are no deadlines for processing VAT returns and for refunding VAT overpayments.
In order to receive a timely refund, a security for the refund amount can be offered.
In principle, VAT declarations, including refund cases, must be processed quickly.
The German VAT Act allows an extension of these (duty or payment) deadlines (Section 18 (6) UStG).
The extension of the time limit must be requested separately.
If it is granted, the VAT pre-registration and the corresponding payments may be made one month later. In the case of monthly notifications, however, a special advance payment must be made.
This payment is offset against the VAT liability established for the pre-registration period of December.
If an error is detected, the entrepreneur must submit a corrected VAT pre-registration.
There is no "complementary" VAT return.
If the VAT declaration to be filed by 31 May of the following year is once submitted to the tax office, the entrepreneur can no longer correct an incorrect VAT pre-registration, but only the incorrect annual VAT declaration.
Corrections to this VAT return to the advantage or disadvantage of the taxpayer are possible within four years of the end of the year in which the first VAT return was filed.
After this four-year period, a VAT return can usually only be corrected in cases of a frivolous tax reduction or tax evasion.
Taxable persons must submit the VAT pre-registrations electronically.
The FÄ may grant exceptions to this rule in order to avoid undue hardship.
The annual VAT return can be submitted in paper form or via the Internet with or without certification.
If the tax is paid without certification, the taxable person must make the declaration additionally on paper and with his personal signature.
If no VAT pre-registrations or declarations are made, the tax administration is entitled to make a rough estimate of the turnover achieved by the taxable person6.
In the event of a late levy, the taxpayer may be charged a late fee (up to 10% of the tax liability or up to an amount of 25,000 euros).
In an earlier examination, the BRH found that the FÄ often did not charge this delay surcharge.
In cases where the FÄ levied the late surcharges, the amount was fixed inconsistently and arbitrarily.
The delay surcharge therefore misses its purpose of reducing the average delay, especially in the submission of the annual VAT return.
The form of the VAT declaration contains separate lines for value information on intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions.
There are also separate lines for the provision of services.
Non-taxable sales are to be stated in a separate line of the VAT return.
The VAT declarations submitted on paper must either be scanned or electronically recorded by specially designated personnel.
The data of electronically filed tax returns are directly available to the financial administration.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
After all data is collected electronically, they are subjected to a risk management procedure and a false selection is made on the basis of certain standards.
The VAT declarations selected in this way must be checked by the responsible clerk on the basis of the automatically generated test instructions (see 5.2).
Although the tax administration only has to make a rough estimate of the VAT liability, it still has to be as accurate as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, taxable persons must file their VAT returns no later than 25 days after the end of the tax period.
Depending on the taxable person's turnover, the tax period is either the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
In Germany, taxable persons must file their pre-registrations at the latest 10 days after the end of the calendar quarter or the calendar month, depending on the amount of their tax liability of the previous year.
The annual VAT declaration must be submitted by 31 May of the following year at the latest.
The obligation to file an annual VAT return has some advantages and disadvantages:
+ After the end of the calendar year, the taxpayer can correct the errors in the monthly pre-registrations by submitting a single VAT return;
– If the taxpayer amends his information on intra-Community transactions, the correction cannot be assigned to a specific reporting period of the ZM;
– The federal states do not compare MIAS data on intra-Community acquisitions of German taxable persons until the annual VAT declarations have usually been processed.
According to the registration (see 4.1.3), German entrepreneurs must file a VAT return regardless of the amount of their turnover.
This duty enables the German financial administration to verify compliance with the sales ceiling for small entrepreneurs.
In addition, the responsible FA can compare the annual VAT declaration with the corresponding declarations for direct taxes and with the annual financial statements of the company concerned.
In the Czech Republic, the tax administration can only check the amount of turnover on the basis of the income tax return.
In contrast to the current regulations in the Czech Republic, German taxable persons are obliged to submit the VAT pre-registration electronically.
The introduction of the obligation to file a tax return electronically in the Czech Republic would increase the efficiency of the Czech financial administration.
Summary notifications
Submission and processing of summary notifications in the Czech Republic
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 102 of Law No. 235/2004, an entrepreneur who delivers goods to a person registered in another Member State for tax purposes must submit corresponding summary notifications (hereinafter referred to as "ZM").
The value of the delivered goods is always stated in the ZM in Czech currency, broken down according to USt-IdNr7, the individual taxable person under whom they are registered in the other Member State.
Information on services is not provided in the ZM.
Taxable persons with a calendar-monthly or quarterly tax period must hand over the ZM to the local FA at the latest on the 25th day after the end of each quarter.
Inaccurate data must be corrected in a correction ZM within 15 days after the error has been detected.
Incorrect data in the ZM is always replaced by the data from the correction ZM.
Similar to tax returns, taxable persons can also submit the ZM electronically.
If a taxable person does not surrender a ZM or correction ZM, even though he is obliged to do so under Law No. 235/2004, the tax officer must ask him to surrender the relevant ZM and refer him to the consequences of the non-delivery. In the event of non-compliance with non-monetary obligations, the tax officer is authorised to impose repeated fines of up to CZK 2 million in accordance with Section 37 of Law No. 337/1992.
In its examination, the NKO found that the FÄ mostly did not use their power to impose fines on their defaulting taxable persons.
In particular, taxable persons are not sufficiently motivated to fulfil their obligations when submitting the ZM, as the omission of a ZM does not affect the amount of their VAT liability.
Pursuant to Section 102(5) of Law No. 235/2004, the tax officer is obliged to check the information in the ZM or Amending ZM, to remove all ambiguities and to use the information to determine the tax liability.
In case of disagreement
8 of the information in the ZM with which the taxpayer corrects false information in the ZM by submitting a correction ZM either on his own initiative or upon request.
The financial officer must correct the data on deliveries of goods to other Member States in the ATIS system if:
– the taxpayer does not prove the accuracy of the information reported in the ZM (or Amending ZM) and therefore corrects it by submitting an Amending ZM;
– the financial officer has proven the inaccuracy of the information reported by the taxpayer in the ZM or Amending ZM.
Corrections entered by the tax officer without a correction ZM from the taxpayer's side do not replace the taxable person's obligation to submit a correction ZM, but only lead to the correction of the data in the MIAS, so that these are up-to-date, complete and accurate.
The data from the ZM will be forwarded to the Member States concerned.
Only the national financial authority designated for cooperation with the other Member States in the area of VAT may transmit and receive this data.
This is the CLO (in the Czech Republic this function is performed by the Department of International Administrative Assistance in the field of VAT in the Ministry of Finance). The "O_MCTL" message is automatically sent to the CLO from the other Member States.
It contains all incorrect USt ID no. specified in the transmitted ZM lines.
If the incorrect USt-IdNr. is used in some of the transmitted lines of the ZM or the corrected ZM, an entry is made in the list of the wrong USt-IdNr.
The list contains a "Notice of Doubts Regarding USt-IdNr.".
The financial officer checks the data and enters the result of the review into the system.
When purchasing goods from another Member State, the taxpayer must indicate this in his VAT return and enter the value of the purchase in the lines of the VAT return specified for this purpose.
Selected cases of differences between the values of the purchases made by the Czech taxable person in his VAT return and the values for the delivery of goods specified by the supplier from the other Member State in his ZM are forwarded by the CLO to the responsible FA for examination.
The clerks there must investigate the deviations.
There can then be three different situations:
a) The value indicated by the Czech purchaser in the relevant categories of his VAT return is lower than the value of the deliveries indicated by the suppliers from other EC Member States.
In this case, the financial officer checks the accuracy of the information.
b) The difference is zero.
This situation can result either from a change in the information within the EC (the foreign supplier corrects its ZM) or from a change in the information in the VAT return (the Czech taxable person in the meantime submits a supplementary VAT return on his own initiative).
In this case, it is at the discretion of the tax officer to check the accuracy of the information in the VAT return anyway.
(c) The value of the goods purchased from other Member States, as indicated by the Czech taxpayer in his VAT return, is higher than the value of their deliveries reported by the suppliers of the other EC Member States.
Here again, it is at the discretion of the financial officer to verify the accuracy of the information.
After reviewing the differences and clarifying the reasons for their occurrence, the financial officer enters the results of his review in ATIS.
These results are forwarded to the CLO.
The number of transactions sent by the CLO for review can be seen for the individual quarters of 2005 from Graph No. 1 (source: Czech Ministry of Finance).
Figure 1 above shows that the number of cases submitted by the CLO to the FÄ for each quarter of 2005 has decreased.
The significant reduction in the number in the 4th quarter of 2005 is due, among other things, to the fact that the Czech CLO has raised the threshold for a false selection, taking into account the minimum amount limit for a request for information to the other EC Member States.
Deviations between the information in the VAT declarations and the data from the EC do not always have to be based on an error of the domestic purchaser.
There may also be an error on the part of the taxpayer in another Member State or an error caused by the fact that certain types of deliveries are indicated differently in the ZM in the individual EC Member States.
The most common reasons for deviations in the value of reported transactions found in the audited FÄ are shown in Table 1.
Submission and processing of the summary reports in Germany
Entrepreneurs who make intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EC Member States or participate in triangular transactions must submit quarterly ZMs in which intra-Community deliveries are listed by purchaser (Section 18a (1) UStG).
The ZM must be submitted no later than the 10th day of the month following the calendar quarter in question.
If a long-term extension is granted for the submission of VAT pre-registrations, this also applies to the ZM.
The ZM must be handed over to the CLO.
The electronic levy has been mandatory since 1 January 2007.
The responsible FA may allow exemptions for individual taxable persons in order to avoid undue hardship.
If the taxable person determines that the ZM was faulty, he is obliged to submit a correction ZM within one month.
In case of non-delivery of the ZM, the CLO initiates an enforcement procedure.
This includes the following steps: – first reminder – second reminder, coupled with the threat that a penalty will be imposed and – fixing the penalty.
Although the German Tax Code allows the fixing of a penalty payment of up to 25,000 euros (section 329 AO), the CLO sets fines of 125, 250 and 500 euros in three stages.
In addition, Section 26a (1) No. 5 UStG stipulates that the taxable person acts improperly if he intentionally or recklessly does not deliver a ZM correctly, not completely or not in time or if he does not correct a ZM or does not correct it in time.
This infringement can be punished with a fine of up to 5,000 euros.
Data on intra-Community deliveries cannot be entered by the FÄ into the MIAS, because the CLO is exclusively responsible for processing the ZM.
The data of the ZM is only stored at the CLO.
The information from the summary messages is only available to the FÄ after their processing by the CLO.
The deadlines for processing ZM are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
The data of the ZM must be stored within three months after the respective calendar quarter (in MIAS).
In the case of incorrect USt-IdNr. in the ZM of German taxable persons, the German CLO receives a notification "O_MCTL" from the other Member State.
The CLO then turns to the entrepreneur and requests the right data.
If the CLO fails to obtain the correct information, the case will be submitted to the relevant FA.
It is then up to him to request the right information.
In the course of its examination, the BRH found that most entrepreneurs corrected the USt-IdNr. at the request of the CLO.
However, remembering and threatening and fixing up to three consecutive fines takes too much time when a taxpayer may be involved in cross-border carousel fraud.
The cases, which were finally reported to the competent FÄ, were usually completed within one to two months.
The relevant FA refused tax exemption for reported intra-Community deliveries in 73% of these cases9.
If the taxpayer provided the correct VAT ID number, the FA asked him to submit a corrected ZM to the CLO, because the FÄ cannot correct the MIAS data themselves.
The BRH found that neither the FÄ nor the CLO controlled the surrender of the corrected ZM.
Therefore, the taxable persons often did not comply with the request. Since the CLO has no access to the data of the VAT declarations, there is no comparison of the information given in the VAT pre-registrations or the VAT declaration about goods deliveries with the corresponding information in the ZM before these data are forwarded to the CLO of the other Member States.
This comparison can only be made by the FÄ. This is usually done during the preparation of a special VAT audit.
Data received from other Member States will be processed by the CLO.
Inaccurate VAT IDs are detected and reported to the Member States concerned.
The data will be used for the control of employment taxation in the FÄ.
As soon as they are available in the system, it compares the CLO with the data from previous calendar quarters.
If they meet certain criteria (see 5.2), control notifications are created and transmitted to the competent FÄ.
This is done continuously, whereas a list of the acquisition data of all VAT-payers is created later and forwarded to the FÄ.
The risk management system (RMS) for the investment procedure then compares this data with those for intra-Community acquisitions.
The system fully (only) checks those entrepreneurs who are not fully entitled to deduct input tax.
Comparison and evaluation
In the Czech Republic, taxable persons who have made intra-Community deliveries to a person registered for VAT in another Member State must submit a ZM to the local FA within 25 days of the end of the calendar quarter.
The FÄ process the ZM and forward the data to the CLO.
The values of intra-Community deliveries reported by the taxable persons in the ZM are compared with the values of intra-Community deliveries indicated by the same taxable persons in their VAT declarations.
The results of the comparison will be taken into account in the context of the tax determination.
In Germany, taxable persons who have made intra-Community deliveries are obliged to submit quarterly ZM within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter10.
Since 1 January 2007, taxable persons must submit the ZM electronically to the CLO.
The data from the ZM are only available to the FÄ after their processing at the CLO.
Both in the Czech Republic and in Germany, the taxable persons in the ZM only indicate the deliveries of goods.
The provision of services is not specified in the ZM. Unlike the Czech FÄ, the German FÄ cannot correct erroneous information in individual lines of the submitted ZM itself.
Because of this limited access to the German MIAS data, incorrect USt-IdNr. were not corrected even if the taxable person communicated the correct USt-IdNr. to the FA.
The German tax administration does not compare the information on intra-Community deliveries, which German taxable persons make in their VAT pre-registrations, with the information of the corresponding ZM.
Differences between the data of the pre-registration and the ZM are regularly not revealed before the German CLO transmits the MIAS data to other Member States.
Based on these findings of the BRH, it is obvious that a comparison would improve the reliability of the transmitted MIAS data.
The data transmitted by other Member States on deliveries of goods to Czech taxable persons will be compared in the Czech Republic with the data on purchases of goods indicated by Czech taxable persons in their VAT returns.
The Czech CLO performs the comparison separately for each calendar quarter.
The most serious cases of deviations are forwarded to the FÄ for examination.
Unlike the Czech financial administration, the German financial administration does not generally examine the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.
Such general control is only carried out for taxable persons who are not fully entitled to deduct input tax.
In addition, the German tax administration controls the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other taxable persons only if the RMS has drawn up an inspection notice or if the taxable person has already been selected for an audit.
This procedure relieves the FÄ from clarifying the reasons for the differences that arise.
On the other hand, the detection of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
In order to combat carousel fraud, updated information on intra-Community acquisitions must be available as early as possible.
The current ZM system, in particular MIAS, provides financial authorities with information that may well be half a year old.
This time delay could be reduced to up to four months if taxpayers had to surrender monthly ZM.
The monthly levy would only increase the bureaucratic burden insignificantly, since most taxable persons in the Czech Republic and Germany are already obliged to submit monthly VAT declarations or pre-registrations and no more information is required for the ZM than for the VAT declarations or pre-registrations.
In order to avoid bureaucracy, the submission of the ZM could be linked to the submission of VAT declarations or pre-registrations.
However, an obligation to submit ZM monthly would cause more periodic discrepancies between the information on intra-Community deliveries and those on intra-Community acquisitions and would increase the data flows between the CLO.
In 2006, the Federal Government considered the general introduction of monthly ZM.
The implementation failed due to the concerns of the federal states.
They feared that a monthly transfer of MIAS data to the CLO of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In order for the obligation to submit ZM monthly to be effective, it is necessary to agree on the uniform monthly levy at European level, so that a monthly update of the MIAS data is possible.
Statistical information on goods deliveries and acquisitions between the Czech Republic and Germany
In foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the Czech Republic.
The total turnover of intra-Community trade in goods between the Czech Republic and Germany is shown in Table No. 2.
Both courts of auditors requested data on the number of incorrect tax numbers or VAT IDs in the O_MCTL notifications exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany for each quarter audited.
These data can be found in the following tables.
They have significant differences.
The reason for the differences can be a different calculation basis for the number of O_MCTL messages.
While the Czech CLO refers the numbers to the calendar quarter for which the ZM was submitted, the German CLO refers its numbers to the calendar quarter in which O_MCTL message was received.
International exchange of information at level 3
Implementation of the international exchange of information in the Czech Republic
The international exchange of information allows tax officials to obtain information from other Member States on intra-Community transactions and on the taxable persons who have carried them out.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on mutual assistance in the field of VAT, repealing Directive (EEC) No 218/92 (hereinafter "Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003"), distinguishes between two basic types of exchange of information: the exchange of information on request and the spontaneous exchange of information (without prior request).
The international exchange of information on request is carried out by a request for information (RFI) using the standardized SCAC print.
The financial officials in the Czech Republic send their RFIs or their responses to a received RFI to the CLO through the Finance Directorate. This concerns the translation into the foreign language of the information provided in the standardised SCAC print and the forwarding to the other Member States.
The CLO also receives requests for information (RFI) from other Member States and replies to requests sent. It provides for their translation into Czech and their distribution to the competent FÄ for processing.
Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 sets a maximum period of three months from receipt of the request for its processing.
All RFIs exchanged between the Czech Republic and Germany during the audited period have been audited by the NCF.
Out of the total number of 94 RFIs received from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were processed within the three-month period; in a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) this processing period was exceeded.
In the remaining one case, no reply had been sent to Germany until the NK’s examination. More detailed information on the deadlines within which the Czech Republic responded to requests made by Germany can be found in Figure 2.
From the total number of 335 requests for information (RFIs) sent to Germany from the Czech Republic, 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) received a reply within the three-month period; another 179 (i.e. 53.4%) were processed after the expiry of this period and in 19 cases no reply had yet been received from Germany (in the remaining one case it could not be determined on the basis of the stated information when Germany answered the request for information).
More detailed information on the deadlines within which requests for information from the Czech Republic from Germany were answered can be found in Figure 3.
The percentages of the values of intra-Community sales stated in the requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany are shown in Figure 4.
The graph above shows that the sales audited in connection with requests for information mostly had values of over 60,000 euros.
The international exchange of information without prior request takes place either automatically, structured automatically or in the form of spontaneous information.
Financial officials from other Member States are often provided with information without prior request, which is important for determining the VAT liability.
In the Czech Republic, all information is collected by the CLO.
The exchange of information between the individual Member States takes place electronically.
"Automatic exchange" in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 means the systematic transmission of pre-defined information to other Member States at regular, pre-determined intervals without prior request.
"Structured automatic exchange" means the systematic transmission of previously defined information to another Member State without its prior request as soon as the information in question is available.
The Czech Republic informs the other Member States in the automatic exchange of information on deliveries of new vehicles.
The financial officer obtains this information from the pre-printed notification of the delivery of a new vehicle in accordance with Section 19 of Law No. 235/2004 as well as from the copy of the invoice issued.
When processing this form, the financial officer enters the required data in the corresponding document template and forwards it directly to the responsible employee of the Finance Directorate, where this data is collected and sent to the CLO for further processing. These data will then be transmitted to the other Member States within the specified period, i.e. no later than two months after the end of the quarter in which they were obtained.
The Czech Republic also provides information to other Member States on transactions in mail order which are tax-free in the country of origin, on intra-Community transactions which appear inadmissible and on potential "missing traders".
This information is transmitted to the other Member States by means of a SCAC print in the spontaneous exchange of information.
Implementation of the international exchange of information in Germany
In Germany, the initiative for requests for information and spontaneous exchange of information originates from the locally responsible FA.
The FÄ send the completed form SCAC 2004 by e-mail directly to the German CLO, which forwards the SCACVordrucke to the foreign CLO.
The FÄ are instructed to write their requests for information or spontaneous information only in German, even the used SCACVordruck is single-language.
Half of the German requests for information examined by the BRH were submitted in order to ensure employment taxation in the other Member State or to demonstrate the tax exemption of intra-Community deliveries from Germany to the other Member State.
If the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it examines whether the value of the deliveries mentioned in the request exceeds the minimum amount limit of 15,000 euros.
If there is no adequate justification for the request, the German CLO refuses to provide information regarding a turnover below the minimum amount limit.
In addition, the German CLO provides for the translation of the freely formulated texts in SCAC print (B1-17) or (E) if they are not written in German or English.
In order to answer the request for information, the CLO directs this to the responsible FA and refers to the three-month period.
No further deadlines have been set at the various levels of the German financial administration.
Although the German CLO has the technical means to monitor the maintenance of the deadline, it does not have the necessary personnel capacity to remind the FÄ of the answer to the unfinished requests for information.
The FÄ receive the required information by letter from the taxable person or by carrying out an external audit.
The external auditors usually choose between two types of audit: the special VAT audit, which covers all taxable transactions within a period of several months, or the so-called VAT review, which may only refer to a recent transaction.
With this short and flexible form of examination, an announcement to the taxpayer is not necessary and it has proven itself in the investigation of a single turnover.
In the case of the automatic exchange of information, Germany will provide the other Member State with the following information: – via VAT ID number, which has been allocated to companies established in other EC Member States – on the refund of input tax to entrepreneurs established in other EC Member States.
In addition, Germany has undertaken to provide the other EC Member States with the following information in the context of the structured automatic exchange of information:
a. Delivery of new vehicles to entrepreneurs without UStIdNr., b. Distance sales (shipping) to other EC Member States that are not subject to VAT in Germany, c. Significant deviations between the acquisitions reported by a taxable person and the MIAS data transmitted by other Member States, i.e. intra-Community deliveries of goods that have been incorrectly subject to taxation by the taxable person in Germany, e. potential "missing traders" who have made intra-Community transactions, regardless of whether their U.S. ID
Comparison and evaluation
The sending of requests for information or spontaneous information takes place both in the Czech Republic and in Germany on the initiative of the locally responsible FÄ, which transmit the corresponding SCACVordrucke to the CLO.
While the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCACVordprints (Czech-English) and translates information into English or German, the German FÄ follow the instructions to write requests for information or spontaneous information on a single-language form only in German.
The German CLO does not produce translations of German texts.
When examining requests for information between the Czech Republic and Germany in the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005, the NKO found that the Czech financial administration completed 74.5% of the requests for information received within the three-month period, while the requests for information addressed to Germany were dealt with by the German financial administration only in 40.6% of the cases within this period.
Although the German CLO refers the FÄ to the three-month period, it does not monitor its compliance.
Due to the lack of memories, there is a high proportion of answered requests for information.
That is why the BRH has recommended a continuous reminder procedure to the German CLO.
The situation has changed in the meantime.
According to the information available to us, the German CLO now reminds the tax offices to answer the pending requests for information.
VAT risk management
Risk management in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, several organisational units at different levels of financial management are involved in risk management in the area of VAT.
Within the Czech Ministry of Finance, the following organisational units are responsible for risk management and the fight against VAT fraud:
The Department of Methodology and Economic Management of Value Added Tax or its Department of Risk Management deals with the identification of potential risk fields for tax revenue and evaluates the trends in these risks in domestic and intra-Community trade.
At the national level, this body coordinates the requirements for the criterion "credibility of VAT returns" and uses the MIAS data to discover possible tax evasion in the context of intra-Community deliveries and acquisitions.
Based on data on the trade balance of the Czech Republic, it evaluates high-risk goods, prepares risk management in the area of VAT conceptually and cooperates in this area with the competent EC institutions and the other Member States.
The Department of International Administrative Assistance in the field of VAT provides inter alia for the exchange of information, participates in the creation and maintenance of a relevant information database, evaluates the data of other Member States available in the MIAS system, carries out public relations work and is responsible for other forms of intergovernmental administrative assistance within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003.

The Department of Methodology of Tax Examination and Tax Investigation leads, among other things, To carry out risk analyses in the context of the methodological management of tax audits, to establish priorities for the work plan of the financial directorates with regard to the selection of the cases to be examined, to prepare risk analyses to combat tax evasion and, in this context, to collect information from the financial administration as well as other sources and to make proposals for measures to combat tax evasion.
Tax investigation offices exist at the financial directorates. Their tasks include the search for taxable persons and industries that are risky in terms of the frequency of tax evasion (e.g. Internet transactions, gold, pharmaceutical industry), the search for unregistered taxable persons (e.g. in the Internet services, employment services, electronic and print media, etc.), the investigation of links in chain fraud cases and the information of local financial authorities.
Special examination units have been set up in 12 selected FÄs.
These have regional competence and, on the basis of appropriate authorisation, carry out tax audits outside the local area of competence of the FÄ.
The need to set up the special audit units resulted from the increase in identified new and "improved" forms of tax evasion, particularly in connection with chain transactions.
These special units check according to the needs of the tax investigators or focus on taxable persons with certain activities, multinational companies and taxable persons with particularly high turnovers.
The following mechanisms for reducing the risks in the area of VAT have been integrated into the ATIS system: – the task of "credibility of VAT returns" to assess the risk-prone nature of tax returns; – the task of "selection of taxable persons to be audited", whereby the taxable persons to be audited are selected on the basis of certain criteria; – the task of "IAS", which allows financial officials access to the data provided by the other EC Member States.
The "MIAS" task allows, inter alia: – verification of the validity of the VAT ID no. of taxable persons from other Member States, – confirmation of the value of the goods delivered to a Czech taxable person, as stated in the ZM by all suppliers of the taxable person concerned from other Member States, – preparation of a list of taxable persons who have not submitted ZM, – formal control of the information that taxable persons in the Czech Republic have provided in their ZM before this information is transmitted to other Member States, – compilation of a
As part of their duties to combat tax evasion, tax officials have access to data from government agencies such as the Commercial Register, Land Registry, Motor Vehicle Register, Trade Register, etc.
More detailed information can be found in Section 4.4.1 Submission and processing of the summary notifications in the Czech Republic.
Risk management in Germany
Due to their federal structure, both the federal financial authorities (in particular the CLO) and the financial administrations of the 16 federal states are involved in the development and introduction of an RMS in the Federal Republic of Germany.
Although there are joint working groups for development, neither the CLO nor the financial administrations of the federal states have a fully uniform database.
At the level of the CLO, the ST I 2 unit (hereinafter referred to as "KUSS" – Coordination Office for Special Sales Tax Examinations and Tax Investigations) collects the audit findings on fraud in the OPUS database.
In cooperation with the countries, another database called ZAUBER was set up at KUSS. There, the tax offices can enter and query the names of discovered Missing Traders or VAT fraudsters.
The KUSS coordinates both related cases of VAT fraud at national level and cases of cross-border VAT fraud.
The experiences of KUSS are brought into the development of the RMS through their participation in the working groups.
In addition, experts from several other organizational units of the CLO and the BMF are also involved.
The formal review of the composition of UStIdNr. of other Member States appearing in the ZM of German taxpayers will be carried out at the CLO.
This formal review takes place before the ZM is transmitted to other Member States in order to improve the reliability of the MIAS data and thus its usefulness (see 4.4.2).
The validity of the USt-IdNr. referred to in the ZM is checked on the basis of the O_MCTL identifiers transmitted by the other Member States (for the procedure for correcting invalid USt-IdNr., see also 4.4.2).
In addition, the CLO's RMS is based on the MIAS data provided by the other Member States and generates various types of communications to detect suspected missing traders. As clues, certain features are used, which usually occur in carousel shops.
The FÄ of the federal states are instructed to process these communications and have to forward the results of their investigations to the CLO in certain cases.
The audit by the BRH confirmed that all available features must be included in order to conclude with sufficient probability on a case of tax fraud (instead of focusing mainly on the turnover of a company).
Accordingly, the BRH has recommended to the BMF to work with combinations of different clues in the preparation of the messages.
The risk management system should also take into account other indications, e.g. the taxable person's payment behaviour, the industry or the company's shareholding relationships.
A second level of risk management exists with the financial administrations of the federal states and focuses on the processing of VAT pre-registrations and annual declarations.
For example, the system creates a list of taxable persons who have indicated intra-Community deliveries in their VAT pre-registration or annual declaration.
This list is sent to the CLO to monitor the complete submission of the ZM.
Furthermore, in this type of risk management, the acquisitions indicated by the taxpayer in his annual VAT return are compared with the data in the MIAS.
The financial administrations of the federal states avoid a comparison of the quarterly data, as these would result in too many inconsistencies, which are due to factors other than tax evasion or tax fraud; e.g.:
– Supplier and acquirer assume different dates for the execution of intra-Community sales;
– different accounting and tax declaration of Skonti and discounts.
In addition to comparing the information from the VAT declarations with the MIAS data, many federal states have certain risk management mechanisms based on information in the VAT declarations and certain other indications (e.g. Company word, age of the owner/participant, number of employees and method of payment of the taxpayer).
Bavaria has introduced a risk management system based on fixed rules, which allows a team of specialists in the fight against tax fraud (hereinafter referred to as "risk managers") to program their own rules in such a way that suspected tax fraudsters are filtered out.
This system is used in the processing of sales tax pre-registrations by the FÄ.
As a result, the responsible FA receives the information of the RMS before the value added tax is set.
Since this system is not capable of learning, risk managers have to adapt the rules according to the feedback from the FÄ.
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has developed an adaptive neural network based on the data of uncovered cases of evasion.
Based on this data, the RMS is able to learn the characteristics of tax evasion.
The system compiles a monthly list of tax cases where there is evidence of tax evasion.
On the basis of this list, the competent authorities decide on the examination of the taxable persons concerned.
After the audit, tax auditors must report their results so that the RMS can learn from the results of the tests it proposes.
In North Rhine-Westphalia, an adaptive neural network is used in combination with a rule-based fuzzy system.
Based on a lot of data from processed VAT returns and some other clues, this neuro fuzzy system (also called data mining system) calculates how likely it is that a taxable person is involved in tax fraud.
It then compiles a monthly list of suspected tax fraudsters.
On the basis of this list, the FÄ selects the taxable persons concerned for examination and reports the test results to the data center in question.
The introduction of these three RMS is underway in the federal states.
Since each of these three risk management systems is based on a different approach, the combination of all three anti-fraud systems seems expedient.
It remains to be seen whether the hoped-for effects will occur during actual use.
Comparison and evaluation
Although it is not possible in this report to deal with the specific criteria of the RMS in the Czech Republic and Germany, the NKE and the BRH have found that each Member State has developed its own RMS.
Like the different approaches in the three above-mentioned German federal states, the RMS of each European state has its particular strengths and weaknesses.
There is currently an exchange of experience between the financial authorities of the European Member States on new trends and new models of cross-border VAT fraud.
VAT fraud – especially carousel fraud – has proved to be not a national but a European problem.
The people involved in fraud coordinate their actions not only in one but in several Member States.
A Member State alone cannot develop an effective RMS.
Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each EC Member State. Failure to do so will result in fraudsters selecting the Member State with the weakest RMS for their crimes.
The tax losses caused by Europe-wide VAT fraud do not necessarily affect the Member State where the initiator is based.
Any other Member State involved in the fraud may be affected.
That is why there should be a European exchange of experience on the RMS.
Selected results from the examination of individual sales In the context of the parallel tests, the NK and the BRH examined the quality and usability of information on selected deliveries and/or deliveries.
Acquisitions which were the subject of the international exchange of information between the financial administrations of the Czech Republic and Germany.
In addition, the two courts of auditors jointly examined the handling of several deliveries, the implementation of which was in doubt, or which the taxable persons of both states explained differently in the tax returns or ZM.
At the request of the BRH, the National Chamber of Commerce examined a total of eight transactions between eight Czech and eight German taxable persons.
In addition, on the basis of communications from the BRH, the NKE examined the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany, which Czech taxable persons had indicated in their tax returns and ZM in 43 cases.
At the request of the NK, the BRH checked a total of 23 deliveries between 23 German and 21 Czech taxable persons.
The relevant information was exchanged exclusively on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 on the CLO.
The examination of the selected cases showed, inter alia, that the different registration procedures in the EC Member States lead to the problems mentioned in Chapter 4.1:
1.
According to the MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004, a Czech taxable person purchased goods worth 60,500 euros from a German taxable person.
When the Czech taxable person declared an acquisition of only 29,869 euros, the Czech tax administration sent a request for information to Germany in order to check the value of the delivered goods.
The German side stated in its reply to the Czech request for information that the German taxable person in question had delivered goods to his Czech business partner in the second quarter of 2004 to the value of 27,381 euros, in the third quarter goods to the value of 31,997 euros and in the fourth quarter to the value of 10,276 euros.
Furthermore, it emerged from the answer that the VAT ID number of the German taxable person was not valid until September 28, 2004. However, the German CLO had granted a further application by the German taxable person and had brought forward the validity of the USt-IdNr. retroactively as of May 1, 2004.
The German taxpayer corrected the ZM.
On the basis of this information, it was a (internal) purchase of goods by the Czech taxable person.
In a request to the competent tax office in the Czech Republic, the NKA found that in 2004 the Czech taxable person had issued supplementary VAT returns for the individual (under-year) tax periods in which he declared a higher value of the purchases from other Member States and at the same time sought the deduction of input tax from the purchases from the other Member States.
On the basis of these additional VAT declarations, the responsible clerk of the Czech tax office could not clearly determine whether the value of the deliveries of the above-mentioned German supplier was also included in the declared acquisitions.
In response to a request for information from the National Chamber of Commerce, the BRH stated that the German supplier had been registered in September 2003 as subject to VAT.
At the time of registration, however, he had not applied for the allocation of a VAT ID number, but only a tax number that ultimately applied to Germany.
Although it is usually not possible in Germany to assign a VAT ID number retroactively to a taxable person, this was done in 2006 by the responsible clerk of the German tax administration retroactively as of 1 May 2004.
The German CLO assigns a USt-IdNr. retroactively if the German entrepreneur has not caused the delayed allocation; e.g. if the CLO caused the delay after the taxable person's request for the issuance of a USt-IdNr.
In this case, the CLO grants the USt-IdNr. retroactively, because the entrepreneur does not need a valid USt-IdNr. for an intra-Community delivery according to Section 6 UStG.
Conversely, a German acquirer does not need the (valid) VAT ID number of his supplier to declare the intra-Community acquisition.
Because of these procedural differences between the Member States, the German CLO retroactively issued the USt-IdNr. in this particular case.
2.
As part of the international exchange of information, the Czech financial officer asked for a review of the VAT registration of the German entrepreneur.
From the MIAS data, the date of registration is 5 March 2005, while a registration certificate issued by the local German FA indicates 1 October 2004.
The German authorities stated in their reply that the German taxable person had been registered on 1 October 2004, but for organizational reasons it was not until 16 February 2005 that a USt-IdNr. was assigned in Germany.
In response to a request from the local Czech tax official, the NKO learned that the tax officer had carried out a VAT audit with the Czech taxable person for the tax periods from the third quarter of 2004 to the second quarter of 2005.
During this audit, the tax office found that the Czech taxable person had declared in his VAT return services worth CZK 9,897 which he had rendered to the German taxable person before his VAT registration (i.e. before 1 October 2004).
The (Czech) tax office imposed a tax liability of CZK 1,880 on the Czech taxpayer for the third quarter of 2004.
On the basis of a request from the National Chamber of Commerce, the BRH found that the German taxable person had only been assigned the VAT ID number when he registered his company, which was founded in 2004, with the FA on 16 February 2005.
In addition, the FA registered him retroactively from 1 October 200415 for VAT purposes in order to be able to monitor the submission of the VAT return for 2004.
In this VAT return, the taxable person stated intra-Community acquisitions from the Czech Republic to the value of 160 euros (approx. CZK 5,000).
3. In his VAT return for September 2004 and in his ZM for the third quarter of 2004, a Czech taxable person reported deliveries of goods worth CZK 114,615 to a German taxable person.
When checking the registration of the German taxable person in the system MIAS, the Czech tax officer stated that this registration was only valid from 11 November 2004 and thus after the delivery of goods to Germany.
The Czech taxable person issued a supplementary VAT return in which he declared sales from domestic deliveries to the value of CZK 114,615 and VAT to the amount of CZK 21,777, which he paid.
By making a request to the locally competent FA in the Czech Republic, the NKO found that the Czech taxable person subsequently filed an application for the resumption of the tax procedure in respect of the supplementary VAT return. As evidence, he submitted a confirmation from the German tax administration that the German taxable person had been registered since 1 January 2000.
Accordingly, the Czech tax officer checked the validity of the registration of the German taxable person in the context of the international exchange of information.
From the German information it emerged that the German taxable person had only been assigned a VAT ID no. on 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of delivery of the goods.
As a result, the Czech tax officer rejected the request to resume the tax procedure.
The BRH found that in this case no intra-Community purchase of goods had taken place because the German taxable person had only received a VAT ID no. on 11 November 2004.
However, the German recipient explained both the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and the value added tax on it and also demanded the reimbursement of input taxes in the same amount.
Because this did not lead to a change in the amount of the tax liability of the German taxpayer, the German tax officer did not correct the information in the VAT return.
Furthermore, the BRH found that the company of the German taxable person mentioned in the request for information was changed during the processing of the reply in Germany, which led to confusion between two German taxable persons.
This change in the name of the German taxable person also confused the Czech tax official.
4.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German tax officer reviewed the purchase of goods in the first quarter of 2005 by a Czech taxable person from a German taxable person valued at 22,686 euros.
In a request to the local competent tax official in the Czech Republic, the NKO found that the Czech tax officer had examined in an external audit with the Czech taxable person whether the intra-Community delivery had actually taken place and whether the Czech taxable person had booked and paid the invoice for the delivery of the goods.
The Czech taxable person did not declare the intra-Community acquisition in his VAT return, because the German supplier did not specify his VAT ID number in the invoice, but only his tax number for transactions within Germany.
According to the MIAS data, the German taxable person is not registered for VAT in connection with intra-Community transactions until 21 April 2005, i.e. after delivery to the Czech taxable person.
The Czech tax officer also requested that the German tax administration send a copy of the registration certificate of the German taxable person so that he could, if necessary, initiate a corresponding tax procedure.
The Czech FA regarded this business as the acquisition of goods from a non-entrepreneurial (private) person in Germany and therefore did not set any sales tax for the purchase of goods from Germany.
The BRH found that under German law a taxable person who delivers goods to other Member States does not have to have a VAT ID number for intra-Community deliveries in order to be able to claim the VAT exemption for such a delivery.
The supplier must only have the UStIdNr. of the purchaser in the other Member State and be able to prove the transport of the goods in question to the other Member State.
In this case, the turnover according to German tax law is a (tax-exempt) intra-Community delivery, which should be subject to income tax in the Czech Republic.
In any case, it is important that the Czech financial officer took note of this business incident, because the delivery of a machine of this value was not part of the core business of the German supplier.
As described in Section 4.6.2, the German CLO rejects requests for information on intra-Community transactions if they are below the minimum amount limit of 15,000 euros: 5.
According to the MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004 a Czech taxable person purchased goods worth 12,561 euros from a German taxable person.
The Czech financial officer carried out an audit for this tax period.
Within the framework of intergovernmental mutual assistance, the Czech financial administration requested the examination of this delivery of goods by means of a SCAC print.
The Czech taxable person stated that he had not received the goods, had never been in a business relationship with the German company and that the purchase of the goods in question had not been booked with him.
The German tax administration rejected the request for the transfer of documents – contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents – because the turnover was less than 15,000 euros and no other justification had been given.
Since the Czech tax officer did not receive any documents for a subsequent taxation of the purchased goods, the tax audit remained inconclusive and the original tax determination remained in place.
On the basis of a request from the NK, the BRH found that the German taxpayer acted as a "fiscal representative17" (section 22 (a) – (e) UStG).
The German taxable person explained these deliveries in his VAT return and in the ZM.
His right to tax exemption was recognised.
On the basis of the notification by the BRH, the German FA will send the documents required for the subsequent taxation of the purchased goods to the Czech Republic.
Section 4.6.1 showed that the responses of the German financial administration to requests for information exceeded the three-month period more often than the answers of the Czech financial administration:
6. During its audit, the NKO found that on 5 October 2005, the Czech financial administration had submitted a request for information on the value of wa-ren deliveries made to Germany in the 4th quarter of 2004.
In the ZM for this quarter, the German taxable person had reported a delivery of goods to the Czech taxable person to the value of 86,307 euros; however, the Czech taxable person declared for the same period in his VAT return only the purchase of goods to the value of 35,314 euros.
In response to the request for information received by the Czech Republic on 9 May 2006, i.e. after expiry of the maximum processing period specified in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German side indicated that the request for information could not be processed since the German company had been dissolved at the end of 2005.
Because the German tax administration did not meet the deadline for processing the request for information, the Czech tax administration did not have the documents necessary for taxation in the Czech Republic.
7. In 2005, a Czech tax official asked for a review of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German taxable person in the third and fourth quarters of 2004 to the value of 1,265,554 euros by means of a SCAC print, with indications of carousel fraud.
At the time of its examination, the NKO found that a German response to the request for information had not yet been received.
In a request to the local tax officer, the NKO found that the Czech taxable person had not declared in his VAT return the delivery of new motor vehicles to this German taxable person to the value of 11,816.103 CZK.
The Czech tax officer corrected the information in the tax return and the Czech taxable person gave a corrected ZM.
Due to technical problems, the German CLO did not forward this request for information to the local FA for examination.
Following the notification by the BRH, a special VAT audit was carried out at the German acquirer in Germany. It was found that the purchase of all vehicles concerned had been correctly taxed and that the vehicles were sold to other taxable persons in Germany.
8. According to the MIAS data, in the fourth quarter of 2004, the Czech taxable person purchased a car worth 48,500 euros from a German taxable person.
However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.
In response to a request from the local tax official in the Czech Republic, the National Chamber of Commerce found that the Czech taxable person had not filed a VAT return since August 2004.
The Czech taxable person did not file any tax returns even after being requested by the tax officer. As a result, on 23 May 2005, the FA set the VAT liability for the period October to December 2004 at zero.
On 2 June 2005, the CLO issued an instruction to examine the aforementioned delivery from the German taxable person.
Since the Czech taxable person did not cooperate with the tax official, he sent a request for information on the above-mentioned delivery to Germany.
Since the reply to the request for information was received only on 7 February 2007, it was not known until the completion of the examination of the NCD how the Czech financial officer used the information obtained in the international exchange of information.
Due to non-fulfilment of the obligations under the Czech VAT Act, the VAT registration of the Czech taxable person was deleted with effect from 23 August 2005.
In some cases, only a partial response was sent because at the time of the NK- and BRH examination, the relevant FA had not yet completed the external audit:
9.
In 2005, the Czech financial officer asked for a review of a delivery of motor vehicles to a German taxable person in the third quarter of 2004 to the value of 16,991 euros by means of a SCAC print, with indications of carousel fraud.
In his reply to the request for information, the German tax officer stated that he only had the invoices issued by the Czech taxable person for deliveries worth 16,335 euros.
On the basis of the request of the NK, the BRH found that the external audit carried out by the German FA had not yet been completed by the acquirer in Germany.
The German acquirer declared the purchase of goods worth 16,335 euros twice in his VAT pre-registrations for the months of August and September 2004.
10. In 2005, a Czech tax official asked for a review of the deliveries of motor vehicles to a German taxable person in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005 to the value of 198,167 euros by means of a SCAC print, with signs of carousel fraud.
The German tax administration sent a partial response to the request for information to the Czech Republic, in which it confirmed that the German taxpayer had purchased several motor vehicles, and that, moreover, the investigation in Germany had not yet been completed.
It found that the local FA had carried out several external audits with the Czech taxable person in order to check the deduction of above-average input taxes.
However, an unauthorised claim was not established.
The BRH found that the German taxable person had declared in his VAT returns the purchase of goods from other Member States with a total value of 579,114 euros for the period in question, and that the examination of the German FA by the acquirer in Germany has not yet been completed.
Section 4.4.1 describes the reasons for inconsistencies between the declaration of intra-Community acquisitions in the recipient's VAT return and the information in the supplier's ZM.
In the cases examined, it emerged that periodic inconsistencies 18 or the incorrect declaration of a turnover as intra-Community delivery of goods were not the most common reasons for the differences:
11.
According to data from MIAS, in the first quarter of 2005 the Czech taxable person purchased goods worth 35,716 euros from the German taxable person; however, the Czech taxable person did not declare this acquisition.
Since the Czech taxable person did not cooperate with the tax officer and did not do business at the legal headquarters of the company, the Czech tax officer asked for a review of how the German taxable person had communicated with the Czech in the context of the international exchange of information.
The German reply to the request for information showed that, according to the findings of the German tax administration, the Czech taxpayer was unknown at the address indicated and the goods were picked up by an agreed freight forwarder.
The total value of the order was 155,000 euros, but the German taxpayer only delivered goods worth 21,659 euros.
The Czech taxable person sent the German taxable person a false confirmation of payment for the amount of 155,153 euros in favour of the German taxable person.
After uncovering the fraudulent behaviour of the Czech acquirer, the German taxpayer, with the support of his other Czech customers, managed to get back the delivered material, with the exception of a part valued at 7,916 euros.
In a request to the locally competent FA in the Czech Republic, the NKO found that the financial administration, on the basis of the information received from the Czech taxable person, carried out, inter alia, retrospectively the sales taxation of goods deliveries from other Member States in the amount of CZK 388,522.
On the basis of a request from the National Chamber of Commerce, the BRH confirmed that after corrections, the German supplier had only reported a delivery of goods to the Czech taxable person in the value of 7,916 euros.
In accordance with German legislation, the German taxable person declared the reversal of the delivery and the reduction of the tax base in the quarter of the reversal.
His ZM contained the following information concerning Czech taxpayers:
12.
As part of the international exchange of information, the German financial administration requested the verification of a delivery of goods and the provision of services in the third quarter of 2005 by means of a SCACVordruck.
According to the request for information, during the period in question, the Czech taxpayer had delivered goods to the German taxpayer with a total value of 396,126 euros and provided services with a value of 11,885 euros.
It found that the Czech tax administration had carried out an audit with the Czech taxable person in order to examine this delivery.
In response to the request for information, the Czech tax administration announced that the Czech taxable person had supplied and installed a production plant for the German.
The Czech taxable person supplied the individual parts of the production plant before the accession of the Czech Republic to the EC and the production plant was assembled on the basis of the order after 1 May 2004.
The German taxable person did not remove the assembled production plant and claimed defects.
In the third quarter of 2005, the Czech taxable person charged the German production plant for 107.100 euros and 11,885 euros for services.
The German taxpayer received the bills, but did not recognize them and did not pay them.
By enquiry with the local tax official in the Czech Republic, the NKO found that all invoices in the books of the Czech taxable person had been properly booked.
The VAT returns for the third quarter of 2005 contained only the amounts documented by the Czech taxpayer and related to invoices invoiced after May 1, 2004.
The BRH found that the locally responsible FA came to the conclusion, based on the reply of the Czech tax administration, that these transactions were a uniform (goods) delivery of the Czech taxable person to the German including the assembly performed.
In this particular case, the place of performance of this so-called factory delivery is the place where the production plant is assembled.
The German service recipient of the factory delivery owes the sales tax in accordance with the German VAT Act.
At the same time, the recipient can claim a deduction in the same amount.
Since the VAT liability of the German taxable person remained unchanged, the German FA did not cause any correction of the VAT return.
13. According to the MIAS data, the Czech taxable person A purchased a machine worth 58,000 euros from the German taxable person C in February 2005.
The Czech financial officer sent a request to Germany to verify this information.
In response to the request for information, the German side announced that the German taxable person C had delivered this machine to the Czech taxable person B in 2004, but had returned it to the German taxable person C in October 2004.
According to the German tax administration, the machine was not transported back to Germany, but to the branch of the German taxable person C in the Czech Republic.
The reply to the request for information also revealed that the German taxable person C had delivered the machine to the Czech taxable person A in February 2005.
He received the machine at the headquarters of the German taxable person's office in the Czech Republic.
Since this delivery (from C to A) took place only within the Czech Republic, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods.
By enquiry with the local tax officer responsible for the taxable person B, the NKA found that according to the MIAS data, the German taxable person C had delivered goods (another machine) to the Czech taxable person in the third quarter of 2004 to the value of 88,027 euros.
Taxable person B stated that he had not received this product, so that the local Czech tax officer sent a request for information to Germany.
The answer was that the machine had been delivered.
In the course of further investigations with the taxable person B, the tax officer stated that the machine had not been booked with the taxable person B to the value of 88,027 ’ and that it could be the same type of machine as the branch of the German taxable person C had delivered to the Czech taxable person A in February 2005.
It also found that the Czech tax officer responsible for the taxable person A had carried out an audit of the taxable person.
The tax officer had the invoice of the German taxable person C of 7 February 2005, in which the taxable person A is indicated as the recipient of the machine.
The Czech tax official stated that the taxable person A had not booked this invoice.
Taxable person A had concluded a lease agreement with another Czech company, the subject of which was a machine of the same type.
The leasing company delivered the machine on 9 February 2005 and also took care of the transport.
The Czech FA did not use the information provided in the reply to the request for information to determine the tax liability of the taxable person A.
The BRH found that the German taxable person C had delivered the machine to another German taxable person D, not to the Czech Republic, to the value of 88,027 euros.
Accordingly, there was no intra-Community delivery of goods, but a taxable delivery within Germany.
Consequently, the German tax officer did not recognize the claim of the German tax-compulsory C to VAT exemption and corrected the information in its tax return.
The German taxable person D delivered the machine to the Czech taxable person B.
According to German law, this delivery was not taxable in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the Czech Republic.
The BRH also noted that the German taxable person C had indicated in his ZM for the first quarter of 2005 the delivery of a machine worth 58,000 ’ to the Czech taxable person A.
This delivery was not checked during the tax audit carried out by the German FA.
The figure below shows the contractual relationships between the business partners involved in the above-mentioned transactions.
14.
During the examination of requests for information received, the National Chamber of Commerce found that the Czech tax administration had received a request for information from Germany on 4 October 2005, in which a German tax official requested the verification of intra-Community deliveries of a German taxable person to a Czech taxable person to the value of 879,680,625 euros.
The German financial officer stated that there was a suspicion that this was a fictitious intra-Community delivery of goods.
The German taxable person had not exercised any active business activity since 1999.
The National Court found that the Czech tax officer had carried out an external audit with the Czech taxable person.
The head of the Czech company stated that this was probably a claim of the German taxable person against the German tax administration, which the Czech taxable person had asserted as a shareholder in the German company at the German FA.
According to the information given to the NK, the Czech tax officer does not yet have any information that the German tax administration is handling the case with respect to the Czech taxable person.
From the available information it follows that it was not a delivery of goods; nevertheless, the amount in question is still stored as an intra-Community delivery of goods from Germany to a Czech taxable person in the MIAS.
The main reason for these inconsistencies was the omitted indication of the intra-Community acquisition in the tax returns of the recipients (see above). Section 4.4.1):
15. According to the MIAS data, in the period from the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005, a German taxable person delivered goods to a Czech taxable person with a total value of 33,205 euros.
However, the Czech taxpayer did not declare the intra-Community acquisition.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech financial officer requested an examination of the delivery of goods from Germany.
In its reply to this request for information, the German side stated that the German taxable person had sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech taxable person, and that the other goods had been collected personally.
By enquiry with the locally competent Czech Fi-nanzbeam, the NKO found that the Czech taxable person had filed a supplementary VAT return for the period in question before receiving a reply to the request for information.
Nevertheless, the differences regarding the values of the acquisitions could not be clarified, so that the Czech tax officer recommended a tax audit with the Czech taxable person.
This test has not yet been carried out.
16. According to the MIAS data, in the third quarter of 2004 a German taxable person had delivered goods to a Czech taxable person worth 46,854 euros.
For the same period, a Czech taxable person declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only 14,856 euros.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the Czech financial officer asked for a review of the actual value of the delivery.
With the German answer to this request, three invoices were sent, which showed a total value of the delivered goods of 31,999 euros, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech taxable person and the MIAS data.
By enquiring with the local Czech tax official, the NKx stated that after receiving the reply from Germany, he had contacted the accountant of the Czech taxable person and stayed with her in such a way that, after checking the invoices, she wanted to talk with the company owner about the submission of a supplementary VAT return for the third quarter of 2004.
So far, no supplementary VAT return has been filed.
The Czech financial officer informed the NK ’ that he would proceed in such a way that the deadlines for a retroactive VAT determination for the relevant tax period would be met.
17.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer delivered goods to the German taxpayer to the value of 11,600 euros.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information, the German tax officer asked for verification whether the aforementioned Czech taxable persons actually existed, since the alleged capital owner of the German taxable person had founded a number of sham companies in Germany.
In the course of the review of the transaction by the FA, the Czech taxpayer confirmed the purchase of the goods.
According to the Czech taxable person, however, the goods were not delivered from Germany to the Czech Republic, but were resold in Germany in 2005.
The Czech taxpayer presented evidence of the sale in January 2005.
The Czech taxable person was not registered in Germany as subject to VAT and had not taxed the sale of the goods in question either in the Czech Republic or in Germany.
All of these facts pointed to tax evasion within Germany and the Czech tax officer sent this information to the German tax administration in his reply to the request for information.
In a request to the locally competent Czech tax official, the NKO found that the Czech taxable person had filed a supplementary tax return for the fourth quarter of 2004 on the basis of a tax audit, in which he declared, among other things, the value of the goods he had purchased from a German taxable person and at the same time asserted the right of deduction of input tax for the acquisition from other Member States.
In his Czech VAT return, he did not register any VAT on the sale of goods in Germany.
Due to a supplementary VAT return, which had been issued after the external audit, the Czech tax officer fixed the VAT liability unchanged.
According to Czech legislation, in this case there was no purchase of goods from other Member States, as the goods were not shipped or transported from another Member State to the Czech Republic.
Thus, the Czech financial officer drew the wrong conclusion during the external audit.
The BRH noted that the German tax officer immediately after receiving the reply to the request for information, from which it emerged that the goods had not left Germany, corrected the tax return of the German taxable person and demanded the payment of VAT to the value of 1,600 euros.
In addition, the responsible FA sent a control notification to the FA responsible for the actual recipient of the goods to ensure that the resale of these goods is properly taxed.
In the following cases, entrepreneurs declared intra-Community deliveries which may not have been carried out:
18.
The Czech tax officer received a request for information from the German tax administration on the question whether the Czech taxable person had purchased a car worth 47,400 euros from the German taxable person in February 2005.
The request for information was accompanied as an attachment by an imprint of the VAT registration certificate of the Czech taxable person.
As a further attachment, a photocopy of the passport was attached to the person who was supposed to have transferred the vehicle.
In the course of his investigation, the Czech tax officer found that the passport had been stolen, that the person named in it had not imported a vehicle into the Czech Republic and stated that he had no contact with a German taxable person.
The VAT registration certificate, the imprint of which had been sent by the German side, had not been issued by the Czech tax administration.
With this information, the Czech financial officer answered the request for information and at the same time declared that he could not confirm the purchase of the car.
By enquiry with the local Czech tax official, the NKO found that the Czech taxable person does not have his registered office at the address indicated in the commercial register and that the managing director of the company is unavailable.
After a tax complaint procedure for the tax period February 2005, the Czech tax officer set the tax liability of the Czech taxable person at zero.
In the course of a further investigation, the Czech financial officer found that the vehicle in question had been sold to another Czech person who had purchased it on the basis of an Internet advertisement.
The BRH found that the local German tax officer had rejected the claim of the German taxable person to exempt this delivery from VAT on the basis of the Czech reply to the request for information.
19. In the course of an external audit, a German FA was not able to clarify a difference of 3,000 euros between the value of the purchased goods stated in the VAT return and the reported values from other Member States.
In the fourth quarter of 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005, a Czech taxable person should have delivered goods worth 89,424 euros to a German taxable person.
Since the acquisition declared by the German taxable person did not comply with the MIAS data, the German financial officer requested the verification of deliveries and their payment within the framework of the intergovernmental exchange of information.
In his reply to the request for information, the Czech financial officer stated that the only managing director of the Czech company had been deleted from the commercial register on 8 July 2005 and that a new managing director had not yet been registered.
The German recipient of the goods was presumably a relative of the shareholder of the Czech company.
The Czech taxable person issued a VAT return and a ZM, which had been signed by an unauthorized person, namely this shareholder of the company, after the deletion of the managing director in the commercial register.
The accountant of the Czech taxpayer informed the tax officer that the owner of the capital had deposited the payment received for the invoiced goods in euros into the company's account.
Cash receipts were not issued.
In a request to the local Czech FA, the NKO found that the tax officer had recognised the Czech taxable person's right to VAT exemption for deliveries of goods to other Member States to the value of CZK 1,326,307 in the first quarter of 2004 and CZK 1,416,180 in the first quarter of 2005.
The BRH found that the German tax officer did not correct the VAT return of the German purchaser, since in the meantime a German court had confirmed the insolvency of the German taxable person.
Since the previous external audit did not show any signs of tax fraud, there was no prospect of actually being able to collect a fixed VAT liability.
20. According to the MIAS data, in 2005 a German taxable person purchased goods from the Czech Republic to the value of 4,251,196 euros, according to which he had purchased goods to the value of 43,274 euros in the previous year.
The German taxable person declared the intra-Community acquisitions neither in his VAT declaration 2004 nor in the one for the year 2005.
In addition, he did not declare any value-appropriate initial sales.
Because of these inconsistencies, the German FA filed a request for information regarding the 4th quarter of 2005 and the 1st quarter of 2006.
In the ZM for these two quarters, a Czech supplier reported intra-Community deliveries of goods with a total value of CZK 167,246,083.
On 6 September 2006, the request for information was received, in which the German side asked to check whether the delivery notified by the Czech taxpayer had actually taken place.
In response to this request for information, the Czech tax administration stated that the German request could not be complied with because the Czech company had no managing director (or other legal representative).
It can be seen from the documents handed over to the NKE by the responsible tax officer that, together with the managing director of the Czech taxable person, a protocol was drawn up on 30 March 2006 on the start of the sales tax audit for the 4th quarter of 2004 and the period from January to December 2005.
At the same time, the taxable person was asked by the tax officer to submit all accounting and tax documents for this period, but failed to do so.
According to the Commercial Register, the term of office of the sole managing director expired on 16 May 2005 without the appointment of a new managing director.
The Czech taxpayer has not issued any VAT returns since April 2006.
In the context of the parallel examination, the NKE, in cooperation with the BRH, investigated several cases of intra-Community deliveries between the Czech Republic and Germany, which were not the subject of a prior exchange of information between the two countries.
The two audit bodies exchanged information on the audited cases via the CLO of both countries.
21. A Czech company (UCR), which is not based in Germany, informed the responsible FA (Chemnitz-Süd) that it wanted to do taxable business in Germany.
Based on this information, the company was registered from June 2005, but did not receive a German USt-IdNr.
The (UCR) accepted an order from a Danish company (UDK) for the production of wind turbines and their delivery to Austria in the name, at the risk and for the account of the Danish customer.
Due to insufficient own production capacities, the Danish company passed on part of the order to a German taxable person (UDE) based in Germany.
The following figure shows the contractual relationships and the transport route of the wind turbines:
According to German law, the place of performance of these transactions must be determined as described below:
– The Danish company (UDK) sent the wind turbines in its name, at its risk and for its own account for assembly to Austria.
Because of the installation, its delivery takes place in Austria, i.e. the delivery of the wind turbines is controllable in Austria.
– Because the freight forwarder was commissioned by the Danish company (UDK) and the latter had the transport carried out in his own name, at his own risk and for his own account, the place of delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE) is where the transport started, i.e. in Germany.
Although the wind turbines were delivered to another EC Member State (AU) and the recipient is registered as taxable in one EC Member State (CR), no tax exemption could be claimed for the delivery of the German sub-contractor (UDE), since the EC Member State for which the delivery was intended is different from the country of residence of the Czech company19.
Accordingly, the delivery is properly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (UCR) claimed the deduction of input tax in its VAT returns.
The place of delivery of the Czech company (UCR) also depends on the place where the transport started.
However, some of the wind turbines were transported from the Czech Republic and others from Germany.
– The supply of wind turbines manufactured in the Czech Republic took place in the Czech Republic.
– The delivery of the remaining wind turbines manufactured in Germany took place in Germany.
Accordingly, the Czech company (UCR) delivered both intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic to Austria and intra-Community deliveries from Germany to Austria.
The BRH found that the Czech company (UCR) did not declare intra-Community deliveries either in its German tax returns or in its ZM delivered to the German CLO.
Thus, the Czech company may have treated all its intra-Community deliveries uniformly as intra-Community deliveries from the Czech Republic.
The NKO found that (UCR) did not report intra-Community deliveries to Austria, but intra-Community deliveries to Denmark.
In order to ensure the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions in Austria, the cooperation of at least four financial administrations (Austrian, Czech, Danish and German) would be necessary, although in this case there are no signs of tax fraud or tax evasion.
In addition, the NKE and the BRH examined case designs to show the size of the differences between the information in the VAT declarations and the MIAS data caused by the different legal provisions of 2004.
The cases examined also show that it takes some time for taxable persons and the FÄ to apply the new legal provisions:
22. In its ZM for the second, third and fourth quarters of 2004, a Czech taxable person reported deliveries of goods with a total value of 792,977,452 CZK to a German taxable person.
During the same period, another Czech taxable person reported intra-Community deliveries to another German taxable person in his ZM with a total value of CZK 18,157,265.
From the information transmitted by the BRH to the NK, it emerged that in both cases they were electricity deliveries.
Both Czech taxable persons took into account the above-mentioned deliveries in their ZM in accordance with Czech Law No. 235/2004 in force in 2004.
In a further examination of these business transactions, an audit group of the NKA found that in 2004 different legal regulations on the supply or acquisition of electrical energy between the Czech Republic and Germany applied.
While in the Czech Republic the taxable persons declared the deliveries of electrical energy in accordance with the provisions of Law No. 235/2004 valid in 2004 as intra-Community deliveries of goods, according to the German legal provisions applicable in 2004 it was not an intra-Community purchase of goods, but taxable and taxable transactions in Germany.
The differences in the legal provisions were eliminated in the Czech Republic by the adoption of Law No. 635/2004, which amended some tax provisions with effect from 1 January 2005.
23. When examining intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions in cooperation with BRH, it was further established that a Czech taxable person in his ZM declared intra-Community deliveries to a German taxable person for the first and fourth quarters of 2005 with a total value of CZK 240.411.163 and another Czech taxable person in his ZM for the same period intra-Community deliveries to another German taxable person with a value of CZK 263.470.776.
Information transmitted by the BRH to the NKE revealed that in both cases it had been supplies of electrical energy.
According to the wording of Act No. 235/2004 in force from 1 January 2005, the place of performance for the supply of electrical energy is the place of performance where the purchaser has his legal domicile, place of business or place of business for which this delivery is made.
Therefore, the Czech taxable persons should not have indicated the electricity deliveries in their ZM for 2005.
The fact that both taxable persons treated the supply of electrical energy in their ZM as intra-Community deliveries led to a difference in the amount of CZK 503,881,939 in MIAS.
Conclusion
The cooperation has achieved the objectives of the BRH and the NKE.
Both audit institutions gained in-depth knowledge of VAT management systems in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The cooperation revealed differences in the two systems and in the statutory provisions governing VAT administration.
During the parallel tests, interesting cases of intra-Community deliveries or acquisitions came to light.
For some of them, a further observation is worthwhile.
On the basis of the audit results, both auditors drew up recommendations for the management of VAT.
The follow-up of these recommendations in the form of a review should be part of the follow-up.
The new experience and knowledge gained through the cooperation of the two audit institutions form the basis for the successful execution of future audits in the field of VAT management.

Public procurement of works and corruption prevention
Joint report of the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) on their parallel audits
Introduction and overview
The awarding of services by public authorities is of great importance both for the state and for the economy.
The task of the state is to use public funds as economically and economically as possible and to ensure fair and regulated competition.
In the European Union (EU), the award of services by contracting authorities is an important part of the creation of a single economic area.
In order to ensure largely unrestricted competition across borders, contracting authorities must comply with EU requirements when awarding contracts above certain value limits (threshold values).
To this end, EU member states have to transpose and apply EU public procurement law into national law.
This has already happened in both the Czech Republic and Germany.
Below the EU thresholds, it is up to individual countries to regulate the award of public contracts themselves.
The awarding of services is also an area at risk of corruption.
Due to the generally high damage potential, the contracting authorities must therefore implement appropriate measures to prevent and prevent corruption and undue benefits when awarding their contracts.
In January 2011, the Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) agreed to carry out parallel audits both for the EU-wide award of construction services and for the prevention of corruption.
The main focus of the audits was the application of the EU public procurement law, which has been transposed into national regulations, as well as the prevention of corruption in the award of construction services in construction and road construction or transport infrastructure.
Procurement below the EU thresholds has also been taken into account with a view to preventing corruption.
The audit results of both audit bodies are summarised in this Joint Report.
The report should also be addressed to international institutions, such as the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).
Testing areas and verified bodies The evaluations of the Federal Audit Office on the listed topics are mainly based on cross-sectional tests, which he carried out in 2011/2012 with the building authorities, which are responsible for the road construction and the building construction of the federal government in Germany.
He examined, for example, the construction of motorways and large construction projects.
In addition, the Federal Audit Office drew on results from previous investigations.
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic based its evaluations on audit findings from the years 2008 to 2011. The tests included construction work in road construction, railway construction, hydraulic engineering, building construction (hospitals, cultural buildings, university buildings, etc.) as well as other construction areas in the Czech Republic.
In Germany, the awarding of federal public contracts is carried out predominantly by the building authorities of the federal states.
In the Czech Republic, the State Building Administration is centrally responsible for awarding contracts in the field of transport infrastructure.
In building construction, the awards are carried out decentrally by those bodies that use state budgets.
In both countries, freelancers are also involved in sub-areas of the procurement procedures.
When comparing the evaluations, differences in procurement law and in the market structure for construction services of both countries must be taken into account.
Development of public procurement law in both countries
In Germany, the implementation of EU-wide procurement procedures is laid down in laws and regulations.
Procurement procedures limited to the national area are governed by budgetary law and the administrative provisions based on it.
In addition, for both EU-wide and national awards, many supplementary individual rules are prescribed by internal administrative provisions;
such as the federal government’s so-called “procurement manuals“, in which the legal requirements are supplemented or formulated in more detail in compliance with public procurement law.
In the Czech Republic, the award procedure is governed exclusively by the Procurement Act and other statutory provisions that apply both to the area above and below the EU thresholds.
Procurement law was substantially amended in 2012.
The new regulation increased transparency in the use of public funds, increased competition and limited the possibilities for corruption in the award procedure.
Principles of public procurement law in both countries
In both countries, the open procedure, the non-open procedure and the negotiation procedure apply in particular to EU-wide contracts.
In Germany, the measures below the EU threshold are to be applied to the national award types (public tendering, restricted tendering, free-handed procurement), which, however, largely correspond to the above-mentioned EU-wide award types.
Public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of the primacy of the open procedure (in the case of contracts to be carried out throughout the EU) and the public tender (in the case of national contracts).
In the open procedure and in the public tender, any interested company can submit an offer.
Another key feature of German public procurement law is the promotion of medium-sized companies.
The main purpose of this is to divide an overall construction measure into technical and partial cans.
The individual awarding of these lots is intended to enable as many companies as possible to participate in the competition.
Both of the aforementioned features of German public procurement law are proven instruments for achieving economic results.
More than 330,000 construction companies with 1.9 million employees are active in Germany.
In the Czech Republic, EU-wide procurement procedures are also applicable to construction projects below the EU threshold.
An exception here is the simplified procedure, in which a less stringent procedure may be applied below the thresholds and under certain conditions.
Czech public procurement law, in accordance with EU law, provides for contracts to be concluded if competition is guaranteed and a favourable price is achieved.
The current legal provisions in the Czech Republic allow the contracting authorities to choose between the open and the non-open procedure.
There are over 85,000 construction companies in the Czech Republic, including some 1,900 companies with 20 or more employees.
Construction volume of public clients and shares of award types in both countries
In Germany, the total construction volume in 2011 was 307 billion euros.
Of this amount, 45.5 billion euros were spent on public construction (15%), which, in addition to federal construction, includes in particular the construction measures of the federal states and municipalities.
The construction volume of the federal government in building construction and highway construction (excluding railway construction and hydraulic engineering) amounted to 8.5 billion euros.
The volume of contracts for construction work in the federal building and highway construction sector was distributed among the award types in 2011 as follows: 80.7 % open procedures and public tenders, 12.7 % non-open procedures and restricted tenders and 6.6 % negotiation procedures and hands-free contracts.
Of these, 33.2% were Europe-wide awards.
The volume of public works in the Czech Republic amounted to 4.7 billion euros in 2011, which was about 25% of the total volume of all construction projects in the Czech Republic.
In 2009, the volume amounted to 7.8 billion euros, which corresponded to 37% of the total construction volume.
Breakdown by award type for 2011: 65.1% open procedure 14.3% non-public procedure 9.5% negotiation procedure 8.4% simplified procedure for contract volume below the threshold 2.7% other procedure
The data relate to all public contracts for deliveries, services and construction services awarded by public contracting authorities in 2011.
The o.a. Data show that the parallel audits of both countries focus on a significant part of public procurement, which is of great financial importance for all contracts to be taken into account in the prevention of corruption, and that the open procedure and the public tender are of outstanding importance in the award of contracts.
Summary of the results of the parallel tests
The Supreme Control Office of the Czech Republic and the Federal Audit Office of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have carried out parallel tests in their countries on the EU-wide award of construction services and on corruption prevention.
In this context, the working groups of both audit institutions compared the relevant legal bases and administrative requirements in the Czech Republic and Germany as well as the results of their parallel audits, which they carried out in particular in the areas of construction and road construction.
In doing so, they found essentially:
The EU Directives on the award of works by contracting authorities have been transposed into national law both in the Czech Republic and in Germany (No. 1 and 3.1).
In addition to the EU requirements, the prevention of corruption is also served by the procurement regulations of both countries, which partly differ in their focal points and their detailing (No. 3.2).
In both countries, an essential requirement for the award documents is that they must contain all the information required for the proper preparation of tenders.
The service descriptions must be neutral and must not have any competition-restrictive requirements.
In Germany, the award documents have largely met these requirements.
In the Czech Republic, it is still a problem to determine the object of the order sufficiently.
In Germany, construction services must be divided into lots if possible in order to promote competition.
According to the findings of the BRH, this requirement was largely implemented in Germany.
In its tests, in particular in the field of road construction, the NKO found that the awarding of extensive services without lots or with only very large lots can affect competition and lead to a restriction to only a few large companies.
Restrictions on market potential can lead to significant cost increases and entail the risk of price or other agreements.
Pursuant to the provisions of both countries, the contracting authorities may, under certain conditions, agree on additional or amended services with the companies already contracted, which prove necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (No. 4.1).
The respective specifications for determining the type of award were largely followed in both countries.
Under the rules of the Czech Republic, contracting authorities are free to choose between open and non-open procedures.
In Germany, on the other hand, the legal and budgetary priority of the open procedure for EU-wide contracts or the public tender, which corresponds to the open procedure for national contracts, applies.
This allows more companies to make offers.
This reduces the risk of corruption, complicates price agreements between bidders and leads to the most economic results.
For the construction projects, whose estimated total contract values reached or exceeded the EU threshold, the audited building authorities generally awarded the construction services throughout Europe.
The correct estimation of the expected order value is an essential basis for choosing the right type of award.
In Germany, cost databases are used for the cost assessment of public buildings, especially in building construction,
which are based on the evaluations of completed construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, a database is used in the field of road construction, but it is not yet an effective instrument (No. 4.2).
In the case of construction work to be awarded throughout Europe, preliminary information and announcements must be published. This is intended to strengthen competition by allowing interested companies to adapt to the planned contracts at an early stage.
As a rule, the audited building authorities complied with this requirement.
In individual cases, incorrect information, incorrect applications or missing controls may have impaired competition (No. 4.3).
The selection of candidates for participation in non-public procurement procedures is particularly prone to manipulation.
Under EU law, the number of invited applicants must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not discriminate and must be announced beforehand.
In addition to the requirements of the EU, the contracting authorities in both countries should switch as often as possible among the companies to be invited when selecting applicants.
In order to counter the risk of manipulation, there are sometimes very detailed specifications in Germany.
In some cases, the audited administrations did not take these requirements into account.
In the Czech Republic, the decisions on the selection of applicants were not always comprehensible (No. 4.4).
In both countries, it is necessary to ensure that companies interested in tendering receive the same information during the offer phase in the interest of equal competition.
A contact between these companies among themselves and with freelancers who were involved in the creation of the service description is to be prevented as far as possible in order to avoid anticompetitive agreements.
The corresponding regulations in Germany are more extensive than in the Czech Republic.
However, the audited building authorities in Germany partially did not comply with these requirements (No. 4.5).
When opening up the offers in both countries, particular attention must be paid to the multi-eye principle and the principle of transparency.
The requirements for labelling, documentation, custody and confidentiality of the offers are intended to limit the scope for manipulation and are particularly well defined in Germany.
The tests in both countries revealed only a few complaints (No. 4.6).
Examination and evaluation of the offers are defined in both countries by specifications for the structure and process organization.
The regulations in Germany are more comprehensive, but have not been consistently observed by the audited contracting authorities.
For example, contracting authorities handed over offers for examination to third parties without first reviewing the offers and sufficiently documenting any abnormalities.
The offers were thus insufficiently protected against subsequent manipulations (No. 4.7).
At the conclusion of the EU-wide procurement procedures, the companies involved in the competition are to be informed of the intended award before the award of the contract.
This legal protection option also has a preventive function against corrupt behaviour.
The Czech Republic also provides for judicial review of non-EU procurement procedures.
Only in a few cases did the contracting authorities fail to meet the specified deadlines for the award of contracts or deviated from the bidder's offer in terms of content (No. 4.8).
The documentation of the procurement procedures was not always complete or comprehensible for the audited building authorities in both countries.
In this respect, the EU-wide transparency requirement was not sufficiently implemented in the award notices of some procedures.
Also, some of the detected defects diminished the anti-corruption function of the documentation.
The contracting authorities of both countries largely complied with their reporting and reporting obligations (No. 4.9).
Fundamentals of EU public procurement law and corruption prevention
EU public procurement law
In order to ensure unrestricted competition within the European Union with the free movement of services and goods, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, among other things, the Procurement Coordination Directive and the Remedies Directive, which had to be transposed into national law by the Member States.
The general procurement principles of the European Union are, in particular, the principle of competition, the principle of equal treatment or the prohibition of discrimination, as well as the principle of transparency.
To achieve these objectives, the Procurement Coordination Directive sets out specific rules for construction works to be awarded across the EU for construction projects.
For this purpose, their expected order amounts must reach or exceed a volume of currently 5,000,000 euros.
The rules relate in particular to the content of the award documents, the publication of certain information before, during and after the award, the observance of deadlines, inter alia for the receipt of tenders, the documentation of the award procedure, the requirements that can be placed on the qualification of applicants and the Remedies Directive forms the basis for the legal protection of applicants and bidders.
In the event of possible violations of public procurement law, the companies concerned may have the decisions of the contracting authorities reviewed in review proceedings.
Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the directives of the European Union into national law.
Prevention of corruption
Importance of preventing corruption
In both countries, there is no legal definition of corruption.
In general, corruption is understood as the abuse of a position of trust for the private benefit,
which is usually initiated by the beneficiaries of these decisions.
Corruption can hinder competition and cause significant economic damage.
It is estimated that the global cost of corruption is 5% of world economic output.
For the European Union, the level of these costs is estimated at 1%.
In the case of contracting authorities, restrictive agreements or unfair practices may call into question confidence in the integrity and functioning of the administration.
Preventing corruption is therefore one of the fundamental tasks of public authorities.
In doing so, they must review the organisation and organisation of their administrations in areas that are particularly at risk of corruption in order to implement appropriate safeguards against corruption.
Preventive measures and effective controls can significantly reduce the vulnerability of decision-making processes to corrupt abuse.
The award of public works is generally regarded as a particularly corruption-prone area of work.
Measures to prevent corruption
In Germany, corruption – in particular bribery and bribery as well as acceptance and approval of benefits – is prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
In order to prevent corruption, the Federal Government has issued a guideline and recommendations on corruption12 prevention in the Federal Administration. In addition to risk analysis, the following basic principles must be observed for the award area: priority of public tenders and open procedures, multi-eye principle and transparency, fundamental separation of planning, awarding and settlement, precise and complete documentation of the award procedures.
In addition, further anti-corruption requirements have been incorporated into the public procurement regulations.
In 2011, for example, the responsible Federal Ministry for Procurement in the area of federal highways introduced an electronically supported control system,
with the award data - such as the estimated costs and the order amounts - as well as information on the involved freelancers are collected nationwide and evaluated for abnormalities.
In the Czech Republic, corruption is also prosecuted under criminal and labour law.
The legal requirements of transparency and equal treatment of bidders, as well as the prohibition of all discrimination, form the most important basis for preventing corruption.
For public procurement, the Czech government has defined anti-corruption measures in a strategy paper on anti-corruption for the years 2011 to 2012 and updated them for the years 2013 to 2014.
Some of the measures recommended therein have already been incorporated into national public procurement law and corresponding administrative provisions around14.
The main provisions of the new legislation are as follows: reduction of the thresholds for smaller contracts, obligation to publish the contracts beforehand by the contracting authority, including mention of the reasons for the tender, prohibition of limiting the number of bidders in non-open procedures and thus abolition of the possibility of selecting bidders through lottery procedures, introduction of the obligation to publish the order documents and all annexes, introduction of the obligation to publish the actual price and the list of subcontractors.
Examination results for the individual phases of the award procedure
Procurement documents
Procurement Documents The Procurement Documents must contain all the information that the bidders need to make an appropriate bid.
In particular, the award documents must allow for a correct calculation.
The bidders may not be transferred any risks that are not calculable for them.
The award documents consist in particular of the service description and the contractual conditions.
In addition, they contain the requirements for proof of the qualification (fitness) of the bidders as well as the criteria that are decisive for the selection of the most economical offer.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
The requirements of EU law for the procurement documents are directed in particular to the technical specifications.
These must be equally accessible to all bidders and should limit competition as little as possible.
In principle, the service description must be product-neutral.
Therefore, information on products or manufacturers as part of the service description is only permitted under strict conditions.
Avoiding restrictive competition requirements in the procurement documents is also a fundamental principle of preventing corruption.
In addition, unclear or inaccurate information in the award documents must be avoided, as they open up scope for speculation in the preparation of offers as well as for manipulation in their evaluation.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar regulations In both countries, the EU legal requirements for technical specifications have been transposed into national law.
The services are basically product-neutral without factory specifications.
In the service descriptions, the individual services must usually be divided into performance units with respective quantity specifications in detail.
Prices are to be agreed on the basis of performance units (e.g. B. Euro per m2 or per piece).
Only in exceptional cases can services be defined by functional targets.
In any case, the service descriptions must be complete and unambiguous.
They must contain precise quantities and must not include services for which it is not clear whether they are needed.
Remuneration according to lump sum or time expenditure is to be avoided as far as possible.
These provisions are intended to prevent speculation and manipulation based on indeterminate requirements in the procurement documents.
The service descriptions must enable bidders to prepare their offers safely and without extensive preparatory work.
The call for tenders will not be published until the award documents have been completed.
Derogations from each other
There is no obligation to tender for works in lots in the Czech Republic.
If it is possible according to the type of service to be commissioned, the public contracting authorities can divide construction services into several lots.
In Germany, construction services are generally divided into lots, separated by quantity (partial lots) and/or by type or subject area (professionals).
The aim is to enable small and medium-sized enterprises to participate in the competition, to expand the number of possible providers and to make price agreements more difficult.
This type of award is generally considered to be the most economical.
Criteria for evaluation in the Czech Republic must be stated in the award documents, both in EU-wide and in national procedures.
This should enable applicants to fully and conclusively identify the criteria according to which their offers are to be evaluated.
In Germany, the indication of evaluation criteria in EU-wide announcements, but at the latest in the award documents, is only required in the EU-wide procurement procedures.
In the case of national procurement procedures, the evaluation criteria must only be set out in an internal administrative award note.
Procurement documents, which are prepared by commissioned freelancers, may not contain any references to these offices or involved planners or experts in Germany with the building construction and some road construction administrations.
The aim is to prevent individual companies from gaining additional information or other undue competitive advantages through contact with these freelancers without the client's knowledge.
This is also the reason why freelancers are not allowed to send out award documents or interpret planning documents for inspection.
The contact person for the companies is the client alone.
There is currently no provision for this in the Czech Republic.
Additional or modified services, which prove to be necessary after the conclusion of the original contract (supplements), are almost always required for large construction projects.
In both countries, the legal provisions allow, to a certain extent, the award of subcontracts to the already contracted company without having to carry out a tendering procedure with public notice.
According to the EU regulations and the German regulations, the remuneration of supplementary services may not exceed half of the main order.
In addition, the additional services may not be separated from the main order without significant disadvantages or must be absolutely necessary.
In the Czech Republic, a narrower limit of 20% applies to the award of such contracts without public notice.
However, this may increase the risk of delayed completion of the construction project or the need to involve an additional contractor in the construction work already underway.
If supplementary services are also transferred to the already commissioned company, an arbitrary price increase for these services by the contractor is in principle not possible according to the regulations in Germany.
In determining the remuneration for the additional services, the agreed prices and the basis for determining the price of the order already placed must be assumed.
In addition to supplementary services, there may also be a reduction in the scope of services.
In the Czech Republic, small quantities cannot be offset against additional supplementary services.
Key audit results
BHR
Technical specifications and product-neutral tendering
In individual cases, the performance descriptions contained references to national technical approvals or standards that had already been replaced by Europe-wide standards.
Some performance descriptions also contained product-related specifications – for example for graffiti protection, joints or noise protection plates – without this being necessary.
In some cases, performance requirements were described so precisely that only one product was considered.
Performance directories subdivided by partial services
The BRH has not in any of the examined proceedings found violations of the bid to advertise services in principle in a list of services subdivided by partial services.
Completeness of the service descriptions
In the vast majority of cases, the procurement documents were completed before the start of the tenders.
In some cases, the procurement documents had to be corrected during the offer phase, as some positions or deadlines had changed.
Occasionally, the performance directories contained positions where it was not clear whether they were needed.
A performance catalogue for demolition work even consisted almost half of such demand positions.
Lots and evaluation criteria
Many awards lacked the prescribed reason why the services, which were mainly advertised according to the unemployed, were no longer divided into partial tickets.
There were no objections when specifying the criteria to be used in the evaluation of the offers.
References to freelancers
A small part of the service descriptions contained references to the involved freelancers.
Their names were partly on the covers or in attached plans or reports.
In one case, the contracting authority even explicitly asked the applicants to contact the architect "on questions of the tender".
In the construction sector in particular, the contracting authorities mainly attributed the complaints to the omissions of the freelancers commissioned to draw up the service descriptions.
The construction services pointed out the lack of capacity to adequately control the performance descriptions.
N.K.
Technical specifications and product-neutral tender In the public procurement for the construction of a residential building with 12 residential units, a supplier and a specific product brand were specified in the service description.
The contracting authority did not allow the use of comparable products without justifying this.
During the construction of several university buildings, suppliers and products were also specified in the tender.
Performance descriptions with performance units
In the case of construction projects in some industrial areas, the contracting authority did not clearly specify the scope and type of services required in the service descriptions.
As performance units, it only indicated the converted space of the individual buildings in cubic meters.
Completeness of the service descriptions
During the construction of a motorway bypass, the service descriptions were changed four times within the framework of a non-open procedure in the period from August to September 2009,
because the scope of services had increased considerably and the technical requirements had changed.
Tender documents for social buildings contained inaccurate location information, insufficient structural preliminary investigations and incomplete design drawings, which required additional services to be commissioned.
When building a large library building, the performance description of the interior equipment contained no requirements for product quality.
As a result of these missing requirements, some subcontractors installed overpriced and inappropriately high-quality equipment.
Lots and aptitude criteria
In the Czech Republic, the division of construction measures into partial lots or the award of partial contracts is not mandatory.
An examination of the three large sections of the construction of a motorway ring showed that if selected parts had been allocated separately, savings of up to 31.6 million euros would have been possible with a total cost of 620.3 million euros.
For example, six different buildings, which were the subject of a single contract, could have saved 2.5 million euros (25%) if they were awarded separately.
If the construction of 20 bridges had been given off, savings of 11.5 million euros (25%) would have been possible compared to a total allocation.
When awarding construction services in road construction, the central contracting authority specified very extensive reference requirements as eligibility criteria.
In the construction of a part of a motorway, the contracting authority demanded from the bidders in an open procedure, among other things, the proof of at least three road construction projects carried out, each worth 28 million euros from the last five years.
In the Czech Republic, a maximum of nine suppliers met these requirements.
The public procurement of another section of a motorway consisted of six separate construction projects, in which the contracting authority had specified an annual construction volume of at least 480 million euros in the last three years as an aptitude criterion for the companies.
Two thirds of the funds raised for road construction projects in 2008 and 2009 (i.e. 2.5 billion euros out of a total of 3.7 billion euros) were contracted by a total of five companies that carried out the contracts alone or as a working group.
In 46 procurement procedures with an order volume of 528 million euros, only two or even only one bidder submitted an offer.
It showed that a narrowing of the market potential can lead to significant cost increases.
Additional services
When constructing a motorway bypass, the contracting authority did not apply any of the legally prescribed procedures when awarding additional services in two cases and did not conclude any written contracts for the additional services.
Due to unclear quantity and quality specifications, additions were made in the first case of up to 63.7 million euros (net) and in the second case up to 165.4 million euros (net), which increased the respective order volume by 21 % and 91 % respectively.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
For several university buildings, some services were not listed in the award documents, although their necessity was already known when awarding the contract.
Although the scope of these additional services exceeded the limit of 20% of the original contract value laid down in national procurement law, the contracting authority conducted negotiations with the contracted companies without notice of award.
In the construction of a large courthouse, the contracting authority reserved the right to award additional construction services in negotiation proceedings without a call for tenders.
During the construction period, the contracting authority expanded the scope of the work by 2 million euros.
The unit prices for the additional works awarded without competition were significantly higher than comparable services provided by the same company.
Further findings
On the basis of a sample test of construction projects, the NKA found that the average cost of building a four-lane motorway kilometer in the Czech Republic was up to 14.6 million euros.
In Deuschland, on the other hand, the average cost of a four-lane motorway kilometre is up to 10.4 million euros, according to an evaluation of long-term data from the Federal Ministry of Construction.
This comparison suggests that motorway construction in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in Germany.
Summary findings
The basic rules on procurement documents are broadly consistent in both countries and take into account EU requirements.
They serve both comprehensive and fair competition and the prevention of corruption.
For example, the requirement for the sufficient determination of the service descriptions should enable bidders to calculate and prepare their offers appropriately,
protect the client from additional services to be agreed retrospectively and also reduce the scope for speculation.
In Germany, the common basic requirements for the award documents are supplemented by regulations aimed at further reducing restrictions on competition and the possibility of manipulation.
There are no requirements to this extent in the Czech Republic, but transparency is increased by publishing the evaluation criteria for non-EU procurement procedures.
The requirements for the performance description have been largely met in both countries.
In some cases, however, deviations had to be objected to, which could also have led to restrictions on competition.
The German law on the formation of lots promotes competition and leads to economic results.
In the Czech Republic, according to the audit findings of the NK, the award of extensive services without lots or with only very large lots may result in restrictions of the provider field on only a few large companies.
The extensive reference requirements for road construction in the Czech Republic have meant that public contracts are only awarded to a narrow circle of suppliers and that small and medium-sized enterprises are not allowed to participate in the competition.
Also, a limited number of competitors often leads to higher prices and increases the risk of price or other agreements.
In the award and remuneration of additional or modified services, the regulatory approaches differ in both countries.
According to the EU regulations as well as the German regulations, supplementary services with a value of up to half of the main order can be awarded under certain conditions without award procedures with public notice.
In the Czech Republic, a narrower limit of 20% applies, up to which additional services can be awarded to the original contractor in the negotiation procedure without notice.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
This limit is often exceeded,
since the scope of services for public contracts is often insufficiently determined.
If the exceedance is greater than 20%, the additional services must be advertised with public notice.
By dividing services into lots, restrictions on competition and the resulting adverse consequences can be avoided.
Determining the type of award and taking into account the EU threshold
By determining the type of award, the client determines the extent of the number of companies participating in the competition.
It can leave the circle of potential applicants and bidders largely unlimited, for example by selecting an open procedure, or limit it by specifying non-public procurement procedures.
For construction projects where a threshold set by the EU is reached or exceeded, Europe-wide procurement procedures must be applied.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
When selecting the type of award, the contracting authority must take into account, in particular, the European law bids on competition and transparency.
If the estimated total contract value of the construction services of a project is at or above the EU threshold of currently 5,000,000 euros, the construction services are to be awarded throughout Europe according to open or non-open procedures.
In exceptional cases, negotiation procedures or competitive dialogue are also possible.
In the case of construction projects that reach or exceed the EU threshold, the contracting authority may deviate to a limited extent from the principle of pan-European procurement and award construction services in national procurement procedures, provided that the estimated contract value of the respective lot is less than EUR 1,000,000 and the sum of these lots does not exceed 20% of the estimated total contract value of all construction contracts.
A uniform construction project must not be divided into individual measures without compelling reason or deliberately estimated with too low cost values in order to remove it from the obligation to award construction services throughout Europe as a matter of principle.
Since restrictions on competition significantly increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of the type of award is of great importance in preventing corruption.
The detailed justification of the chosen type of award and the examination of the application obligation of the EU procurement regulations are important components of the documentation of the award procedure.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
Both countries have fully transposed EU legislation on procurement procedures and the threshold value into national law.
Derogations from each other
The Czech Republic has also transferred the fundamental equality of open and non-open procedures contained in the EUR Directive to its construction contracts, which are not subject to EU requirements.
There is freedom of choice between the open and the non-open procedure, without the decision having to be documented or justified. Other procedures, on the other hand, are only possible under certain legally defined conditions.
In Germany, on the other hand, the open procedure or – in the case of national awards – the public tendering procedure generally takes precedence. This is determined by budgetary and public procurement law, as well as by the anti-corruption directives.
Other types of award – as well as the non-open procedure or the restricted tender – are only possible in exceptional cases, which are finally regulated in the procurement law.
The existence of an exceptional case must be substantiated and documented in a comprehensible manner.
The principle of the primacy of the open procedure or the public tender is intended to ensure that competition is as unrestricted as possible, to exclude the possibility of manipulation by specifying on certain bidders and to make possible price agreements among bidders more difficult.
The principle of public tendering is a central element of the prevention of corruption in Germany.
The correct estimation of the expected order value is an essential basis for choosing the right type of award.
The construction offices in Germany can rely on planning and cost databases of public administrations as well as other organisations to determine the expected costs in the area of public construction.
These databases are based on evaluations of completed construction projects. The databases contain e.g. Cost parameters for building categories, usage units, components or individual construction services.
On the basis of such cost parameters, the expected order value of a planned advance or a construction work to be awarded can be determined.
Corresponding cost databases for road construction have only a few construction administrations in Germany.
However, a nationwide introduction for all road construction administrations is planned.
Procurement offices in the Czech Republic cannot rely on central databases or average price analyses of comparable construction measures to determine the expected costs of construction services.
In most cases, the cost estimates are based on estimates by the financing body or are based on the amount of funds made available to the construction service.
Measures to standardise cost assessment procedures are still in their infancy.
Within the framework of the anti-corruption plan for 2011-2012, the relevant ministries were commissioned to create a database for standardised building materials and materials.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
This database is intended to collect information on the cost of materials and on construction and expansion works as well as other cost-relevant data in order to enable cost analyses and provisions of unit prices.
In order to improve cost control, the Czech Ministry of Transport has also published a data collection for construction projects,
which should serve as a benchmark for price fixing in the financing plan and is currently being updated.
Key audit results BRH
Choice of award procedure
The audited contracting authorities largely tendered the construction services in an open procedure or in a public tender and thus followed the budgetary and public procurement requirements.
In 2011, 59.5% of the federal government's construction work in building construction was advertised publicly or in an open procedure.
In road construction, this share was 94.8%.
In the selection of non-public tender types, there were partly no detailed reasons why the contracting authorities had to deviate from the principle of open procedure or public tendering.
In a cross-sectional investigation, the BRH found, on the basis of more than 16,000 procurement procedures, that non-public tendering methods have significant competitive disadvantages compared to open procedures and public tenders and increase the risk of manipulation and corruption.
In building construction, more than twice as many tenders were submitted for public tenders as for restricted tenders and almost three times as many offers as for free-handed contracts.
The investigation also showed that the offer prices for restricted tenders and open-handed contracts were on average 6% and 10% higher than for public tenders.
Parallel investigations by the Federal Ministry of Construction and a state accounting court confirmed the economic differences between public and non-public procurement types.
As a result of its studies on cost-effectiveness, the Federal Ministry of Construction even came up with twice as many differences between public and non-public procurement procedures.
Taking into account the EU threshold
In the case of the construction projects for which they had determined an estimated total order amount of more than 5,000,000 euros, the audited contracting authorities usually drew up award plans in which they determined the construction services to be awarded in accordance with EU-wide and national procurement procedures.
According to the procurement plans, this meant that more than 80% of the construction work had to be awarded throughout the EU.
A circumvention of the obligation to award EU-wide contracts through cost estimates that were too low was not detectable.
However, it was partly due to incorrect calculations that the minimum share of EU-wide procurement procedures actually fell short.
During construction, some contracting authorities inadmissibly changed the definitions of their procurement plans.
They did not justify these changes and did not prove that the minimum share of EU-wide procurement procedures was still respected.
For most of the examined construction measures, the share of EU-wide contracts was usually lower according to the billing results than provided for under the procurement plan.
In some cases, in the case of construction projects above the EU threshold, the contracting authorities breached the requirement to advertise all 1,000,000 euros and more comprehensive individual cases in EU-wide procedures.
and instead chose national procedures.
N.K.
Choice of type of award
In several major construction projects, such as the construction of some motorway sections, construction projects as part of a major sporting event and housing projects, the contracting authorities divided construction services into several sub-contracts, although these services were similar or comparable.
As a result of these divisions, the individual benefits were no longer above the threshold value and were subsequently awarded in simplified procedures or even in violation of legal requirements.
Calculation methods for the estimated order value
In road construction, the existing price databases for this area were only an insufficient instrument for determining the expected order values.
The data were based on just completed construction projects, but there were indications of a lack of cost-effectiveness, unnecessary additional effort or excessive profits of the contracted companies.
For three sections of a motorway ring, the actual prices were about 37% lower than the estimated order values determined with the help of the database.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Transport revised the databases in order to take into account not only the offer prices of recent years, but also comparable market prices and price increase indices in the construction sector.
In building construction, the expected order values were based on cost values estimated by the project architects or on estimates by investors.
Actual order values differed greatly from the estimates.
The estimated price for the conversion or expansion of a large library was twice as high as the later agreed order value, but eight additions in the course of construction led to an increase in costs of 2.1 million euros or 27%.
Similarly, the actual order value for the construction of a library depot was 33% lower than the estimated price, with cost increases in the construction phase.
In other cases, supply prices exceeded estimates and increased during construction.
When building a large library, the estimated price was exceeded by 16 million euros or 22%. In the construction of a judicial building, the costs rose disproportionately at 139%, as the usable area had only increased by 12%.
Summary findings
Both countries have transposed into national law the EU rules for determining the type of award and taking into account the EU threshold value. Therefore, the respective regulations are largely in line with each other.
However, the priority of the open procedure or public tender in Germany goes beyond the EU requirements and the regulations in force in the Czech Republic.
Compared to non-public procurement procedures, more companies have the opportunity to compete in public procurement procedures or public tenders.
The public procurement procedures lead to a higher number of offers and to the most economical results.
The risk of corruption will be significantly improved by not restricting the applicant field by tamper-prone stipulations of the client and by making price agreements between the bidders more difficult.
The investigations have confirmed the advantageousness of the priority of the open procedure or the public tender in Germany.
Under Czech legislation, contracting authorities may award contracts in an open or non-open procedure.
According to the latest changes in public procurement law, the number of bidders may no longer be limited in proceedings with previous competition.
This means that the non-open procedure is now very similar to the open procedure.
In Germany, the contracting authorities have largely complied with the requirements for the priority of the open procedure or the public tender. In the Czech Republic, some services have been unduly distributed in order to circumvent the criteria for selecting the type of award.
When taking into account the EU threshold value, errors had to be detected in Germany which resulted in a fall in the minimum share of services advertised throughout the EU.
In the Czech Republic, there is still no satisfactory solution to accurately determine the expected costs of construction work and construction projects.
The building authorities should, if necessary, ensure by means of further checks that the requirements for the choice of the type of award and the scope of services to be tendered throughout the EU are complied with or that the conditions for appropriate cost investigations are created.
Pre-information and notice
In the case of construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe, the public builder must inform interested companies about the planned contracts in advance of the tender.
Preliminary information and announcements form an important basis for Europe-wide competition.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
The preliminary information should contain the essential information on the planned construction projects under public procurement law.
They are necessary for those construction projects where the estimated total contract value reaches or exceeds the EU threshold and where the client wants to shorten the offer periods of open or non-open procedures.
In announcements, the client must provide more details on the construction contracts to be awarded throughout Europe.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Among other things, he has to make known the scope of services, the process and execution dates, the special requirements as well as the evaluation criteria and their weighting.
When describing the object of the order, the vocabulary of the Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV codes), which is standardized throughout Europe, must be used.
Preliminary information and announcements will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the client's procurement profile.
In order to prevent discrimination against foreign interested parties, notices may not contain any additional information at national level and may not be published until the publication text has been sent to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union.
Incomplete or inaccurate information in the notice may affect competition and may even support manipulation.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
Both countries have fully transposed the EU legal requirements for pre-information and notification into national law.
Derogations from each other
In the Czech Republic, preliminary information and announcements must also be published for construction work not to be awarded throughout Europe.
Procurement procedures may be started at the earliest one month after sending the preliminary information to the EU Official Journal (for EU-wide awards) or to the national Official Journal (for all awards).
Only in exceptional cases can the publication of a preliminary information be dispensed with.
In Germany, no prior information is required for the non-EU procurement procedures.
In the national procurement procedures, announcements for public tenders and participation competitions before restricted tenders must be published on the Federal Government's Internet portal and, if necessary, also in newspapers or magazines.
In the case of restricted tenders without participation competition, announcements of services to be awarded starting from 25,000 euros are required (ex-ante transparency).
All planned lots of the construction projects are to be listed in the preliminary information.
In Germany, this is of particular importance because of the small part of the loose construction contracts.
In the Czech Republic, this regulation has only a small impact, as much less construction work is divided into lots.
Key audit results
BRH
Preliminary information
The surveyed contracting authorities published preliminary information on all tested construction projects with construction services to be awarded throughout Europe.
In some open proceedings, however, they shortened offer periods, although the period of 52 days required between the dispatch of the preliminary information and the announcements had not yet expired.
Other shortened procedures were only put out to tender after the twelve-month period of validity of the preliminary information had already expired and before it had been extended.
Many published preliminary information lacked references to the planned division of construction services into lots.
Announcements
The notices of the audited bodies partly contained CPV codes which deviated from the information provided in the preliminary information or which did not correctly record the required services.
In individual cases, notices were published earlier at national level or contained more information – e.g. on implementation deadlines – than the notices in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Ex-ante transparency
The contracting authorities of an audited building administration had commissioned a service company to publish the national procurement procedures.
This published the notifications on its own fee-based procurement platform.
However, the contracting authorities did not check whether the company had forwarded the notifications as prescribed to the free internet portal of the federal government.
Samples showed that only one third of the reports from the audited administration were published on this portal.
N.K.
Announcements
When constructing a sewage treatment plant, the contracting authority did not specify in its notice the criteria on which it wanted to select the bidders.
The contracting authority could not prove how the bidders were selected.
The limitation of the number of bidders was permissible under the law in force at the time.
In the case of the construction of a motorway ring, the contracting authority did not specify in detail either in the announcement or in the documentation of the award procedure, according to which it would evaluate the qualification of the applicants and how many applicants it wanted to admit to the competition.
In its assessment, the contracting authority concluded that all six applicants met the qualification requirements, but excluded the candidate with the worst ratings from the further procedure.
The procedure of the contracting authority was not transparent because at no time in the procedure had it disclosed information on the qualification criteria and the evaluation procedure.
Publication of the announcements
During the renovation of former military premises, the contracting authority did not publish the tender.
Summary findings
The two-stage teaching system with pre-information and notice is an important part of implementing the transparency requirement for Europe-wide contracts, strengthening competition and thus preventing corruption.
Both countries have implemented the EU rules and increased the transparency of their procurement procedures also in the national procurement sector:
Selection of applicants for non-public tender types
In contrast to the public procurement procedures, not every company interested in the performance of the services to be awarded can participate in the competition in the non-public procurement procedures.
In the case of non-public procurement procedures, the contracting authority must make a selection in advance as to which companies should be invited to tender.
Requirements of EU law as well as the prevention of corruption The EU regulations allow a limitation of the number of applicants in the EU-wide non-public procurement procedures.
In the case of non-open procedures, however, at least five companies must be invited to submit tenders.
At least three companies must be invited to negotiate with a contract announcement.
In any case, the number of applicants invited must be sufficiently high to ensure genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, must not lead to discrimination and must be announced beforehand.
The selection of companies to be invited is a process within the award procedure that is highly vulnerable to manipulation, e.g. by allowing certain companies to be given unilateral preference.
In addition, limiting competition to a few companies also favours possible agreements between applicants.
In both cases, the delivery result may be significantly impaired at the expense of the client.
The contracting authorities must therefore take special precautions against possible manipulations, carry out sufficient checks and, in particular, ensure the transparency and traceability of this procedural step.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
The rules for selecting applicants are similar in both countries.
In addition to the EU requirements, the contracting authorities should switch among the companies to be invited as often as possible when selecting applicants.
Nor must competition be restricted to companies established in certain regions.
The contracting authorities must justify the selection of candidates and document the process of the selection process in their award notes.
Derogations from each other
In Germany, in the case of restricted tenders, at least three and in the case of free-handed contracts, several suitable applicants must be invited to submit tenders.
Under the new Czech rules, with the exception of two special areas, it is inadmissible to limit the number of bidders in the case of non-open procedures and negotiation procedures.
In Germany, the multi-eye principle must be observed when selecting companies.
For example, if an employee has proposed a number of companies for a non-public procurement procedure, the management level of the construction office or an agent from the contracting authority must usually amend this proposal by, for example, removing a proposed company and/or supplementing a new company.
The aim is to prevent a single person from being able to definitively determine the circle of companies to be involved in the competition.
Otherwise, in the case of manipulative intentions, this could allow for far-reaching agreements between the parties involved.
The list of companies to be requested is to be treated confidentially – also with regard to freelancers – and not to be made accessible to the general public.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
In the Czech Republic there are no corresponding regulations for the establishment and secrecy of applicant lists.
According to the German regulations, freelancers are not allowed to determine the companies to be requested, but can only submit proposals to the contracting authority.
There is a loophole in Czech legislation in this regard.
Key audit results
BRH
Number of applicants
The requirement to require a minimum number of companies to submit tenders for non-public contracts has been complied with, with a few exceptions.
An evaluation of the BRH of almost 7,000 non-European procurement procedures for construction services in building construction showed that the contracting authorities requested an average of 6.6 for restricted tenders of the federal government in Germany and an average of 4.4 companies for tenders for free-handed contracts.
Change of companies and regional restrictions
Especially for trades with few providers, the contracting authorities did not always change the circle of selected applicants.
Above all, they took into account companies already known to them and proven in their view.
As a reason for this, they stated that, in the case of non-public proceedings, they had to ensure the suitability of the companies to be invited to compete even before the invitation to submit an offer.
The BRH did not find an inadmissible restriction to regional bidders in the non-public procurement procedures, but a higher proportion of regionally based companies than in public tenders.
The contracting authorities attributed this mainly to the fact that the scope of services in the non-public procurement procedures was on average much lower and therefore, for example, longer access routes are more important than in public tenders.
Multi-eye principle and proposals for freelance workers
Contrary to the rules, the contracting authorities largely omitted to have the proposed list of companies to be requested amended by an independent person.
They justified this in particular with a lack of processing capacity, time pressure or insufficient knowledge of alternative suitable companies.
Often it was also not documented who had proposed the companies requested to submit the offer.
Some samples showed that freelancers had drawn up the applicant lists and that these proposals had been accepted unchanged by the contracting authorities.
Thus, the contracting authorities did not protect themselves to the extent necessary from possible manipulations.
Confidential treatment of bidding lists
At a contracting authority, the lists of companies to be requested were recorded in a data processing system that could be viewed by all employees of this service.
In the case of manipulative intentions, the names of the intended or authorised companies would have been passed on unauthorised and e.g. Arrangements among these companies may allow.
Documentation
The documentation of the award procedures contained only in a few cases justifications for the selection of applicants.
N.K.
Selection of candidates
During the construction of a motorway ring, the bidders received no information on the evaluation criteria and the evaluation procedures.
In the non-open procedures for the development and modernisation of waterways and ports, the announcements did not contain any information on how the selection of applicants should be carried out.
In one procedure, all eight participating applicants met the qualification requirements, exceeding the specified maximum number of companies to be admitted.
The award committee then carried out a lottery procedure for selecting the companies.
However, this approach, which was generally permissible at the time, should have been cited as one of the criteria in the notice.
Summary findings
Due to the high risk of manipulation in the selection of candidates in non-public procurement procedures, both countries have taken special precautions to prevent undue restrictions on competition.
With the multi-eyes principle, the secrecy of the bidding lists and the sole authority of the contracting authorities to propose the companies to be requested, the German regulations restrict such possibilities of abuse.
In the case of Czech regulations, the newly introduced requirement of the largely unlimited number of bidders in non-public proceedings can in particular counteract possible manipulative restrictions.
However, the audit findings have shown that some of these requirements have been inadequately implemented and that the potential for manipulation for abusive restriction of the field of participants has not been sufficiently reduced in these cases.
The contracting authorities should completely eliminate the deficits identified.
Offer phase
With the announcement of the award or with the invitation to tender, the offer phase begins, in which the companies can prepare offers on the basis of the tender documents sent to them.
Applicants can submit their offers until the end of the offer period set by the contracting authority.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
There are no separate EU legal requirements for this phase of the award procedure.
The contracting authorities have to comply with the national regulations, which are intended to counteract the possibilities of manipulation existing during the offer phase.
These are mainly organizational requirements and controls.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
The award documents on the basis of which the companies are to prepare their offers are, in principle, only to be sent by the contracting authority.
Freelancers involved in the award procedure may not perform this task.
The contracting authority must ensure that all applicants receive the same information even during the offer phase.
In case of ambiguity regarding the award documents or other questions concerning the tender, only the contracting authority may provide information to the applicants.
Freelance workers commissioned to draw up the award documents may not provide any information.
During the entire offer phase, contact between the employed freelancers and the applicants must be prevented.
Freelance workers must not become a hub of the award procedure through which contacts with anti-competitive consequences can be established.
Offers sent directly or by post must be submitted in a sealed envelope.
Offers transmitted electronically have a technical encryption.
Derogations from each other
In Germany, the contracting authority may also commission external service companies with the printing and dispatch of the award documents, whose employees are obliged to keep the offers confidential and to conscientiously fulfil the contractual obligations.
The offers received must be marked with an entry stamp in Germany and forwarded immediately, immediately and unopened to an employee responsible for custody.
This employee may not be involved in the awarding of the contract.
The offers received are to be kept under lock until the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, the offers received are marked with a file number.
The contracting authority records the offer data including order numbers as well as the creation and receipt details in a protocol.
The custody of offers is not regulated in detail in the Czech Republic.
Key audit results
BRH
The tests for the offer phase focused primarily on the procurement procedures of a building administration.
Dispatch of the award documents
The contracting authorities of the audited building administration sent the award documents themselves or had them printed and shipped by an external service company.
Freelance workers did not send out any award documents.
Information to applicants
The audited building administration largely did not comply with the requirements for the separation of planning and awarding when naming the contact persons for queries and information.
In the service descriptions, contrary to the specifications, she did not specify employees from the contracting office, but from the project management as contact persons.
Some award documents even contained the names of the freelancers who had created the service descriptions.
For inquiries during the offer phase, not all applicants received the same information in individual cases.
Labelling of bids
At the audited building management, all received offers were provided with an entrance stamp and an entrance note.
In some hands-free contracts, however, the offers were received by freelancers, which contradicted the preliminaries to the prevention of corruption.
Preservation of offers
According to their labelling, not all offers were received immediately and immediately by the employee responsible for custody, who included the offers in a steel cabinet.
In the meantime, the offers were stored in an open compartment of the post office, to which each employee had access.
Another office had hung up a mailbox in a not constantly monitored hallway, in which the offers thrown in there sometimes even stayed overnight.
Since the insertion slot of this letterbox was large and unsecured, not only employees but also visitors to the service would have had the opportunity to take received offers and, if necessary, manipulate them.
N.K.
No defects were objected to on the Czech side.
Summary findings
During the offer phase, contacts between interested companies and freelancers involved in the procurement process are to be prevented in both countries.
By providing all bidders with the same information, the principle of equal treatment should also be respected.
The regulations governing the receipt, custody and confidentiality of the offers appear to be suitable for counteracting manipulation and corruption.
The corresponding requirements in Germany are somewhat more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
The results of the investigation in Germany have revealed violations of the regulations in some areas.
These shortcomings could be remedied with little effort.
Opening up of offers
Opening up of offers
During the opening date, the previously closed offers will be opened and their contents will be read out and thus made known.
From the opening date, the bidders are bound to their bids until the expiry of the surcharge period specified by the contracting authority.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
There are no separate EU regulations for the opening of bids.
However, for this highly sensitive phase of the award procedure, the national anti-corruption regulations contain extensive requirements for the protection of offers and competition.
The multi-eye principle as well as the transparency and comprehensibility of the offer opening are intended to prevent manipulations and changes to the submitted offers.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
The opening date is to be carried out by several persons to be determined by the contracting authority.
The multi-eye principle is intended to prevent individuals from being able to manipulate the offers in an uncontrolled manner when opening the offers.
In most tendering procedures, bidders can participate in the opening date.
Only offers which were submitted to the negotiator when the first offer was opened are allowed to open.
Offers received late may in principle no longer be taken into account.
In order to ensure the transparency of the opening date, the actions taken and the results of the opening of the offer must be recorded in a protocol containing, among other things, the names of the bidders and the offer prices.
The Minutes are to be read out and signed by the negotiators.
It can also be signed by the bidders present.
Derogations from each other
In the Czech Republic, a committee carries out the opening of tenders.
Freelance workers can also participate.
The Committee may also be entrusted with further phases of the award procedure, such as the evaluation of bids.
In Germany, a negotiator and a secretary carry out the opening of the offer.
The negotiator must be an employee of the tendering body.
The negotiator and, in the case of contracts in building construction, also the secretary shall not be involved in the processing of the award documents as well as in the awarding and contract processing.
According to the German regulations, the minutes of the opening date must include not only the offer prices but also information about Skonti and discounts as well as special features such as damaged or delayed offers.
In the Czech Republic, in addition to the offer price, only the language of the offer and the signature authority of the applicant are recorded.
The German regulations stipulate that the open offers must be marked in all parts in such a way that subsequent changes and additions are prevented.
The offers are usually marked by perforations with the date of the opening date. They are to be kept secret after the opening date and may only be made available to the persons directly responsible for the processing.
Corresponding Czech regulations do not exist.
If only one offer is received in a tender procedure in the Czech Republic, it may not be opened and must be returned unvalued.
There is no such regulation in Germany. If only one offer is received here, it must be opened and then evaluated.
Key audit results
BRH
Multi-eye principle
The audited contracting authorities implemented the requirements for the multi-eye principle at the opening dates.
They held the opening appointments with negotiators and secretaries who were not charged with any other award procedures.
However, in the case of freelancers, there were occasional cases in which freelancers opened offers sent to them without the participation of the contracting authority.
Minutes
In the minutes of the opening dates, the opening of the offers was not always fully documented.
In some cases, for example, the late-filed offers were not registered, in some cases even signatures were missing.
Labelling of bids
The contracting authorities examined in the context of the cross-sectional examination marked the offers according to the specifications by a perforation with the date of the opening date.
In the case of tests carried out by some beneficiaries over a longer period of time, insufficient labelling had been found.
However, these contracting authorities changed their labelling practice after the complaint by the BRH.
N.K.
Offer period
When awarding road maintenance measures, an offer was received by the contracting authority only one month after the end of the offer period. The contracting authority nevertheless accepted this offer.
Summary findings
The rules governing the opening up of tenders in both countries are in agreement in significant parts. They take into account both the multi-eye principle and the principle of transparency. As a result, the risks of corruption and manipulation in the opening of offers can be significantly limited.
The requirements in Germany are more comprehensive than those in the Czech Republic.
In particular, the requirements for the exact documentation of the procedure as well as for the labelling, safe storage and confidentiality of the offers significantly restrict manipulation possibilities such as subsequent changes to the offers.
In addition, those commissioned with the opening of the offers may not perform any other tasks in connection with the service to be awarded.
The overall few complaints prove the high acceptance of the requirements for the opening of the offer.
Examination and evaluation of offers
Examination and evaluation of the offers The client has to examine and evaluate the offers available at the opening date.
He has to determine the offer for the award of the contract, which corresponds best to the requirements according to the specified award criteria.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
The EU guidelines provide for a multi-stage procedure:
First of all, the suitability of the bidders has to be determined.
Bidders must be economically and financially efficient and possess the necessary professional and technical expertise.
Companies that are legally convicted of bribery or fraud, for example, must be excluded from participating in the award procedure.
The offers of the not excluded bidders are to be examined mathematically, technically and economically and evaluated on the basis of the previously announced award criteria.
The client has to determine the most economically advantageous offer. Offers with unusually low prices must be examined by the client in particular.
The examination and evaluation of the offers is a particularly tamper-prone phase of the award procedure.
For example, bidders can be unjustifiably excluded or offers that do not meet the requirements can be left in competition.
By favouring or discriminating against bidders, the valuation result can be improperly impaired and thus the determination of the economically most advantageous offer can be prevented.
The contracting authority must therefore take special precautions to ensure that the persons responsible for the examination and evaluation meet the requirements for integrity and expertise.
It must also ensure the transparency and comprehensibility of the procedure and the decisions taken.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
In accordance with the requirements of the EU, the offers in both countries must be examined and evaluated in multi-stage procedures.
The requirements for the aptitude certificates to be submitted by the companies as well as the award criteria to be taken into account in the evaluation and their weighting are laid down in the announcements or in the award documents and can no longer be changed during the procedure.
After checking the suitability of the bid, the eligibility criteria may no longer be used in the evaluation of the bids.
The valuation must be limited to the award criteria.
The submitted offers must first be formally checked immediately to see whether they are complete and whether, for example, they are complete. Abnormalities are included, which could indicate possible manipulation intentions.
If bidders are excluded from further examination and evaluation of their offers, they must be informed immediately.
If the valuation of the offers gives an unreasonably low price, the bidder must be given the opportunity to comment before a possible exclusion of his offer.
The decisions made during the examination and evaluation of the offers must be documented in a comprehensible manner.
Derogations from each other
In Germany, the offers to be kept secret may only be made available to persons directly commissioned with the processing.
The review of the offers as well as the computational examination of the offers may only be carried out by the contracting authority.
It only has to appoint staff who are not involved in the award decision or the implementation of the measure.
The performance of further examination and evaluation tasks is not regulated in detail.
If freelancers are commissioned with the examination and evaluation, they must treat the offers confidentially.
They may only make proposals for the decisions to be taken by the contracting authorities.
In the Czech Republic, award committees are to be formed for the examination and evaluation of tenders.
The committees draw up evaluation reports with award proposals.
Ultimately, as in Germany, only the contracting authorities have to decide on the award of contracts.
If evidence or declarations required for the submission of an offer in Germany are only incompletely filed, the contracting authority shall give the bidders the opportunity to submit the missing documents within six days.
Only if the documents are still not available after the deadline, the offer is to be excluded from the evaluation.
In the Czech Republic, it is at the discretion of the contracting authority whether it gives bidders the opportunity to complete missing evidence or declarations.
If a bidder fails to do so, he must be excluded.
In Germany, in addition to the total price, the unit prices (prices for partial services) of the offers must also be examined.
If, due to the price structure of the offer, there are indications that prices for partial services are too low or too high, the bidder must be asked to remove these ambiguities.
If he fails to do so and the contracting authority can provide proof of a mixed calculation of the prices, this offer must be excluded.
The aim is to prevent bidders from speculating on significant changes in the volume of partial services when calculating their offer, which can lead to significant cost increases in construction projects.
In the Czech Republic, the total price is valued, but not the appropriateness of the prices for partial services.
A mixed calculation cannot justify the exclusion of an offer.
A surcharge may not be awarded in Germany for offers with unreasonably high or low prices.
If one or more offers fall below the correct price determination of the client or the offer amounts of the other bidders by 10 % or more, the bidders must prove the correct calculation of their offers.
If this is not possible for them, the contracting authority may exclude the relevant offers.
In the Czech Republic, the tender can be cancelled after the cost-effectiveness check if only offers with non-justifiable at low prices are available.
In contrast to German public procurement law, the surcharge cannot be refused for offers with prices substantially higher than the client's calculation for this reason.
If there is a suspicion of restrictive behaviour in Germany, the contracting authority must report immediately to its specialist supervisory authority.
It has to decide which measures have to be taken and whether the antitrust authority or the public prosecutor's office should be informed.
The leading level of supervision must, for example, also agree on construction services of more than 50,000 euros if a contract is to be awarded freely, if a surcharge is not to be awarded on the offer with the lowest price or if the tender is to be cancelled.
There are no such regulations in the Czech Republic.
Key audit results
BRH
Suitability and evaluation criteria
The vast majority of the audited procurement procedures corresponded to the specified requirements.
For some companies proposed by freelancers, the contracting authorities did not check the suitability of the companies themselves.
A grant recipient commissioned companies without the required proof of suitability being available in full.
In some cases, it was not comprehensible whether the contracting authority had taken into account all the award criteria announced in its selection decision or whether it had merely based its award decision on the criterion "price".
Selection of persons involved and confidentiality of offers
Some contracting authorities used persons who were not authorised to do so when examining the offers.
For example, freelancers or employees of the department involved in the planning or implementation of a construction project carried out tasks that could only be performed by employees of the contracting authority.
The construction services justified this with insufficient personnel capacities in the respective areas.
In some cases, the freelancers commissioned with the examination of the offers also involved employees who were not obliged to keep the offers confidential and to conscientiously fulfill the contractual obligations.
For the construction services it was usually also not comprehensible whether the offers were only accessible to the persons directly commissioned with the processing by the freelancers.
Review and computational examination of the offers
Some contracting authorities handed over the open offers to freelancers for further examination, without having previously carried out the prescribed review of the offers and the computational examination itself and having documented their results.
In the case of manipulative intentions, third parties could have made changes to the offers without this being comprehensible to the contracting authorities.
In the audited documents, abnormalities or missing price or product information were partially not or only inadequately marked.
Performance audits
For a sample in a building administration, the cheapest offers for three quarters of the audited procurement procedures differed more than 10% from the previously determined estimation costs.
Every 20th award procedure has been cancelled because of inappropriate offer prices.
Not all bidding examinations and reconnaissance discussions with the bidders were comprehensible or sufficiently documented.
In many cases, more detailed explanations were missing, such as on the unit prices of the most important positions.
Often the deviations were only generally justified, e.g. by references to changed market prices or increased material costs.
The construction services explained that it was difficult to identify and prove mixed calculations.
In the case of a tender for an institution under public law, the offer price of the cheapest offer was 66% below the previously determined estimate of these services.
Further calculation tests or investigations on the causes of this deviation were not documented.
In an enlightenment interview, the contracting authority found no evidence of price dumping by the then commissioned company.
As a result, it remained unclear whether the estimated value was excessive or whether the offer price was too low.
Later, the client rated the commissioned company as a "cheap company" that could not keep quality or deadlines.
In another tender, a construction agency awarded the contract to an offer whose price was 35% higher than the value of the cost determination.
It did not cancel the invitation to tender, citing the unfamiliar justification that this company could be concluded on an adequate calculation.
Suspicion of irregularities
In the case of an audited building administration, there were two cases of irregularities, both of which were reported to the technical supervisor.
In one of the cases, the calculation of two bidders was identical in a tender, so that the contracting authority excluded both offers from the procedure.
In the application of the remaining regulations, the tests did not give rise to any significant complaints.
N.K.
Aptitude test
For many of the examined construction projects, including university construction, road construction and the expansion of the rail network, the contracting authorities did not exclude bidders from the procedure, although they did not meet the requirements specified in the tender documents or could not prove their suitability to the prescribed extent. On the other hand, in one case a contracting authority could neither prove nor explain why it had excluded a bidder who had fulfilled the requirements.
Valuation
When awarding construction services for a water treatment plant, the contracting authority did not take into account the specified evaluation criteria in the examination and evaluation of the offers.
In a construction project for the expansion of the railway network, the contracting authority determined the weighting of the evaluation criteria only at the beginning of the evaluation.
In the case of road maintenance measures, the prescribed criterion "shortening the construction phase" was incorrectly evaluated in a procedure.
As a result, the offered shortening was insufficiently taken into account by bidders in second and third positions.
Documentation of the offer selection
In three award procedures in the context of housing promotion, the contracting authority did not document which criteria it had applied and on what basis it had selected the successful bidder.
In the construction of a motorway, the contracting authority selected the companies for smaller orders up to 20,000 euros solely on the basis of telephone surveys on prices and delivery conditions.
Tests of this selection were not possible because the surveys were not documented.
Summary findings
The regulations for the examination and evaluation of offers in both countries comply with the requirements of the EU.
For details of the procedure and the selection of the persons involved, however, the respective regulations differ from each other.
In Germany, the procedure is regulated more strongly than in the Czech Republic by detailed requirements, in particular regarding the implementation of the multi-eye principle and the protection of offers.
The same applies to the requirements on the basis of which the appropriateness of the prices offered must be checked.
In both countries, it had to be established in some of the audited procurement procedures that essential procedural steps in the examination and evaluation of tenders were not or only insufficiently documented.
Without comprehensibility and transparency of the audit and evaluation decisions, however, possible manipulative interventions are favoured.
A particularly serious defect was the handing over of all offers to third parties, without the public client having previously sufficiently reviewed and documented the offers and thus protected them from possible manipulations in the further proceedings.
If public clients have tasks carried out by third parties in the examination and evaluation of the offers, sufficient precautions and an increased control effort are required to counter the increased risk of manipulation.
When assessing the appropriateness of the prices, the audited services in Germany did not always make full use of the specified instruments and did not sufficiently examine the price structure of the offers.
In the Czech Republic, complaints arose mainly in the aptitude test as well as in the application of the evaluation criteria.
Completion of the award procedure
After checking and values of the offers, the award procedure is concluded by awarding the contract or by cancelling the procedure.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
In the case of EU-wide procurement procedures, all bidders must be informed in advance of the planned award decision.
The companies have the possibility to examine the intended award in the case of information by electronic means or by fax within 10 days or with other means of communication within 15 days and, if necessary, to initiate a review procedure.
A contract may not be concluded before this information period expires.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
If a bidder submits a request for review within the information period, the conclusion of a contract is only possible after the final decision in the review procedure.
The companies can also have the award decision reviewed by an independent court within the framework of this review procedure.
The review procedure is intended to ensure the legal protection of companies and to encourage the client to observe the procurement law throughout the procurement procedure.
To do this, he must sufficiently document the procedure.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
Both countries have implemented EU rules on information and verification procedures.
In both countries, the contracting authority has to decide on the award of the contract.
However, it must not deviate arbitrarily from the result of a proper examination and evaluation of the offers.
The client shall place the order within the announced surcharge period,
also because the bidders are no longer bound by their offers after the deadline.
In the case of open and non-open procedures or public and restricted tenders, the client may not deviate from the content of the offer when concluding the contract.
The inferior bidders are to be informed promptly about the award decision and the reasons for not taking their offers into account.
Procurement procedures may only be cancelled under certain conditions, e.g. if the offer prices are excessive or the offers do not meet the requirements of the tender.
Derogations from each other
In the Czech Republic, there is a 10- or 15-day obligation to provide information and to wait before awarding a contract, even for construction services that are not to be awarded throughout Europe.
In Germany, these requirements apply only to the area of EU-wide procurement.
In the case of the other proceedings in Germany, the bidders can only be informed of the award decision after the award of the contract.
In the Czech Republic, a tender procedure must be cancelled if only one offer has been received or only one offer could be evaluated.
In Germany, the contract must also be awarded in the case of only one valuable offer, provided that it complies with the conditions of the tender and is economical.
Key audit results
BRH
In the case of the audited awards, there were only a few complaints at the conclusion of the award procedures.
In some cases, companies received letters of order for EU-wide contracts before the end of the information periods, which may lead to the invalidity of the contract.
In individual cases, order letters also contained content deviating from the content of the offer, such as changed dates, according to open procedures.
In several cases, the contracting authorities did not meet the award deadlines.
In the case of an open procedure, a contracting authority therefore awarded the contract to the second most favourable offer, since a company with a 50% cheaper offer was no longer prepared to carry out the services at the originally offered price after the expiry of the award period.
N.K.
In the case of a construction project in the higher education sector, the contracting authority deviated in terms of content from the bidder's offer.
For some contracts, e.g. for road maintenance construction measures, for the construction of a motorway and a bypass road, the contracting authorities concluded the contracts after the expiry of the statutory period.
When awarding construction services for the renovation of former military premises, the contracting authority only forwarded the notification of the award of the contract to all bidders after the expiry of the statutory period.
Summary findings
Both countries have implemented the EU's requirements to complete the award procedure.
The legal protection of the inferior applicants or bidders increases the tools for preventing corruption.
The scope of legal protection in Czech public procurement law is also extended to contracts below the EU thresholds.
In both countries, the deadlines for awarding contracts have been exceeded.
This can lead to economic disadvantages and increase the risk of manipulation.
In future, the construction authorities should avoid the shortcomings identified in the completion of their procurement procedures.
Documentation, reporting and reporting obligations
The award procedures must be documented in a comprehensible manner during their individual stages with regard to the relevant findings as well as the reasons for the individual decisions.
The contracts awarded must be made known in EU-wide procedures.
The order data is also recorded in an EU statistics.
Requirements of EU law and the prevention of corruption The documentation of the procurement procedures implements a fundamental requirement of the EU-wide transparency requirement.
A carefully and promptly created documentation enables the traceability of the award decisions.
In particular, it also serves the effective legal protection of bidders when awarding contracts above the EU thresholds.
Proper documentation is also an essential part of preventing corruption, as the compulsion to justify award decisions in detail significantly restricts the scope for manipulation.
The announcement of a contract awarded in an EU-wide procurement procedure must be submitted by the respective contracting authority to the Office for Official Publications of the EU within 48 days.
The Office publishes the announcements in the Official Journal of the EU and thus also implements the transparency requirement.
The contracting authorities must also collect the essential data of their procurement procedures and report them to the EU Commission via the relevant national ministries.
On this basis, the EU Commission compiles an annual EU statistics, through which it can gain an overview of the development of the internal market in construction services.
Regulations of German and Czech public procurement law
Same or similar rules
Both countries have fully transposed EU legislation on documentation and reporting requirements into national law.
The rules on documentation and reporting for EU statistics are largely the same in both countries.
Derogations from each other
In the Czech Republic, the obligation to publish contracts awarded is not limited to EU-wide contracts, but also extends to other procurement procedures.
The notice period is shortened to 15 days.
In Germany, in addition to the EU-wide awards, there is a publication obligation only in the case of restricted tenders and in the case of free-handed contracts from value limits of 25,000 euros or 15,000 euros without value added tax (so-called "VAT"). Ex-post transparency).
Below these limits, as well as in the case of public tenders, only the companies involved in the competition procedure receive information about the award of contracts.
Key audit results
BRH
Documentation
A large number of the audited award procedures were not fully documented.
The award notices did not contain all the necessary information, such as the justification of product specifications or references to national regulations.
In a tendering procedure, the contracting authority did not justify why it awarded the contract to a company, even though its offer did not contain mandatory evidence.
In a few cases, the documents of the contracting authorities did not contain all the evidence required for the documentation of the award procedure.
Announcements on the award of orders
In some EU-wide procurement procedures, the contracting authorities failed to make the awarding of contracts known.
Further award procedures lacked the evidence that the contracting authorities had made the awarded contracts known.
Reporting and reporting obligations
The statistical listings viewed contained the required minimum information. They had been prepared and dispatched on time.
Ex-post transparency
In most cases, the audited building authorities published the order data of the completed procurement procedures.
However, a construction administration did not publish this data due to a transmission error.
The building administration noticed this mistake only after half a year,
so that the order data of the procurement procedures completed up to that time have not been published.
N.K.
Documentation
In the case of construction measures for the organisation of a major sporting event, the documentation of the award procedures showed considerable shortcomings. These were mainly inaccurate information, such as incorrect offer prices in the minutes of the valuation commissions.
In addition, some minutes of the offer openings were not signed.
Announcements on the award of orders
In the case of several road construction projects, notices of contracts awarded were published only belatedly or not at all.
Summary findings
The rules on documentation and reporting and reporting obligations are broadly consistent in both countries and implement EU requirements.
The transparency of the procurement procedures, including the award of contracts, is thus guaranteed in principle.
The rules to be applied in the Czech Republic for publication go a little further than the requirements in Germany.
The shortcomings in the documentation and in the announcements shown limited the orruption-preventive effect of these instruments in the respective procurement procedures.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The building authorities should further improve the transparency of their procurement procedures and assignments and fully comply with their reporting and reporting obligations.
Summary evaluation and recommendations
The parallel audits carried out by the NCA and the BRH have focused on two main areas that are essential in the Czech Republic and Germany for the award of works by public authorities: the application of EU public procurement rules and the prevention of corruption.
The requirements of EU law will allow cross-border competition to create a single European market.
Anti-corruption measures not only serve to prevent or at least reduce corruption. They should also avert economic damage and a possible loss of confidence in the integrity of the state.
The audit findings of the two audit bodies on the application of the public procurement rules in both countries and the comparison of these regulations provide information on similarities and differences, which can be helpful for both countries in the further development of their procurement law and its application.
Application of EU public procurement rules
Both countries have transposed the EU's requirements for the award of construction services into national law.
Thus, in the Czech Republic and Germany, there is an important common basis for the award of works and the consideration of the essential requirements of competition, equal treatment of the companies involved and transparency of procurement procedures.
The building authorities of both countries have partly backed these bids very extensively by further administrative regulations.
The Czech Republic has also largely transferred the requirements for the construction services to be awarded throughout the EU to its nationally regulated procurement procedures below the EU threshold.
However, the investigations carried out by the Court of Auditors have shown that the building authorities have not fully complied with the requirements of EU law in all areas.
The building administration in Germany should further improve the quality of its procurement procedures in order to be able to eliminate the complaints raised when implementing the EU regulations.
In particular, the audits in the Czech Republic have identified risks that affect the cost-effectiveness of the awards.
For example, incomplete service descriptions necessitated additional services, which were often awarded in breach of legislation. In addition, the cost assessments were usually insufficiently prepared. Excessive qualification requirements also reduced the number of potential bidders and restricted competition, particularly in the transport sector.
Prevention of corruption
The investigations have not had the aim of uncovering cases of corruption,
also because the Court of Auditors does not have the appropriate instruments for this purpose.
However, the Court of Auditors can examine the extent to which the administrations of both countries have taken precautions against corruption and manipulation in the award of works and how these requirements are applied.
In preventing corruption, both countries have set different priorities.
Above all, the German regulations provide for largely unrestricted competition as well as transparency and controls as central elements of the prevention of corruption.
The Czech regulations are primarily aimed at increasing the transparency of procedures.
BRH
In Germany, general principles of corruption prevention apply, which the entire federal administration has to apply.
These principles are also implemented in the specifications for the award of construction services and are geared to their specific requirements.
In some cases, the relevant regulations specify very precisely how the bids for the prevention of corruption must be taken into account in the course of the award procedures and in the selection of the persons involved.
The BRH considers, in particular, that the primacy of the principle of open procedure or public tendering is a suitable instrument for significantly reducing the risk of corruption in the award of works. Restrictions on competition, on the other hand, increase the risk of manipulative intervention.
Risk analyses and adequate controls (especially the multi-eye principle), the requirements for transparency and documentation of procurement procedures as well as various organizational measures are also effective precautions to prevent corruption and manipulation.
The BRH therefore sees no need for fundamental changes to the corresponding requirements of the administrations in the award of construction services.
The anti-corruption rules are largely taken into account in practice.
The shortcomings identified in some areas have highlighted shortcomings in the implementation of some of the benchmarks.
The building authorities should continue to train their employees on the requirements for corruption prevention and make them even more aware of this problem.
A significant part of the complaints related to tasks that the building authorities had delegated to freelancers.
However, without controls and sufficient safeguards, the risk of abuse increases when delegating tasks.
Therefore, manipulation and corruption-prone tasks should only be transferred to third parties if the administration can guarantee a sufficient level of protection against inadmissible interventions.
N.K.
The Czech Republic adopted at government level a strategy against corruption, in which the area of public procurement is the most important component.
The Procurement Act and its implementing provisions have been substantially amended.
The examinations of the NCD took place during the implementation of this strategy.
The strategy adopted and the new legal provisions should be effective improvement measures, since the contracting authorities must justify the profitability of the award of contracts, the calculation of the expected prices, the appropriateness of the qualification requirements, the essential evaluation criteria and the nature of the evaluations and must properly document and publish all these aspects.
Recommendations
In principle, the NCC and the BRH rate the implementation of the EU requirements positively.
The widespread acceptance in practice has confirmed that the EU's rules on competition, equal treatment and transparency are an appropriate basis for the award of construction services within the European Union.
The supranational model implemented in the European Union can also serve as a basis for similar projects aimed at facilitating and promoting cross-border competition.
In view of the enormous material and ideal damage potential caused by manipulation and corruption in the awarding of construction services, both courts of auditors see the construction authorities in their countries as being required to continue and, if necessary, improve their measures against corruption and manipulation.
In particular, the organisation and procedures of procurement procedures should be continuously examined for weaknesses and risks in order to identify the need for action and to initiate appropriate countermeasures.
The comparison of procurement practices in both countries suggests that the share of open procedures in the Czech Republic should be increased, as open procedures offer a wider scope for competition and can significantly reduce the risk of corruption.
A greater division of construction services into lots can also have a favourable effect on supply prices, provided that this leads to greater competition with a higher number of bidders.
Ensuring the correct implementation of procurement procedures is an essential basis for the efficient awarding of contracts by public authorities.
In Germany, the procurement procedures are carried out by the specialized building authorities. In the Czech Republic, on the other hand, these tasks – with the exception of transport construction projects – are carried out by the departments themselves or by contractors commissioned by them.
The Court of Auditors of both countries has the intention, even after the completion of their joint project, to further develop the relevant findings for them and, if necessary, to bring them to the parliament and government of their country.
Both audit institutions are also convinced that the principles of public procurement law set out in this report and its implementation are also of interest at the international level of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI). The principles and findings set out above are of general importance in order to effectively combat corruption and to ensure the economic award of works in a well-functioning and fair competition.
Annexes
Administration of VAT in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany
Report on the audit
Foreword
Taxes are the main source of income for public budgets.
A focus of the Court of Auditors' activities should therefore be on the audit of this area.
This applies in particular to VAT fraud.
This alone causes annual tax losses in the European Union of an estimated EUR 100 billion1.
Already at the 6th EUROSAI Congress 2005 in Bonn, the participants pointed out the need for increased cooperation.
This makes it possible for the Court of Auditors, e.g. Exchange examination approaches and optimise the examination practice.
VAT is particularly suitable for cooperation, as it is harmonised within the European Union.
In 2006, for the first time, the courts of auditors of both countries conducted parallel audits in the area of the USt.
The corresponding audit report was published in 2008.
Since USt fraud is a widespread phenomenon in the European Union, close cooperation between the courts of auditors is needed. This allows a comprehensive assessment of whether the measures taken are suitable for effectively countering the USt fraud.
The two audit bodies decided to continue their cooperation and carried out a second parallel audit. Administration of VAT in the Czech Republic and in the Federal Republic of Germany Report on the audit
1. Introduction
Examination number:(CZ) 09/11 (D) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892
Subject of the audit: (CZ) Administration of the USt (D) Bilateral audit with the Court of Auditors of the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as NKx), audit
The aim of the audit is to:
(CZ) The USt administration and the treatment of selected transactions between entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic (hereinafter CZ) and the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter Germany) should be examined. In addition, the procedures used by the tax authorities in intergovernmental mutual assistance should be examined.
(D) The audit should evaluate how the financial administration has implemented the recommendations made by the audit bodies.
In addition, further examination fields - linked to the USt - should be processed.
The findings should be compared in order to determine whether tax procedures can be optimised.
The examination period was the years 2006 to 2008 including relevant information from the period before the examination period up to the conclusion of the examination.
2. Summary of the results and evaluation of the parallel examination
The courts of auditors of the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have agreed on an audit for the administration of the USt.
In the previous parallel examination, they had uncovered suspected cases of intra-Community transactions,
which made a re-examination purpose appear.
On the basis of the audit findings, the two Court of Auditors issued recommendations for the administration of the USt.
The aim of the audit was to evaluate how these recommendations were implemented. In addition, the identified suspected cases should be investigated.
The examination also dealt with other issues. These included selected cases of high-risk intra-Community transactions, mutual assistance in the recovery of USt claims and the USt audit of large companies.
The Court of Auditors found that:
1. Recommendations made on the basis of the previous audit
Recommendation 1: The rules for the registration of taxable persons should be harmonised within the EU
In the first audit, the Court of Auditors compared the registration procedures for the USt in the two states and found differences that caused problems.
The Court of Auditors therefore recommended harmonising the registration of taxable persons within the EU.
This has also been taken up at EU level.
The draft amendment to Council Regulation No 1798/2003 provides for the extension of the existing databases in the EU, including a database with the identification number of USt persons.
The draft also provided for common rules for the registration of taxable persons and their possible deletion.
The Court of Auditors expected Member States to agree, in accordance with their decision in principle, on appropriate arrangements to remove unreliable entrepreneurs from the USt system as early as possible.
Member States reached political agreement in ECOFIN on the final version of the draft.
The above-mentioned common rules are no longer included. The two Court of Auditors regret this.
They still consider such regulations to be important in order to prevent VAT fraud.
Recommendation 2: Monthly submission of summary notifications As a result of the first audit, the Court of Auditors recommended that Member States submit summary notifications (CMs) on a monthly basis in the future.
The amounts of intra-Community transactions could then be reviewed more closely.
Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax (VAT) for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-Community transactions has shortened the deadline for the surrender of the ZM to one month.
In the CZ, this requirement was implemented by an amendment to the USt Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.
In Germany, implementation did not enter into force until 1 July 2010. It has thus failed to transpose the obligation to submit the ZM monthly into national law on time.
Recommendation 3: Data synchronisation of USt pre-registrations and ZM in Germany for more reliable MIAS data and proposal to examine the merging of procedures for USt pre-registrations and ZM The German financial administration has taken up the recommendation made by the Federal Audit Office and set up a working group to develop possible solutions.
The work has not yet been completed.
The Federal Audit Office will monitor the further development.
Recommendation 4: Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level In the course of the first audit, the two audit bodies agreed that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by one Member State alone.
Successful criteria as well as elements or approaches of a risk management system must be exchanged and implemented in each EU Member State.
If this does not happen, fraudsters will focus on the Member State with the weakest risk management system.
The Court of Auditors found that the two Member States apply different risk management systems, which have both strengths and weaknesses.
The NKU examined the system of information exchange within the EU - EUROCANET, while the Federal Audit Office focused on the German participation in the "Platform for Risk Management".
2. Verification of selected intra-Community transactions
At the first audit, the Court of Auditors had jointly examined transactions in which it was doubtful whether they had actually been carried out or those of the taxable persons of the two states in the USt pre-registrations (or. USt declarations) or ZM had been explained differently.
The Court of Auditors selected nine cases of intra-Community deliveries of goods between CZ and Germany for the audit.
The audits by the tax offices (FÄ) of both states had not yet been completed at the conclusion of the first parallel audit.
The audit showed that the tax procedures for these selected transactions have now been completed. The respective financial administrations had taken appropriate measures to this end (e.g. subsequent USt fixes or the prevention of pre-tax refunds).
3. Examination of selected, particularly risky intra-Community sales
The audit also included highly risky intra-Community transactions between taxable persons in the EU covered by the EUROCANET system.
EUROCANET is used to identify taxable persons at risk.
Member States can participate in this system on a voluntary basis.
CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET. Germany has a passive status, i.e. it does not participate in the exchange of data within the framework of EUROCANET.
From the point of view of an active participating state, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to participate actively.
As a result, no information could be obtained about which suppliers with German USt-ID would have been classified as highly risky cases.
The NKU found both normal business transactions and those suspected of USt fraud, including carousel fraud, in the selected sales.
The FÄ were only able to examine sales with high risk to a limited extent. This was particularly true for so-called "missing traders", whereby an examination of the documents alone is hardly sufficient to be able to prove fraud to the taxpayer.
Suspicion of carousel fraud in imports and exports
it is advisable for customs and tax authorities to work more closely together in order to be able to track the originality of the goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final customer.
Germany and a number of other countries have refused to participate actively in EUROCANET because they do not believe that there is a sufficient legal basis.
The Bundesrechnungshof found that the German tax administration uses other instruments to identify taxable persons at risk.
However, there is a need for communication and exchange of experience between all EU Member States.
The Council of the EU agreed on a draft regulation:
was created by the EUROFISC.
The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should be incorporated into the planned network for combating USt fraud.
4. Mutual assistance in the recovery of claims
Intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims is subject to the same European legislation in all Member States.
Therefore, requests for intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in the CZ and Germany are dealt with in the same way.
Bundesrechnungshof and NKU compared the statistics that both Member States submitted to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.
These statistics contained inconsistencies.
The two Court of Auditors consider it useful to re-discuss statistics at EU level in order to avoid any remaining inconsistencies in the future.
If this does not happen, the statistics cannot be used appropriately for comparisons.
In addition, the statistics should contain more information about the USt.
An analysis of detailed data can make it easier for the Commission to support Member States in their efforts to combat USt fraud.
Both audit institutions believe that Member States with a low recovery rate should strive to achieve at least the average recovery rate.
The Commission should support the Member States in this, if desired.
5. USt testing at large companies
The Court of Auditors analysed the legal situation regarding the USt audit of large companies in both states.
In addition, they collected information from the financial administrations with a questionnaire, which they considered important in this context.
It became clear that the situation in both countries is different.
CZ has a system for selecting risky cases that includes a large amount of relevant data (including information on USt audits, balance sheet data, and profit and loss statements).
As a result, the USt control can be effectively controlled and analyzed overall.
A special finance office for large companies is to be set up in 2012.
Germany does not yet have a comparable system. This complicates the control and analysis of the USt control as a whole.
The German financial administration concentrates more on the selection of relevant individual cases and relies in particular on data from the USt pre-registrations or USt declarations and the ZM.
Various risk management components, which are to be improved, support the evaluation of this data.
3. Examination procedure
3.1 Examination procedure in the Czech Republic
Division II - Government Budget Revenues as well as the Regional Departments I-Pilsen, I-Eesk-Budjovice, xiii Brno and xv Ostrava audited in the period May 2009 to February 2010.
Certified bodies were the Czech Ministry of Finance and 25 FÄ: Tax Office (FA) Brno II, FA Brno III, FA Brno IV, FA in Beclav, FA in Doma-lice, FA in Hodon-n, FA in Hradec Kr-lov, FA in Cheb, FA in Jablonec nad Nisou, FA in Karlovy Vary, FA in Kralupy nad Vltavou, FA in Kraslice, FA in Ostrava, FA in
The Senate of the Czech Court of Auditors approved the audit findings on 27 April 2010.
3.2 Examination procedures in Germany
The examination area traffic taxes and employees of the assigned PÄB Berlin, Frankfurt/Main and Munich examined from February 2009 to February 2010.
After selecting the examples, they announced the examination in several countries:
Bavaria, Hamburg, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia, Saxony. In addition, they conducted interviews at the Federal Ministry of Finance (Federal Ministry of Finance).
Tax files from the following FÄ were included in the audit: - Erlangen, Zentralfinanzamt München, Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Grafenau; - Hamburg-Nord, Hamburg-Hansa, Sonderfinanzamt Hamburg für Großunternehmen; - Wiesbaden I, Wiesbaden II, Darmstadt; - Essen-NordOst, FA Essen for tax audits at large companies and corporations, Lüdenscheid; - Chemnitz-Süd.
Discussions were also held with FÄ Mühlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-Süd and OFD Frankfurt/Main, Chemnitz and Münster.
The Federal Audit Office informed the Federal Ministry of Finance of the audit results in April 2010.
3.3 Cooperation between the two Courts of Auditors
In the run-up to the parallel audit, the representatives of both audit bodies met in September 2008 to discuss and define the audit topics.
In December 2008, the Presidents of both Courts of Auditors signed the agreement on co-operation in the parallel audit.
At a meeting in Bonn in June 2009, the examination teams informed themselves about the initial results obtained during the examination preparation, discussed possible examination approaches and agreed on the next steps.
A second meeting took place in Prague from 2 to 4 December 2009.
The examination teams exchanged the audit findings obtained up to that point and agreed on the timetable for the preparation of the joint audit report.
The two audit bodies set out the following topics for their parallel audit: - Evaluation of the recommendations made in the previous report; - Review of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between taxable persons from the CZ and from Germany, which could not be fully clarified during the first parallel audit; - Review of selected intra-Community transactions classified as risky between taxable persons from the CZ and Germany; - Examination of the procedures of the two tax administrations with regard to intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of U.S. claims; - Examination of the procedures of the two tax administrations in respect
The report on the results of the parallel audit was prepared during a working meeting in June 2010.
4. Examination of the management of VAT in selected areas
4.1 Implementation of the recommendations from the first joint audit
4.1.1 Implementation of recommendations in the Czech Republic
Recommendation 1
Harmonisation of the conditions for registration of taxable persons within the EU Supported
on the results of the first audit, the Czech Court of Auditors has recommended adapting the requirements for VAT registration and introducing new rules for the deletion of registration in the CZ.
These amended rules should reduce the risk of possible tax evasion more effectively.
In certain cases, it was found that the FÄ did not delete the VAT registration of taxable persons if they did not comply with their obligations under Czech Law No. 235/2004 (hereinafter referred to as the "USt Act").
So far, the Czech Ministry of Finance has not submitted an amendment to oblige the FÄ to delete if the taxable persons repeatedly do not submit USt declarations.
Under the Czech USt Act, the FA may ex officio delete the registration of a taxable person if a) the taxable person has not made any transactions for twelve consecutive months and has not informed the FA of the reasons for doing so; b) the taxable person has not fulfilled his obligations under the USt Act; c) the taxable person no longer meets the requirements for tax liability.
The first examination had shown that, due to the existing legal situation, FA Prague 1 must delete the USt registration of "foreign taxable persons"3 with effect from 31 January of the following calendar year, if they were not obliged to register and pay USt in the current calendar year.
The FA Prague 1 often did not delete the USt registration of these taxable persons, because the relevant provision of the deadline could not be adequately implemented in practice.
The problem was solved by the amendment of the USt Act, which came into force on 1 January 2009.
Accordingly, the FA is authorized to delete the registration of a foreign taxable person if he has not provided taxable or tax-exempt goods deliveries or services with the right to deduct input tax in the previous calendar year.
Recommendation 2
Monthly submission of the ZM
On the basis of the first audit, the Court of Auditors had recommended that the monthly levy of ZM be introduced.
The Council Directive, which shortened the cycle for the surrender of the ZM to one month, was implemented in the CZ by the USt Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.
The ZM must now be delivered electronically.
In addition, a ZM must be surrendered if services whose place of performance is to be determined in accordance with Section 9(1) of the UST Act are provided for a person registered in another Member State as subject to VAT.
The prerequisite is that the recipient is obliged to declare and pay the USt for these services. This obligation arises from Council Directive 2008/8/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC as regards the place of supply of services.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of the data of the USt pre-registrations and the ZM to increase the reliability of the MIAS data This recommendation related to the German financial administration.
In its ATIS4 system, the Czech financial administration automatically compares the data on intra-Community transactions from the USt declarations and the ZM.
Recommendation 4
Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level
The proper collection of the USt is an essential prerequisite for the proper functioning of the EU internal market.
That is why the fight against USt fraud is of primary interest and has received considerable attention in recent years.
The importance of this is demonstrated, among other things, by a study published by the European Commission in October 2009.
In it, an external expert estimated the USt failure for the 25 Member States between 2000 and 2006. After evaluating the available data, the tax loss for the period mentioned was estimated at 90 to 113 billion euros. This was based on the fact that the EU-25 loses an average of 12% of the turnover taxes due to them each year.
The estimated tax loss for CZ in 2006 was 18%.
The first audit found that a Member State cannot develop an effective risk management system (RMS) on its own.
Successful criteria, components or approaches for an RMS must be exchanged and implemented in each Member State.
In relation to the RMS, the Czech Court of Auditors examined the system for the exchange of information within the EU (EUROCANET).
Risky intra-Community transactions carried out by taxable persons within the EU and recorded in EUROCANET were selected for this purpose (see Chapter 4.3).
The EUROFISC network aims to optimise mutual assistance in tax matters and to combat USt fraud more effectively. Cooperation between the competent authorities should be improved in order to detect fraud as early as possible.
Later, EUROFISC could be used as a tool to estimate the risk potential of intra-Community sales.
The ECOFIN Council6 already approved EUROFISC on 7 October 2008 and at the same time adopted the principles for the functioning of the system.
The model for EUROFISC is EUROCANET, which was developed by the Belgian financial administration in cooperation with the other Member States and with the support of the European Commission and OLAF7.
The purpose of the system is to uncover risky sales and identify entrepreneurs involved in organized USt fraud.
4.1.2 Implementation of the recommendations in Germany
The evaluation of the recommendations of the first report led to the following findings:
Recommendation 1
Harmonisation of the conditions for registration of taxable persons within the EU
Based on a detailed questionnaire, the German tax administration has developed a well-functioning system for the registration of taxable persons.
The Federal Ministry of Finance presented this system to the Commission in October 2007.
The system itself is constantly being improved.
The data provided in the questionnaire is now collected electronically and will later be available for research. They are therefore part of the risk management during registration.
The Commission had made a proposal8 to amend Regulation 1798/2003. This included common standards for the registration and deletion of taxable persons.
There was still a need for clarification and clarification in the Member States.
The Federal Audit Office had recommended to the Federal Ministry of Finance not to fall short of the standards already achieved.
Recommendation 2
Monthly submission of the ZM
On 8 April 2010, a law9 on the transposition of EU directives into national law was passed.
It contains, among other things, Provisions for the monthly levy of the ZM for intra-Community deliveries
and enters into force on 1 July 2010.
Recommendation 3
Comparison of the data of the USt pre-registrations and the ZM for more reliable MIAS data and considerations for merging the previously separate procedures for filing the USt pre-registrations and the ZM
A joint federal-state working group has been set up,
which has developed a concept for the automatic comparison of the data from the USt pre-registrations and the ZM.
The concept is still under discussion with the countries.
In addition, this working group dealt with a concept for optimising the control procedure for intra-Community transactions.
Recommendation 4
Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level At EU level, relevant information is exchanged.
Germany participates in the risk management platform.
The European Commission supported the initiative and, by written procedure dated 18 October 2006, initiated the establishment of a risk management platform within the "Fiscalis 2006-2007" action plan.
The members of the platform dealt in 4 sub-groups with the following topics: risk management tools, influencing the behaviour of taxable persons, evaluation, updating the risk management guide.
New reports from the Risk Management Instruments subgroups and the Update of the Risk Management Guide were published in early 2010.
4.1.3 Evaluation
Registration
The question of the requirements for USt registration and its deletion in different countries has been dealt with at EU level.
The draft amended Council Regulation 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT and repealing Regulation (EEC) 218/92 provides for the extension of the existing databases within the EU, including a database of USt identification numbers.
This proposal also includes common standards for the registration and deletion of taxable persons.
The questions of registration and deletion are reserved until further notice for the national legislation of the EU Member States.
There was still a need for clarification and clarification in the Member States.
The Federal Audit Office had recommended to the Federal Ministry of Finance not to fall behind the standards already achieved.
Member States reached political agreement on the final version of the draft in ECOFIN on 8 June 2010.
It no longer contains common rules for the registration and deletion of taxable persons.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The two Court of Auditors regret this. They still consider such regulations to be important in order to prevent VAT fraud.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Monthly submission of the ZM
With regard to international cooperation, as a result of the previous examination, it was recommended that all Member States introduce the monthly levy of the ZM in order to allow an earlier examination of the amounts of intra-Community transactions.
Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax (VAT) for the purpose of combating tax fraud in intra-Community transactions has shortened the rate of payment of the corresponding ZM to one month.
In the CZ, this requirement was implemented by the amendment to the USt Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2010.
Germany did not implement the obligation to pay the monthly ZM tax until 1 July 2010 and thus not on time, while the CZ complied with the requirements of the EU.
Comparison of the data of the USt pre-registrations and the ZM for more reliable MIAS data and considerations for merging the previously separate procedures for filing the USt pre-registrations or the ZM
The German financial administration has taken up the recommendations of the Federal Audit Office and set up a working group to develop possible solutions.
The Federal Audit Office will monitor the further development.
Exchange of successful criteria, components or approaches for a risk management system at EU level
Germany and CZ use different approaches to identify high-risk entrepreneurs.
The Czech Court of Auditors examined the application of the EUROCANET system in CZ (see Section 4.3).
The Federal Audit Office focused on Germany's participation in the risk management platform.
4.2 Verification of selected intra-Community transactions
The first audit examined jointly transactions where there were doubts as to whether they had actually been carried out or whether discrepancies had been found in the notifications of taxable persons in both Member States.
The two audit bodies selected nine cases of intra-Community deliveries of goods between CZ and Germany for the audit, for which the tax audit by the FÄ of the Member State concerned had not yet been completed at the time of the previous joint audit.
1)
A Czech taxable person purchased goods worth 22 686 euros from a German taxable person in the first quarter of 2005.
The Czech taxable person did not declare the acquisition in his USt declaration,daderGerman taxable person mentioned period had no USt identification number, but only a tax number for domestic German sales.
Through international mutual assistance in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the competent Czech FA had received information that according to German USt law the supplier of intra-Community goods does not need a USt identification number in order to be able to claim the tax exemption of intra-Community goods deliveries.
The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that, according to the examination of the competent Czech FA, the Czech taxpayer filed an additional VAT declaration declaring the purchase of goods in the above-mentioned value and at the same time asserting his right to deduct VAT in the same amount.
2)
A Czech taxable person is said to have purchased goods worth EUR 12 561 from a German taxable person in the fourth quarter of 2004.
However, he stated that he had not purchased the goods and therefore did not declare them in his USt statement.
On the basis of a provision of Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the German financial administration refused to process the request because the turnover associated with the acquisition did not exceed the threshold of EUR 15 000.
Since the Czech FA could not obtain any documents, the tax audit remained inconclusive and the original tax determination remained in place.
The audit by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech FA received two spontaneous information from Germany in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, according to which the German taxpayer had invoiced the goods in question to a Slovak addressee.
The Czech taxable person purchased the goods from the Slovak taxable person and stated the purchase in his regular USt declaration for the month of October 2004.
3)
A Czech taxable person is said to have purchased a car worth 48 500 euros from a German taxable person in the fourth quarter of 2004.
However, he did not declare an intra-Community acquisition.
In addition, he had not made a U.S. declaration since August 2004. Therefore, the FA set the USt for the quarter in question at 0 CZK.
Based on information transmitted from Germany in the course of the international exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the FA asked the taxpayer in March 2007 to file a subsequent tax return, but the taxpayer failed to do so.
The audit found that the FA had carried out further examinations in this tax case in 2007. It found that the car in question had been sold by the taxpayer to a used car dealer in the CZ.
The Czech FA carried out an assessment for the tax period December 2004, setting additional taxes of CZK 295 379 for the purchase and resale of goods from another Member State.
The competent Czech court decided to open insolvency proceedings over the assets of the Czech taxpayer; an insolvency administrator was appointed.
In the absence of significant assets, the outstanding tax liability is unlikely to be recoverable.
4)
A Czech taxable person is said to have delivered new vehicles (passenger cars) to Germany in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005 with a total value of 198 167 euros.
In response to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, it was stated that tax proceedings were pending against the German taxpayer in Germany.
The audit of the Federal Court of Auditors showed that after the conclusion of the proceedings there was evidence that the German taxpayer was involved in fraud.
The intra-Community purchase of goods was subject to employment taxation in the amount of EUR 182 424 (for 2004) and EUR 369 690 (for 2005).
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech taxpayer was involved in carousel fraud involving new vehicles.
On the basis of information provided by the German tax administration, a USt audit of the Czech taxable person took place for the tax periods April, May and June 2005.
Based on the examination findings and the information from the international exchange of information, the FA set an additional USt of 703 031 CZK for May 2005 and 726 551 CZK for June 2005.
5)
Czech taxable person A is said to have purchased a machine with a total value of 58,000 euros from a German taxable person in February 2005.
The German taxable person is said to have delivered a machine worth 88 027 euros to Czech taxable person B in the third quarter of 2004. However, B denied the acquisition.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that B had purchased the machine from a German company with a branch in CZ.
The Czech taxable person A did not specify the purchase of the goods from the aforementioned German taxable person in his USt declaration.
The reply of the German FA to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 showed that the German taxpayer had not made an intra-Community delivery of a machine worth 58 000 euros, but a delivery within the CZ.
In the audit, the Federal Court of Auditors found that the intra-Community delivery of the machine was classified as domestic delivery after completion of an audit and that the USt exemption was subsequently refused.
6)
A German taxable person is said to have delivered goods worth 11 600 euros to a Czech taxable person in the third quarter of 2004.
The goods were purchased and later sold in Germany, i.e. in 2005.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the Czech FA had made its assessment on the basis of a supplementary USt declaration which inadmissibly identified acquisitions from another Member State, including acquisitions in the above amount.
The Federal Court of Auditors found that after receiving a reply to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the German FA corrected the USt declaration of the German taxable person and set additional USt in the amount of 1,600 euros.
Due to the resale of the goods in Germany and the corresponding USt investment there, an examination is ongoing.
The ZM of the German taxable person has not been corrected so far, since in Germany only the taxable person who has surrendered the ZM can correct it.
7)
The competent Czech FA received a request for information from the German tax administration in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003 on the question of the acquisition of a car worth 47 400 euros by a Czech taxable person in February 2005.
After an examination for the tax period 2005 the Czech FA fixed the tax liability of the Czech taxable person with 0 CZK and informed the German FA that it could not confirm the purchase of the car by the Czech taxable person.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors showed that the registration of the Czech USt official had been deleted because he had failed to comply with his tax obligations.
The Czech FA had forwarded the documents to the Czech police.
The German taxable person has so far not corrected his information in the ZM, but has appealed against the tax ruling.
8)
According to MIAS10, between the third quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005, a German taxable person delivered goods with a total value of 33 205 euros to a Czech taxable person, which he did not declare to be an intra-Community acquisition.
The audit carried out by the Czech Court of Auditors found that the Czech FA examined the reasons for the inconsistencies.
For the first quarter of 2005, the Czech taxable person repeatedly issued subsequent USt declarations.
Nevertheless, the Czech FA was unable to clarify the difference in the amount of CZK 134 273 in the third quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2005. It justified this on the grounds that sales for individual quarters could not be accurately allocated and accepted the USt statements made.
9)
In the third quarter of 2004, a German taxable person delivered goods worth 46 854 euros to a Czech taxable person.
For the same period, the Czech taxpayer declared the intra-Community purchase of goods worth only 14 856 euros.
As part of the intergovernmental exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003, the Czech FA checked the actual value of the delivery.
With the German answer to this request, three invoices were sent which showed a total value of the delivered goods of 31 998 euros, i.e. an amount corresponding to the difference between the purchase declared by the Czech taxpayer and the MIAS data.
According to the results of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors, the Czech taxpayer had filed a subsequent USt declaration for the July 2004 tax period after repeated warnings from the FA in January 2007.
With this declaration, the taxpayer simultaneously asserted his right to deduct input tax. His tax liability for the tax period in question therefore remained unchanged.
The audit confirmed that most of the tax procedures relating to the transactions selected for the audit had been completed and that the financial administrations in the CZ and Germany had taken appropriate measures (e.g. subsequent USt fixing or prevention of pre-tax refunds).
4.3 Examination of selected cases of risky intra-Community transactions
4.3.1 Findings in the Czech Republic
EUROCANET can be an important source of information to identify high-risk taxpayers in the Member State of acquisition.
In the CZ, the early warning information obtained from EUROCANET is checked by the responsible FA with the purchasers.
Since the first quarter of 2008, CZ has included information on sales and taxable suppliers deemed to be risky in the EUROCANET system.
Nine Czech taxable persons were selected for the audit;
which had been entered into EUROCANET by the financial administrations of other Member States either as suppliers or purchasers.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Since the German financial administration did not participate in the exchange of data via EUROCANET, it could not be determined whether suppliers with a German USt identification number were classified as risky by the German financial administration.
The audit identified both normal business transactions and those suspected of carousel fraud or other USt fraud.
In the cases concerned, the FÄ exchanged information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 1798/2003,
e.g. B:
During the examination of the early warning information, the FÄ found no suspicion of risky sales.
The taxable persons concerned were constantly monitored because their data was stored in EUROCANET.
The FÄ did not manage to prove violations of the rules for calculating the tax base and the USt on the basis of the accounting documents submitted, even though they found inconsistencies in the transport and storage of the goods or revealed business relations with letterbox companies from other Member States.
The review of individual transactions was complicated because certain taxable persons did not cooperate with the FÄ and could not be contacted.
The competent FÄ reviewed most of the risk-bearing taxable persons and transactions mentioned in EUROCANET's early warning reports.
However, their possibilities for checking risky sales, especially so-called "missing traders", are limited.
In particular, a mere examination of the documents can hardly provide evidence of fraudulent action by the taxpayer.
Stricter requirements for the registration of taxable persons for USt purposes and greater flexibility in the deletion of registrations would be helpful to combat the USt fraud.
The taxable persons involved in fraudulent carousel transactions can be registered for USt purposes in order to fake fictitious deliveries of goods throughout the EU or to issue formally correct tax documents to other taxable persons, with which they then assert unjustified claims for deduction of input tax.
In the event of suspected carousel fraud in connection with imports and exports, it is advisable for customs and tax authorities to cooperate more closely in order to be able to monitor the identity of the goods and their actual transport routes within the EU to the final customer.
Member States can participate in EUROCANET on a voluntary basis.
The fact that three large Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not participate was seen by the European Parliament at the end of 200811 as a weakness of the system, which should be remedied by setting up a EUROFISC network with mandatory participation.
4.3.2 Findings in Germany
The Federal Audit Office evaluated data available at the Federal Central Tax Office, including data from EUROCANET.
They served as a basis for the selection of six German taxable persons whose files were checked.
Both Germany and a number of other countries refused to participate actively in EUROCANET.
That is why Germany has a passive status, i.e. it does not send any data to Brussels itself, but is only the recipient of EUROCANET data.
This is justified by the fact that “from the point of view of the Federal Government
no unquestionable legal basis exists, which would make it possible to break the tax secrecy existing in Germany.
In addition, the Federal Government does not have reliable information on how information sent by the Member States is processed within the framework of EUROCANET".12 Since October 2007, the Federal Central Tax Office has been evaluating the EUROCANET data and transmitting it to the federal and state tax authorities on the basis of a coordinated procedure.
The German FÄ receive control notifications about the direct business relations of the taxable persons registered with them with companies from other EU countries recorded in EUROCANET.
However, the respective German FA does not receive any information as to whether the company from the aforementioned other EU Member State has business relations with a company based in another Member State, which is also in business relationship with the German company from the control communication.
4.3.3 Evaluation
CZ is an active participant in EUROCANET, while Germany has only a passive status.
From the point of view of an active participant, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to participate actively.
Accordingly, the examination in this area had to be carried out differently.
However, there were no significant differences in the success of detecting USt fraud. The reason for this is that EUROCANET is only one component of the risk management system.
However, the financial administrations of both countries have a variety of other instruments at their disposal to detect fraudulent transactions. Nevertheless, it is necessary to develop a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.
The Council of the European Union agreed on a draft regulation13, which created EUROFISC, a network to combat USt fraud.
The experience gained so far with EUROCANET should be shared by Member States at European level and incorporated into this network.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The cases brought before the courts at national and European level show that there is a need for discussion between the Member States and the Commission on the conditions for tax exemption for intra-Community transactions.
4.4 Mutual assistance in the recovery of claims
4.4.1 Intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic
Legislation on intergovernmental mutual assistance for the recovery of certain claims in the EU is essentially based on:
Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to measures forming part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as levies and duties;
Council Directive 2001/44/EC amending Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to measures forming part of the financing system of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, as well as levies and duties and as regards VAT and certain excise duties; and
Commission Directive 2002/94/EC laying down detailed implementing provisions for certain articles of Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims relating to certain levies, duties, taxes and other measures.
The CZ implemented Council Directive 76/308/EEC by Law No. 252/2000 on intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of certain claims.
Following the adoption of Council Directive 2001/44/EC, this too had to be transposed into Czech law. At the same time, an amendment to the aforementioned law was required.
In this context, Amendment No 191/2004 on intergovernmental assistance for the recovery of certain claims was adopted.
A new relevant piece of legislation was adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1179/2008 of 28 November 2008.
The annexes to this regulation contain new application forms to be used from 1 January 2009. Furthermore, the Regulation makes electronic transmission mandatory and obliges the requesting authority to certify the conformity of all documents sent with the respective original.
Essential principles of international mutual assistance for the recovery of claims are:
1. The principle of reciprocity applies;
2. Mutual assistance must always be provided only upon request and in the event that all conditions are met;
3. Mutual assistance does not cover claims which are considered criminal sanctions in the requested State;
4. The procedure of intergovernmental mutual assistance for the recovery of claims must be carried out in accordance with the national law of the requested State;
5. In the recovery process, foreign claims do not take precedence over domestic claims;
6. Mutual assistance is provided only for the recovery of undisputed claims;
7. The principle of exhaustion applies: the requesting State shall use all means available to it under national law to recover the claim.
Law No. 191/2004 provides for three forms of mutual assistance: provision of information, notification of legal acts and actual recovery.
Procedures for outgoing requests to other EU Member States
The competent FA shall transmit the request for information, the request for notification of legal acts or the recovery request together with the relevant documents electronically to the Ministry of Finance of the CZ via the respective Financial Directorate.
The Ministry of Finance of the CZ arranges the translation of the request into the language in question, scans it with all facilities and transmits it via the communication network or the common interface CCN/CSI to the competent financial authority of the state concerned.
A request for recovery aid must meet the following conditions: the claim must exceed EUR 1 500 and must not be older than five years.
The requested authority may refuse recovery if the requirements are not met.
Procedures for incoming requests from other Member States
The receipt of requests from other Member States must be confirmed by the Ministry of Finance of the CZ as soon as possible, at the latest within seven days.
If it decides not to grant the request, it must inform the requesting authority of the reasons for the refusal, citing the specific provisions of the directive on which it is based.
The corresponding notification must be sent no later than three months after the date of receipt of the confirmation of receipt of the request.
Upon receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance examines whether the request meets all legal requirements.
It will then send the request to the relevant FA through the relevant Financial Directorate. If the recovery request is granted, the FA must, among other things, determine the debtor's financial circumstances, e.g. by extracts from the land register, enquiries about existing bank accounts and registration of vehicles at the registration office.
After six months from the date of receipt of the request, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ shall inform the requesting authority of the outcome of the investigation.
The requesting authority must also be informed if the taxable persons concerned are unavailable and the claim cannot therefore be settled.
All sums successfully recovered must be transferred to the requesting authority within one month of recovery.
The Czech FA dealing with the recovery may, with the consent of the requesting State, agree to the claim for hours or payment of instalments.
The interest or default surcharges imposed on the debtor for the delay period in accordance with Law No. 337/1992 on the administration of taxes and fees
the requesting State shall be entitled to do so.
In particular, in 2006 and 2007, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ forwarded the recovery requests received to the relevant FA in a delayed manner.
The same applied to the forwarding of the recovery requests made by the Czech FÄ to the competent authority in the requested state.
The investigation found that the Ministry of Finance had violated the Act on Intergovernmental Assistance for the Recovery of Claims. It had failed to inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State of the state of play of the recovery procedure within six months of confirmation of receipt of the request.
The situation has improved since 2008.
Statistical data
Pursuant to Section 13(4) of Law 191/2004, the Ministry of Finance of the CZ shall draw up statistics for the European Commission by 15 March of each year. This includes the number of requests submitted in the previous year and the requests received for information, notification of legal acts and recovery, including the amount of the respective claims.
Based on the data provided by the Member States, the European Commission prepares its report to the Council and the European Parliament on the application of the provisions on mutual assistance in the recovery of claims.
The audit showed that in 2008 the Ministry of Finance of the CZ gave the claims by EUR 5 250 000 too low. The reason was the incorrect indication of the amount of a USt demand introduced in 2008 (caused by the postponement of a decimal comma in the conversion of the claim of Czech crowns into euros).
The error was subsequently reflected in the statistics of the European Commission.
Information on mutual recovery assistance is presented in the table below.
4.4.2 Intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of claims in Germany
The legal basis for intergovernmental mutual assistance in tax matters is Council Directive 2008/55/EC of 26 May 2008 (EC Recovery Directive)14 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1178/2008 of 28 November 2008 (EC Implementation Directive).
In order to improve readability and clarity, the EC Accession Directive codified Council Directive 76/308/EEC of 15 March 197616, the provisions of which had been substantially amended several times.
It regulates, among other things, the recovery of USt and taxes on income and assets, including the associated interest, fees and default surcharges.
The EC Contribution Directive was transposed into German law by the Recovery Act (EC)17 of 3 May 2003.
The enforcement procedure in Germany is regulated by the German Tax Code (AO).
Section 117 (2) AO provides that the tax authorities may provide intergovernmental legal and administrative assistance by virtue of international treaties and legal norms of the European Communities applicable in national law, as well as by virtue of the EC Official Assistance Act.
Part Six of the AO (section 249-346) contains the legislation governing the enforcement procedure.
The administrative activities of the financial authorities regulate in particular the execution and enforcement instructions.
The Federal Ministry of Finance agreed with the representatives of the Supreme Financial Authorities of the Länder on the principles of mutual assistance in tax matters and transferred its own competence in this area to the Federal Central Tax Office18.
General conditions for the admissibility of a recovery aid request are:
The legal requirements must be met (Section 251, 254 AO).
All recovery funds available domestically have been exhausted.
The claims for which mutual assistance is requested are incontestable.
The period between the issuance of the Enforcement Order or the date on which the claim or title became unchallengeable and the date of the request may not exceed five years.
The claim must be at least EUR 1 500.
Procedures for outgoing requests to other EU Member States The German requests for recovery of backward taxes are forwarded by the enforcement bodies of the FÄ via the competent central authority and the Federal Central Tax Office of the foreign authority concerned, e.g. the Czech CLO.
The details are set out in the leaflet on intergovernmental mutual assistance in tax collection (contribution) dated 19 January 200419.
This leaflet is currently being revised by a federal-state working group and adapted to the new recovery directive.
In addition to attachments, the request will be forwarded electronically by the FA to the Central Authority.
The latter checks whether it is correct in terms of content and form.
If not, the request will be returned to the relevant FA.
Otherwise, it will be forwarded to the Federal Central Tax Office.
The Federal Central Tax Office then takes over the necessary communication with the relevant foreign authority.
Procedures for incoming requests from other EU Member States
Requests for recovery from other Member States are recorded in the Federal Central Tax Office, which sends a confirmation of receipt within ten days.
It also checks whether the formal requirements are met.
In principle, the Federal Central Office for Taxes passes these requests on to the Central Authority, which directs them to the relevant FA and monitors the completion.
The Federal Central Tax Office also sends interim or final reports.
If the processing of a request lasts longer than six months, it reminds the Central Authority of the obligation to submit an interim report pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Directive 2002/94/EC.
After examining the formal and factual conditions for the admissibility of the request, the enforcement bodies announce relevant measures.
All amounts added must be transferred to the bank account specified in the request within one month of receipt.
Statistical data
Information on mutual recovery assistance between Germany and CZ for the years 2006 to 2008 (as of 31 December 2008).
4.4.3 Examination of selected recovery cases
A total of 21 intergovernmental recovery requests between CZ and Germany were selected for the examination. Ten cases are listed below, including:
The following was noted:
1.
On 20 October 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for U.S. debt of a Czech taxpayer from 2004 and 2005 for a total amount of 3 883 euros (109 820 CZK).
It was not until 26 February 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the relevant FA.
For the purpose of securing the recoverable claim, the Czech FA charged a property belonging to the taxable person with a land deposit right.
Since the contaminated property was not sufficient to pay the entire tax liability, a payment agreement of at least CZK 2 000 per month was made with the debtor.
On 31 August 2009, an interim report was sent to the German FA. As a result, the taxpayer had paid a tax debt of CZK 49 600 in the meantime (as of 25 August 2009).
The amount was transferred to Germany. Shortly thereafter, on 28 August 2009, a further CZK 3 000 were transferred.
2.
On 7 January 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a recovery request for tax debts (UST, income tax) as well as interest and fees of a Czech taxable person amounting to a total of 180 869 euros (Section 4 434 915 CZK).
It was not until 27 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the relevant FA.
After reviewing bank deposits, securities, real estate, motor vehicles, and other movable assets, the FA found that the debtor did not have attachable assets.
Investigations on the ground also revealed that the debtor had been absent from his permanent residence for almost a year.
His whereabouts in the CZ were unknown.
This communication was received by the Czech Ministry of Finance on 6 April 2009 and forwarded to the German Finance Administration on 16 April 2009.
3.
On 21 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for USt together with interest and fees totalling EUR 3 139 (Section 84 846 CZK).
It was not until 6 August 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the relevant FA. On 18 February 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance from Germany was informed that the Czech tax debtor had now paid the debt.
On 9 December 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance informed the Czech FA that the case had been closed because the Czech tax debtor had fully settled his debt in Germany.
However, the debt was also settled in the CZ as part of the recovery procedure and the corresponding amount was transferred to Germany on 27 October 2008.
Due to the long time that the Czech Ministry of Finance needed to forward the information to the FA, the tax liability was paid twice - by the taxpayer himself in Germany and by means of recovery by the competent Czech FA.
In cooperation with the Federal Court of Auditors, it was found that the amount added was offset against the tax liability from another procedure, which amounted to EUR 6 649 and was to be transferred to the CZ in September 2008.
In the documents of the Czech Ministry of Finance there was only a recovery request of 3 139 euros for the company in question. The recovery request of 6 649 euros could not be found there.
4.
On 15 September 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for income tax, VAT, interest and fees amounting to a total of 39 957 euros and 956 654 CZK.
It was not until 19 December 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the relevant FA.
The recovery procedure was launched on 1 June 2009. A decision was taken to attach the Czech bank credit and the debtor's salary (7 000 CZK).
During the negotiations with the FA, the debtor did not agree with the amount of the tax liability and the amount was disputed.
According to the Czech FA, the debtor had been willing to pay 250 euros per month in the past, but the responsible German FA did not agree.
The taxpayer promised to discuss his case with the German FA in order to agree on another amount.
The recovery procedure was not yet completed at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.
5.
On 19 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a German recovery request for income tax of the year 2005 as well as USt for the years 2003 to 2007 together with interest and fees totalling 113 444 Euro ’ 3 116 304 CZK.
It was not until 14 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to FA Prague 1, which is not authorised to handle tax cases in the CZ resident taxable person; on the basis of the available address, a locally competent FA could not be determined.
In its investigation, the FA received information and documents on 19 September 2008, according to which the debtor's income amounted to 4,704 euros. However, it could not issue an enforcement order because the recovery request had been received after that date.
On 26 January 2009, the Czech FA initiated the recovery procedure and issued an enforcement order to attach the debtor's assets to credit institutions.
The recovery procedure was not yet completed at the time of the audit by the Czech Court of Auditors.
6.
On 3 October 2006, the competent Czech FA asked for intergovernmental assistance in the recovery of a U.S. debt together with procedural costs totalling CZK 146 223 742.
It was not until 13 May 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German financial administration.
On 8 September 2008, the responsible German FA, through the Bundesbank, transferred to the Czech authorities the amount of EUR 17,700 – CZK 439 226 – which had been added by attachment of accounts.
A conversion error was discovered during the review of the amounts added.
The recoverable amount of CZK 146 223 742 was converted at the exchange rate of CZK 1 EUR 25.065, but a comma error resulted in an amount of EUR 583 378.
The correct amount of the recoverable amount amounted to 5 833 782 euros.
As a result, a request for recovery of EUR 5 250 404 was made too low.
7.
On 1 March 2007, the competent Czech FA asked for recovery on account of a U.S. debt plus interest and fees of a Czech taxable person totalling CZK 1 970 632 - EUR 79 847.
It was not until 10 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German financial administration.
The German FA asked the debtor to pay the arrears on 4 February 2009.
Taking into account the significant reduction in the company's revenues in the second half of 2008 and in particular in the first half of 2009 as well as the corresponding liquidity situation, the following payments were made to settle the overdue tax liability. On 8 April 2009 - 4 600 euros, on 6 May 2009 -3 000 euros and on 16 June 2009 - 2 500 euros.
These payments were transferred to the account of the responsible FA in the Czech Republic.
On 23 June 2009, a further payment of EUR 2 500 was agreed between the debtor and the FA until 30 June 2009.
8.
On 22 May 2008, the competent Czech FA asked for the recovery of tax debts totalling 398 653 euros, 9 832 779 CZK, including property acquisition tax.
It was not until 2 October 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German financial administration.
In a letter from the German financial administration to the Czech Ministry of Finance dated 3 April 2009, the request was returned.
The German tax administration justified this on the grounds that the real estate acquisition tax was not a tax within the meaning of Article 2(e), (f), (g) and (h) of Directive 2008/55/EC.
In addition, Article 2 g) relates to liabilities arising from taxes on income and assets.
Accordingly, Article 3 of Directive 2008/55/EC applies to taxes on income and assets not mentioned in Articles 1, paragraph 3 and 4 of Directive 77/799/EEC.
The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed to send a new recovery request to the German financial administration, which should no longer include the real estate tax arrears in the amount of CZK 61 759, but the arrears in the USt, corporation tax and income tax.
The Czech Ministry of Finance received a new request from the competent FA for the recovery of tax debts of the same taxpayer in the amount of CZK 7 079 735.
9.
On 6 February 2006, the Czech FA in charge sent the Czech Ministry of Finance a recovery request for income tax and VAT totalling CZK 3 445 782 – EUR 123 328.
The USt debt was CZK 1 133 967.
Only on the 18th. April 2007 the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the recovery request to the German financial administration
and it was not until 11 November 2008 that the Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded to the Czech FA the reply of the German Finance Administration of 9 November 2008. Brussels, 20 July 2007
According to which the German FA issued an enforcement order for the attachment of the bank account on 11 June 2007. The bank stated that it was not in a business relationship with the taxable person mentioned.
Thus, the request for the German financial administration was deemed to have been settled.
10.
On 26 September 2005, the Czech FA sent a recovery request to the Czech Ministry of Finance for US-debt totalling CZK 1 296 845 – EUR 43 591.
The responsible Finance Directorate sent the request to the Ministry of Finance on 10 October 2005.
The Czech Ministry of Finance forwarded the request to the German Finance Administration on 15 December 2005.
Before submitting the request, the Czech FA carried out the tax claim by attaching the accounts to banks and salary attachment as well as by burdening a property.
Before the recovery request, an information request was sent to the German financial administration on 16 March 2005.
According to the reply letter of 16 September 2005 to the Czech FA, the Czech taxable person had his residence in Germany and had income from non-self-employment in the amount of 8 437 euros. On 20 April 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a reply to the recovery request and did not forward it to the relevant Czech FA until 12 February 2008.
According to this, the tax liability in Germany is not recoverable due to the insolvency of the debtor.
No assets were found, the income from non-self-employment was already the subject of other enforcement measures.
The German financial administration considered the request to be settled.
4.4.4 Comparison and Evaluation
In the case of recovery, the requirements of EU law apply to all EU Member States for intergovernmental assistance.
The procedures for processing requests are therefore similar in CZ and Germany.
The Federal Court of Auditors and the Federal Court of Auditors have compared the statistics submitted by the two Member States to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.
Disagreements arose.
In its 200620 report, the European Commission recommended that Member States draw up their statistics with greater care.
In 200921, the Commission concluded that, despite a larger number of requests for mutual assistance, the discrepancies in the statistics have narrowed.
Both Court of Auditors consider a renewed discussion at EU level on statistics to be useful in order to avoid the remaining inconsistencies in the future.
If this does not happen, the statistics are conditionally meaningful and cannot be used for comparisons.
In addition, the Court of Auditors considers that the statistics include both the annual number of requests and the type of claims (e.g. B. VAT, income tax) and the amount of the amounts added per Member State should be shown.
Through a more detailed analysis of the statistics provided by the Member States, the Commission could help Member States to assess their measures to combat USt fraud.
Since the recovery rate can be calculated per Member State, the Court of Auditors argues that Member States with a low rate should at least aim for the average recovery rate within the EU.
At the request of a Member State, the Commission could play an active role in this.
The foreign recovery requests received by the Ministry of Finance CZ were forwarded to the competent FÄ, in particular in 2006 and 2007.
The same applies to the recovery requests made by the Czech FÄ.
The investigation showed that the Czech Ministry of Finance was in breach of Law No. 191/2004 on intergovernmental recovery assistance in so far as it did not inform the competent authority of the requesting Member State within the six-month period from the date of receipt of the request on the progress of recovery measures.
4.5 Value Added Tax Examination at Large Enterprises
4.5.1 Value Added Tax Examination at Large Enterprises in the Czech Republic
Background
The tax procedure for large companies is subject to the same rules that apply to other taxable persons.
The audit of large enterprises is regulated by Czech Law No. 337/1992, the "Tax and Fees Management Act".
The Czech Ministry of Finance defines large enterprises as natural persons who have set up a business or legal persons who have been established to carry out a business and whose net turnover for the tax period in question amounts to at least CZK 2 billion according to the income or corporate tax return.
The taxable person is a large company based on the amount of turnover. Income or corporation tax return classified in the respective tax period; for the first time for 2003.
A natural or legal person will no longer be run as a large-scale business for the purpose of sales taxation if, in three consecutive investment periods, their net turnover in the tax period is less than CZK 2 billion. The period begins at the end of the tax period for which lt for the first time. Tax return the requirements were met.
A taxable person can only be deleted from the list of large companies if at least one type of tax has been checked beforehand for a tax period.
By the end of 2009, all large companies had been audited at least every five years.
Since 2010, taxable persons have to be assessed in writing at least every two years. The subsequent control measures are intended to eliminate the tax risks and their negative effects on the proper determination and collection of taxes.
The examinations by the FÄ should focus on at least one type of tax; they usually include several tax periods.
The large taxable enterprises were audited by the special inspection bodies or audit services of the competent FÄ, which were set up for a total of 13 FÄ.
A special audit body carried out audits in its local area of responsibility in accordance with the requirements of the Head of the Finance Directorate.
In addition, she also examined
taxable persons with unusual and special business activities and
those whose examination required a high degree of expertise and time expenditure.
Taxable persons with complex location distribution and organizational structure are also examined,
Taxable persons suspected of large-scale tax evasion
as well as taxable persons belonging to chains and networks suspected of extensive tax evasion and unjustified deduction of input tax.
Information on the number of examinations carried out by the special audit bodies of the FÄ and the additional tax results of these examinations are shown in Table No. 3.
The Czech Ministry of Finance has submitted a proposal to amend Law No. 531/1990 for the regional financial authorities. In particular, it proposes the creation of a special financial office with national competence for selected taxable persons (legal persons established for the purpose of economic activity, with a turnover of at least CZK 2 billion).
4.5.2 Value Added Tax Examination at Large Enterprises in Germany
Background
The USt audit of large companies is not particularly regulated in Germany. The general provisions of the Tax Regulations (AO), the Financial Administration Act (FVG) and the Audit Regulations (BpO) apply to audits.
There are also work aids.
Tax regulation
The provisions of Sections 193 to 203 AO "Section 4 - External Examination" contain, in particular, rules for the admissibility of an external audit and its substantive scope, distribution of responsibilities, form and content of the examination announcement, examination principles, obligations of the taxable person to cooperate and prerequisites for final discussions as well as for the transmission of the audit report.
External tests are carried out by the responsible FÄ (Section 195 AO).
Financial Administration Act Pursuant to Section 5 (1) No. 1 in conjunction with Section 19, it is the responsibility of the Federal Central Office for Taxes to participate in external audits of the FÄ.
The nature and scope of this cooperation will be agreed between the authorities involved.
In addition, the Federal Central Office for Taxes may require that certain establishments it has renowned be audited at a certain point in time.
In this case, it may lay down rules for the external audit of these taxable persons.
Audit Regulations Pursuant to Article 108(7) GG, the Audit Regulations (BpO 2000) were adopted with the consent of the Federal Council.
It applies to external audits of the state financial authorities and the Federal Tax Office.
Pursuant to Section 3 BpO, the companies are regularly classified in size classes.
Large companies must undergo a follow-up test (point 4.2 BpO).
Pursuant to Section 33.1 BpO, each competent financial authority shall maintain a group directory within the meaning of the provision.
Administrative work aids
In addition, the following working aids have been issued for the administration:
- "Single Handbook for the USt Special Examination";
Turnover Tax-Country-Online - USLO (dialogue system in the intra-Community USt control procedure) with instructions on how to use the data contained in the MIAS on intra-Community business relations;
Work aids for difficult and special situations.
Central database for the storage and evaluation of USt fraud cases and the development of risk profiles -ZAUBER;
Taxable persons are classified in size classes. These are based on criteria such as turnover and profit, whereby the limit values vary depending on the branch of business.
The figures are published by the Federal Ministry of Finance.
The values are reviewed every three years and set for the following three years.
The number of companies - not only large enterprises - is to be determined regularly (last cut-off date: 1 January 2010).
In general, large companies have to be checked completely.
The tests are announced and usually extend to the USt,
i.e. the audit covers all relevant taxes, i.e. income tax, corporation tax, commercial tax and VAT.
The sales tax can be audited either by auditors or USt special auditors.
Practice varies and depends on the administrative structure of the individual countries.
The number of tax periods covered by an audit usually varies between three and five years.
The BpO 2000 assumes three years.
The audit is subject to all taxes to which a company has been charged.
4.5.3 Management of the VAT audit at large companies
In accordance with the agreement, both courts of auditors did not examine individual cases. They looked into the question of how the financial administrations proceed in the USt audit of large companies.
With the help of a questionnaire, they collected information from the financial administrations that is essential for the audit of large companies.
What statistical records and evaluations for the USt testing of large companies are available to the management of the tax administration?
In particular:
Are there statistics or records on the extent to which a distinction is made between USt fraud control and general USt testing?
CZ: No, the current version of the ATIS system does not allow such a distinction.
Germany: The financial administration does not distinguish between audits to combat USt fraud and general USt audits.
Are there statistics or records on the timeliness of the tests?
CZ: Information on the timeliness of audits of intra-Community acquisitions of selected USt-mandators is recorded in the ATIS system;
The same applies to information about the beginning and end of the examination of the FA.
Germany: No, the statistics for auditors summarised at federal level only contain information about the so-called average last audit period (year).
This figure does not give an overview of the audit periods selected for individual companies.
USt special auditors focus on the last USt investment periods and are also authorized to audit large companies.
The federal statistics for USt special auditors do not contain any information on the size class of the audited company.
There are statistics or records on the nature of the surplus result; e.g. B. subdivided by:
i. real additional result (e.g. B. Application of a reduced rate instead of the general rate of VAT)
ii. Incorrect surplus result (e.g. B. Relocation/shifting of a matter not objectionable under VAT law to another tax period)
iii. Cash effectiveness (payment of the fixed additional result)
CZ:
The Czech tax administration monitors the number of tax audits carried out, the amount of the additional tax result broken down by type of tax, the number of taxable persons audited and the number of tax periods audited.
Other tax procedures (on-the-spot investigations, dunning procedures) are monitored in the same way.
Irrespective of this, the amount of additional payments and the receipts of payments are recorded.
Statistics on tax liabilities are broken down by type of tax. However, no distinction is made between tax liabilities arising from a tax return and those arising from the audit activities of the FA.
Germany: No, the statistics compiled at federal level for auditors and USt special auditors do not differ according to the above-mentioned criteria.
Nor did most financial authorities, where local surveys were carried out, differentiate in this respect.
- Are there any fields of examination that are likely to yield results?
CZ: Yes, the FA can select test cases based on criteria associated with selected key figures stored in the ATIS system.
Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at federal level for auditors and USt special auditors do not provide such information.
However, the federal and state finance ministries have agreed on a common approach.
Accordingly, auditors and tax investigators of the countries have to enter the additional tax result they have achieved if a certain threshold value is exceeded in ZAUBER.
In this case, additional information must be provided, e.g. on the origin of the USt surplus result achieved.
What are the most common findings?
CZ:
- Large taxable companies have unlawfully used input tax deduction for purchased deliveries and services,
- which were not used for an entrepreneurial activity in accordance with Section 72 (1) CZ UStG;
- which were used for representation expenses in accordance with Section 75 (3) CZ UStG;
due to invoices that do not comply with the requirements of Section 73 (1) CZ UStG
- Large taxable enterprises have omitted the registration of USt to be paid as provided for in Section 21 (1) CZ UStG.
Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at federal level for auditors and USt special auditors do not provide such information.
Findings on the USt from audits of large companies are not recorded separately by the countries.
However, the Federal Central Tax Office can evaluate the database ZAUBER, into which auditors and tax investigators of the Länder have to enter the additional tax result they have achieved if a certain threshold is exceeded.
- Does the financial administration analyze areas of audit that are likely to yield results and draw consequences for strategic management?
CZ: Yes, for example, nationwide tests are carried out with regard to risky goods and industries.
Germany: There are no regulations at the federal level.
Accordingly, the statistics compiled at the federal level for auditors and USt special auditors do not provide any information on particularly "energy-based" audit fields.
With regard to the analysis of such information, the benefits and the way in which it is used further, there were different views among the survey bodies.
Some senior financial directorates provide such information to the FÄ, but the FÄ is free to use it or not.
4.5.4 Comparison and Evaluation
As a result, large amounts of information are processed automatically in the CZ. Among other things, data from USt audits, as well as key figures from balance sheets, profit and loss statements are processed in the system.
CZ is able to control the selection of high-risk cases based on a wide range of information.
The same applies to the evaluation and management of USt tests in general.
In the CZ, the establishment of a special finance office for large enterprises is planned for 2012.
In Germany, the financial administration does not collect comparable amounts of data.
Accordingly, it is more difficult to perform these tasks in the same way.
The emphasis is more on the selection of relevant individual cases.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
On the basis of the information in USt pre-registrations or USt declarations as well as test notices, qualified examiners select the cases to be examined and ensure the applicable taxation.
Suitable management processes and risk management systems must be introduced in order to reduce revenue losses at the USt and at the same time increase the risk of being discovered for unreliable entrepreneurs.

5. Conclusions
The cooperation between the two audit institutions has proved its worth.
In this way, necessary insights into the systems used in both countries could be gained: This applies in particular to: - intra-Community sales, - risk management at USt, in particular with regard to the selection of risky sales, - recovery of USt claims and - USt testing of large companies.
The audit revealed differences in the strategies for detecting USt fraud and in the systems described above.
These findings can be used to improve existing procedures.
They can also be used to initiate a discussion among interested parties on which audit approaches and strategies can be used to combat fraud. This applies, for example, to the relationship within and between the Member States and the EU Commission.
The experience and insights gained should encourage us to continue to jointly examine the administration of the USt in the future.
6. Kommunique
The report has been prepared in Czech, English and German and signed by the Presidents of the Czech Court of Auditors and the Federal Court of Auditors.
Status of information: June 2010.
