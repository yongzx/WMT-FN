Report on the Results of Parallel Audit of Value Added Tax Administration in the Czech Republic and in the Slovak Republic in 2005
Introduction
This material provides information on the course and results of parallel audit performed by the Supreme Audit Office, Czech Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic which was concerned with the area of administration of value added tax and use of the VIES (Value Added Tax Information Exchange System).
In May 2004, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic acceded to the European Union and, consequently, income from the value added tax affects not only the State budgets of the two countries, but also the budget of the European Union as a whole.
The parallel audit was concerned particularly with the procedure of tax administrators in relation to a review of the value added tax paid within commercial transactions between the individual member countries of the European Union.
Introduction of the VIES system enabled electronic exchange of information on registration of VAT payers in the individual member countries of the European Union and on commercial transactions performed by the VAT payers.
Variance between information in the VIES and information stated in a value added tax return submitted by a taxpayer should alert the tax administrator to any suspicious cases and facilitate detection of tax evasions or frauds.
The benefits of the performed parallel audit included, in addition to exchange of information on the procedure of tax offices in administration of value added tax, particularly review of the use of the VIES system within audit of exercising the entitlement to exemption from value added tax on intra-Community transactions.
The findings obtained in implementation of the parallel audit support development of mutual cooperation and will be used in further parallel audits pursued in collaboration with audit institutions of the member countries of the European Union.
Report on the Results of Parallel Audit of Value Added Tax Administration for the Period from May 1, 2004 to June 30, 2005
Introduction
Audit number: (CZ) 05/19 (SK) 22/2005
Subject of audit: (CZ) Administration of value added tax, (SK) Audit of the procedure of tax authorities in administration, audit and enforcement of value added tax and fulfilment of tasks within the VIES system with respect to exchange of information amongst the EU Member States
The Supreme Audit Office, Czech Republic (hereinafter the “SAO, CR”) and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter the “SAO SR”) concluded an Agreement on Audit Cooperation on September 12, 2005.
Under the Agreement, the parties agreed to cooperate in the performance of parallel audits entitled “Administration of value added tax”, included in the Audit Plan of the SAO, CR for 2005 under No. 05/19, and “Audit of the procedure of tax authorities in administration, audit and enforcement of value added tax and fulfilment of tasks within the VIES system with respect to exchange of information amongst the EU Member States”, included in the Audit Plan of the SAO SR under No. 22/2005.
The parallel audits had the character of a coordinated audit.
The results of the joint coordinated audit were processed in the sense of European Implementing Guidelines No. 31 for the INTOSAI audit standards.
The aforementioned cooperation included exchange of information within the scope stipulated by the executed Agreement, as well as the preparation of a joint final report on the results of parallel audits.
The objective of the coordinated audit was to review selected cases of supply and acquisition of goods within suspicious commercial transactions between taxpayers of VAT in the Czech Republic (hereinafter the “CR”) and the Slovak Republic (hereinafter the “SR”).
Both Parties agreed to provide each other with information from public sources, data from the VIES electronic system (Value Added Tax Information Exchange System) and information on accepted and submitted requests for review of commercial transactions between the CR and the SR.
Audits were performed in parallel in the period from June to December 2005.
In the territory of the CR, the audit was performed by the State Budget Department and by the territorial departments for Central Bohemia, North-Western Bohemia, Southern Bohemia, Southern Moravia, Central Moravia and Northern Moravia.
The audited entities included the Ministry of Finance and 12 tax offices: Tax Office in Mladá Boleslav, Tax Office in Kolín, Tax Office in Teplice, Tax Office in Karlovy Vary, Tax Office in Tábor, Tax Office Brno III, Tax Office in Znojmo, Tax Office in Zlín, Tax Office in Šumperk, Tax Office Ostrava I, Tax Office for Prague 7 and Tax Office for Prague 9.
Audit in the territory of the SR was performed by the Financial and Fiscal Section of the SAO SR, in cooperation with branch offices of the SAO SR in Banská Bystrica and Košice, at 9 selected tax offices: Tax Office Bratislava I, Tax Office Komárno, Tax Office Trenčín, Tax Office Prievidza, Tax Office Zvolen, Tax Office Dolný Kubín, Tax Office Košice II, Tax Office Košice V and Tax Office Michalovce.
Objective of audits:
The objective of parallel audits was to review the procedure of tax offices in administration of value added tax (hereinafter “VAT”) after integration of the CR and the SR to the common internal market of the European Union (hereinafter the “EU”) and to review the use of the VIES electronic information system, particularly in audit of exercising the right to VAT exemption.
The coordinated audit covered the period from May 1, 2004 to June 30, 2005.
Summary of results and evaluation of parallel audits The VIES electronic system has been introduced in the EU member countries in order to enable the tax administrators to check whether suppliers are entitled to VAT exemption of their taxable fulfilment and, in the country of destination, to review whether acquirers have duly declared and taxed the acquired goods.
The VIES system is not a centralized scheme in the framework of the EU; each member country develops its own system.
The audit indicated differences between the national VIES systems in the CR and the SR in the following areas:
Values of supplies of goods to other EU member countries are stated in recapitulative statements, while the values of provided services are not included in these reports.
Information from recapitulative statements submitted by Czech taxpayers is processed in the CR at the level of tax offices, where this information is compared with the data on supplies of goods to other EU member countries, as stated in VAT returns.
Tax offices forward data from the recapitulative statements to the Ministry of Finance (CLO), which sends them to other EU member countries.
In the SR, data from recapitulative statements submitted by Slovak taxpayers with tax offices are merely transferred to electronic form and they are processed centrally at the Tax Directorate of the SR (CLO).
In the CR, taxpayers enter the value of goods supplied and the value of services provided to other EU member countries in separate lines of VAT returns, which allows for comparison of the values stated in recapitulative statements with the values of supplied goods pursuant to the VAT returns and for identification of any potential differences.
In the SR, the values of goods supplied and services provided to other EU member countries are reported summarily in a joint line of the VAT return.
Consequently, the system in the SR does not permit automatic identification of differences between the values of supplied goods pursuant to the VAT returns and the recapitulative statements.
Separate declaration of the values of supplied goods in VAT returns allows for utilization of the results of comparison of data concerning VAT exemption of supplies to the EU.
The communicated data from recapitulative statements submitted by the taxpayers in other EU member countries are processed by the CLO and compared with the acquisition values of the goods, as declared by the taxpayers from the CR or the SR in their VAT returns.
In the SR, these data are sent to the tax offices and the tax administrators themselves decide as to which differences they will subject to their review.
In the CR, the Ministry of Finance (CLO) determines which differences between the values of supplies and acquisition of goods are to be reviewed by the tax administrators and submits the list of these cases to the locally competent tax offices.
It is thereby ensured that, with respect to most substantial variances, it is determined whether VAT was reported in the accurate amount upon acquisition of the goods.
Furthermore, the audit pointed out certain problems in the system of VAT administration and complications caused by different reporting of intra-Community transactions (i.e. supplies and acquisition of goods by taxpayers from various EU member countries):
Recapitulative statements are submitted in the EU for each calendar quarter and the latest deadline for processing and sending data to other EU member countries is set to 3 months from the end of the relevant quarter.
Reduction of the period, for which recapitulative statements are submitted, to one month, together with shortening the time-limit for their processing, would allow earlier access to the data in the VIES system.
Thus, the tax administrators would be able to review more effectively whether VAT has been reported in the correct amount with respect to intra-Community acquisitions.
In parallel, submission of VAT returns and recapitulative statements for the same taxation period (month) would allow for faster verification as to whether the taxpayers have declared the same values of supplies of goods to the EU in the recapitulative statement and in the VAT return.
Differences between the values of supplies of goods reported by taxpayers from the EU and the values of acquisitions of goods reported by taxpayers from the CR or SR, as appropriate, were caused, amongst other things, by variances in the methods of reporting of data on intra-Community supplies and acquisitions in the individual EU member countries.
These variances involved, for example, the specification of accepted advance payments in recapitulative statements or declaration of intra-Community supplies in the supplier’s recapitulative statement for a different quarter than for intra-Community acquisitions in the acquirer’s VAT return.
Unification of the conditions for reporting of these data within the EU would increase the effectiveness of audit activities of tax administrations of the individual member countries.
Cooperation between the SAO, CR and the SAO SR was also concerned with review of selected intra-Community transactions performed between the two countries.
A total of 40 commercial transactions, which took place between 29 Czech and 32 Slovak tax entities, raised doubts as regards their performance or suspicion of a tax evasion related to VAT; these transactions were checked jointly.
The SAO, CR and the SAO SR ascertained, inter alia, the following facts:
tax entities declared in their VAT reports intra-Community transactions that had not actually taken place, in an attempt to unlawfully obtain an excessive VAT deduction;
in the framework of carousel transactions, tax entities accounted for intra-Community supplies which involved intentional several-fold reduction of the value of supplies in order to obtain excessive VAT deductions;
in their VAT returns and the recapitulative statements, the suppliers declared intra-Community supplies of goods exempt from VAT to acquirers who were “missing traders” and failed to account for tax on the acquired goods;
the suppliers performed intra-Community supplies of goods exempt from VAT in favour of tax entities that were not registered for VAT in another member country.
In these cases, the supply should not have been exempt from VAT and should have been subject to tax in the supplier’s country;
in their VAT returns, the suppliers accounted for intra-Community supplies with a higher value than that declared by the acquirers of intra-Community acquisitions, where, in some cases, VAT was accounted for an incorrect amount.
The findings obtained during the audit indicate that the VIES system provides tax administrators with information required for audit of proper application of VAT in intra-Community transactions.
Tax administrators should pay increased attention particularly to thorough review of the differences between data declared by VAT payers and the data included in the VIES system and use of all information in tax proceedings.
Aspects of value added tax after accession of the CR and the SR to the EU
Value added tax
On May 1, 2004, the CR and the SR became members of the EU.
Internal borders and border controls of movement of goods within EU were abolished after accession to the EU.
The competent tax office had acted as the VAT administrator until April 30, 2004; the only exception consisted in import of goods and occasional domestic bus transportation where tax had been administered by a customs office.
In relation to adoption of new Czech Act No. 235/2004 Coll., on value added tax (hereinafter “Act No. 235/2004 Coll.”), and Slovak Act No. 222/2004 Coll., on value added tax (hereinafter “Act No. 222/2004 Coll.”), VAT administration with respect to acquisition of goods and services (formerly imports) from other EU member countries was transferred from customs to tax offices.
In the CR, pursuant to Section 13 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., supply of goods means the transfer of the right to manage goods as the owner.
Supply of goods from the CR to another EU member country means a supply of goods that has actually been dispatched or transported to another EU member country.
Pursuant to Section 64 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., this is an exempt taxable fulfilment with the right to deduction of VAT, provided that the goods are supplied to a person registered for VAT in another EU member country.
In the SR, pursuant to Section 8 of Act No. 222/2004 Coll., supply of goods means a supply of tangible assets involving a change in the ownership title.
A supply of goods may also consist in relocation of goods that is the property of a tax entity from this country to another member state, provided that these goods are dispatched or transported by the given person or in his account to another member country for the purposes of his business activities.
Pursuant to Section 43 of Act No. 222/2004 Coll., a supply of goods from this country to another member state is exempt from VAT provided that the acquirer is a person identified for VAT in another EU member country.
In the CR, under Section 16 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., acquisition of goods from another EU member country means the acquirement of the right to manage goods that are sent or transported to the acquirer by a person registered for VAT in another EU member country, as the owner.
The Czech taxpayer buys the goods for a price excluding VAT and he is obliged to account for VAT in the CR pursuant to Section 25 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.; if the preconditions stipulated in Section 73 of the Act are met, the taxpayer incurs the right to deduction of VAT.
In the SR, under Section 11 of Act No. 222/2004 Coll., acquisition of goods from another EU member country means the assumption of the right to manage movable tangible assets, which are sent or transported to the acquirer by the supplier or acquirer or in their account from this country to another member state, as the owner.
The taxpayer becomes taxable in the SR upon acquisition of goods in this country from another member country pursuant to Section 20 of Act No. 222/2004 Coll.
Pursuant to Section 49 of Act No. 222/2004 Coll., the taxpayer may deduct VAT if he claims the tax refund upon acquisition of goods in this country from another member state pursuant to Sections 11 and 11a of the Act.
Pursuant to Section 17 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. and Section 45 of Act No. 222/2004 Coll., as appropriate, a triangular transaction means a transaction concluded amongst three persons registered for VAT in three different EU member countries, where the subject of the transaction consists in supply of the same goods amongst these three persons.
Intra-Community transactions mean supply and acquisition of goods amongst VAT payers from different EU member countries.
The total quantities of intra-Community transactions between the CR and the SR are set forth in the following table.
The VIES system
An information exchange system for the area of VAT has been established in the EU for the purposes of checking the claims for VAT exemption of intra-Community supplies of goods.
It includes the VIES electronic system, which enables the tax administrators in the EU member countries to check whether the supplier was entitled to VAT exemption of a taxable fulfilment and also to review whether the acquirer has duly reported and taxed the acquired goods.
The VIES information system is not a centralized scheme in the framework of the EU.
Each member country develops its own VIES system.
National systems are based on a common principle and are mutually interconnected through the Common Communication Network of the EU (CCN – see the chart below).
In the CR, the VIES system has been interconnected with an Automated Tax Information System (hereinafter the “ATIS”) and, in the SR, with a Program Application of the Tax Information System (hereinafter the “PATIS”).
These systems are used by tax offices as technical support for executive and management activities in administration of taxes and fees.
International administrative cooperation
Through international administrative cooperation, the tax administration of each EU member country obtains information on tax entities, which it would not be able to obtain itself without such cooperation.
The main objective of international administrative cooperation consists in the fight against tax evasions and tax fraud.
Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, each member country shall designate a single administrative body entrusted with cooperation with other EU member states in administration of VAT within its internal organizational structure, the CLO (Central Liaison Office).
In the CR, the tasks following from international cooperation are fulfilled by the Ministry of Finance – the Central Financial and Tax Directorate, including the newly established Department for International Cooperation in Administration of VAT (hereinafter the “MF CLO”).
The functions of the CLO in the SR are performed by the Tax Directorate of the SR, the Department for International Administrative Cooperation (hereinafter the “TD CLO”).
Amongst other things, these departments communicate with foreign administrations in the EU, particularly in the area of information exchange in the framework of the VIES system, spontaneous exchange of information and communication of information requested by the EU tax administrations, coordination of multilateral (parallel) tax audits, verification of value added tax identification numbers (hereinafter “VAT ID”) of persons registered for VAT in other EU member countries, and communicate with the European Commission.
For the purpose of verification of a certain intra-Community transaction or acquisition of other information related to a specific tax entity, tax offices send requests for information to the EU through the MF CLO and TD CLO, respectively.
On the basis of these requests, they obtain information from the requested member countries, which they can use for proper assessing of VAT.
Requests of information are sent amongst the CLOs of the EU member countries mostly in electronic form, with the use of the SCAC standardized form.
Selected audit findings within verification of commercial transactions
Cooperation between the SAO, CR and the SAO SR was concerned particularly with review of selected intra-Community transactions between the two countries and, furthermore, with the extent of use of information obtained within international cooperation by financial and tax authorities.
In 30 cases, the SAO, CR requested that the SAO SR reviews business transactions, which took place between 19 Czech and 25 Slovak tax entities.
The SAO SR requested in 10 cases that the SAO, CR reviews business transactions between 7 Slovak and 10 Czech tax entities.
Review of intra-Community transactions indicated, amongst other things:
o
The SAO, CR requested that the SAO SR reviews the procedure of the tax administrator who had been provided with a response to a request for information.
Through the SCAC form, the Slovak tax office asked for review of supply of goods (shoes) in the 3rd quarter of 2004 from a Slovak taxpayer in the value of SKK 2 847 thousand.
A tax office of the CR responded that the Czech taxpayer accounted for acquisition of goods of this value in a supplementary VAT return and supplied the same goods before the end of 2004 back to Slovak tax entities for a price of CZK 2 550 thousand.
It was ascertained on the basis of international cooperation between the SAO, CR and the SAO SR that the locally competent tax office fully recognized the claim of the Slovak supplier for excessive deduction, which was incurred, inter alia, on the basis of this supply.
The tax office failed to provide information on the suspected re-export to locally competent tax offices with respect to the goods transported back from the Czech taxpayer.
The aforementioned facts will constitute and incentive for further review of business transactions related to the potential carousel fraud.
o
With the use of the SCAC form, the Czech tax administrator asked for verification of supply of a technological unit to the SR in the value of CZK 4 850 thousand in the 2nd quarter of 2004.
The tax proceedings carried out in the SR indicated that only part of the technological unit was supplied, while components in the value of CZK 3 395 thousand were not provided.
When reviewing this case, the SAO SR ascertained that VAT on the taxable performance was accounted for by the Slovak tax entity from an amount of CZK 4 850 thousand in the VAT return for the taxation period of 7/2004.
Furthermore, the SAO, CR ascertained that the Czech taxpayer claimed in his VAT return for the given quarter an excessive deduction of VAT in an amount of CZK 655 thousand, based on deduction of VAT on purchase of this technological unit from another domestic taxpayer.
On the basis of the results of investigation, the Czech tax office concluded that the Czech and Slovak tax entities established a commercial relation for the purpose of unlawful obtaining of excessive deduction of VAT, challenged the taxable fulfilment and failed to recognize part of the claim for deduction of tax in an amount of CZK 647 thousand for the Czech taxpayer.
o
In 2004, the Slovak tax administrator requested through the SCAC form that a supply of goods (copying machines) to a Czech taxpayer in the value of SKK 24 246 thousand, which took place in December 2002, be reviewed.
The Slovak taxpayer purchased goods in the SR in November 2002 from another tax entity for a price of SKK 29 667 thousand and, subsequently, sold it to the Czech taxpayer.
The Slovak tax entity claimed an excessive deduction of VAT for the relevant taxation period.
Tax investigation carried out in the CR indicated that the Czech tax entity did not cooperate with the tax administrator and that it failed to submit the VAT return for the 4th quarter of 2002 and the following periods.
The SAO SR ascertained that, based on the result of tax control, the Slovak tax administrator did not recognize the claim for excessive deduction in an amount of SKK 5 541 thousand as declared in the VAT return for the month of November 2002 and assessed the tax liability at SKK 1 750 thousand.
At the same time, the tax entity was not granted VAT exemption based on export of goods in December 2002.
o
The Czech tax administrator received an instruction from the MF CLO to review the value of goods acquired during the 3rd quarter of 2004.
According to information from the VIES, a Czech taxpayer acquired goods (solvents) from the SR in the value of SKK 3 767 thousand.
The tax entity failed to cooperate with the tax administrator and failed to submit the VAT return, and VAT for the months of July to December 2004 was officially assessed at CZK 0.
The Czech tax administrator requested through the SCAC that it be reviewed whether the supplies of goods from the SR to the CR had actually taken place, in what amount and for what price (according to invoices).
In response, the Slovak locally competent tax office sent a copy of the invoice, the bills of delivery and a request for payment of the invoice.
The SAO SR ascertained that an exemption with the right to deduction of VAT was granted to the Slovak taxpayer for this supply.
The SAO, CR ascertained that the Czech tax administrator considered the response to the request for information provided from the SR to be a piece of evidence proving that the company had acquired goods from another EU member country.
On the basis of further investigation, the tax office in the CR will request that the superior body reviews the tax liability.
o
A Slovak company supplied goods (cardboard products), inter alia, to a U.S. company, which stored the goods in the CR in customs-free zone.
The operator of the customs-free zone was identified in the invoices as the consignee.
In 2004, the U.S. company, e.g., bought from the Slovak taxpayer cardboard facing materials in the value of USD 57 600 (with the unit price of 100 USD/item), which it stored in the customs-free zone.
Subsequently, this company transferred the ownership title to the goods to a Swiss company for the value of USD 14 400 (unit price of 25 USD/item) and the goods were re-exported to the SR.
The goods were not unloaded in the CR, but they rather left the area of the customs-free zone on the same means of transport.
The Slovak tax administrator commenced tax controls at the supplier of the goods, concerned with the individual taxation periods of 2004 and 2005, based on a suspicion of carousel fraud.
Review of the performed transactions was requested from Czech locally competent tax administrators through several SCAC forms.
The individual answers gradually provided a picture of the transactions and confirmed involvement of entities from the SR and the CR in carousel transactions.
The SAO, CR, in cooperation with the SAO SR, ascertained that the value of goods was gradually reduced within these business relations.
On the basis of the obtained information, the Tax Directorate of SR concluded that this case of carousel fraud included free pricing (i.e. import of undervalued goods and its overvaluation by domestic companies which are part of a chain between the importer and the exporter), which is not contrary to the Slovak VAT Act.
Under the current legislation, it is not possible to prevent payment of excessive deduction of VAT to export companies, as they meet all the conditions of the Act for exemption of supplies from VAT.
o
VAT registration of a Czech taxpayer was cancelled as of July 12, 2005.
On October 27, 2005, this entity again became a VAT payer on the basis of a voluntary application for VAT registration.
In the VAT return for the month of August 2005 (i.e. the period when it was not a VAT payer), the Czech tax entity stated the value of acquisition of goods (a printing machine) from the SR in the amount of CZK 1 174 thousand and claimed deduction of VAT.
This value corresponded to the supply of goods from the Slovak taxpayer in an amount of SKK 1 530 thousand, which was stated by the Slovak taxpayer in his VAT return as supply of goods to another EU member country with the right to deduction of VAT.
The Slovak tax administrator requested through the SCAC form that the aforementioned supply would be reviewed, as the Slovak supplier failed to prove the manner of acquisition of the goods supplied to the CR.
The SAO, CR ascertained that the Czech taxpayer failed to cooperate with the tax administrator and that it was not present at the address registered in the Commercial Register.
In the framework of international exchange of information, the locally competent tax administrator in the CR will perform local investigation in order to verify the data.
o
In the recapitulative statement for the 3rd quarter of 2004, a Slovak taxpayer stated supplies of goods in the value of SKK 956 thousand to a tax entity in the CR.
The VAT ID of the Czech entity was incorrect according to the VIES system.
By review of the database of taxpayers, it was ascertained that the relevant VAT ID had never been assigned in the CR.
According to invoices issued by the Slovak taxpayer, the subject of the performance consisted in electrical engineering work at a real estate in the CR; rather than supply of goods from the SR to the CR, a provision of services was involved.
The services were invoiced excluding VAT, as the Czech entity informed the Slovak entity that it was registered in the CR as a VAT payer.
The Slovak tax administrator requested through the SCAC form that the aforementioned facts would be verified.
By inquiry at the locally competent tax administrator in the Czech Republic, the SAO, CR ascertained that the tax entity which was identified in the invoices as the client had never been registered in the CR as a VAT payer, that it failed to account for the tax on services accepted from the Slovak entity and that it also failed to account for the tax on acquisition of goods.
Neither local investigation nor tax control has been performed at the Czech entity, as its current location is unknown.
On the basis of international exchange of information, the Czech tax administrator learned that, by acceptance of the service, the Czech tax entity became a VAT payer by operation of law.
Tax control concerned with the period of the 1st to 4th quarters of 2004 will be carried out at the Slovak tax entity.
o
In the recapitulative statement for the 3rd quarter of 2004, a Slovak taxpayer stated supplies of goods in the value of SKK 1 055 thousand to a Czech taxpayer.
According to invoices issued by the Slovak taxpayer, the subject of the performance consisted in electrical engineering work at a property in the CR.
Rather than supply of goods from the SR to the CR, the subject of the performance involved provision of services.
The Slovak tax administrator requested through the SCAC form that the aforementioned facts would be verified.
By inquiry at the locally competent tax administrator in the CR, the SAO, CR ascertained that, at the time of the supply, the Czech entity was a VAT payer, and local investigation was carried out at the taxpayer in the 3rd quarter of 2004 for the purpose of review of acquisition of goods from other EU member countries.
On the basis of the local investigation, it was ascertained that, rather than acquisition of goods, the given transaction involved acquisition of services, as stated by the Czech entity in the ordinary VAT return.
Furthermore, the tax office ascertained that, due to incorrect procedure in calculation of VAT, the Czech entity did not pay VAT for the 3rd quarter of 2004 in the correct amount.
The tax entity shall submit a supplementary VAT return.
By inquiry at the locally competent tax office, the SAO SR ascertained that the Slovak taxpayer incorrectly stated the provision of services in the recapitulative statement and tax control will be carried out at that entity for the 1st to 4th quarter of 2004.
o
A Czech tax entity voluntarily registered as a VAT payer as of March 10, 2004.
For the 1st quarter of 2004, it submitted a VAT return with a high input and output turnover.
The locally competent tax administrator commenced tax proceedings, where the entity failed to cooperate with the tax administrator and, therefore, VAT was assessed in the amount of CZK 0 given the suspected involvement in carousel fraud.
The taxpayer did not submit any further VAT return.
For the purpose of non-fulfilment of obligations following from the Act, its VAT registration was cancelled as of January 4, 2005.
According to information from the VIES system, this entity acquired goods in the value of SKK 7 846 thousand from a Slovak taxpayer in the 3rd and 4th quarters of 2004.
For the purpose of reviewing the performance of these transactions, the Czech tax administrator sent two requests for information to the SR.
By inquiry at the locally competent tax office, the SAO SR ascertained that the executive of the Czech company denied, in his testimony, that the reviewed transactions actually took place and contested the authenticity of his signature on invoices and other documents.
The intra-Community supply to the CR, as reported by the Slovak taxpayer, was challenged on the basis of tax proceedings performed in the SR.
The taxpayer’s claim for VAT exemption will not be recognized and VAT will be assessed on the aforementioned amount.
o
According to information from the VIES system, a Czech taxpayer acquired goods (working clothes) from the SR in the total value of SKK 39 970 thousand in the 1st quarter of 2005.
In that quarter, the Czech taxpayer accounted for acquisition of goods from another EU member country only in the VAT return for the month of March 2005, in the value of CZK 11 292 thousand.
The locally competent tax administrator performed local investigation of the relevant entity, aimed at reviewing data stated in the VAT return.
As the company failed to submit any documents or otherwise prove the taxable fulfilments, on June 9, 2005, the tax administrator assessed VAT in the amount of CZK 0.
Given the doubts regarding the actual acquisition of goods, in May 2005, the tax administrator sent two requests for information to the SR.
According to the response to the requests for information, the tax administrator in the SR had doubts as regards the performance of the transactions, as well as the payment.
The SAO SR stated that the Slovak tax administrator sent to the TD CLO instigation to perform simultaneous audits, together with the tax administration of the CR, which will be carried out at the participating entities.
At the time of the coordinated audit, the locally competent tax administrator in the CR performed another investigation concerning the Czech entity and, at the same time, investigation was being pursued by the Police of the CR.
o
The following 2 cases are concerned with companies that are suspected of being involved in a carousel fraud.
Transactions with goods (working clothes) were implemented between the CR and SR in the 4th quarter of 2004 and the 1st quarter of 2005.
Slovak taxpayer No. 1 supplied the goods to Czech taxpayer No. 2.
Then, the goods were sold in the CR to taxpayer No. 3 who sent them back to the SR to taxpayer No. 4 (see Chart No. 2).
A)
Czech taxpayer No. 2 allegedly acquired from Slovak taxpayer No. 1 goods (working clothes) in the value of CZK 4 847 thousand in the 4th quarter of 2004 and goods in the value of CZK 17 050 thousand in the 1st quarter of 2005.
Given the fact that the acquisition declared by the Czech taxpayer in the VAT return did not correspond to data in the VIES system, on May 25, 2005, the locally competent tax administrator sent a request for information to the SR.
In the response, the Slovak tax administrator expressed his doubts regarding the performance of the transactions and provision of payment.
A request for information concerning goods in the value of SKK 16 575 thousand, which were allegedly supplied by Slovak taxpayer No. 1 to Czech taxpayer No. 2 in December 2004, was delivered to the MF CLO from the SR on June 8, 2005.
The Slovak party requested that it would be reviewed whether Czech taxpayer No. 2 actually received the goods, accounted for them in the VAT return and paid VAT.
The official record drawn up by the locally competent tax administrator in the CR indicates that Czech taxpayer No. 2 had not been present at the address registered in the Commercial Register for a prolonged period of time.
Although he was a VAT payer with a monthly taxation period, he submitted VAT return for quarterly taxation periods.
Given this fact, the Czech tax administrator could not assess VAT.
The taxable fulfilment between Slovak taxpayer No. 1 and Czech taxpayer No. 2 in the amount of SKK 16 575 thousand, as stated in the request, could not be reviewed for the aforementioned reasons.
The Czech tax administrator had suspicion of involvement of both entities in a carousel fraud aimed at claiming an excessive deduction of VAT.
B)
Czech taxpayer No. 3, whose object of activities includes purchase and sale of cars, submitted a VAT return for the taxation periods of January and February 2005, in which he accounted for supplies of goods (working clothes) to Slovak taxpayer No. 4 in an overall value of CZK 21 935 thousand.
These working clothes were allegedly bought by Czech taxpayer No. 3 from Czech taxpayer No. 2 in the period from December 2004 to January 2005.
The locally competent tax office sent a request for information to the SR, concerning particularly review as to whether Slovak taxpayer No. 4 acquired from Czech taxpayer No. 3 goods in the value of CZK 1 025 thousand in December 2004 and goods in the value of CZK 21 935 thousand in the 1st quarter of 2005.
The response from the SR to this request for information indicated that, in the VAT return for the month of December 2004, Slovak taxpayer No. 4 declared a zero value of goods acquired from another EU member country and, in the VAT return for the months of January and February 2005, declared the value of goods acquired from another EU member country only in the amount of SKK 1 193 thousand.
Slovak taxpayer No. 4 did not respond to the request for submission of tax documents for the taxation periods of October 2004 to March 2005.
During local investigation performed in the SR, it was ascertained that the company was not present at the address specified in the Commercial Register.
In the response, it was also stated that the taxpayer met all the characteristics of a “missing trader” and, therefore, there was a justified suspicion of a carousel fraud.
The SAO SR stated that the Slovak tax administrator sent to the TD CLO instigation to perform simultaneous audits, together with the tax administration of the CR, which will be carried out at the participating tax entities.
During the coordinated audit, the Czech tax administrator collected basic documents confirming or denying the existence of the goods.
VAT will be assessed according to the results of the investigation.
The case is also being dealt with by the Police of the CR.
Audit procedure
In the framework of preparation of parallel audits, a coordination meeting of representatives of the SAO, CR and representatives of the SAO SR was held in the first half of the month of July 2005.
The participants of the meeting discussed the legislation on VAT in both countries and introduction of the VIES electronic system to national databases.
The meeting resulted in specification of the scope of cooperation and stipulating the conditions for selection of audit samples.
Both parties agreed that cooperation should concentrate on the following areas: a) review of validity and correctness of the VAT IDs of persons registered for VAT in the CR or SR, as appropriate, in intra-Community supplies; b) review of data on intra-Community acquisitions stated in the VAT returns by taxpayers in the CR with the use of information from recapitulative statement (hereinafter the “RS”) of taxpayers from the SR contained in the VIES system, and vice versa; c) exchange of information between tax administrations in the CR and in the SR with respect to the performed transactions.
Furthermore, it was agreed that selection of tax entities for audit would be carried out on the basis of the quantity of intra-Community supplies between the CR and the SR and, according to the number of requests for international cooperation sent and accepted between the CR and the SR through the SCAC form.
5.1 Intra-Community transactions
The procedure in processing of information between tax administrations of the CR and the SR in intra-Community supplies and acquisitions of goods is depicted in the following chart.
5.1.1 Intra-Community supplies
If a VAT payer makes an intra-Community supply, he is obliged to submit a RS by the 25th day after expiry of the relevant calendar quarter.
In the RS, a taxpayer in the CR provides summary information on supplies of goods to another EU member countries exempt from VAT, which he carried out during the previous calendar quarter.
In the SR a taxpayer is obliged to declare in the RS the value of goods exempt from VAT and supplied to this country from other EU member countries during a calendar quarter.
Information on the value of supplied goods is stated in the RS always in the Czech or Slovak currency, as appropriate, and is classified according to individual tax entities with specification of their VAT IDs, under which they were registered in their country.
Data on services are not provided in the RS.
If a taxpayer in the CR finds out that he has stated incorrect information in the RS, he is obliged to submit a corrective RS.
If a taxpayer in the SR finds out that the data stated in the RS were incomplete or incorrect, this taxpayer shall submit a corrective RS prior to expiry of the deadline for submission of the RS; after this deadline, he shall submit a supplementary RS.
The VIES system allows for exchange of information on registration data of taxpayers registered for VAT in the EU member countries.
Taxpayers from the CR and the SR may verify whether the VAT ID of the relevant acquirer is registered in the given EU member country.
Information from the submitted RS are combined at the MF CLO and TD CLO, as appropriate, with the use of the VIES system according to the individual VAT IDs of the acquirers.
The summary value of all supplies is calculated for each acquirer’s VAT ID and the codes of the manner of fulfilment are drawn up for all Czech and Slovak suppliers in the so-called L1QD files.
Data from the L1QD files are sent to the relevant EU member countries at the latest within three months of the end of the quarter to which the data are related.
The total value of intra-Community fulfilments between the CR and the SR (from L1QD files) is stated in the following table.
If the VIES system in another member country detects an incorrect acquirer’s VAT ID in the sent L1QD files, it generates the “O_MCTL” report which contains all false VAT IDs with description of the type of error.
This report is subsequently sent to the MF CLO or TD CLO, as appropriate.
The O_MCTL may contain 4 types of mistakes: formally incorrect VAT ID; the VAT ID is not recorded in the given country or has never been assigned; the acquirer with a certain VAT ID was not a VAT payer in the given quarter; VAT registration of the acquirer was cancelled during the quarter.
In the CR, the MF CLO submits data from accepted O_MCTL reports to the tax offices.
If a false VAT ID of a taxpayer from the EU is entered in any of the lines of the RS or corrective RS, the ATIS system at the competent tax office generates a “Notice of Doubt Concerning VAT ID”.
The tax office reviews whether the supply to a taxpayer registered for VAT in another EU member country has actually taken place and records the result of review in the system.
In the SR, the TD CLO processes all O_MCTL reports in the VIES system and sends them to the locally competent tax offices together with identification of taxpayers who stated a false VAT ID in the RS.
Tax offices subsequently invite the taxpayers to submit supplementary RS and state valid VAT IDs or, in case of reporting an invalid VAT ID in the submitted RS, the tax office reviews the supply of goods at the relevant taxpayer.
Information on the number of false VAT IDs related to intra-Community transactions performed between the CR and the SR is stated in the following table.
Of the total number of 41 728 VAT IDs of Czech taxpayers stated in the RS submitted by Slovak taxpayers in the period from the 2nd quarter of 2004 to the 1st quarter of 2005, 929 VAT IDs, i.e. 2.23 %, were incorrect.
Of the total number of 62 997 VAT IDs of Slovak taxpayers stated in the RS by the Czech taxpayers in the same period, 416 VAT IDs, i.e. 0.66 %, were incorrect.
When accounting for intra-Community transactions performed between the CR and the SR, Czech taxpayers stated fewer false VAT IDs in their RS than taxpayers from the SR.
When reviewing the activities of tax offices, as appropriate, it was ascertained that the VIES system did not always provide up-to-date information on validity of VAT registration of tax entities.
E.g.:
- although, on the basis of inquiry by a tax administrator in the CR, the VIES system confirmed validity of registration of a tax entity in the 4th quarter of 2004, an O_MCTL report was subsequently generated due to cancelling of registration of the taxpayer during this quarter.
Investigation showed that the registration was cancelled only as of January 1, 2005;
- furthermore, the SAO SR ascertained that 6 tax entities submitted a RS containing false VAT IDs; however, the O_MCTL reports did not contain these VAT IDs.
In the SR, the submitted RS are transferred by the tax offices into electronic form and data from the RS are sent to the TD CLO.
After subsequent processing of these data in the VIES system, the TD CLO sends to the competent tax offices the so-called lists of errors in the RS submitted by tax entities for the relevant quarter.
The SAO SR compared information on erroneous data in the RS as of July 26, 2005 (i.e. information processed prior to commencement of audit) with information as of February 2, 2006 (i.e. data processed after completion of audit).
Comparison of the data is given in the following table.
The above data indicate that the audit carried out by the SAO SR led not only to a decrease in the number of RS with an incorrect VAT ID (on average, by 199 RS per quarter), but also to a decrease in the number of uncorrected mistakes in the RS (on average, by 431 mistakes per quarter).
In the CR, tax offices compare the value of intra-Community supplies, as declared by the taxpayers in the relevant lines of the VAT return, with the value of intra-Community supplies set forth by the taxpayers in the quarterly RS.
The ATIS system automatically indicates differences between these values.
The tax administrator should verify these differences, remedy any shortcomings and use the obtained data when determining the tax obligation.
The SAO, CR ascertained that the audited tax offices failed to review these differences in 27 cases.
The total difference between the values stated in the RS and the VAT return equalled in these cases CZK 537 231 thousand.
From the 3rd quarter of 2004, the ATIS system has enabled the tax administrators in the CR to consider any values declared in the RS and the VAT return which differ by an amount not exceeding 0.5 % of the total value of intra-Community supplies pursuant to the RS to be equal values and set such conformity in the ATIS system.
For taxpayers with a large quantity of intra-Community supplies during a quarter, 0.5 % is not a negligible amount and, therefore, in these cases, tax administrators should not set conformity of RS and VAT return without clarifying the causes of the differences.
E.g., the tax administrator set conformity in case of values differing by CZK 1 561 thousand.
Review of differences in the CR and the SR was complicated by the fact that the RS per each quarter was submitted by the taxpayers within 25 days after expiry of the quarter.
For taxpayers with a monthly taxation period, tax administrators could not compare the values of intra-Community supplies in the VAT return with the values pursuant to the RS at the time of submitting the VAT return for the first two months of the calendar quarter.
In these cases, the tax administrators learned of the potential inconsistence of data in the VAT return with the data in the RS only at a time when the tax liability or the excessive deduction of VAT was assessed or reimbursed, respectively.
5.1.2 Intra-Community acquisitions
The VIES system provides, inter alia, information on the values of intra-Community transactions performed in the framework of the EU member countries.
Acquisition of goods in the CR
Data from the RS submitted by taxpayers from other EU member countries (delivered L1QD) are processed in the CR by the MF CLO.
During processing, these data are converted on the basis of minimum and maximum daily exchange rates of the Czech National Bank for the relevant quarter and then they are compared with the acquisition value stated by the Czech taxpayers in the VAT return for the relevant quarter.
The acquisition value declared by the taxpayers in the VAT return should vary between the minimum and maximum converted values of L1QD (values L1min and L1max).
When the value declared in the VAT return is lower than L1min, a “review instruction” is generated for taxpayers with the most substantial variances.
Instructions to review acquisitions of goods serve as a notice to problematic tax entities and are submitted to locally competent tax offices, which must examine the submitted data.
The numbers of review instructions concerning audited tax offices in the CR are stated in the following table.
The SAO, CR ascertained that, in 33 cases, the audited tax offices failed to review variances in the values of intra-Community acquisitions that were indicated by the delivered review instructions.
The total difference between the values stated in the RS submitted by taxpayers from other EU member countries and the VAT returns submitted by the Czech taxpayers equalled in these cases at least CZK 148 319 thousand.
The SAO, CR selected for audit 533 files of tax entities, with respect to which the audited tax offices received a review instruction from the MF CLO.
The audit indicated the following most frequent causes of differences between the values stated in the acquirer’s VAT return and the supplier’s RS: on the part of the acquirer (Czech taxpayer) in 263 cases, the acquirer failed to state the acquisition of goods in the ordinary VAT return, in 93 cases, the taxpayer accounted for acquisition of goods in a taxation period other than in which he was obliged to account for the tax, in 6 cases, the acquirer stated the value of acquired goods in an incorrect line of the VAT return, on the part of the supplier (taxpayer from the EU) in 88 cases, taxpayers from the EU included in their RS also values of services provided to a Czech taxpayer, of which 54 cases involved taxpayers from the SR, in 39 cases, the taxpayers included in their RS supplies of goods in a different taxation period than acquirers from the CR in their VAT return, in 22 cases, the suppliers stated in their RS an incorrect VAT ID of the Czech taxpayer, in 16 cases, the suppliers stated incorrect values of supplies of goods in the RS, in 12 cases, the suppliers included in the RS the value of goods supplied to the CR before May 1, 2004, in 5 cases, the suppliers included in the RS the value of accepted advance payments.
Slovak taxpayers most frequently incorrectly declared in the RS the value of provided services.
54 such cases were found at the audited tax offices.
E.g., during examination of a review instruction, it was ascertained that a difference of CZK 10 974 thousand was caused by the fact that the Slovak taxpayer included in the RS for the 1st quarter of 2005 the provision of services (construction work and supply of goods including assembly in the territory of the CR).
Another reason for the existence of differences consisted in inclusion of values of accepted advance payments in the RS; e.g., 2 Slovak taxpayers included in their RS advance payments accepted from Czech taxpayers, resulting in generating a review instruction concerning a difference of CZK 3 580 thousand.
Review instructions concerning acquired goods are generated only once per quarter.
In case of a subsequent change in the data declared in the RS in the EU member countries, such as a change in the buyer of goods in the CR or an increase in the value of goods supplied to the CR, no new review instructions are generated.
Given the fact that the VIES system does not provide automatic notification of these changes, without further information the locally competent tax administrator for the acquirer of the goods may not learn of the facts decisive for correct assessment of the tax obligation concerning the acquired goods and the probability of VAT fraud is very high.
The audit performed by the SAO, CR indicated that this situation occurred, e.g. in the following cases:
A Slovak taxpayer stated in the RS for the 2nd quarter of 2004 the value of goods supplied to a Czech taxpayer equal to SKK 1 504 thousand.
On February 1, 2005, the locally competent tax office for the Czech taxpayer sent a request for information to the SR, as the Czech taxpayer accounted for acquisition of goods only in the amount of CZK 425 thousand.
On the basis of tax proceedings, on March 1, 2005, the Slovak taxpayer submitted a supplementary RS, in which he corrected data on supply of goods to the CR, namely by decreasing the value of the supply to the original Czech taxpayer to SKK 538 thousand and increasing the value of goods supplied to another Czech taxpayer from SKK 194 thousand to the value of SKK 1 160 thousand.
Four Slovak taxpayers stated in their RS for the 2nd quarter of 2004 intra-Community supplies to taxpayers from the CR in a total amount of SKK 10 240 thousand (i.e. CZK 8 183 thousand).
However, Czech taxpayers did not account for intra-Community acquisitions in their VAT returns.
On the basis of international exchange of information, it was ascertained that, in all cases, the goods were supplied to another Czech taxpayer who was not identified in the RS submitted by the Slovak taxpayers.
During the 1st quarter of 2005, Slovak taxpayers increased the value of intra-Community supplies to this Czech taxpayer declared in the supplementary RS concerning the 2nd quarter of 2004, by a total of SKK 10 240 thousand.
Given the aforementioned facts, the locally competent tax administrator in the CR could not have any doubt concerning correctness of data stated in the submitted VAT return for the 2nd quarter of 2004, although the actual acquirer failed to fulfil the obligation to account for an intra-Community acquisition during this quarter.
The SAO, CR ascertained that, on the basis of international exchange of information between tax administrations, VAT was subsequently assessed for the Czech taxpayer in an amount of CZK 3 640 thousand for the taxation periods of May and June 2004 and in an amount of CZK 3 305 thousand for the 3rd quarter of 2004 with respect to the goods acquired in the 3rd quarter of 2004.
It follows from the aforementioned facts that tax administrators had to review in tax proceedings not only differences arisen due to errors in the acquirer’s VAT return, but also differences caused by different reporting of data on intra-Community supplies and acquisitions in the individual EU member countries.
Unification of the conditions for reporting these data within the EU would increase the effectiveness of control activities of tax administrators.
Acquisition of goods in the SR
In the SR, the PATIS system allows for comparison of data on the value of acquired goods obtained through the VIES system from other EU member countries with data set forth in the VAT returns submitted by Slovak acquirers.
The method of comparison of data is called the “MIN-MAX method”.
This method is used to convert the values of acquisitions stated in the RS of taxpayers from other EU member countries on the basis of the minimum and maximum exchange rates for the relevant quarter.
A MIN-MAX interval is thus established, which is used to compare the values of acquisitions stated in the VAT returns submitted by Slovak taxpayers.
The TD CLO provides the tax administrators with information on values of intra-Community acquisitions stated in the VAT returns and values of supplies from the EU in the VIES system.
The tax administrator decides with respect to which persons registered for VAT this difference will be reviewed, taking also account of other risk analysis criteria.
On the basis of data provided by the TD CLO, the SAO SR collected at the audited tax offices 57 files of Slovak acquirers of goods for audit, of which 25 taxpayers acquired goods from the CR, and, with respect to these acquirers, the greatest differences were established between the values of acquisition obtained from the VIES system and the values declared in the VAT returns.
Audit performed by the SAO SR confirmed the fact that tax administrators failed to consistently review differences established through the MIN-MAX method and thus failed to verify accuracy of data declared in the VAT returns by Slovak acquirers.
In the framework of audit, the SAO SR requested that the tax offices carry out 47 local investigations concerned with specific tax entities.
31 local investigations were completed at tax offices during the audit by the SAO SR.
The following facts were ascertained, inter alia, with respect to Slovak companies, in relation to which the VIES system reported considerable differences in the MIN-MAX values upon acquisition of goods from the EU member countries:
In the VAT return for the 4th quarter of 2004, a Slovak taxpayer failed to declare the value of goods acquired from the EU.
The tax office ascertained that a company from the CR declared by mistake in the RS for the 4th quarter of 2004 the number of the aforementioned taxpayer, while the goods in the value of CZK 19 184 thousand were in fact supplied to a different Slovak taxpayer.
According to the VIES system, a Slovak company allegedly acquired goods from the CR, Poland, Hungary and Austria in the MIN value of SKK 682 692 thousand and in the MAX value of SKK 715 105 thousand during the 4th quarter of 2004.
This company submitted a VAT return for the given period, in which it declared the value of acquisitions from the EU only in the amount of SKK 480 599 thousand.
The tax administrator carried out local investigations, in which it ascertained that the tax entity purchased electrical energy from the CR, Poland, Hungary and Austria.
Suppliers declared in the RS and the VAT return intra-Community supplies according to the date of delivery, rather than according to the dates of issuance of invoices.
Given other variances in acquisition of goods from those EU member countries, the tax administrator will request review of the value of supplied goods through the SCAC forms.
A Slovak taxpayer failed to state in the VAT return acquisition of goods from other EU member countries in the 4th quarter of 2004.
According to the VIES system, this taxpayer allegedly acquired goods in the MIN value of SKK 11 286 thousand and in the MAX value of SKK 11 845 thousand.
The tax office carried out local investigation and the audit indicated that the tax entity did not acquire any goods from the EU member countries in the 4th quarter of 2004.
The SAO SR recommended the tax office to request through the SCAC form that the supply of goods from the EU member countries would be reviewed.
Supply of goods for a Slovak buyer in the MIN value of SKK 557 thousand and in the MAX value of SKK 565 thousand was recorded in the VIES system.
In the VAT return for the taxation period of October to December 2004, the taxpayer did not account for any acquisition of goods.
By local investigation, the tax administrator ascertained that, on December 10, 2004, the tax entity received from a supplier in the CR an invoice for material used in repair of a hydraulic loader.
The SAO SR recommended that a tax control would be performed at the taxpayer.
16 local investigations were not completed at tax offices during the audit by the SAO SR.
In 10 cases, the SAO SR requested that the tax administrators perform tax control at the tax entities.
Reports on the results of local investigations and tax controls will be lodged by the tax authorities after their performance to the SAO SR.
The following cases were involved, for example:
A Slovak acquirer failed to declare in the VAT return for the 4th quarter of 2004 an acquisition of goods from EU member countries and, for the taxation period of October to December 2004, he failed to account for any tax and claimed reimbursement of an excessive deduction of VAT in a total amount of SKK 1 236 thousand.
The tax administrator carried out local investigation, which indicated that the tax entity acquired goods from the CR in the value of EUR 683 thousand (approx. SKK 27 080 thousand).
The aforementioned goods were transported from the CR by the Czech supplier to the customs office in Čierna nad Tisou, where the transport continued to the Russian Federation.
The Slovak taxpayer issued an invoice to the buyer in the Russian Federation in an amount of EUR 683 thousand, which he failed to declare in the submitted VAT return.
The tax administrator is performing tax control at the tax entity.
The difference between the data on acquisition stated in the VAT return submitted by the Slovak taxpayer for the period from the 3rd quarter of 2004 to the 1st quarter of 2005 and the data on supplies accounted for by the taxpayers from the EU member countries in the individual quarters equalled a total of SKK 4 800 thousand.
The tax office ascertained that the tax entity purchased goods from suppliers in the CR and Belgium and subsequently sold the goods to Ukraine.
Uniform export customs declarations were attached to the invoices.
The tax entity did not state the acquisition of goods in the VAT return; according to the statement of the executive of the company, the goods were transported within the transit procedure directly from the CR to Ukraine.
The tax entity did not submit any VAT records during local investigation.
Tax control was commenced at the taxpayer.
5.2 International exchange of information at the L3 level
Information exchange at the L3 level is initiated by locally competent tax administrators who send their requests for information (hereinafter “RFI”) or spontaneous information exchange (hereinafter “SIE”) related to a certain tax entity or transaction through the MF CLO or TD CLO, as appropriate, to other EU member countries.
The objective of the RFI is, e.g. to demonstrate performance of a given transaction in the framework of intra-Community performances, verification of a certain VAT ID, etc.
SIE involves provision of information that is important for a tax administrator in another EU member country.
Cooperation in the area of information exchange is governed by Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003.
Pursuant to Art. 8 of the Regulation, the limit for response to a RFI equals 3 months.
The conditions for admissibility of requests are regulated in the Commission Decision of November 15, 2004 which stipulates that, unless the countries involved agree otherwise, the RFI must concern transactions with a value of at least EUR 1 500 excl. VAT.
If a RFI concerns a transaction with a value of less than EUR 15 000 excl. VAT, the requested authority may refuse to respond with respect to its workload.
The procedure in dealing with received RFI by the tax administration of the CR, including specification of internal time limits stipulated for processing at individual organizational levels, is depicted in the following chart.
In the SR, the time limit for responding to a RFI by the tax offices was internally set at 2 months so that the three-month limit pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003 can be complied with.
The MF CLO received a total of 29 RFI and 3 SIEs from the SR in the period from May 1, 2004 to June 30, 2005.
Of 29 RFI received, 26 (i.e. 89.7 %) were dealt with within the set deadline of 3 months and 3 (i.e. 10.3 %) were dealt with after the deadline.
During the same period, the TD CLO received a total of 71 RFI and 7 SIE from the CR.
Of 71 RFI received, 64 (i.e. 90.1 %) were dealt with within the set deadline of 3 months and 5 (i.e. 7.0 %) were dealt with after the deadline (in 2 remaining cases, it was not possible to determine the deadline on the basis of the submitted materials).
More detailed information on the duration of addressing RFI accepted by the MF CLO or TD CLO, as appropriate, is given in Graph No. 1.
The reasons for sending RFI, as stated in the SCAC forms, are described in the following table.
Conclusions
On the basis of international cooperation, compliance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax was reviewed, as well as the use of the VIES system to exchange information amongst EU member countries, particularly in control of exercising the claim for VAT exemption.
International cooperation enabled to verify selected intra-Community transactions performed between VAT payers from the CR and the SR.
Review of selected transactions indicated that, on the basis of international exchange of information, tax administrations of both countries revealed that certain companies performed fictitious intra-Community transactions in order to obtain excessive deductions of VAT and also that certain acquirers failed to account for VAT on accepted supplies of goods in the correct amount.
The audit also revealed variances in processing and use of data from the VIES system by tax administrations of both countries.
Moreover, the audit also indicated problems caused by different reporting of data on intra-Community supplies and acquisitions of goods in individual EU member countries.
Unification of the conditions for reporting of these data within the EU would increase the effectiveness of control activities of tax administrations of the individual member countries.
Through review of the procedure of tax offices in administration of VAT and use of the VIES system, it was ascertained that tax offices did not adequately utilize all the options of the VIES system and the relevant statutory powers.
Furthermore, it was ascertained that the VIES system did not always provide up-to-date information on supplies of goods and on validity of registration of tax entities for VAT.
The SAO SR compared data on occurrence of erroneous data in the RS processed prior to commencement of audit with data processed after completion of the audit.
It follows from the comparison of these data that audit by the SAO SR led, not only to reduction of the number of RS with incorrect VAT ID, but also to reduction of the number of uncorrected mistakes in the RS.
In case of variances in the reported data, the SAO SR requested that the tax offices perform local investigations or tax control, as appropriate.
The SAO, CR did not have that option in the framework of the valid legislation in the CR.
The findings obtained during the audit indicate that the VIES system provided tax administrators with basic information required for control of proper application of VAT in intra-Community transactions.
Given the fact that there continues to be a potential for tax evasions in this area, it is necessary to pay increased attention to intra-Community transactions in administration of VAT.
Communiqué
This Report has been drawn up in the Czech, English and Slovak languages and signed by the President of the Supreme Audit Office, Czech Republic and the President of the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic.
Parallel audit of the administration of value-added tax and excise taxes between the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic
Introduction
The present document provides information on the execution and results of parallel audits conducted by the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic, which were both focused on the area of administration of value-added lax and excise taxes.
The cooperation between the two supreme audit institutions of the two countries is based on the Agreement on Audit Cooperation, signed in February 2004.
The topic of the parallel audits was chosen with a view to the fact that indirect taxes constitute very substantial revenue of the state budgets of both countries.
The value-added tax structure, which allows for a refund of an excessive tax deduction, provides room for tax frauds and tax evasion.
High excise tax rates, particularly those applying to tobacco and tobacco products, spirits and mineral oils, bring high profits to those who can dodge them by selling the commodities listed above illegally.
Tax frauds are a problem not only in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, but also elsewhere in the European Union.
The need to tackle the problem comprehensively and in a coordinated fashion all across (he Union prompted EU SAIs to establish a VAT Working Group, in the work of which the Supreme Audit Offices of both the Czech Republic and Slovakia have been actively involved.
The most important contribution of the two audits described herein is not just the exchange of information, but particularly in joint efforts to identify problematic areas of the administration of indirect taxes in order to reduce the room for tax evasion.
The experience and information acquired will be used in planned audits of indirect taxes, which will focus predominantly on the involvement of tax administrators of both countries in the VIES system that permits controlling movements of goods between EU member states.
Report on results of the audit of the administration of value-added tax and excise taxes in 2002 and 2003
1. Introduction
Audit IDs: (CZ) 04/07 (SK) 18/2004
Subject matter:
(CZ) Value-added tax and excise taxes
(SK) Audit of procedures employed by the tax administrator in the administration, control and collection of value-added tax and excise taxes
On February 11, 2004, the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (hereinafter „SAO CR") and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter „SAO SR") signed an Agreement on Audit Cooperation, the subject matter of which was cooperation of the two institutions in parallel audits, namely „Value-added tax and excise taxes", included in the Audit Plan of SAO CR under ID 04/07, and „Audit of procedures employed by the tax administrator in the administration, control and collection of value-added tax and excise taxes", included in the Audit Plan of SAO SR under ID 18/2004.
The cooperation consisted in the exchange of information, the scope of which has been defined in the Agreement referred to above, and in the preparation of a joint final report on audit results.
Under the Agreement, both parties have undertaken to exchange information from their respective public sources, custom administration databases and files of taxpaying entities maintained by tax offices in the Czech Republic and tax offices in the Slovak Republic, which the parties were unable to obtain for the purpose of auditing the application of value-added tax and excise taxes from sources in their own territory.
The audits were conducted in parallel, from January to August 2004.
Insofar as the Czech Republic (hereinafter „CR") is concerned, the audit was performed by SAO's State Budget Department and Regional Offices in South Bohemia, Northeast Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia and North Moravia.
The audited entities included the General Directorate of Customs and twelve selected Tax Offices: Tax Office of Praha 1, Tax Office of Praha 3, Tax Office of České Budějovice, Tax Office of Frýdek-Místek, Tax Office of Hodonín, Tax Office of Jihlava, Tax Office of Kostelec nad Orlicí, Tax Office of Kroměříž, Tax Office of Písek, Tax Office of Rožnov pod Radhoštěm, Tax Office of Ústí nad Orlicí, Tax Office of Velké Meziříčí.
Insofar as the Slovak Republic (hereinafter „SR") is concerned, the audit was performed by SAO SR's Section of Tax and Customs Administration in cooperation with SAO's Regional Offices in Banska Bystrica and Kosice.
The audited entities included ten selected Tax Offices: Tax Office for selected taxpayers in Bratislava, Tax Office of Bratislava III, Tax Office of Trnava, Tax Office of Púchov, Tax Office of Banska Bystrica I, Tax Office of Liptovský Mikuláš, Tax Office of Žilina I, Tax Office of Žilina II, Tax Office of Košice I and Tax Office of Kosice IV.
Audit objective
The purpose of the audits was to check and verify the performance of Tax Offices and Customs Offices with respect to the administration of value-added and excise taxes, with an emphasis on the collection of these taxes in connection with exports and imports of goods and services.
The purpose of the international cooperation under the Agreement referred to above was to check export and import transactions of selected commodities between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, using the Customs Databases of the two countries, and to make their subsequent verification using Tax Return Forms submitted to relevant Tax Offices of jurisdiction.
The audits covered the years 2002 and 2003.
2. Summary of Audit Results
2.1. General Assessment of the Audits
Under the International Cooperation Agreement referred to above, the Czech Supreme Audit Office handed over 22,206 items of Single Administrative Documents (hereinafter „SAD") on export and import transactions between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic from the Czech Customs Database to its Slovak counterpart. On the other hand, the Slovak Supreme Audit Office provided 30,221 items of Single Administrative Documents from the Slovak Customs Database to its Czech counterpart.
A comparison of selected SAD items from the Czech Customs Database and the Slovak Customs Database was made.
The total number of SAD items selected from the Czech Customs Database was 5,883, of which 43 percent were assigned to a transaction.
The total number of SAD items selected from the Slovak Customs Database was 12,343, of which 26 percent were assigned to a transaction.
Based on the remaining, i.e. unassigned, SAD items, a selection of folders of taxpaying entities was made at Tax Offices, in respect whereof export and import transactions were further verified in cooperation with the Czech and Slovak Customs Directorates.
The information provided by the Czech and Slovak Customs Directorates and Tax Offices and exchanged between the two states was used to check whether registered export and import transactions between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic had indeed taken place.
The Czech and Slovak Supreme Audit Offices conducted a joint pilot audit at the Starý Hrozenkov Drietoma border checkpoint, during which both parties were cooperating very closely to verify data on movements of goods between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.
The audit did not identify any shortfalls or deficiencies in records of selected export and import transactions, which had taken place in 2002.
The international cooperation described herein made it possible to check and verify business transactions between partners from both nations, and has helped identify shortfalls and deficiencies in records of export and import transactions.
2.2. Summary of Audit Results
Under the International Cooperation Agreement referred to above, the audit carried out by the Czech and Slovak Supreme Audit Offices focused on exports and imports of alcohol and spirits, tobacco and tobacco products, computers and computer components, cellphones and their components, and other goods.
Based on a check of folders of taxpaying entities at selected Tax Offices, the Czech Supreme Audit Office asked for a verification of exports of goods registered on 40 SAD s, the aggregate statistical value of which was CZK 15,301,093,-, while the Slovak Supreme Audit Office asked for a verification of exports of goods the aggregate statistical value of which was 56,989 SKK.
The Czech and Slovak Supreme Audit Offices have established, inter alia, the following facts:
- Business transactions were not declared in the same way in both countries, which made corresponding exports and imports difficult to identity in the Czech and Slovak Customs Databases,
- Data entry errors in the above-mentioned customs databases made it impossible to identify some import and export transactions,
- Some exports from the Czech Republic failed to find and verify appropriate matching imports in the Slovak Republic.
Insofar as these cases are concerned, there exists a justified suspicion of fictitious exports for the purpose of illegally claiming a value-added tax return,
- Taxpaying entities failed to comply with certain legal obligations pertaining to the reporting of exports and imports in value-added tax return forms,
- Shortfalls and deficiencies were identified in the administration of value-added tax and excise taxes by Tax Offices and in their coordination with customs offices.
Insofar as value-added tax and excise taxes are concerned, continuous attention will have to be paid to international trade in order to minimize tax evasion.
Of particular importance is improving the work of tax administrators with respect to value-added tax.
An efficient excise tax management system cannot dispense with checks of circulating documents, systematic physical checks of goods and mutual exchange of information on imported and exported goods.
3. Current State of Affairs in the Area of Value-Added Tax and Excise Taxes
Value-Added Tax
Value-added tax (hereinafter „VAT") was collected by Tax Offices on taxable performance at home and by Customs Offices on imported goods.
Tax revenues of Tax Offices are equal to the difference between the total collected VAT and VAT refunds.
VAT revenues of Customs Offices are equal to the total amount of collected VAT.
In accordance with basic principles of VAT, the tax collected by Customs Offices is reflected in VAT refund claims submitted to and granted by Tax Offices.
For most Tax Offices, VAT refunds exceed VAT liabilities.
VAT is one of the key tax revenues of the state budget, as it accounted for roughly 31 percent of the Czech Republic's budget revenues and for about 42 percent of the Slovak Republic's budget revenues in 2003.
The aggregate balance of VAT in the Czech Republic in 2003 was CZK 162.9 billion.
Tax and Customs Offices altogether collected CZK 394.3 billion, the aggregate amount of VAT refunds was CZK 231.4 billion.
The aggregate balance of VAT in the Slovak Republic in 2003 was SK 83.8 billion.
Tax and Customs Offices altogether collected SK 187.0 billion, the aggregate amount of VAT refunds was SK 103.2 billion.
Excise Taxes
Excise taxes (hereinafter „ExT“) were collected by appropriate Tax Offices; insofar as imports of products subject to excise tax were concerned, ExT were collected by Customs Offices.
ExT accounted for roughly 16 percent of the Czech Republic's budget revenues and for about 19 percent of the Slovak Republic's budget revenues in 2003.
The aggregate ExT balance collected by Tax Offices and Customs Offices in 2003 was CZK 85.6 billion in the Czech Republic and SK 38.0 billion in the Slovak Republic.
4. Audit Execution
The cooperation between the Czech and Slovak Supreme Audit Offices took place in two phases.
The first phase comprised a comparison of exports and imports of selected commodities on the basis of data obtained from the Czech and Slovak Customs Databases. The second phase consisted in a mutual verification of selected business transactions between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, and checks performed in the territory of each of the countries.
4.1.
Audit preparations
The first proposal for cooperation in parallel VAT and ExT audits was presented at a working meeting of representatives of the Czech and Slovak Supreme Audit Offices in April 2003.
In November 2003, there was a coordination meeting, which brought, inter alia, an agreement regarding the commodities to be audited, i.e. types of goods posing a high risk of non-compliance with customs and tax regulations: - alcohol and spirits, Customs Tariff Headings No. 2207 and No. 2208, - tobacco and tobacco products, Customs Tariff Headings No. 2401, No. 2402 and No. 2403, - computers and computer components, Customs Tariff Headings and Sub-Headings No. 8471 and No. 8473 30, - mobile phones and their accessories, Customs Tariff Sub-Headings No. 8525 20 91, No. 8525 20 99 and No. 8529 90 40.
Both parties agreed that the selection of taxpaying entities to be checked would be made: a) From unassigned items resulting from a comparison of exports and imports of selected commodities between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, b) From entities regularly involved in export or import transactions or involved in a one-off large export or import transaction, c) On the basis of findings of checks and audits performed by selected Tax Offices.
4.2. Comparison of Customs Databases of the Czech and Slovak Republics
In the first phase, a mechanism of mutual assignment and matching of SAD items in the Czech and Slovak Customs Databases was tested on a sample of export and import transactions of selected commodities from October 2002.
Next, exports of the following selected commodities (see the list below, including the Customs Tariff Classification) from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic and vice versa in 2002 were compared.
- 2207 Ethyl alcohol, non-denatured, with volume content of alcohol equal to 80 percent or more; ethyl alcohol and other denatured distillates irrespective of their alcohol content,
- 2208 Ethyl alcohol, non-denatured, with volume content of alcohol less than 80 percent, distillates, liqueurs and other spirit-containing beverages,
- 2401 Raw tobacco; tobacco waste,
- 2402 Cigars, cheroots, cigarillos and cigarettes made from tobacco or tobacco substitutes,
- 2403 Other tobacco products and tobacco substitutes; homogenized or reconstituted tobacco; tobacco concentrates and essences,
- 8525 20 91 Transmission apparatus incorporating reception apparatus: For cellular networks (mobile phones),
- 8525 20 99 Transmission apparatus incorporating reception apparatus: Others,
- 8529 90 40 Parts and components suitable for use solely or primarily with apparatus falling under headings 8525 to 8528
Others: Parts and components of apparatus falling under subheadings 8525 10 50, 8525 20 91, 8525 20 99, 8525 40 11 and 8527 90 92.
SAD items from the Customs Databases of the Czech and Slovak Republics were mutually assigned on the basis of matching contents of different columns of the SAD (e.g. invoiced price, quantity, weight, license plate number of the vehicle carrying the consignment, border crossing date, Customs Tariff heading etc.).
Results of the comparison are presented in the following tables and charts.
The process of matching individual export and import transactions was complicated, inter alia, by the fact that export and import transactions had not been declared by the parties in the same way.
So, for example, a Czech export transaction made use of a single SAD, while the corresponding import transaction on the Slovak side made use of multiple SADs, there were differences in the numbers of items between an export SAD and its matching import SAD etc.
Additional factors affecting the rate of success of the matching or assignment process was the structure of data in the Czech and Slovak Customs Databases, as well as the period of time elapsed between the registration of an export transaction in the Customs Database of one country and the registration of the corresponding import transaction in the Customs Database of the other country.
Results of the comparison were used to select check samples at audited Tax Offices.
Attention was focused on some taxpaying entities that had accomplished export or import transactions between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, which were impossible to identify in both national Customs Databases.
Furthermore, some other taxpaying entities, in respect whereof data on export or import transactions between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic was found in both national Customs Databases, were selected for the purpose of verification of business operations shown in Value-Added Tax Return Forms.
4.3. Pilot Audit at the Stary Hrozenkov - Drietoma Border Checkpoint
The border checkpoint for the pilot audit was selected on the basis of a joint analysis of unassigned SAD items in the Czech and Slovak Customs Databases.
Based on a bilateral agreement between Czech and Slovak customs authorities, the use of so-called control forms was introduced at Czech-Slovak border checkpoints as of June 1,1998.
The purpose of the measure was to minimize customs and tax evasion, obtain an idea of movements of vehicles transporting business goods in the customs area, and provide prerequisites for a mutual comparison of customs records.
The pilot audit took place between March 8 and March 26, 2004, and its purpose was to verify the customs check procedure described above.
Procedure involving the use off control forms at the Stary Hrozenkov—Drietoma border checkpoint
1) Weighing of the vehicle, issue of the control form to the driver.
2) Parking of the Vehicle in the assigned sector of the parking lot.
Customs clearing procedure in the customs clearance building - Czech Police, Slovak Police, Czech Customs, Slovak Customs.
Each authority participating In the clearance procedure will stamp the control form.
3) Arrival of the vehicle to the physical inspection area.
Presentation of the control form, SAD and other relevant documents to the customs officer. A check of all required steps and documents.

Release of the vehicle from the customs zone.
Note: Vehicles carrying goods imported to the Czech Republic were weighed by Czech customs officers.
Vehicles carrying goods imported to the Slovak Republic were Weighed by employees of an authorized legal entity.
Weighed vehicles were entered into a computer database
4.3.1 Audit Sample
Exports from the Czech Republic to Slovak Republic
The audit sample was selected on the basis of an analysis of records of the Czech Customs Database of exports in 2002.
The composition of the audit sample for export transactions is shown in Table 4.
4.3.2. Control Forms and their Registration Exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic
Insofar as exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic were concerned, the control forms were issued and registered by the Slovak Customs Directorate.
The Czech Customs Directorate recorded registration numbers of the control forms pertaining to exported goods in its electronic database of exports.
Of the total number of 453 SAD items, the Slovak Supreme Audit Office identified 256 imports to the Slovak Republic on the basis of data from the Czech and Slovak Customs Databases, and the remaining 197 SAD items in cooperation with customs officers of the Drietoma border checkpoint.
Exports from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic
Insofar as exports from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic were concerned, the control forms were issued and registered by the Czech Customs Directorate.
Of the total number of 339 SAD items, the Czech Supreme Audit Office assigned corresponding control form registration numbers to 295 in cooperation with customs officers of the Stary Hrozenkov border checkpoint.
The remaining 44 SAD items were identified and the exports from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic confirmed by customs officers of the Drietoma border checkpoint.
The audit conducted by the Czech and Slovak Supreme Audit Offices did not identify any shortfalls or deficiencies in records and registration procedures pertaining to selected exports and imports of goods going through the Stary Hrozenkov -Drietoma border checkpoint in 2002.
4.4. Selected Audit Findings Established in the Course of Verification of Business Transactions
The purpose of the international cooperation project was to verify import and export transactions between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, using data provided by the Customs Directorate and Tax Offices, whichever is applicable, in the territory of the other country.
For selected taxpaying entities, the following facts were checked:
- Whether submitted SADs had been registered in the Czech and Slovak Customs Databases,
- Whether legal requirements applying to the deduction of VAT with respect to imported goods, to VAT refund or VAT exemption with respect to exported goods had been complied with.
The verification of the business transactions brought the following results:
1. The Slovak Supreme Audit Office requested a verification of exports of alcohol, the aggregate statistical value of which was SK 56,989.-.
The Czech Supreme Audit Office identified corresponding imports amounting to CZK 42,624.- in the Czech Customs Database.r
2. A company dealing in exports and imports of photographic cameras and their accessories had claimed an excessive VAT refund of CZK 3,740,664.- in its December 2002 VAT Return Form.
For the purpose of checking registered exports from the Czech Republic, the Czech Supreme Audit Office selected 3 SAD (16 items), the aggregate statistical value of which was CZK 1,274,822.-.
The Slovak Supreme Audit Office identified 3 corresponding import SADs (17 items), the aggregate statistical value of which was SK 1,724,321.-.
Applicable VAT was paid to the appropriate Slovak Tax Office.
3. A company dealing mainly in optical instruments had claimed an excessive VAT refund in 2002, which was CZK 4,136,000 - higher than the tax liability.
For the purpose of checking its business operations, the Czech Supreme Audit Office selected an export SAD (32 items), the aggregate statistical value of which was CZK 7,154,124.-.
The Slovak Supreme Audit Office identified a matching import SAD (12 items), the aggregate statistical value of which was SK 9,653,827.-.
Applicable VAT was paid to the appropriate Slovak Tax Office.
4. A company dealing, inter alia, in purchases of goods for the purpose of their subsequent sales had not shown any exports in its 2002 and 2003 VAT Return Forms.
According to the Czech Customs Database, the aggregate statistical value of the imports in 2002 was CZK 3,439,888.-.
The Czech Supreme Audit Office thus selected 5 export SAD s (5 items), the aggregate statistical value of which was CZK 669,839.-, for verification.
The Slovak Supreme Audit Office identified 5 matching import SADs (5 items), the aggregate statistical value of which was SK 1,012,656.-.
A check of the Slovak Supreme Audit Office at the appropriate Tax Office proved that the declared imports had indeed taken place and that VAT had been paid.
5. A company dealing, inter alia, in purchases of goods for the purpose of their subsequent sales and sales, manufacture, installation and repairs of electrical machines and instruments, had shown exports amounting to CZK 12,966,706.-in its 2002 VAT Return Forms.
According to the Czech Customs Database, the aggregate statistical value of the exports in 2002 was CZK 14,474,381.-.
The Czech Supreme Audit Office submitted 17 export SADs (59 items), the aggregate statistical value of which was CZK 2,975,122.-.
The Slovak Supreme Audit Office identified 13 SADs (50 items) in the Slovak Customs Database, the aggregate statistical value of which was SK 3,621,000.-.
It was not possible to find matching import SADs for 4 export SADs in the Slovak Customs Database, the aggregate statistical value of which was CZK 399,776.-.
The Slovak Tax Office of jurisdiction verified the imports at the taxpaying entity.
The taxpaying entity mentioned on the SADs as the importer to the Slovak Republic claimed that it had not imported the goods in question.
The Slovak Supreme Audit Office therefore asked the Tax Office of jurisdiction to perform a tax audit focused on VAT and income tax of legal entities for the fiscal years of 2002 and 2003.
6. According to the Czech Customs Database, a company dealing in imports and sales of cigarettes exported tobacco stamps valued at CZK 7.338,199.- in 2002 and CZK 12,228,545.- in 2003.
In its 2002 and 2003 VAT Return Forms, the company had not shown any exports.
The Czech Supreme Audit Office thus selected 5 export SADs (5 items), the aggregate statistical value of which was CZK2,471,598.-.
In the Slovak Customs Database, the Slovak Supreme Audit Office identified 7 matching SADs (7 items) in the aggregate statistical value of SK 2,919,514.-for 4 of the export SADs (4 items), the aggregate statistical value of which was CZK 2,246,860.-.
It was not possible to find a matching import SAD for one of the 5 export SADs (1 item) in the Slovak Customs Database, the statistical value of which was CZK 224,738.-.
7. A company dealing in software had not shown any exports in its 2002 and 2003 VAT Return Forms.
According to the Czech Customs Database, the aggregate statistical value of the exports in 2002 and 2003 was CZK 1,630,198.-.
The Czech Supreme Audit Office thus selected 9 SADs (9 items) for verification in the Slovak Republic, the aggregate statistical value of which was CZK 755,588.-.
In the Slovak Customs Database, the Slovak Supreme Audit Office identified 8 matching SADs (8 items) in the aggregate statistical value of SK 915,601.-.
It was not possible to find a matching import SAD for one of the 9 export SADs (1 item) in the Slovak Customs Database, the statistical value of which was CZK 68,286.-.
In the cases listed above, it was not possible to find matching imports to 6 export SADs, the aggregate statistical value of which was CZK 692,800.-, in the Slovak Customs Database.
Of these:
- It was not possible to find matching import SADs for 2 export SADs registered in the Czech Customs Database, the aggregate statistical value of which was CZK 293,024.-, in the Slovak Customs Database (see Paragraphs 6 and 7 above).
Because of some errors in entering data into the customs database, it was not possible to identify some registered import transactions, e.g. when the importer's name was missing or if there was a mistake in the Tax Identification Number (hereinafter „Tax ID").
Consequently, it is not possible to say with certainty that the import transactions had not actually taken place.
- For 4 export SADs from the Czech Customs Database, the aggregate statistical value of which was CZK 399,776., no matching imports were found and proven (see Paragraph 5 above).
In this case, there exists a suspicion of a fictitious export of goods for the purpose of placing an unjustifiable and illegal VAT refund claim.
5. Audit of Exports and Imports of Goods and Services at Selected Tax offices
5.1. Audit Sample
Folders of taxpaying entities were selected at Tax Offices being audited for the purpose of verifying whether taxpaying entities comply with their obligations with respect to exports and imports of goods and services, and assessing the cooperation between financial and customs authorities. The selection was based on the following criteria:
1. The criteria used to select taxpayers from the Czech and Slovak Customs Databases were as follows: a) Highest volume of imports, b) Highest assessed VAT, c) Highest volume of exports,
2. The criteria used to select taxpayers from records of Tax Offices were as follows: a) Amount of VAT refund claims related to imports, b) Excessive VAT refund claims, c) ExT refund claims, d) VAT exemption on exports,
3. Taxpaying entities that had undergone a tax audit.
The sample selection did not take into account the country of destination and was focused on risky commodities.
5.2. Audit Findings in the Czech Republic
A list of imports and exports of risky commodities to and from the Czech Republic in 2002 and 2003 is shown in the following table:
5.2.1. Audit of the Selected Sample at Tax Offices
In its audit of Tax Offices, the Czech Supreme Audit Office focused particularly on the following issues:
- Procedures employed by Tax Offices to check VAT values shown in VAT Return Forms,
- Cooperation between Tax Offices and customs authorities,
- A comparison of data from the Customs Database with that from the SAD databases of Tax Offices, focusing on a comparison of declared values, application of appropriate VAT rates (according to the Customs Tariff classification of the goods or service in question), and possibly also a comparison of data on SADs and accompanying invoices with that from the Customs Database,
- A comparison of data from VAT Return Forms pertaining to export- and import-related payments and goods with data in SAD databases at Tax Offices or in the Customs Database,
- The manner of verification of claims for VAT exemption with respect to exported goods or services,
- A comparison of the volumes of exported goods or services according to VAT Return Forms against corresponding data in the Customs Database.
The SAD databases at Tax Offices contained only records on import and export transactions in respect whereof the taxpayer was obliged to mention the transaction in the tax return form.
The audit carried out at the Tax Offices focused on files of taxpaying entities, whose 2002 and 2003 VAT Return Forms had shown imports in an aggregate value of CZK 60,396,379,000.-, and the corresponding VAT sum of CZK 12,644, 052,000.-.
Furthermore, files of taxpaying entities, whose 2002 and 2003 VAT Return Forms had shown exports in an aggregate value of CZK 47,323,111,000.-, were also audited.
According to the Czech Customs Database, the taxpayers subject to the audit of export and import transactions between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, had accomplished imports from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic in 2002 and 2003, whose aggregate VAT basis and VAT were CZK 3,759,352,000.-and CZK 767,607,000.-, respectively, and exports from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic in 2002 and 2003, whose aggregate statistical value was CZK 1,989,090,000.-.
The differences between records in SAD databases of Tax Offices and data from the Czech Customs Database were checked in the following manner:
- SAD items, which were missing in the Czech Customs Database, were requested directly at the General Directorate of Customs of the Czech Republic,
-As to SAD items, which were missing in the databases of Tax Offices, a check was made to verify and establish whether they had not been destroyed or cancelled,
— As to SAD items, in respect whereof differences between the Czech Customs Database and the databases of Tax Offices were found to exist, printouts of appropriate SADs, including invoices attached thereto, were requested from General Directorate of Customs of the Czech Republic.
The audit established, inter alia, that the SAD databases of Tax Offices did not contain, for example, records on import- and export-related related SADs corresponding to aggregate VAT values of CZK 3,622,000.- and CZK 9,359,000.-, respectively.
5.2.1.1. Differences Established by the Audit
A comparison of SAD databases at Tax Offices and cumulative tax liabilities in 2002 and 2003 according to VAT Return Forms of a selected sample of taxpaying entities identified the following differences:
The differences are attributable especially to:
- The time difference between the physical completion of the import transaction and the date of the refund claim with respect to the VAT assessed on the imported goods.
The taxpaying entity could lodge the VAT refund claim with respect to imported goods within 3 years from the end of the fiscal period in which the goods had been placed under the appropriate procedure; insofar as the temporary use procedure is concerned, within 3 years from the end of the fiscal period in which the procedure was terminated or ended.
- The time difference between the physical completion of the export transaction and the date on which the taxpaying entity received the relevant SAD.
The taxpaying entity was obliged to present data on accomplished export transactions exempted from VAT upon leaving the country in the VAT Return Form, at the earliest in the fiscal period in which the goods in question had left the country and subject to the taxpaying entity having received a tax document, i.e. the SAD.
- Non-compliance of taxpaying entities with their duties and obligations concerning reporting of import and export transactions in their VAT Return Forms.
In some cases, taxpaying entities had failed to report correct data on import and export transactions in their VAT Return Forms.
As taxpaying entities did not have to attach SAD lists to their VAT Return Forms, the possibility of checking and verifying VAT refund or VAT exemption claims by Tax Offices was rendered more difficult.
5.2.2. Cooperation of Tax and Customs Authorities
During the period covered by the audit, customs authorities had been making decisions to return or waive import or export duties and VAT.
Taxpaying entities were legally obliged to reduce their previous VAT refund claims by the amount returned by the Customs Office, and to do so in the tax return form pertaining to the fiscal period in which the tax had been returned.
There was not any legal standard whatsoever which would stipulate a procedure of sending information about changes in the amounts of duties and VAT from Customs Offices to Tax Offices.
It is true that some of the audited Tax Offices had been getting that information, but irregularly, or with a considerable delay, and only from some Customs Offices.
One of the audited Tax Offices had not been getting that information at all.
If the Tax Office did not receive the information on changes in the amounts of duties and VAT directly from the Customs Office, it did not have the data needed to check and verify compliance of taxpaying entities with their legal duties and obligations.
In 2002 and 2003, the aggregate amounts of VAT returned by Customs Offices were more than CZK 319 million and more than CZK 398 million, respectively.
Results of the audit pointed out at persisting shortfalls and deficiencies on the part of tax administrators, some system errors in cooperation between Tax Offices and customs authorities, and a failure of some taxpayers submitting VAT and ExT Return Forms to comply with their legal duties and obligations.
Insofar as the administration of VAT and ExT is concerned, the audit identified particularly the following shortfalls and deficiencies:
a) Insofar as cancellations of VAT registrations were concerned, the taxpayers' obligation to pay VAT on their business property that had been (or should have been) registered as of the day of the cancellation and in respect whereof the taxpayer had claimed a VAT refund had been checked only occasionally.
b) Tax Offices did not make full use of a possibility to conduct a tax audit and/or local investigation.
In some cases, this resulted in an inadequate verification of the eligibility or legality of VAT refund claims.
c) Official records and protocols on oral proceedings did not contain all information needed to corroborate the eligibility and legality of excessive VAT refund claims.
d) Tax Offices did not make sufficient and adequate checks of export and import transactions shown in VAT Return Forms.
5.3. Audit Findings in the Slovak Republic
5.3.1. Audit of the Selected Sample at Tax Offices
The Slovak Supreme Audit Office or the Tax Office carried out a tax audit covering the fiscal years 2002 and 2003 on the selected sample.
Having analyzed tax return forms and tax refund claims submitted by selected taxpayers, the Slovak Supreme Audit Office requested the Tax Office of jurisdiction to provide relevant SADs on export and import transactions, as well as invoices and documentary evidence of tax payments.
Next, the Slovak Supreme Audit Office checked whether the submitted SADs had been registered in the Customs Database of import and export transactions and whether all legal requirements and conditions applying to taxation of imported goods, refund of excessive VAT, tax exemption of exported goods and refund of ExT had been complied with.
The Slovak Supreme Audit Office carried out the audit at 10 Tax Offices to verify selected export and import transactions between the Czech and Slovak Republics, the structure, number of SAD items and aggregate statistical values are shown below:
The aggregate statistical value of audited import transactions was SK 856.2 million, i.e. 5.11 percent of the total value of selected commodities imported from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic.
The aggregate statistical value of audited export transactions involving selected commodities was SK 176 million, i.e. 6.87 percent of the total value of selected commodities exported from the Slovak Republic to the Czech Republic.
In addition, additional 618 transactions involving other goods (household appliances, packages, software) imported from EU countries to the Slovak Republic were also audited, the aggregate statistical value of which was SK 532.8 million.
5.3.2. Cooperation of Tax and Customs Authorities
The Slovak Supreme Audit Office identified discrepancies between data in the Slovak Customs Database and data contained in some of the audited VAT Return Forms, e.g.:
- 2 taxpaying entities (natural persons) stated that they had imported goods in the value of SK 1,589,261.-, on the basis of which they had claimed a VAT refund.
Following local investigations carried out at the instigation of the Slovak Supreme Audit Office, the two taxpayers could not provide any evidence supporting their refund claim (documents proving the import transactions and payment of VAT).
- Another taxpaying entity (a limited liability company) had declared an accepted taxable goods valued at SK 77,167,576 and exports of goods valued at SK 18,006,041, and claimed an excessive VAT refund of SK 17,157,101.-.
The 2003 VAT Return Forms indicate that the difference between the value of the purchased goods and the value of the exported goods, i.e. SK 59,161,535.-, which had been created in January 2003, was not made up for throughout the year.
In the cases described above, the Slovak Supreme Audit Office requested Tax Offices of jurisdiction to carry out a tax audit aimed at the excessive VAT refund claims.
- In yet another case, a taxpaying entity (a limited liability company) had stated exports of goods valued at SK 87,199.- in its January to June 2002 VAT Return Forms.
A check in the Slovak Customs Database showed that the total exports of the company during the period in question had amounted to SK 296,747.-.
The Tax Offices of jurisdiction carried out multiple local investigations in the seat of the company, establishing that its executive secretary (a British national) had left and that the company had vacated the leased premises without terminating the Lease Contract in August 2002.
During the audit conducted by the Slovak Supreme Audit Office, the tax administrator notified authorities involved in criminal investigations of a suspicion of a criminal act of tax evasion.
Based on results of the audit at selected Tax Offices, the Slovak Supreme Audit Office concludes that major problems in the exercise of administration and control of VAT and ExT occur predominantly in the following areas:
- The possibility to carry out a tax audit of problematic taxpayers, particularly those claiming excessive VAT refunds, has not been used often enough.
- Tax audit protocols did not contain a list of audited documents
- export and import SADs.
- Inadequate verification of export and import transactions in tax return forms,
- A lengthy decision-making process of tax administrators, in particular with respect to tax assessment proceedings, including forfeiture of the right to impose sanctions.
- Failure to comply with legal requirements and conditions when granting tax payment deferments.
- Failure to set off outstanding VAT payments against VAT refunds within the prescribed period of time.
- Inadequate use of all forms and means of collecting and exacting outstanding tax payments.
To remedy the deficiencies identified by the audit, the Slovak Supreme Audit Office has requested relevant Tax Offices to carry out a VAT audit, which should focus on eligibility and legality of excessive tax refund claims submitted by 14 taxpaying entities.
Measures to remedy the deficiencies identified by the audit have been adopted at all audited Tax Offices, and the Slovak Supreme Audit Office will monitor and check their implementation.
6. Conclusions
The international cooperation described herein has helped to verify business transactions between partners from both countries and has identified deficiencies and shortfalls in the registration of exports and imports.
In addition, the audits have identified persisting deficiencies in the compliance of VAT and ExT payers with their duties, in the work of Tax Offices, and in the system of cooperation and exchange of information between tax and customs authorities, which ultimately had an adverse impact on the efficiency and efficacy of tax audits.
Lessons learnt from the audit also indicate that Czech Tax Offices have at their disposal a tax information system, which also contains essential information on export and import transactions from the Czech Customs Database, while there is no similar system permitting an exchange of information on exports and imports of goods between customs and tax authorities in the Slovak Republic.
Because of different legislation and conditions existing in each of the countries, the procedure employed to audit the exercise of the administration of VAT and ExT was not identical.
The Czech Supreme Audit Office used information obtained from the Czech Customs Directorate and documents available at Tax Offices being audited, while the Slovak Supreme Audit Office verified business transactions on the basis of documents of taxpaying entities requested from Tax Offices.
In the event of discrepancies, it requested the Tax Office of jurisdiction to carry out a tax audit.
The parallel audits of VAT and ExT evaluated the situation in the administration of these taxes prior to the accession of both countries to the European Union and pointed out at the necessity of continuing cooperation in this field.
Mutual cooperation will continue to expand and grow deeper with respect to audits of Tax Offices in connection with the enactment of a new VAT Act.
One of the new duties required with respect to deliveries of goods to other member states of the European Union is the submission of a so-called summary report.
The report must be submitted by all VAT payers who have delivered goods to another EU member state and to an entity that is also a registered VAT payer in that state.
Tax administrators are obliged to enter data from the summary reports to the VIES system (VAT Information Exchange System), which can be accessed by tax administrators from EU member countries.
Tax Offices then can compare data from the VIES system with information presented in submitted VAT Return Forms.
The system is also used to verify the validity of Tax IDs of registered VAT payers, eligibility and legality of VAT exemption claims with respect to goods delivered to another EU member country, and to make sure that the goods have been subject to proper taxation.
The parallel audits have demonstrated the potential of cooperation between the Czech and Slovak Supreme Audit Offices.
Results of the audits will be compared against outputs of planned audits, which will focus, inter alia, on verifying the performance of the VIES system insofar as cases of tax evasion arising in connection with so-called „intra-Community deliveries".
In the light of the importance of VAT and ExT as budget revenues, audits must be primarily targeted to the monitoring and identification of risky areas, their ultimate objective being to minimize the room and potential of indirect tax dodging.

Audit no. 04/23 „State Property and Financial Means Allocated to Cover the Work of the Refugee Facilities Administration of the Ministry of Interior"
Audit no. 15/2004 „Audit of the Management of State Property and Finances Earmarked for the Provision of Asylum and Temporary Refuge to Foreigners in the Slovak Republic
1. Introduction
Population migration is a worldwide trend that has become an integral part of the present development stage of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic.
It is mainly caused by citizens fleeing from their country of origin or last place of permanent residence to escape persecution, in particular racial, religious, national and political persecution, and to escape military conflicts and ethnic cleansing.
Its objective is to obtain asylum and to integrate into society, primarily in one of the advanced democratic countries of Europe.
However, another major group is formed of foreigners whose reason for migration is poor economic and living conditions.
Migration is not a new phenomenon.
Specific principles for assisting refugees were laid down by the 1951 Geneva Convention and the New York Protocol of 1967 regarding the legal status of refugees. Signatory countries bound themselves to apply these principles in their foreign policy.
The Czech and Slovak Federative Republic ratified the New York Protocol in 1991 and the Geneva Convention in 1992.
Following the split of Czechoslovakia in 1993, both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic declared their position on the refugee issue by continuing to comply with the international documents they had signed up to; both states confirmed them by enshrining them in national legislation.
Both countries have also enshrined the provision of asylum in their constitutions.
The asylum process and related matters came under scrutiny in parallel audits performed by the Supreme Audit Office, Czech Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic. The results of both are contained in the joint final report.
Cooperation between the two countries' supreme audit offices took place on the basis of the „Treaty on Cooperation in Audit Work" (hereinafter the „Treaty") signed in April 2004.
In the Treaty the two sides undertook to inform each other about legislation governing asylum procedures in the state of the other party, selected statistical data regarding the number of asylum seekers and the results of the asylum process, as well as information on refugee facilities.
The purpose of the parallel audits was to identify common problems and to draw attention to the possible consequences for population migration.
The cooperation consisted in defining a uniform audit programme, exchanging information in the scope set out in the Treaty and in drawing up a joint final report on the audit results.
At the first meeting, which took place on 5-7 April 2004, common sets of audit topics and common audit preparatory procedures were defined.
At the second meeting on 28-30 June 2004, common (overlapping) points of the audit programme were specified.
At the third meeting on 8-10 November 2004, there was an exchange of experience from the ongoing audits.
The forms of outputs from the audits were finalised, and the preliminary structure and content of the joint final report defined. The report was drawn up on 14-17 February 2005 at the last joint session.
The audits were performed in parallel in the period from September 2004 to January 2005.
The audit in the Czech Republic was performed by auditors from the Defence and Security Department and from selected territorial departments.
The auditees were the Ministry of Interior of the Czech Republic (hereinafter „Mol CR") and are Refugee Facilities Administration of the Ministry of Interior (hereinafter „RFA").
In Slovak Republic the audit was performed by the Defence, Interior and State Offices Division.
The auditee was the Migration Office of the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter „MO").
The audited period covered 2001, 2002 and 2003 (hereinafter „period under scrutiny").
In some cases, the joint report also contains statistics from earlier periods.
2. Recapitulation of the audit results
2.1. Assessment of the audit work
The parallel audits covered the following areas: - The asylum process, - Refugee facilities, - Management of finances and state property, - The internal control system.
Experience and information exchange between the Supreme Audit Office Czech Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic took place during the preparation and execution of the audits.
This exchange made it possible to evaluate the submitted materials more rigorously and to analyse the reasons for the differences found in the way the asylum process is implemented.
That made it possible to concentrate on the key problems that influence the work of refugee facilities.
Ultimately, it had a positive effect on the quality of the audit.
2.2 Summary of the audit results
The harmonisation of asylum law in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic with European Union legislation was one issue covered by the assessment reports of the European commission on the two countries' readiness to join the EU.
The enactment of legislation on this matter continues even after both countries have joined the EU, with the goal of further harmonisation with EU law.
In 2001 the number of applicants seeking asylum in the Czech Republic rose sharply.
In the Slovak Republic the number of applicants has been growing constantly, with a major increase occurring in 2001.
Within the meaning of international treaties the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic provide financial and material assistance to asylum seekers.
The necessary finances for this purpose are earmarked in the state budgets of both countries.
The size of expenditure drawn from the state budgets in both countries is chiefly influenced by the number of applicants, the length of asylum proceedings leading to the award or non-award of asylum and the state of health of applicants.
The magnitude of certain selected benefits in the two countries is comparable.
The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic have established refugee facilities, in which they have gradually put in place suitable conditions for housing participants in asylum proceedings.
Throughout applicants' stay in the refugee facilities they are provided with accommodation, food, healthcare and basic material items and hygiene articles.
A, the same time, leisure-time educational courses are organised and applicants are given access to cultural and sporting activities.
Refugee facilities include reception centres and residential centres; the Czech Republic also has integration refugee centres.
The cost of one day spent in a facility depends on occupancy levels and the standard of fittings in the centre. Costs in the two countries are comparable.
The capacity of refugee facilities in the Czech Republic has essentially been stabilised.
In the Slovak Republic it is envisioned that capacity will be increased by almost 1000 extra places in the next two years.
The aim is to put in place suitable conditions for the expected increase in the number of applicants in the coming years in consequence of the Dublin Convention.
In the Czech Republic, most of the approved budgetary expenditure went towards the provision of services, mostly expenditure on providing accommodation and food for applicants in refugee facilities operated on a contractual basis, expenditure on healthcare provided to asylum seekers and the cost of having a full-time security service guarding the refugee facilities.
Spending on pay, payments for work done and insurance was also significant.
In the Slovak Republic, budgetary management regarding the implementation of migration policy and the asylum process was marked by a large quantity of budgetary measures adopted in response to justified requirements related to the increasing number of asylum seekers.
The spending of current expenditures consisted mainly in wages, salaries and insurance expenditures, material and service costs, as well as security service costs.
The results of the audits in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic drew attention to certain similar shortcomings that did not have a fundamental influence of financial management and the use of state property.
These mainly concerned the use of state budget finances contrary to the purpose defined by the state budget act, where investment in the technical amelioration of long-term tangible assets was paid for out of current expenditure.
Stocktaking errors and non-compliance with the chart of accounts also constituted breaches of the accounting act.
Further minor shortcomings were found in the management of state property in the Czech Republic, whereby it was let to another party without a contract.
Failing to comply with the deadline for reporting changes to data in the real estate register constituted a breach of the act on the real estate register; the act on refuse was violated when a party that was not authorised to manage waste was contracted to dispose of refuse.
Shortcomings were found in the Slovak Republic in the provision of inordinately high advance payments for the supply of electricity and natural gas, in public procurement and in the management of state property, where property records were insufficient and the manner in which surplus property was disposed of was not proved.
The internal control system in the Czech Republic and in the Slovak Republic was applied within the meaning of the binding legislation governing the performance of financial control.
No shortcomings were found in the submitted written documentation.
Despite the identified shortcomings, the supreme audit office Czech Republic and the supreme audit office of the Slovak Republic rate positively the procedure followed by the RFA and the MO in providing services to asylum seekers.
Based on the audit findings the Supreme Audit Office Czech Republic and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic state that despite the pronounced increase in the number of asylum seekers in recent years the relevant organisational units of both countries have handled the tasks associated with caring for asylum seekers satisfactorily.
The assessment shows that the system is functional and stable.
The audit results were discussed with the statutory representatives of the concerned organisational units of the state both in the Czech and Slovak Republic.
Based on the results of the audit we recommend making use of the positive methodological experiences gained from the audit in further joint audits as part of international cooperation between supreme audit institutions.
3. Legislative framework
In both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, asylum law is based on the 1951 Geneva Convention (The Treaty on the Legal Status of Refugees and the New York Protocol of 1967).
The first legislation was implemented by Act no. 498/1990 Coll., on refugees.
Since 1.1.2000 Act no. 325/1999 Coll., on asylum and amending Act no. 283/1991 Coll., on the Police of the Czech Republic, has been in force in the Czech Republic.
This Act has been amended five times in total (by Acts nos. 2/2002 Coll., 217/2002 Coll., 320/2002 Coll., 519/2002 Coll., and 222/2003 Coll.).
Two more amendments of Act no. 325/1999 Coll., on asylum, are in the legislative pipeline and the adoption of new amendments will be tied to European legislation.
When Act no. 325/1999 Coll., on asylum, was being drawn up, asylum was part of the 3rd pillar of the EU and documents covering asylum were political documents.
The endeavour in enacting this law was to make it as compatible as possible with EU law.
The shifting of asylum from the 3rd to the 1 st pillar was an important change for asylum policy in the EU - asylum law became part of community law on 1.5.1999 when the Treaty of Amsterdam entered into force.
This shift made it necessary to create suitable legislation, i.e. to create legal instruments of suitable binding force.
The compatibility of Czech asylum law with EU law has been covered by many assessment reports of the European Commission.
Key community regulations governing asylum were adopted shortly before or even after the Czech Republic joined the EU and the deadline for their transposition had not yet elapsed at the time of the audit by the Supreme Audit Office, Czech Republic.
Once they are incorporated into Czech law, the Czech Republic will be obliged to report to the European Commission on how it effected the transposition.
In the Slovak Republic the procedure to be followed by the state authorities in proceedings to award refugee status for and determine the duties of foreigners who have applied for refugee status or who have been provided with temporary refuge in the territory of the Slovak Republic was laid down, with effect from 1.1.1996, by Act of the National Assembly of the Slovak Republic no. 283/1005 Coll., on refugees.
Since 2003 the act on refugees has been superseded by Act no. 480/2002 Coll., on asylum and amending certain acts, in which Slovak law was harmonised with Council Directive 2001/55/EC of 20.7.2001, on minimum standards for giving temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons and on promoting a balance of efforts between Member States in receiving such persons and bearing the consequences thereof.
After two amendments of Act no. 480/2002 Coll., on asylum, in 2003 and 2004, a third amendment was passed at the beginning of 2005. This third amendment represents further harmonisation of Slovak law with EU legislation on migration and asylum.
The duty for asylum seekers to visit a Slovak language introductory course during their stay in an integration centre, the appointment of court guardians for foreign minors staying in the territory of the Slovak Republic without a legal representative, making it possible for applicants to enter into employment under certain defined circumstances are all significant features of the amendment.
The harmonisation of Slovak law with EU law on migration and the asylum process has been appraised in the European Commission's regular reports on readiness of the Slovak Republic to join the EU.
In 2002 the report drew attention to the MO's insufficient staffing in the light of the increased number of asylum seekers.
4. Asylum process
In the Czech Republic matters concerning refugees have come under the remit of the Mol since 1990.
With effect from 1.1.1996 the Mol set up the RFA in order to separate the exercise of stale administration in the asylum procedure, which is exercised via the Asylum and Migration Policy Department (AMPD) of the Mol, from the provision of services to asylum seekers.
The RFA's task is to handle, on behalf of the Mol, the provision of accommodation, catering, healthcare and other services to participants in asylum proceedings and those granted asylum.
In the Slovak Republic the key tasks in the asylum process are carried out by the MO with particular regard to the financing of and material provision for the asylum process in the scope set out by special regulations.
Priority tasks are matters related to decision-making on foreigners' asylum applications in the first stage of administrative proceedings and the comprehensive operation of refugee facilities in terms of accommodation, food, healthcare and financial and material provision for asylum seekers.
In addition, it prepares the concept of the state's migration policy.
The results achieved in the creation of an asylum system in the Slovak Republic in past years have been markedly influenced by its cooperation with and support from the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees („UNHCR").
One particular benefit was the office's financial involvement in renovating housing stock for asylum seekers.
The UNHCR has also co-financed social, cultural and sporting activities for asylum seekers.
4.1 Development of the number of asylum seekers and results of the asylum process
The following graph shows how the number of asylum seekers in the Czech Republic has developed.
There was a particularly pronounced increase in 2001 as a result of the Kosovo crisis; in 2003 there was an increased number of refugees from Chechnya.
Table 1 gives an overview of the results of asylum proceedings in the Czech Republic.
In the period under scrutiny asylum was awarded in a total of 394 cases; 83 of these were in 2001, 103 in 2002 and 208 and 2003.
Asylum was not awarded in 22 731 cases in the period under scrutiny; in 22 636 cases asylum proceedings were suspended.
The number of participants in proceedings as at 1.1. includes both persons who have not yet been issued with a decision and those who have not yet received an issued decision.
It also includes persons who have been excused for missing the deadline for appeals or for whom a prior decision was annulled and no new decision has yet been issued.
In the Slovak Republic the number of asylum seekers has been constantly on the rise.
If there were 96 asylum seekers registered in 1993, by 2003 the figure had climbed to 10 358.
There was a considerable increase in the number of applicants in 2001, with 8 131 new applicants registered, a rise of 423% compared to 2000, in which there were 1 556 applications for asylum.
Table 2 gives details of the results of asylum proceedings in Slovak Republic in the period under scrutiny.
Asylum was granted 49 times in total in the period under scrutiny; the number in individual years did not exceed 0.22% of the registered number of applicants.
Asylum was refused in 860 cases.
Asylum proceedings were suspended in a total 23 088 cases.
The majority of applicants voluntarily abandoned asylum proceedings before their conclusion by leaving asylum facilities without permission.
That accounted for over 82% of the total number of registered applicants in 2002 and over 94% in 2003.
The average length of stay in asylum facilities per applicant was 13 days in 2001, 18 days in 2002 and 19 days in 2003.
The information of MO also reveals that most applicants entering the asylum process in the Slovak Republic were economic migrants, who are not protected by the international treaties that the Slovak Republic signed up to.
These applicants are abusing the asylum system.
Applications for asylum based on economic reasons such as looking for a job or better living conditions are not grounds for granting asylum.
Under Section 12 (1) (a) of Act no. 480/2002 Coll., on asylum, such an application should be adjudged evidently groundless and should be ruled on within 30 days.
There are at present no internationally recognised principles for identifying economic migrants that would distinguish them from asylum seekers escaping persecution in their country of origin and that would speed up the asylum process.
In view of the above, it is fair to say that the Slovak Republic is a transit country for international migration; western European states continue to be the migrants' ultimate destination.
After joining the EU, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic acceded to the Dublin Convention attributing responsibility for assessing asylum applications submitted in one of the European Community member states.
The Convention prevents the submission of multiple applications for asylum in more than one EU state.
After positive identification in the EURODAC system applicants return to the country in which they first registered.
The Slovak Republic lies on the EU's outer borders; that means that application of the Dublin Convention may in the coming years result in an increase in the number of applicants, who require conditions enabling them to stay in Slovak Republic until the asylum decision is issued.
4.2 Spending of financial means
Within the meaning of international treaties and national legislation based thereon, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic are obliged to provide financial and material security to asylum seekers.
The state budgets of both countries set aside the necessary finances for this purpose.
The amount of money drawn from the state budget is influenced chiefly by the number of applicants, the length of asylum proceedings up to the official decision on the award of asylum and by applicants' state of health.
The growing number of persons entering the asylum process has a direct impact on increased spending of legally defined benefits for applicants, such as food expenses, pocket money, the expense of basic material provision, other material provision and other social allowances.
The magnitude of certain selected benefits is comparable in the two countries.
In the Czech Republic in the period under scrutiny, food allowance was CZK 58 per person per day, pocket money CZK 12 per person per day and CZK 6 for a child up to the age of 15.
The average cost of keeping one asylum seeker in a facility for one day was CZK 351 in 2001, CZK 383 in 2002 and CZK 345 in 2003.
Besides pocket money, asylum seekers accommodated in private outside refugee facilities may receive an allowance up to the subsistence minimum.
Section 84 of Ac, no. 325/1999 Coll., on asylum, as amended, awards municipalities the entitlement to an allowance to cover costs associated with refugee facilities in their territory.
The size of the allowance is fixed every year by government resolution, and amounted to CZK 7 per person per day of stay in the period under scrutiny.
At the same time, municipalities are entitled to an allowance to cover non-investment costs of elementary schools attended by asylum seekers.
The size of the allowance in the period under scrutiny was CZK 120 for every school-going asylum seeker on the condition that the person in question attended school for at least 10 days in the given month.
In the Slovak Republic food allowance was SKK 70 per person per day in the period under scrutiny; pocket money was SKK 12 per person per day and SKK 8 for a child aged up to 15.
The average cost of housing one asylum seeker in an refugee facility per day was SKK 442 in 2001, SKK 447 in 2002 and SKK 445 in 2003.
Under Act no. 480/2002 Coll. (SR), on asylum, municipalities with refugee facilities in their territory receive an allowance to cover part of the municipality's expenditure associated with establishing and running an refugee facility.
So far municipalities have only made partial use of the possibility of applying for the allowance, which is fixed at SKK 1 500 per bed per calendar year.
The national legislation in both countries lays down a 90-day deadline, from the start of asylum proceedings, in which a decision must be issued. In warranted cases this deadline may be extended.
The most common reason for asylum proceedings overstepping this deadline, which has an influence on state budget expenditure, is appeals lodged against rulings not to award asylum.
In the Czech Republic most official decisions are issued after a period of 90 to 180 days (31.54%).
The second greatest number of decisions is issued 90 days or less after the asylum application was lodged (17.61 %).
In total, 73% of asylum proceedings opened in 2001-2003 were officially ruled on a year or less after proceedings commenced.
92% of applications were officially ruled on two years of less after the start of proceedings.
In the Slovak Republic up to 90% of applicants not awarded asylum make use of their legal right to extend the deadline by lodging an appeal with a court, according to the MO SR.
In some cases the deadline was extended by over a year and court proceedings had no, been brought to a conclusion at the time of the audit.
The establishment of joint offices of the MO and the Frontier and Foreigners' Police Office of the Police Force in reception centres a, Adamov-Gbely, Opatovská Nová Ves and Liptovské Vlachy, which occurred during the audit on 1.10.2004, is expected to speed up asylum proceedings.
This move is expected to simplify procedures and cut the amount of time taken by proceedings between the two components of the asylum process.
5. Refugee facilities
The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic have established refugee facilities, in which they have, over time, put in place suitable conditions for providing services to the participants in asylum proceedings.
During asylum seekers' stays in refugee facilities they receive accommodation, food, healthcare, pocket money and basic material items and hygiene articles.
Leisure-time educational courses are organised and applicants are given access to cultural and sporting activities.
5.1 Refugee facilities in the Czech Republic
The RFA administers and operates refugee facilities and is responsible for managing state property in the complex is of the reception centre at Vysní Lhota, the Červený Újezd reception and residential centre, the residential centres at Bělá-Jezová, Zastávka u Brna, Kostelec nad Orlicí and Havířov, and the integration refugee centres at Jaroměř and Zastávka u Brna.
At the start of 2002 a reception centre was set up in the transit area of Prague Ruzyně Airport.
The RFA is also responsible for the operation of refugee facilities at Stráž pod Ralskem, Seč, Bruntál, Zbýšov and Kašava, which are operated by a legal entity under Section 60 (3) of Act no. 325/1999 Coll., on asylum.
The total accommodation capacity of the reception centres is 747 places and the total residential capacity of reception centres is 1 977 places.
Reception centres are closed facilities, which asylum seekers may not leave until the prescribed medical examinations and basic reception actions set out in Act no. 325/1999 Coll., on asylum, have been completed.
Violating the duty to remain in the reception centre is treated as a misdemeanour.
Residential centres, to which asylum seekers are sent from reception centres, serve to accommodate asylum seekers until the decision on their asylum application takes force in law.
If certain conditions are satisfied, asylum seekers may leave the residential centres, or possibly live in private accommodation.
At the reception and residential centres where they are registered, asylum seekers are entitled to free accommodation, food, other services and pocket money on condition that they undergo the actions necessary to ascertain their financial and property means and provided that these means are such that it would be wrongful to demand even partial payment for the set services.
Integration refugee centres are used for the temporary accommodation of persons who have been granted asylum.
Clients are put up in the centre on the basis of an accommodation contract, which is usually concluded for six months but include the option of extending them up to such time as it is possible to find suitable housing for them or they find their own housing under the state integration programme.
In integration refugee centres clients pay all the costs of accommodation and provide themselves with food on individual basis.
Persons awarded the status of refugee have the same rights and duties as Czech citizens and the same access to social insurance.
5.1.1 Cost of refugee facilities
The cost of putting up one person for one day was chosen as the best indicator for comparing refugee facilities.
This indicator is based on the actual number of persons who are actually provided with services by an refugee facility every day.
In Table 3 and the graph facilities run by the RFA are referred to as „own" and facilities run by legal entities under Section 80 of Act no. 325/1999 Coll., on asylum, as „contractual".
The cost of one day of stay in an own refugee facility run by the RFA falls as occupancy of the facility rises, as the fixed costs of running facilities are spread over more asylum seekers.
The total cost of providing services for asylum seekers increases proportionately with their increasing number.
In 2001 and 2003 occupancy levels at the RFA's own refugee facilities reached crisis levels.
At times in 2003 an extraordinary accommodation capacity in the form of residential containers (320 beds) was even used to cope with a capacity crisis in refugee facilities caused by the mass influx of asylum seekers of Chechen nationality from Poland.
Leasing of 80 residential and six sanitary containers secured this capacity.
Expenditure on one applicant per day of stay was then lower in these years.
However, it is not possible to maintain high occupancy levels at these facilities in the long term:
the risk of an unexpected influx of refugees, and the related demands for increased accommodation capacity, must be taken into account.
At the same time, when facilities are fully occupied it is not possible to perform certain repairs, maintenance work and investment.
Having contractually run refugee facilities makes it possible to respond flexibly to capacity requirements when necessary.
5.2 Refugee facilities in the Slovak Republic
Refugee facilities in Slovak Republic comprise reception centres and residential centres.
The MO administers reception centres at Adamov-Gbely, Rohovce, Opatovská Nová Ves and the Brezová pod Bradlom residential centre.
The reception centres' total capacity is 470 places; the residential centre has 100 places.
The MO responded to the growing number of asylum seekers by setting up a residential centre at Gabčíkovo in spaces leased from the Slovak Technical University in Bratislava, with a flexible available capacity of 250 to 940 places.
Under the contract the leaser also provides services associated with operation of the centre.
In this way the MO solved the problem of its own staff shortage.
A residential centre was also temporarily set up in 2002 and 2003 in leased premises at Jaziercie with a capacity of 160 places.
In the period under scrutiny, the occupancy rate of reception centres was on average from 57% to 62%; average occupancy in residential centres ranged from 33% to 50%.
Occupancy rates changed according to season, but the highest rates were in the last months of the year, when many more applicants applied for asylum than in the other months of the year.
Once the centres at Opatovská Nová Ves and Vlachy are refurbished they will offer a further 450 places.
The number of places available will rise by a further 550 when the centre at Humenné is completed.
5.2.1 Cost of refugee facilities
Data on the cost of running refugee facilities are given in Table 4.
Analysis of the data reveals that refugee facilities operated by a third party providing premises and managing the working of the facility, including all the associated activities, is one way of handling the tasks relating to accommodating asylum seekers in the Slovak Republic at a reasonable cost.
6. Management of finances and state property
6.1 Analysis of financial management
In 2001 in the Czech Republic, the RFA's approved budgetary expenditure was raised by thirteen budget measures by CZK 103 077 000.
Of this, CZK 89 979 000 (87.29%) were purpose-tied funds, mostly for responding to the consequences of the Kosovo crisis (CZK 44 538 000) and providing healthcare to asylum seekers (CZK 38 870 000).
In 2002 the RFA's expenditure was raised by twenty budget measures by CZK 88 362 000.
Of this, CZK 62,282,000 (70.48%) were purpose-tied funds, most of which (CZK 53 200 000) was for providing healthcare to asylum seekers.
In 2003 the RFA's expenditure was raised by a total of CZK 88 078 000 by fourteen budget measures.
CZK 82 000 000 of this (93.09%) were purpose-tied funds released from the General Treasury Administration.
CZK 51 000 000 was earmarked for healthcare provided to asylum seekers; CZK 24 000 000 for responding to the influx of Chechen refugees and CZK 7 000 000 for the programme of humanitarian airlifts of the handicapped from Iraq.
Table 5 shows selected items in the RFA's spending in the period under scrutiny.
The table shows clearly that most spending went on the provision of services.
Expenditure on services ranged from 37.07% to 38.23% of total expenditure.
Most expenditure on services was accounted for by expenditure on accommodation and food provision to the applicants of refugee facilities operated under contract, expenditure on healthcare provided to asylum seekers and the cost of having a constant security service guarding each refugee facility.
Spending on wages, salaries and insurance accounted for a considerable part of the RFA's total expenditure (23.99% - 24.97%).
Last but not least, purchases of material were another significant part of the RFA's total expenditure, with spending on foodstuffs the biggest individual item (7.61 % - 9.83% of total expenditure).
In the Slovak Republic the MO's budget management of funds to cover migration policy and the asylum process was marked by several budget measures that responded to justified demands related to the increasing number of asylum seekers.
In 2001 and 2002 in particular, proposed budgetary expenditure displayed an imbalance between the MO's demands, which were based on the increasing number of asylum seekers and the need to finance their statutory entitlements, and the provided resources, primarily in the main category of current expenditure.
The administrator of the budget chapter resolved the imbalance by means of several budget measures in the course of the year, which increased the current expenditure limit by 41.8% in 2001 and by as much as 71.7% in 2002.
Outline of selected MO expenditures in the period under scrutiny is given in Table 6.
Spending on wages, salaries and insurance formed a major part of current expenditure, ranging from 24.47% to 30.51% of total expenditure, and spending on material and services, ranging from 21.04% to 38.82%.
The cost of security services accounted for more than 10% and purchases of foodstuffs 3.92% to 7.20%.
Spending on accommodation and catering services took up another major portion of expenditure, ranging from 10.82% to 26.96%.
Capital expenditure is a relatively minor item, accounting for 1.03% to 6.25% of total expenditure.
6.2 Identified shortcomings
The results of the audits in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic highlighted certain similar shortcomings that did not have a fundamental influence on the management of finances and state property.
The following were the main shortcomings: a) Using state budget finances contrary to the purpose for which they were defined in the state budget act, where investments constituting technical amelioration of long-term fixed assets were paid for out of current expenditure; b) Breaches of the act on accounting regarding stocktaking and non-compliance with the chart of accounts.
In the Czech Republic minor shortcomings were identified in the use of state property, where a third party was allowed to use state property without the necessary contract; failure to abide by the deadline for reporting changes to database in the real estate register constituted a breach of the act on the real estate register; assigning refuse disposal to a party not authorised to do so constituted a breach of the act on refuse.
In the Slovak Republic shortcomings were found in the provision of inordinately high advance payments for supply of electricity and natural gas; shortcomings in public documents and in management of state property, where insufficient records were kept and the means of disposal of surplus property was not proved.
7. Internal control system
In the Czech Republic an internal control system was established in the RFA on 1.7.2002 within the meaning of Act no. 320/2001 Coll., on financial control, setting out the powers of individual employees responsible for the performance of ex ante, interim and ex post control.
At the same time, a system of internal audit was introduced and an internal auditor for the RFA was appointed.
Every year the RFA issues the plan of financial, social and operational controls, the purpose of which is to scrutinise the management of finances and state property in individual refugee facilities administered by the RFA.
42 controls were performed in 2002 and 54 in 2003.
In the Slovak Republic direct control of compliance with the law and internal regulations in the departments and organisations of the Ministry of the Interior of the Slovak Republic is performed by the Control Office of the Minister.
No control of the performance of tasks in the area of asylum policy was performed in the period under scrutiny.
The MO's internal control system is mainly designed to carry out ex ante and interim financial control pursuant to Act no. 502/2001 Coll. (SR), on financial control and internal audit.
The performance of financial control is also governed by internal regulations of the director of the MO.
Substantive control, as part of the management of individual units, was specified in the annual plan of the MO.
Department directors were made responsible for the performance of control in this area.
According to the submitted written documentation no shortcomings were detected.
Since Regulation of the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic no. 28 of 23.4.2004 took effect, the MO has been obliged to deal with and investigate complaints according to the act on complaints.
In the immediate future it will be necessary to finalise how this task will be organised and dealt with.

Joint Report on Parallel Audits of Expenditure on the Construction of the Motorway Prague – Dresden
Background
Without the trans-European motorway networks the high traffic volumes between the member states in modern, united Europe would be subject to considerable constraints and losses in quality.
High-quality transport networks are essential for maintaining and raising Europeans’ standard of living.
Putting in place the right conditions for fast, safe, reliable and efficient passenger and freight transport is an important government task.
Performing this task is a highly demanding exercise in organisational, technical and financial terms.
When putting into place and extending a sustainable European transport infrastructure system, decision-makers often have to reach difficult compromises with European and national policy interests, for example, in preserving the environment.
Building transport infrastructure is expensive, especially owing to the environmental protection measures that are required.
Carefully considered action and decision-making by government departments when preparing and procuring transport construction may bring significant savings of public funds that can be channelled into other beneficial uses.
One of the tasks of audit institutions is to identify shortcomings that prevent ensuring the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of expenditure on the construction of transport infrastructure.
Audit institutions should not merely draw government departments’ attention to the shortcomings identified; they should also recommend measures designed to improve the state of affairs, to the benefit of citizens and to the benefit of Europe.
Summary
In 2005 and 2006, the two supreme audit institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic, the Bundesrechnungshof (BRH) and the Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad (NKÚ) conducted parallel audits of expenditure on the construction of the motorway Prague – Dresden (D 8 motorway in the Czech Republic and the A 17 motorway in the Federal Republic of Germany).
The motorways are connected by a border bridge co-financed by the two countries.
By working together with the NKÚ, the BRH was able to audit in depth the efficiency of the funds used for building the border bridge.
As a result of working closely with the BRH the NKÚ was furnished for comparative purposes with the necessary data of German cost levels of bridges and tunnels.
In the year 2000 the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany concluded a treaty on building a border bridge.
In accordance with the construction progress, the completion date was finally scheduled for the end of 2006.
During the public procurement process, however, the Roads and Motorways Directorate of the Czech Republic (hereinafter “RMD”) committed errors that led to the tender being prolonged and time for construction shortened.
The contract with the contractor was therefore signed later than envisaged.
The contractor agreed to build the bridge in a shorter time and ensure completion in 2006.
As a result, the RMD had to accept a considerable increase in the price of the bridge.
As part of the joint audit effort motorway bridges on the D 8 and A 17 were compared based on the prices per square metre of area of the bridge structure.
The statistical analysis of prices made it possible to identify bridges that came at a high cost per square metre.
This analysis revealed that the border bridge was the most expensive bridge as compared to other large bridges having a length of over 100 metres.
The price increase could also be attributed to the delays occurred in the tender procedure.
When auditors analysed the costs of tunnel structures they found that the prices of tunnels are considerably higher on the D 8 motorway than the prices of comparable tunnels in Germany.
The BRH and NKÚ now possess a database of prices for bridges and tunnels on which they can rely in future audit missions into the efficiency of the funds used for transport infrastructure purposes.
Concerning the construction of bridges the two audit institutions recommend the following: standardising bridge constructions and using composite steel-concrete and special structures only if prestressed steelconcrete bridges are not adequate.
The main features of the cooperation were teamwork and informality.
Throughout the parallel audit, the auditors shared their specific knowledge and skills.
Introduction
This report informs about the conduct and the results of parallel audit missions regarding the funds spent on the construction of the motorway connecting Dresden and Prague (D 8 in the Czech Republic and the A 17 in Germany).
The audit missions focused on the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the expenditure occurred.
The parallel audits were performed by the BRH in Germany and NKÚ in the Czech Republic.
The parallel audit work was conducted in the years 2005 and 2006.
The NKÚ scrutinised the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of approximately CZK 20 billion incl. VAT in expenditure (approx. € 690 million) on the border section of the D 8 motorway, which is numbered 0807.
Out of this amount € 64 million were planned to be used from European funds (ISPA).
Apart from the parallel audit work undertaken conjunctively with the NKÚ the BRH had audited the planning and construction of motorway A 17 in the years 2003 and 2005.
The funds used for building all three sections of the A 17 motorway amounted to some € 670 million, where € 277 million will be co-financed by European funds (EFRE).
The motorway from Prague to Dresden is part of the Dresden – Central Eastern and South Eastern Europe – Istanbul Pan-European Transport Corridor IV.
The D 8 runs from Prague to the state frontier via Usti nad Labem.
The A 17 runs from the Czech/German border to Dresden.
At the time of audit, the frontier sections of both motorways were under construction.
These sections have been opened on December 21, 2006.
While on the German side the motorway is completed up to Dresden, on the Czech side, the D 8 is not completed, because section No. 0805 at a length of 16.4 km through the Central Bohemian Highlands between Rehlovice and ovosice is still in the preparatory phase.
The stretch 0805 between Prague and Ústí nad abem is planned to pass through the Protected Countryside Area in the Central Bohemian Highlands.
According to forecasts performed in the Czech Republic in 2001, traffic volume on the border section No. 0807 of the D 8 motorway should be 22 940 vehicles per day in 2008.
According to German forecasts traffic volumes at the Czech border will total some 25 000 vehicles per day in the year 2010.
In the year 2000, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Czech Republic signed a Treaty on connecting German Motorway A 17 and Czech Motorway D 8 on the common state frontiers by constructing a border bridge.
Since the two states participated in building the bridge; examining the construction of the individual bridge was therefore an important aspect of parallel audit missions by the two audit institutions.
Cooperation between BRH and NKÚ
From mid 2005, the two supreme audit institutions discussed to work closely in auditing the construction of the motorway connecting Prague and Dresden.
Both sides had important reasons for this cooperation:
1.
Germany co-finances the construction of the border bridge.
Planning and construction are incumbent on the Czech road construction administration.
Therefore, the BRH had no possibility of auditing this construction project itself.
2.
The NKÚ did not have a comparative database needed for assessing whether the funds were used economically regarding the overall cost level of bridges and tunnels on the D 8.
3.
The NKÚ needed to examine the effectiveness of expenditure by looking at the motorway’s principal technical parameters, and particularly the arrangement of bridges and tunnels that were meant to provide the same level of quality of use on both sides of the border.
After preparatory negotiations, an Agreement on the Coordinated Audit of the D 8/A 17 Motorway was signed on January 4, 2006 by the presidents of the two supreme audit institutions.
Joint working meetings between BRH and NKÚ auditors took place throughout 2006 at roughly six to eight week intervals.
The meetings addressed current problems and tasks, in particular the preparation of a uniform methodology for auditing the prices of bridges and tunnels, information exchange regarding findings arising from the audit of the construction of the border bridge and the preparation of joint reports.
A significant feature of the cooperation was the continuous sharing of information.
While the BRH did most of the comparative work on the technical parameters of bridges and tunnels and the contracting procedures, the NKÚ prepared most of the methodology for scrutinising the prices of bridges and tunnels.
In accordance with applicable relevant government audit legislation in the two countries, there are differences in the manner of concluding audit missions in Germany and Czech Republic.
For this reason, the two supreme audit institutions drew up each a separate national report on its audit findings produced.
The present report reflects the results achieved in the parallel audit missions.
The cooperation will be ended by the signing of a final communiqué in the first half of 2007.
Construction of the border bridge
In the Treaty as of the year 2000, the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany agreed on a deadline for completing the border bridge, according to their capabilities, in 2005.
They both agreed to postpone this deadline to the end of 2006.
The RMD acted as investor.
Germany co-finances the construction of the bridge by 42.13 %.
In the period up to 1999, RMD had proposed that the border bridge should have a prestressed steel-concrete structure.
In 1999 by agreement with its partners in Germany RMD approved a composite steel-concrete structure.
They justified this decision by referring to the reduction of pillar pairs from seven to five and the resulting ecological benefit for the valley.
In addition, a comparative calculation done by RMD stated that the composite steel-concrete structure would be the less costly option.
But there was an error in the calculation.
The calculation stated that the new composite steel-concrete structure would be only 397 m long.
In fact, it is 5% longer.
RMD committed grave errors in the public procurement procedure.
RMD failed to prepare tender documents adequately describing both assessment criteria and sub-criteria used for comparing the bids.
This error resulted in subjective and ambiguous assessment by the bids evaluation commission and the managing director respectively.
A non-successful bidder contested the results of the tender procedure.
The subsequent inquiry by the Office for the Protection of Competition caused the bridge construction contract to be signed later than originally anticipated.
That meant that 2004 year summer building season after bid evaluation was lost, and the time for construction of the bridge was shortened.
The constructor agreed to build the bridge in a shorter time, but this involved a substantial price increase.
The steps offered included dual assembly of the bridge superstructures, a change in the pillar design and erecting an assembly facility.
In addition, the constructor was unable to obtain the originally proposed type of steel in the time required.
The new type of steel – at a higher cost of some € 4 million borne fully by RMD – made it possible to shorten the time for performing anti-corrosion protection, which subsequently made it possible to cut the overall time needed to build the border bridge.
Compared to the price offered in the bid of some € 18.3 million net, as a result of the accelerated procedure and further funding adjustments, the total cost of the border bridge will rise considerably.
Shortened time for works resulted in price increase in the range of some € 5.9 million.
Currently net costs amount to some € 25.9 million not considering price escalation (as of October 2006).
Comparison of the prices of bridges and tunnels
The two supreme audit institutions analysed the prices of bridges on the D 8 and A 17 in order to identify bridges whose price was excessively high, and compare the prices of bridges on the German and Czech sides.
The analysis relied on arithmetical statistics.
Tunnels on the D 8 were also compared with equivalent tunnels on motorways (A 71, A 38 and A 4) in Germany;
there were no similar tunnels on the A 17 motorway.
In preparing this part of the audit, it was important to identify relevant prices accurately.
The main principles determined by the two supreme audit institutions for comparing the prices of bridges included the following: to rely on the actual price paid for the bridge without value added tax (VAT rates in the Czech Republic and Germany differ and are subject to change); not to consider prices for special bridge foundations; to convert prices in CZK into € using the European Central Bank rate applicable on 30.12.2005 (CZK 29 = € 1).
Bridges of various construction types (such as steel concrete, prestressed steel-concrete, composite steel-concrete and steel) and various sizes are found on both the D 8 and A 17.
In an effort to homogenise the reviewed bridge constructions, the bridges were divided into categories based on construction type.
Within these categories the bridge size was also taken into account in the analyses.
Concrete bridges were by far the most common type of construction on both sides of the border (20 bridges on the D 8 and 36 bridges on the A 17).
The analysis focused chiefly on this category of bridge, as the large size of the sample made it possible to use arithmetical statistics and improved the reliability of results.
Audit work revealed that the prices per m2 of concrete bridges on the D 8 and A 17 depend on the bridge size (its length, area): the bigger the bridge, the lower the price per m 2 of the bridge.
The correlation between price and size is stronger for German bridges than Czech bridges (see graphs below).
Two concrete bridges were identified on the A 17 and four on the D 8 whose price is markedly higher.
These bridges were identified partly by a method enabling the ascertainment of atypical values in a set of numbers and partly by regressive analysis taking into account the correlation between the bridge price and its size (distance above the regressive curve is a key to identifying atypically expensive bridges).
Information about the atypically high price of the said bridges should, however, be regarded merely as an indicator as to which bridges to focus on.
In order to be able to make a generally applicable conclusion the causes of the high price would have to be analysed in each identified case.
One reason may be inefficient administrative action but it may also have been caused by environmental protection requirements or any other acceptable reasons.
Given that the Czech concrete bridges are on average longer than the German ones (see table below), the proven negative correlation between the bridge price and length might lead one to expect that they would be cheaper.
The hypothesis about the lower cost of Czech concrete bridges is also supported by the lower cost of labour in the construction industry in the Czech Republic than in Germany.
The results of the analysis, however, indicate that the price of concrete bridges on the D 8 is higher than on the A 17.
Two possible reasons for this state of affairs were identified during joint meetings.
1.
In Germany most bridges are procured as independent projects.
That makes it possible for small and medium-sized regional firms to take part in the tender.
In the Czech Republic many bridges are procured as part of a contract for a part of motorway route that is several kilometres long.
Small and medium-sized firms do not take part in this kind of tender, as the job is too big for them.
2.
There is greater variety in bridge structures used in the Czech Republic than in Germany.
In this context the NKÚ found that the type of bridge structure is decided long before it is built.
The decision is made during the time when the RMD submits the zoning decision application.
At this time the RMD selects bridge types from several alternatives, but economy plays only a minor role in decision-making.
A general conclusion regarding bridge prices in the Czech Republic and Germany would only be possible on the basis of a thorough analysis of the building work market in both countries; that would have been beyond the scope of this audit, however.
The border bridge is the most expensive composite steel-concrete bridge on the D 8 and A 17.
In the case of tunnels it was found that tunnels on the D 8 cost twice as much as tunnels in Germany.
Yet a comparison of the principal technical construction parameters of tunnels on the D 8 and tunnels in Germany revealed no fundamental difference.
The considerable price differences could be attributed to the fact that in the Czech Republic, there is no real competition in the tunnel building sector.
Nevertheless, the low number of tunnels made it impossible to reach generally applicable conclusions.
Effectiveness and efficiency of the motorway Dresden – Prague
The independent Czech Republic was established in 1993.
In the same year, the government approved the concept of motorway network development.
The D 8 was to be extended step by step from Prague towards the state frontier to Germany.
Section No. 0805 through the Central Bohemian Highlands was to be built before the border section No. 0807.
The Czech Republic is building the D 8 under programme financing.
Two objectives of the construction of the D 8 are defined in programme No. 327 220 “Construction of the D 8 Motorway, Prague – Usti nad Labem – Czech/ German State Frontier”:
1.
improve the connection between Prague and Usti nad Labem – national objective;
2.
improve the connection between Prague and Berlin as part of the Berlin-Istanbul Pan-European Transport Corridor IV – international objective.
According to the programme, construction of the section leading through the Central Bohemian Highlands was scheduled for completion in June 2008 and construction of the border section No. 0807 for June 2007.
It should be noted that the deadline for completing the construction is not identical with the deadline for putting into operation.
The NKÚ ascertained that the preparatory work for the construction of the section leading through the Central Bohemian Highlands is currently in the official zoning decision stage.
Ecological activists have contested this decision with legal actions.
A definitive ruling on the actions is pending.
It therefore cannot be ruled out that the section leading through the Central Bohemian Highlands will be completed several years later than stated in the programme documentation.
During summer 2006 the Czech Ministry of Transport proposed postponing the term of completing of section No. 0805 up to year 2010.
As a result of these circumstances, construction of the border section did not achieve the national goal of improving the connection between Prague and Usti nad Labem.
The RMD performed a capital expenditure appraisal of the border section of the D 8 No. 0807 and of section No. 0805 via the Central Bohemian Highlands in the years 1999 – 2001.
The investment cost included in this capital expenditure appraisal amounts to some € 639 million together for both sections No. 0805 and No. 0807.
Table 2: Results of the economic assessment (EIRR=economic internal return rate)
All planned motorways and highspeed roads open, both sections of the D 8 open in 2007.
Traffic volume on the northern part of the border section of 18 000 vehicles per day in 2010.
All planned motorways and highspeed roads open, both sections of the D 8 open in 2007.
Traffic volume on the northern part of the border section of 22.000 vehicles per day in 2010.
All planned motorways and highspeed roads open, both sections of the D 8 open in 2007.
Traffic volume on the northern part of the border section of 25 000 vehicles per day in 2010.
The economic analysis performed in 2001 relied on the assumption that the section near the frontier and the Central Bohemian Highlands section would both be finished at the time.
At the time of audit it is clear that the Central Bohemian Highlands section will not be opened by the original deadline.
That will reduce the aforementioned EIRR values.
The ex VAT costs of both sections specified as of 31.12.2005 were € 897 million, i.e. 27.4% higher than the cost level applied in the economic analysis in 2001.
There is a risk, however, that section No. 0805 will follow a different, more expensive route, which would impact on the aforementioned economic viability level.
As a result of the economic analysis, the construction of both motorway sections is economically viable at a traffic volume of at least 18 000 vehicles per day in 2010.
The forecast for 2008 indicated 22 940 vehicles per day but a study addressing the issue of detour routes in place of the missing section through the Central Bohemian Highlands reckons with a traffic volume in year 2007 of 12 600 to 13 750 vehicles per day, which puts the investment below the economic viability threshold.
A higher traffic load on the detour routes in place of the lacking Central Bohemian Highlands section gives rise to a high probability of congestion and thus also increased external costs that were not taken into account during the original economic analysis.
The aforementioned reduction in revenues and increase in costs means that the already low EIRR the construction of the D 8 border section was supposed to have will not be attained.
Proto je stavba příhraničního úseku D 8 neefektivní.
When building the A 17 motorway, cost overruns also occurred similarly to those of the two above sections of the D 8.
As part of the overall economic assessment for the 1992 federal long distance road plan, the German Federal Ministry for Transport assumed a cost of some € 320 million.
The resulting cost benefit ratio was 4.6.
In the meantime, costs have soared to some € 670 million reducing the cost benefit ratio by more than half.
Apart from the parallel audit work undertaken conjunctively with the NKÚ the BRH had audited the planning and construction of motorway A 17 in the years 2003 and 2005.
When doing so the BRH found that the relevant authorising states body demanded a landscape tunnel for the third section of the A 17 that was not needed.
During the course of audit work, the BRH succeeded in convincing the Federal Ministry and the German road works administration that the tunnel was not necessary.
As a result savings were made that accounted for single building cost of some € 10 million and € 0.15 million of annual operating costs.
When examining the first section of the A 17 the BRH found that the building project had not been adequately prepared.
This is illustrated by the following example:
At the planning stage, the road works administration failed to do a survey on the condition of the bedrock at the Dölzschen rock, since it was not easily accessible.
Only after the tunnel driving machine reached the rock they made up for it.
The tests showed that the interior rock was weathered to a higher extent than expected at the time of tendering.
This resulted in costly measures such as anchoring, injections and protection nets against rockfall that amounted to some € 3.3 million.
The road work administration had to bear the costs not only for additional extra operations such as the safety measures at the Dölzschen rock but also measures that would not have been needed if the building project had been adequately prepared in the first place.
Such expenditures include cost for disrupted building operations (€ 3.2 million), additional training for drilling staff (€ 0.5 million) and soaring wages and expenses on goods as a result of time overruns for the project (€ 7 million).
Thus excess costs amounted to some € 10.7 million that were not matched by any additional value.
On the basis of the lessons learnt from this project and other projects audited the BRH demanded the Federal Ministry to take more rigorous leadership regarding its oversight over road works.
In this context, the Federal Ministry should provide the necessary momentum for road works administrations to introduce quality assurance systems.
Benefits of cooperation for the BRH and the NKÚ The cooperation achieved the objectives of both audit institutions.
The BRH now has audit findings on the preparation, contract public procurement procedure and course of the construction of the border bridge.
The two supreme audit institutions developed a database of the prices of bridges and tunnels that can be relied on in future audits.
The NKÚ found that the main technical construction parameters of bridges, tunnels and the route of the D 8 motorway are no different from the A 17 parameters.
Auditors of both institutions taking part in the cooperation gained new experiences that can be put to use in future audits.

Coordinated audit of the funds earmarked for the funding of projects implemented within the Operational Programme Cross-Border Cooperation the Czech Republic – Poland 2007–2013
INTRODUCTION
The developing union of people of Europe is the driving force behind the cross-border cooperation as a part of broader territorial cooperation that has been with us for more than 20 years by now.
Let it provide itself the introduction into this joint report of supreme audit institutions of two close countries:
“185 million EU citizens, or 37% of the population, live in border areas.
These are often peripheral, underdeveloped or marginalised areas- sometimes the borders are historical scars.
The main aim of cross-border cooperation is to reduce the effect of borders as administrative, legal and physical barriers, tackle common problems and exploit untapped potential.
The programmes cover a variety of border regions: some work with maritime areas, others with internal EU land borders or borders shared with candidate countries.
Most programmes are bilateral, but some consist of more than two neighbouring countries (e.g. South Baltic programme).
The programmes last for seven years. It should be noted that there is EUR 5.7 billion in total earmarked for all programmes in this period.
“The programme activities include: Repairing and (re)building cross-border roads, cycle paths or bridges; Investing in cross-border waste systems, medical equipment, research centres, anti-flood measures, and so on; Managing jointly natural or tourism sites; Developing common services for the local population; Advising on employment issues; and Creating thematic networks and clusters for innovation.
The funding is granted on condition that organisations from both sides of the border, such as regional authorities, universities and small and medium enterprises, come together to implement projects based on the needs of the border region.
Representatives of cooperating regions, thematic ministries and other local partners meet regularly and decide which projects are going to be supported.
This unique structure is supposed to lead to sustainable collaboration that continues long after the programme ends.
The funding is granted on condition that partners from both sides of the border work together and fulfil at least two of the following conditions: common financing, common staffing, common preparation and common implementation of the project.”
Within the partnership framework, the tasks and responsibility for preparation, implementation, financing and control of project activities are clearly defined and distributed among the respective partners.
The following are main attributes: joint selection of leading partner; joint preparation of project and applications; making of joint agreement of partnership signed by all partners; overtaking of complete responsibility for project implementation by leading partner; total support payments received by leading partner who completes their transfer to respective project partners.
The support can be granted to eligible projects implemented in the regions and voivodeships adjacent to the joint border.
AUDIT OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE
On 11 December 2007 the European Commission approved the Operational Programme Cross-Border Cooperation the Czech Republic – Poland 2007–2013 (OP CBC CZ-PL).
EUR 258 187 467 was allocated for the implementation of the Operational Programme.
This amount included the contribution of EU funds (ERDF funds) in the total amount of EUR 219 459 344 (85%) which must be settled by the end of 2015.
Financial data related to the drawdown of EU resources from the Programme as of the end of the year 2013 are presented in the following table:
The Agreement of Cooperation between the Czech Supreme Audit Office (NKU) and the Supreme Audit Office of Poland (NIK) was signed on 27 February 2013 after previous deliberations at the meeting of the heads of the supreme audit institutions of Visegrád countries, Austria and Slovenia in Lovasberény in Hungary in September 2012.
The objective of the cooperation was to verify whether the OP CBC CZ-PL is being implemented in accordance with legal regulations and with obligatory programme documents or agreements, the management and control system is reliable, the objectives of the Operational Programme are reached, and selected projects are implemented in accordance with the obligatory criteria set in the grant agreements or decisions.
The cooperation took the form of a parallel audit during which the supreme audit institutions, in compliance with their mandate, verified independently the topics which were previously discussed by both sides.
It had a character of compliance audit focusing on the implementation of OP CBC CZ-PL.
The completed audit had also elements of performance audit.
The selected topics were verified on the sample of projects at the project partners on both sides of the border.
The results of the executed audits were audit reports published independently by both institutions in regular manner.
This joint report was prepared on the basis of these audit reports.
The selected joint audit sample included six projects (see attachment 1) which fall under the intervention area 1.1 – Strengthening of transport accessibility and intervention area 2.2 – Tourism development support.
Prior to the beginning of the audit, the drawdown of the financial resources from these two areas of support represented more than 60% of financial resources paid out to beneficiaries until the end of the year 2012 from the ERDF for all implemented projects within the OP CBC CZ-PL.
In total, amounts of EUR 39 748 636 and EUR 42 714 548 were paid out in the intervention areas 1.1 and 2.2, respectively.
Apart from the audit of a common sample of six projects, the NKU conducted audits of 13 other projects and NIK audits of two additional projects (all of them in areas 1.1 and 2.2).
The financial means paid to beneficiaries from the ERDF that were audited by NKU and NIK amounted to EUR 25 362 174 and EUR 8 450 784, respectively.
The audited amount represented 41% of the financial means paid to the beneficiaries in the intervention areas 1.1 and 2.2.
THE MAIN AUDIT CONCLUSION
Both audits carried out by the NKU on the Czech side and by the NIK on the Polish side of the border have shown that the level of identified irregularities did not exceed the materiality threshold.
The implementation of the OP CBC CZ-PL, including the management and control system performance and the realization of selected projects, was successful.
Actions taken by the audited entities established within the management and control system, limited the risk of improper expenditure of funds, as well as the possibility of failure to utilise the available ERDF funds.
What indicates the effectiveness of the operations carried out within the Operational Programme is a high level of achievement of the results, which was also confirmed by the social evaluation of projects´ completion.
SUMMARY OF THE AUDIT RESULTS
A. Assessment of the management and control system
The coordinated approach allowed carrying out an audit of the management and control system of OP CBC CZ-PL implemented by institutions of both countries: Managing Authority (Ministry of Regional Development of the Czech Republic), National Coordinator (Ministry of Regional Development of Poland), Comptrollers (Centre for Regional Development and Voivodes).
The audit also allowed for evaluation of tasks and functions performed by the Joint Technical Secretariat and the Monitoring Committee.
During the assessment of the management system, the focus was on the set-up and performance of the Managing Authority and National Coordinator functions, particularly on the programme objectives set-up and monitoring of the progress, evaluation and annual reports, assessment, review, selection and authorisation of project applications, Operational Programme resources drawdown, publishing of correct, complete and up-to-date information about grants, on the control activity of the Managing Authority, set-up and performance of commissioned audit entity, on the management and reporting of irregularities and coordination of tasks and cooperation between institutions taking part in the Operational Programme.
Furthermore, the activity of the respective authorities was audited in the area of risk analysis and the control plan design related to the on-the-spot checks. The evaluations of project applications carried out by independent experts were also scrutinised.
The audit of the control system included verification of on-the-spot and administrative checks which enabled confirmation of e.g. the products delivery and co-financed services, eligibility of the expenditure declared for reimbursement, as well as the compliance of such expenditure and related operations (or their parts) with EU and national regulations.
The NKU found significant shortcomings in the area of publishing correct, complete and up-to-date information about provided grants.
In the area of projects assessment and authorisation, the risk to the transparency of the process was identified.
Further shortcomings were found in the area of monitoring indicators set-up and in the set-up of system for reporting irregularities.
Based on the findings, the NKU evaluated the management and control system implemented by the Managing Authority as partially effective.
The irregularities, identified by the NIK, related to management and control system functioning in Poland concerning both violation of existing law and the lack of regularity in the undertaken activities were not evaluated by the NIK as material.
The results of these irregularities concerned individual projects and did not crucially influence the implementation of the OP CBC CZ-PL.
Despite the identified irregularities, the NIK evaluated the system functioning positively.
B. Evaluation of project effects
The audit has shown no inconsistency between the indicators and objectives set for each project and those included in the Operational Programme.
In all the audited projects the expected results were achieved, the activities supported by funding have actually been executed; indicators (measurable parameters) set in the project applications for the Operational Programme funding have been achieved.
These audit conclusions are in agreement with the results of the public opinion poll, the realization of which is described further in this chapter.
The important aspect, which both the NKU and NIK paid attention to in their audit reports, is the reduced possibility of objective verification of the achievement of assumed effects of individual projects, both when it comes to the objectives of individual projects, as well as of the whole Operational Programme.
The NIK initiated a public opinion poll which took place in the summer of 2013 in the location of the projects implementation.
The poll and its evaluation were carried out by the School of Higher Vocational Education in Nysa (Poland).
After the agreement with the NKU, a survey was carried out on both sides of the border on a sample of 2 820 people, i.e. both among the public in Poland in relation to the part of the project implemented by Polish project partners and among the public in the Czech Republic in relation to the part of the project implemented in the Czech Republic.
The survey particularly concerned the validity, quality, interaction, resource utilization and social functionality of projects, including the investments.
The number of respondents at the individual projects is presented in the attachment 2.
The analysis of the poll responses indicates that the total social evaluation of final projects was good and averaged 4.8 (on a scale up to 8 pts.), which means that their impact has been positively assessed by the majority of respondents, both according to the objectives as well as other parameters declared in applications.
According to the respondents the surveyed projects met the criteria formulated within the Operational Programme.
Respondents have noticed the positive impact of investment on improvement of the quality of transport and tourism infrastructure, transport accessibility, touristic attractiveness, the entrepreneurial conditions, quality of life of inhabitants, the resumption of contacts between the inhabitants of the border region.
On the other hand, the overall evaluation of responses indicates the difference between the actual level of achievement of the objectives/parameters (the actual level of impact), and the level expected by respondents.
This also applies to the assessment of the individual effects; in some cases the difference is significant.
The results of the survey were consistent with the opinions of the participants of panel discussions (focus groups), carried out within the NIK audit on the Polish side, who pointed to the need of the implementation of projects and confirmed their positive public perception and the achievement of the expected results.
C. Assessment of legality of audited projects
At the beneficiary level, the audit focused particularly on material and timely implementation of a project and the compliance with the schedule and contents of the project application, fulfilment of project pre-set goals and objectives and mandatory monitoring indicators, management of project amendments, handling of potential project revenues, identification of project transactions, prohibition of cross-financing from various EU resources, implementation of the project partnership and fulfilment of its conditions, required publicity related mainly to advertising the role of EU financial resources, eligibility of project expenditure and public procurement process.
The total financial amount of ascertained shortcomings qualified by NIK and NKU as expenditure ineligible for the support from EU funds was EUR 85 094.
The amount however did not exceed the materiality threshold set in relation to the total volume of audited financial resources in the sample of projects.
Despite the identified irregularities, the NIK and the NKU evaluated positively actions taken by the beneficiaries for the implementation of selected projects.
In the vast majority of cases, the obligations arising from contracts for financing were properly implemented by the beneficiaries.
The funds for the implementation of the audited projects were expended in accordance with the provisions of the EU and national law.
However, in seven out of eight audited beneficiaries audited by the NIK, the irregularities were found in the implementation of material and financial responsibilities.
These were individual cases of non-system nature and concerned in particular the unreliable preparation of tender documentation and infringement of the regulations of public procurement, but without effect on the selection of contractor or delivery of contracted works.
Only in one of all the projects audited by NIK, irregularity, which concerned non-compliance with reporting obligations, may result in the assessing the expenditure in the amount of PLN 43 003 as ineligible (of which EUR 8 231 were financed from ERDF).
On the other side of the border, the NKU identified in three out of 19 audited projects ineligible expenditure in the amount of CZK 2 098 053 (out of which EUR 76 863 were financed from ERDF).
The irregularities included non-delivery of financed material and works and expenditure for upgrading a property in the ownership of a party unrelated to the project (either as a project beneficiary or a partner).
RECOMMENDATIONS
A common recommendation of the NKU and the NIK concerns an improvement of the monitoring system specifically by consistent assignation of proper monitoring indicators for all specific objectives of priority axis of the Operational Programme.
Generally, it is also necessary to aim for designing monitoring indicators both on the programme and project level which would enable more operative verification of the achievement of set effects.
Remarks and recommendations resulting from the audits carried out on both sides of the border are included in the separate audit reports of NKU and NIK on CD.
COMMUNIQUÉ
The report has been drawn up in Czech, English and Polish and signed by the Presidents of supreme audit institutions of the Czech Republic and Poland.
Procurement of public building and corruption prevention
Joint report on parallel audit submitted by the Czech Supreme Audit Ofice (NKÚ) and the German Bundesrechnungshof (BRH)
Introduction and overview
The procurement of goods and services by public-sector contracting agencies is of great importance both for the government and for the business community.
The government’s task is to use public resources as efficiently and economically as possible and to ensure fair and regulated competition.
In the European Union (EU), public contract awarding is key to the success of the single economic area.
In order to ensure a largely unrestricted competition in the field of crossborder procurement, awarding authorities also have to meet certain requirements imposed by the EU in awarding contracts where the contract value exceeds certain thresholds.
To this end, the EU Member States have to transpose EU procurement law into their national law and apply it.
This has already happened both in the Czech Republic and in Germany.
For contracts worth less than the EU thresholds, regulating public contract awarding procedures remains a matter for the individual countries.
Moreover, the contract award procedure is, as a rule, vulnerable to corruption.
In view of the generally high damage potential, awarding authorities are obliged to take reasonable action to fight and to rule out corruption and abusive favouritism in their contract award procedures (corruption prevention).
In January 2011, the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (Czech SAI – NKÚ) and the Bundesrechnungshof of Germany (German SAI – BRH) agreed to conduct parallel audits both of the EU-wide awarding of building contracts and of corruption prevention.
The audit focused on the application of EU procurement law as transposed into national law and corruption prevention of contracts for building construction and road construction and/or transport infrastructure.
The audit also covered contract awards below the EU thresholds with a view to corruption prevention.
The two SAIs’ audit findings are summarised in the joint report, which is also to be addressed to international institutions such as the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).
Fields of audit and audited bodies
The assessments performed by the German SAI are for the most part based on horizontal audits of the above-mentioned topics, which we carried out at German building authorities responsible for federal road and building construction in the years 2011–2012.
This included e.g. the construction of motorways and large building construction projects.
In addition to that, the German SAI included findings from previous audits in the assessment.
The assessments performed by the Czech SAI were based on audit findings generated in the years 2008–2012. The audits covered the construction of roads, railway lines, hydraulic engineering projects, large buildings (hospitals, cultural buildings, universities, etc.), and some other areas in the Czech Republic.
Federal contract award procedures in Germany are largely conducted by the construction administrations of the countries.
In the Czech Republic, the road and estimate construction administrations of the State have central responsibilities for awarding contracts relating to transport infrastructure.
In building construction, responsibility for contract award procedures is decentralised, i.e. the procedures are conducted by the entities which receive state budget funds.
In both countries, the services of self-employed professionals are used in individual stages of contract award procedures.
When comparing the assessments, differences in procurement legislation and structural peculiarities of the construction services and markets of both countries have to be observed.
Structure of procurement law in the two countries
In Germany, the conduct of EU-wide contract award procedures is governed by Acts of Parliament and delegated legislation.
Contract award procedures limited to Germany are governed by budgetary law and administrative regulations based on it .
Many supplementary provisions both for EU-wide and national contract awards are contained in internal administrative rules.
Further details concerning the requirements of EU procurement law and corruption prevention are set forth in the socalled “contract award manuals” of the Federal Government, in which the requirements are complemented or formulated in greater detail taking regard to judicial precedent in the field of procurement law.
In the Czech Republic, contract award procedure is governed exclusively by the respective Act on Public Procurement and other legal provisions, which apply to contract values both above and below the EU thresholds.
Procurement law was substantially amended in 2012.
The new provisions strengthened transparency in the management of public funds, opened the way for more competition and limited the opportunities for corruption in the contract award procedures.
Basic features of procurement law in the two countries
In both countries, especially the open procedure, the restricted procedure and the negotiated procedure are to be applied where contracts are to be awarded EU-wide.
In Germany, contracts below the EU threshold are awarded in accordance with the national procedures (public invitation to tender, restricted invitation to tender, negotiated contract), which, however, are aforementioned procedures. largely identical with the EU-wide contract award.
Public procurement law in Germany is characterised by the principle of preference for the open procedure (where tenders have to be invited EU-wide) and for the public invitation to tender (in case of merely national contract awards).
Under the open procedure and the public invitation to tender, every interested enterprise may submit a bid.
Another essential feature of German procurement law is the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
This is achieved mainly by dividing an overall public works project in trade-specific lots and part lots.
By awarding separate contracts for these lots, as many enterprises as possible, are to be given the chance to compete.
The two aforementioned characteristics of German procurement are time-tested tools for obtaining good value for money.
More than 330,000 construction firms with workforce of 1.9 mil. are registered in Germany.
In the Czech Republic, the EU-wide contract award procedures are also to be applied to public works contracts below the EU threshold.
An exception to this is the simplified procedure below threshold, where the contracting authorities may under certain conditions use considerably less strict procedure.
In agreement with EU law, Czech procurement law includes provisions according to which contracts are to be concluded, if competition is guaranteed and an advantageous price is obtained.
The present Czech legislation enables contracting authorities to choose between open and restricted procedure.
In the Czech Republic, there are about 85,000 registered building companies, out of it 1,900 building contractors with 20 or more workers each.
Aggregate volume of public works contracts awarded by contracting agencies and shares of contract award types in the two countries
In 2011, the total volume of construction works in Germany totalled € 307 billion.
Of these, € 45.5 billion (equivalent to 15 per cent) were accounted for by public contracts which, apart from contracts awarded by the Federal Government, included contracts awarded by the Federal States and municipalities.
The total volume of federal building and road construction projects (without railway construction and hydraulic engineering) amounted to € 8.5 billion.
In 2011, the breakdown of federal contracts for building construction and construction of longdistance roads by type of award procedure was as follows:
80.7 % Open procedures and public invitations to tender 12.7 % Restricted procedures and restricted invitations to tender 6.6 % Negotiated procedures and discretionary awarding of contracts 33.2 % of which were EU-wide tenders.
In 2011, the volume of public works in the Czech Republic totalled € 4.7 billion, which accounts for about 25 per cent of the total volume of all building works in the Czech Republic.
In 2009 the volume reached € 7.8 billion e.g. 37% of the total volume of public works.
Structure of types of awards in 2011: 65,1 % open procedure 14,3 % restricted procedure 9,5 % negotiated procedure 8,4 % simplified procedure for awards below the threshold 2.7 % other procedures
The data comprise all public contracts for supplies, services and construction works awarded by public contracting authorities in 2011.
These figures show that the parallel audits of both countries focus on an important part of public contract awarding; corruption prevention, that always has to be observed when awarding contracts, has a significant financial impact and the open procedure and/or open tendering are of key importance when awarding contracts.
Summary of the basic results
The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (NKÚ) and the Supreme Audit Institution of the Federal Republic of Germany (BRH) have conducted parallel audits of EU-wide awarding of public works contracts and corruption prevention in their respective countries.
In this context, the working groups of the two SAIs compared the legal frameworks and administrative regulations in the Czech Republic and in Germany and the results of their parallel audits which they conducted specifically in the fields of building construction and road construction.
The key findings were:
The EU Directives on the awarding of public works contracts have been transposed into national law both in the Czech Republic and in Germany (items 1 and 3.1).
Corruption prevention is not only the purpose of the EU Directives but also of the national procurement rules of both countries, which partly differ as to their points of emphasis and degree of detail.
In both countries, an essential requirement to be met by the tender documents is that they have to include all information needed for appropriately drawing up bids.
The specifications must be neutral and not include any requirements that restrict competition.
The tender documents in Germany largely complied with these requirements.
In the Czech Republic the problem of determining the subject of the contract largely exists.
In Germany, public works are to be divided into lots whenever possible in order to promote competition.
According to the BRH’s findings, this requirement was largely met in Germany.
The NKÚ’s audits showed that awarding large volumes of public road works without division into lots or division in only very large lots may impair competition and result in a restriction to only a few large companies.
These restrictions of market potential may result in major cost increases and bear the risk of undue price negotiations and collusion.
Legal provisions of both countries enable, under certain conditions, the contracting authorities to award contracts of additional or modified construction works if the need for this arises after concluding the contract (item 4.1).
The respective requirements for determining the type of award were largely complied with in both countries.
According to the provisions of the Czech Republic, the contracting authorities may freely choose between open and restricted procedures.
In contrast, the relevant German provisions in procurement and budgetary law stipulate the precedence of the open procedure both for EU-wide tenders and for national tenders known as public invitations to tender.
This enables more enterprise to submit bids.
This reduces the risk of corruption, makes price-fixing by collusion of bidders difficult and produces the best results in terms of value for money.
In the case of major work projects whose estimated total value reached or exceeded a threshold set by the EU, the contracting authorities audited always applied Europe-wide tendering procedures.
When determining the type of award procedure, the correct estimation of the contract value is of essential importance.
In Germany, databases for objective setting estimated public works prices are used, especially in the area of building construction.
The data is based on evaluations of construction projects already completed.
In the Czech Republic, the databases are used only in the area of road construction, but they are not efficient tool as yet (item 4.2).
Where contracts for work projects are to be awarded by EU-wide tendering procedures, prior information and contract notices have to be published. This is to strengthen competition by allowing interested enterprises to prepare at an early stage for submitting bids.
Kontrolovaní zadavatelé zpravidla tento požadavek plnili.
V ojedinělých případech byly zjištěny omyly ve zveřejněných informacích, nesprávná aplikace požadavků a nedostatek kontrol, což mohlo konkurenci poškodit (bod 4.3).
The selection of bidders for participation in restricted award procedures is particularly vulnerable to manipulation.
Under EU law, the number of bidders invited must be sufficiently high to guarantee genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective, non-discriminatory and must be published in advance.
In addition to EU requirements, the contracting authorities in both countries are to alternate as frequently as possible among the enterprises to be invited when selecting participants.
In Germany, there are partly very detailed requirements to counteract the risk of manipulation.
In some cases, the audited bodies did not take regard to the requirements.
In the Czech Republic, the selection decisions made were not always plausible (item 4.4).
In both countries, the contracting authorities have to ensure, during the tender stage, that all enterprises interested in submitting a tender receive identical information.
To avoid collusion that would restrict competition, any contacts among these enterprises and between them and independent professionals that were involved in drawing up the specifications have to be prevented to the greatest extent possible.
The corresponding provisions in Germany are more extensive than those in the Czech Republic.
However, the audited construction administrations in Germany did not comply with requirements in some cases (item 4.5).
In both countries, the opening of the bids must comply with the cross-check and transparency principles.
The requirements for the marking, documentation, preservation and secrecy of the bids are to restrict the scope for manipulation and are particularly detailed in Germany.
The audits in both countries revealed only few deficiencies (item 4.6).
Examination and evaluation of the bids are regulated in both countries by requirements for structural organisation and procedures.
The respective German rules are more comprehensive but were not always, complied with by the audited contracting authorities.
For instance, contracting authorities passed bids on to third parties for examination without first inspecting them and without adequately documenting any conspicuous feature.
The bids were thus inadequately protected against subsequent manipulations (item 4.7).
On completion of EU-wide contract award procedures, the participating předem informováni. Důvodem je dát účastníkům řízení možnost nechat přezkoumat rozhodnutí o udělení zakázky.
Toto pravidlo právní ochrany je rovněž určeno k zabránění korupčních aktivit.
Česká právní úprava řeší otázku právního přezkoumání zadávacího řízení i u národních řízení.
Pouze v ojedinělých případech nebylo plnění informačních povinností náležitě zabezpečeno. (bod 4.8).
The documentation of the contract award procedures by the audited construction authorities in the two countries was not always complete or plausible.
In the case of some procedures, the transparency requirement, which applies throughout the EU, had not been adequately observed in the contract award memos.
Moreover, some of the deficiencies found diminished the corruption prevention effect of the documentation.
The contracting authorities of both countries largely complied with their reporting duties (item 4.9).
Fundamentals of EU procurement law and corruption prevention
European procurement law
In order to guarantee free competition and free movement of services and goods within the European Union, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted, inter alia, the Directive on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts (Directive on the coordination of procedures for the award of contracts) and the Directive on the coordination of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the application of review procedures to the award of public supply and public works contracts (Remedies Directive), that were to be transposed into national law.
In particular, the general procurement principles of the European Union include the competition requirement, the equal treatment requirement or prohibition of discrimination and the transparency requirement.
To accomplish these objectives, the Directive on the coordination of EU-wide procedures for the award of contracts includes provisions relative to construction projects the expected order total of which reaches or exceeds € 5 million.
Such provisions impact especially on the contents of tender documents, the applicable type of procedure, the publication of certain information prior to, during and after the contract award procedure, the compliance with the deadlines for the receipt of tenders, the documentation of the contract award dokumentaci celého zadávacího řízení; the qualification requirements that may be imposed on tenderers and the criteria according to which a tender is selected.
The tenderers’ legal protection is governed by the Remedies Directive.
In the case of potential breaches of procurement law, enterprises may have the contracting authority’s decision reviewed within review procedures.
Both the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany have transposed the European Union Directives into national law.
Corruption prevention
Significance of corruption prevention
In neither country is there a legal definition of what constitutes corruption.
In general, corruption is understood to mean the misuse of a position of confidence for private advantage.
As a rule, it is implied that such abuse is incited by those who benefit from it.
Corruption may hamper competition and may cause substantial economic damage.
According to estimates, global costs caused by corruption, amount to 5 % of the global economic output.
For the European Union area, these costs are estimated at an amount equivalent of 1 % of the area’s economic output.
If the contracting authority is involved, agreements restricting competition or unfair behaviour may undermine confidence in the integrity and the capability of the public administration to function.
Thus, preventing corruption is an essential task for awarding authorities.
Practices and procedures are to be reviewed to adress areas that are especially vulnerable to corruption so that appropriate anticorruption measures can be taken.
Taking preventive measures and carrying out effective controls may substantially reduce vulnerability of decision-making processes to corruption.
As a rule, the awarding of works contracts is considered to be particularly vulnerable to corruption.
Measures to prevent corruption
In Germany, corruption is prosecuted under penal and employment law, this especially applies to active and passive bribery and to the undue acceptance of benefits and undue granting of benefits.
In order to prevent corruption, the German Federal Government issued a guideline together with recommendations on corruption prevention in the federal administration , according to which, in addition to risk analyses, the following principles shall apply to contract award procedures: precedence of open tendering multiple control principle and transparent decision-making separation of planning, awarding of contracts and accounting precise and full documentation of procurement procedures.
In addition, further provisions having a preventive effect against corruption have become part of procurement law.
In 2011, the federal department responsible introduced an IT-supported system to monitor the awarding of federal road construction contracts.
By means of this system, procurement data, e.g. estimated costs, order total and private independent professionals involved, can be fully recorded and analysed with a view to finding irregularities.
In the Czech Republic, corruption is similiarly prosecuted under penal and employment law.
The legal requirements of transparency, equal treatment of bidders and prohibition of any discrimination are the most important bases of corruption prevention.
Anti-corruption measures in the area of public procurement have been set down by the government in a strategy on fight against corruption for 2011–2012 which was updated for 2013–2014.
Some parts of these measures were already incorporated into public procurement law and respective implementing regulations.
The new legislation essentially contains the following provisions decrease of contracts for small scale obligation of prior contract award announcement by the contracting authority, including the reasons of the contract prohibition of limiting the number of tenderers in restricted procedures and thus impossibility of limiting the number of tenderers based on drawing obligation of publishing the contract awarded, including the supplements obligation of publishing the real price and the list of sub-contractors
Audit results related to the successive phases of the contract award procedure
Tender documents
Tender documents The tender documents must include all information which the bidders need for preparing their tenders in due form.
In particular, the tender documents must permit accurate costing.
To ensure this, bidders must not be burdened with risks they cannot calculate.
The tender documents mainly consist of the specifications. They also include the requirements for proving the bidders’ qualification and the criteria for selecting the most cost-effective bid.
Requirements of EU law and of corruption prevention
Requirements provided for by EU law especially focus on technical specifications.
All bidders must have equal access to them and they are to restrict competition as little as possible.
As a matter of principle, specifications have to be product-neutral.
Any details as to specific products or manufacturers as part of the technical specifications are therefore admissible only within narrow limits.
To avoid the inclusion in the tender documents of requirements that restrict competition is an elementary principle of corruption prevention.
Furthermore, it is necessary to avoid ambiguities or inaccurate information when preparing the tender documents, since such deficiencies provide a scope for speculations in connection with the preparation of bids and for manipulations in the evaluation of bids.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
Both countries have transposed EU legal provisions about technical specifications into their national law.
As a matter of principle, specifications have to be product-neutral without requiring any particular brands.
As a matter of principle, the specifications must outline the supplies and services required, detailing the number of units of work or supplies.
In this normal case, prices are to be stipulated by units of work or supplies (e.g. euro/m² or euro/item).
Only in exceptional cases is it admissible to define the work to be done in terms of functional objectives.
As a rule the specifications need to be complete and unambiguous.
They have to include precise quantities and may not comprise work or supplies whose necessity is uncertain.
Remuneration in lump sum form or input of working time should be avoided whenever possible.
These provisions are to preclude speculations and manipulations based on ambiguous specifications in the tender documents.
The specifications must enable each bidder to prepare his bid safely and without extensive preliminary work.
The invitation to tender is to be announced only after completion of the tender documents.
Differing provisions
In the Czech Republic there is no obligation to invite construction tenderers for lots.
The contracting authority is entitled to subdivide a public contract into several separate lots, if it is admitted by the nature of the subject-matter of such public contract.
In Germany, there is a requirement in principle to divide construction projects into lots, either divided by quantities (partial lots) and/or specialties (specialised lots).
This is to enable small and medium-sized contractors to compete, to increase the number of potential bidders and to make price-fixing more difficult.
This type of award is considered as usually providing best value for money.
In the Czech Republic, all tender documents, both for national and EU-wide awards, must include the evaluation criteria.
This is to inform the bidder completely and exhaustively about the criteria according to which his tender is to be evaluated.
In Germany, the requirement to indicate evaluation criteria in the EU-wide contract notice or, failing that, in the tender documents applies only to EU-wide invitations to tender.
In national contract award procedures, the evaluation criteria need only be included in the contract award memo, which is an internal administrative document.
Where the tender documents are prepared by commissioned independent professionals, the German regulations require any information to be omitted from the tender documents that may help to identify the (firms of) architects or civil engineers involved.
This is to prevent individual contractors from obtaining any additional information or other undue competitive advantages through contacts with these independent professionals without the contracting authority being aware of this.
This is also the reason why independent professionals may neither post tender documents nor make planning documents available for inspection.
The contracting authority is the sole contact of the contractors.
At present, no similar provision is in force in the Czech Republic.
In case of big construction projects, the necessity of extra or modified works almost always occurs after conclusion of the original contract.
Legislation in both countries enables to award the extra works contract up to a certain threshold to the same supplier without having to conduct an award procedure and to publish a contract notice.
The volume of extra works as per both European and German legislation must not exceed 50% of original contract price.
In addition, extra works need to be indispensable and identifiable as extra components to the major contract.
In the Czech Republic, stricter limit of 20% applies to such award procedure without publishing a contract notice.
However, this may bring higher risks of time delays of project realization and eventual involvement of a new constructor in the project just underway.
If the extra works contract is also awarded to the supplier already contracted, German law stipulates the rules not enabling contractors to arbitrarily increase the prices of such modified and/or extra works.
Such calculations must be done with reference to the agreed prices of the original contract.
Apart of extra works, less works in construction may occur.
In Czech republic, less works cannot be mixed with additional extra works.
Basic audit findings
BHR
Technical specifications and productneutral invitation to tender
In individual cases, specifications referred to national technical requirements or standards that had in the meantime been replaced by EU standards.
In some cases, specifications also contained data requiring certain brands for example for graffiti resistance systems, water stops or noise abatement tiles –, although this was not needed.
In some cases specifications were so detailed that only one product could fulfil the requirements.
Bills of quantities subdivided into items
In none of the procedures audited did the German SAI detect any cases of non-compliance with the general requirement to invite tenders for supplies and services according to bills of quantities subdivided into items.
Comprehensiveness of specifications
In most of the cases reviewed, the tender documents had been fully elaborated before the process of soliciting bids was launched.
However in various cases, documents had to be modified during the tendering process to pay due regard to changing items or time schedules.
In isolated cases, tender documents contained work or supplies whose necessity was uncertain.
One tender document on demolition work we looked at consisted almost exclusively of such items.
Lots and criteria according to which the contract is to be awarded
In a large number of cases, the required justification for not subdividing the lots of services into partial lots was not given.
The criteria we studied according to which the contract is to be awarded gave us no reason to point out shortcomings.
Inclusion of names of self-employed professionals
In a number of documents the commissioned independent professionals involved were mentioned.
The names were identified on the cover sheets or on the plans or opinions attached.
In one case, the contracting authority even called upon bidders to contact the architect explicitly mentioned regarding questions on the tender.
In building construction projects such cases were caused in the first place by the self-employed persons commissioned to develop the specification documents.
The building administration services stated that they did not have enough staff to control the tender documents in detail.
NKÚ
Technical specifications and product-neutral invitation to tender
In case of public procurement for 12 apartments building, there was reference to concrete supplier and type of product mentioned in the specification.
Contracting authority did not admit using of other comparable types of products. and did not give reason for insisting on these concrete suppliers and products.
In connections with the constructing of various university facilities, the tender documents specified concrete suppliers and products.
Overall list of specifications with partial specifications
In case of constructions of some industrial zones contracting authority did not clearly specify the volume and type of requested works and supplies in the list of measurement, and as measuring unit he specified for each building only the built up volume in cubic meters.
Comprehensiveness of specifications
During the procurement of public contract for construction of a road circle, the tender documentation for restricted procedure was four times changed in the period of August– September 2009.
The reason was increasing of scope of delivery and changes of technical conditions.
In case of some social buildings construction the tender documentation showed mistakes which resulted in necessity of extra works (precise location missing, technical and constructional research insufficient, drawings missing).
Tender documentation for construction of a big library described the elements of interior only without specifying product quality requirements.
As a result, some sub suppliers provided some very expensive and above standard equipment.
Lots and criteria according to which the contract is to be awarded
In the Czech Republic, no obligation of dividing public works projects into partial lots or awarding partial contracts is in place.
Analysis of three big parts of a road circle construction proved that within their public procurement in parts (individually by selected installations), savings amounting up to 31.6 million EUR could have been achieved, out of total of achieved public contract prices amounting to 620.3 million EUR.
For example, in case of offer price for 6 individual construction objects as 6 separate parts of one public contract, the savings of 2.5 million EUR (i.e. 25%) could have been achieved.
If the construction works of 20 bridges had been awarded as a separate part of one public contract, the savings amounting to 11.5 million EUR (i.e. 25%) could have been achieved.
In case of road constructions, contracting authority imposed very extensive requirements for references as suitability criteria.
In tender documentation of open procedure for one part of a motorway construction, contracting authority requested, among others, such experience of a supplier, proving his realization of at least three road construction projects worth 28 million EUR each, finalized or put into operation within the last 5 years.
In the Czech Republic, there are not more than 9 suppliers complying with the above prerequisite.
Open public procurement for another part of a motorway construction included 6 separate construction works, where the contracting authority demanded minimum yearly construction volume of construction works worth € 480 million within the last 3 years.
Podle provedeného rozboru získalo dvě třetiny finančního objemu zakázek v oblasti pozemních komunikací (62,5 mld. Kč z 92,5 mld. Kč) v letech 2008 až 2009 pět firem buď samostatně, nebo v rámci sdružení.
In case of together 46 contract award procedures worth € 528 million, there were just two or even one only tenderer.
NKÚ pointed out that restriction of the market potentional may result in major cost increases.
Area of extra works
In case of a road circle construction, contracting authority did not conclude written contract for delivery of extra works (in two cases) and he did not contracted those extra works according to any of procedures prescribed by law.
Value of extra works amounted in the first case up to € 6.7 million without VAT (increase by 21%), in second case up to € 165.4 million without VAT (increase by 91%).
The reason was an unclear determination of quantity a quality features of works.
In case of various University facilities the contracting authority did not comprise some works and deliveries into the tender documentation even if their need and necessity for construction completion and for final inspection were known just when the contract had been awarded. These works and deliveries were done on basis of addendums to the contract between contracting authority and supplier in negotiation procedure without publication.
The volume of extra works overpassed the national limit 20% of the original contract.
In connection with the construction of a large court building, the contracting authority reserved the right to award contracts for additional work without invitation to tender.
During construction, the contracting authority increased the contract volume by € 2 million.
The unit prices for the additional work commissioned without competition were considirably higher than comparable work done by the same contractor.
Other findings
Based on selected sample of constructions, NKÚ found out that the average costs of construction of 1 km section of the four-lane motorway in the Czech Republic amounts up to € 14.6 million.
According to the long term data from the Federal Ministry of Construction of Germany, the average costs of 1 km section of the four-lane motorway in Germany amount up to € 10.4 million.
This comparison suggests, that construction of a motorway in the Czech Republic is more costly compared to Germany.
Summarised findings
The basic legal provisions about tender documents are largely identical in both countries and comply with the requirements of EU law.
Their purpose is both to ensure comprehensive and fair competition and to prevent corruption.
The specifications must be sufficiently precise to enable bidders to accurately calculate the costs and prepare their tenders.
Moreover, this requirement is to limit the scope for speculation and the contracting authority is to be protected against the need to make contracts for extra work later.
In Germany, the basic legal provisions about tender documents are supplemented by additional regulations that are to further reduce the possibilities for restricting competition and for effecting manipulations.
While no similarly detailed requirements of this kind exist in the Czech Republic, higher transparency is achieved there by the publication of the evaluation criteria.
The requirements for specifications have largely been complied with in both countries.
In some cases, however, it was necessary to object to deviations that may have resulted in restrictions of competition.
The rule in force in Germany that requires the segmentation of large work projects into lots promotes competition and cost-effective results.
The NKÚ has found that, in the Czech Republic, the award of large works contracts without segmentation into lots or segmentation into very large lots may restrict the circle of bidders to a small number of large enterprises.
As a result of the very extensive requirements for reference imposed in the Czech Republic for selecting bidders for road works, public contracts are awarded to only a small circle of bidders and small and medium-sized enterprises are not given the chance to compete.
A limited number of bidders also increases the risk of price-fixing and other forms of collusion.
Concerning the award of contracts for extra or modified works and the remuneration for such work, the regulatory approaches differ between the two countries.
According to both European and German legislation, extra works not exceeding 50% of the original contract price can be awarded without tendering procedure and contract notice.
In the Czech Republic stricter limit of 20% applies.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
This limit is often overstepped by contracting authorities.
The reason is an insufficient definition of public works.
If the limit of 20% is exceeded, the extra works must be awarded on the basis of a tendering procedure with contract notice.
By dividing work into lots, restrictions of competition and the resulting detrimental consequences can be avoided.
Determining the type of award and taking regard to the EU threshold
By determining the type of award, the contracting authority defines the number of potential contractors participating in the competition.
The contracting authority may leave the number of potential contractors and bidders largely unrestricted or may restrict the number by opting for a restricted procedure.
In the case of work projects whose value reaches or exceeds a threshold set by the EU, EU-wide tendering procedures must be applied.
Requirements of EU law and of corruption prevention
When determining the type of award, the contracting authority especially has to comply with the requirements of European law on competition and transparency.
If the estimated total contract value of the construction work to be performed reaches or exceeds the current EU threshold of €5 million, it is always required that the contract be awarded EU-wide by open or restricted procedure.
In exceptional cases, negotiated procedure or competitive dialogue is admissible.
Where construction projects reach or exceed the EU threshold, the contracting authority may deviate to a restricted extent from the principle of EU-wide contract awarding and may award contracts by national procedure, if the estimated contract value of the lot concerned is below € 1 million and the total value of these lots does not exceed 20% of the estimated total contract value.
It is not allowed to inappropriately divide a project by its nature single construction project without compelling reasons or deliberately estimate its cost too low in order to avoid the obligation in principle to carry out a EU-wide procedure for awarding the works contract.
Since restrictions of competition substantially increase the risk of manipulation, the choice of the type of award is of major importance for purposes of corruption prevention.
The detailed justification of the choice of type of award and the considerations made about the obligation to apply EU procurement law are important parts of the documentation of the contract-award procedure.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
Both countries have completely implemented in national law the EU legal requirements for contract award procedures and thresholds.
Differing provisions
The Czech Republic has made arrangements to apply the principle of equal validity of open and restricted procedures laid down in the directive to its national awards of work contracts.
Open and restricted procedures may always be freely chosen without the need to document or justify the decision. Other types of procedure are only permitted where certain legally defined conditions are met.
Differing from that arrangement, the relevant German provisions of budgetary law and of the guidelines for preventing corruption as a rule give preference to open procedure or public invitation to tender.
Other types of procedure – including even restricted procedure or restricted tendering – are permitted only in exceptional cases, which are exhaustively determined by procurement law.
Such an exceptional case must be plausibly justified and documented.
The principle of preference for open procedure or public invitation to tender is to guarantee competition that is as little restricted as possible and to prevent opportunities for manipulation and for price-fixing among bidders by deciding in advance to choose certain tenderers.
In Germany, the principle of public tendering is a central element of corruption prevention.
The correct estimation of expected prices of a public contract is an essential basis for deciding the adequate type of public contract award procedure.
When estimating the costs of public building construction projects, the construction administrations in Germany can rely on planning and cost databases of public administrations and other organisations.
These databases have been compiled through analyses of completed construction projects. These databases include, among other information, standard cost figures for types of buildings, building units, building components or individual building work.
Based on such standard cost figures, it is eventually possible to estimate the contract value of a planned project or building work to be commissioned.
Only a few construction administrations in Germany already have similar databases for road construction.
However, it is intended to implement such databases nationwide.
Contracting authorities in the Czech Republic do not use any central database or average prices of comparable construction projects for determining the expected costs of a public contract for building constructions.
In most cases, cost determinations are based on estimates of the entity that funds the project or result from the amount of funds made available to the construction administration entity in question.
The measures for standardizing are in initial stage only.
On the basis of the programme of corruption fighting for the period of 2011–2012, the respective ministries work out the data base of customary prices of standardized commodities.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The data base should serve as set of information about construction and assembling works, materials and products, and other data to enable the calculation of necessary costs and determination of unit prices.
Ministry of Transport issued price data base for transport constructions as means of price controlling, which are currently updated.
The database is intended to determine the price in project (investment) plan, and they should play comparative function within further phases of construction preparatory works.
Key audit findings BRH
Choice of tendering procedure
The contracting authorities audited largely invited tenders under open procedure or public invitation to tender, thus complying with the requirements of budgetary and procurement law.
In 2011, 59.5% of the aggregate contract volume of federal construction projects in the field of building construction was accounted for by public tendering.
In road construction, this share was 94.8%.
In some case where non-public tendering was chosen, we found that the reasons for the contracting authorities’ infringement of the principle of open procedure or public invitation to tender were not stated in detail.
In the course of a horizontal audit, the BRH found, on the basis of information compiled about more than 16,000 contract award procedures, that the restricted procedures have a clear disadvantage, where competition is concerned, in comparison to public procedures and public invitations to tender and that they also increase the risks of manipulation and corruption.
Public tenders in the field of building construction elicited more than twice as many bids as restricted tenders and nearly three times as many bids as awards under negotiated procedure.
Our study also revealed that the bid prices quoted in restricted procedures and negotiated procedures were 6% and 10% higher respectively than those quoted in public procedures.
Parallel studies of the Federal Building Ministry and of a Land court of audit confirmed the differences in value for money obtained by public and by restricted procedures.
The Federal Building Ministry’s performance study even revealed that the prices quoted in restricted procedures were twice as high as those quoted in public procedures.
Taking regard to the EU threshold
In respect of those work projects whose aggregate contract value was estimated at more than € 5 million, the construction authorities audited usually made contract awarding plans in which they specified which works were to be awarded by EU-wide tender and which by national tender.
According to the contract awarding plans, the share of those works that required Europe-wide tendering always exceeded 80% of the total works.
There was no evidence of circumvention of the requirement to invite tenders Europe-wide by excessively low cost estimates.
However,in some cases, as a result of errors in the calculation of total contract value, the minimum share of EU-wide tendering was undercut.
During the execution of work, some construction authorities illicitly changed the determinations made in the contract awarding plan.
They did not give any reasons for these changes and did not prove that the minimum share of EU-wide tendering continued to be complied with.
The share of EU-wide tendering according to the accounts for the projects was usually lower than laid down in the contract awarding plan.
Where the expected contract values of construction projects exceeded the EU threshold, the construction authorities did not apply EU-wide tendering to all individual lots worth more than €1 million.
Instead, they awarded the respective contracts under national procedures without giving sound reasons for the necessity of deviating from the requirement.
NKÚ
Choice of tendering procedure
In the case of several large-scale building projects, e.g. the construction of some motorway sections, of facilities for a big sports event and of housing projects, the contracting authorities split one project into several parts, although these partial contracts were of the same or similar character.
Splitting resulted in decrease of expected value under the fixed limit, and the contracts were thereafter awarded in less strict under limit procedure, or even out of law regime.
Methods for calculating the estimated contract value
Price databases set up for transport infrastructure works did not appear as sufficient tool for estimating contract volumes with some degree of accuracy.
They originated from just realized public procurements, which comprised eventual lacks of economy, construction over-works or excessive profit of suppliers.
The actual prices for three sections of the road circle were about 37% below the determined price from the database.
Ministry of transport updated the databases in a way to reflect not only the bid prices of the past years, but even comparison with comparable markets and index numbers of price progress in the area of construction.
As far as the building construction concerns, the estimative price was based on budget of project architects or estimation of investors.
The true price than varies considerably.
Assumed price of a big library reconstruction was doubled compared to the contract price, however, based on eight addendums, in process of realization the final price increased by € 2.1 million, i.e. by 27%.
Similarly, when constructing a library despository, the true price was by 33% lower compared to assumed price and prices increased during realization.
In other cases, the price of successful bidder is higher compared to assumed price and moreover, during realization it still increases.
In case of a big library construction the assumed price increased by € 16 million, i.e. by 22%, and in case of construction of a justice palace, the volume of financial needs increased during the works disproportionately (by 139%) compared to increase of function surfaces (12%).
Summarised findings
Since both countries have implemented in national law the EU provisions about the choice of type of awarding procedure and about taking regard to the EU threshold, the respective national provisions are largely identical.
However, the principle of public procedure or public tendering applicable in Germany is stricter than the EU provisions and the national provisions in force in the Czech Republic.
Compared to the restricted contract-award procedures, public procedure or public tendering gives more businesses the opportunity to participate in competition.
These types of contract award procedure generate a large number of bids and the best results in terms of value of money.
Corruption prevention is enhanced considerably, since the circle of candidates is not restricted by decisions taken beforehand by the contracting authority which leave room for manipulation and for price fixing among bidders.
The studies have confirmed the advantage obtained through the German rule that preference must be given to public procedure or public invitation to tender.
Czech legal rules enable the contracting authorities to award a contract in open or restricted procedure.
However, the latest amendment of procurement law has introduced a general prohibition to limit the number of bidders in procedures that involve a prior competition for participation.
The restricted procedure has now become very similar to the open procedure.
In Germany, the contracting authorities have largely complied with the requirement to give preference to open procedure or public invitation to tender, whereas in the Czech Republic some projects have been divided, which is not allowed, in order to circumvent the requirements governing the choice of the type of awarding procedure.
However, in Germany in some cases the EU threshold has not been taken regard to, ensuing that the minimum share of EU-wide tendering was undercut.
In the Czech Republic, no satisfactory solution facilitating the correct calculation of expected costs of construction works and construction projects does yet exist.
The construction authorities should ensure, if applicable, by means of more extensive controls that the requirements governing the choice of type of awarding procedure and the volume of contracts to be awarded EU-wide are complied with or should create the conditions necessary to be able to calculate costs accurately.
Prior information and contract notice
Where contracts for work projects are to be awarded by EU-wide tendering procedures, the contracting authority is to publish a contract notice for interested businesses outlining the contracts to be awarded.
Prior information and contract notices are an important basis for EUwide
Requirements of EU law and of corruption prevention
The prior information notice has to include the essential specifications of the intended work project.
These notices are required in the case of work projects whose estimated total contract value is equal to or higher than the EU threshold and where the contracting authority wishes to shorten the deadlines for submitting tenders in open or restricted procedures.
The contracting authority has to publish a contract notice with detailed information on any public works contract that requires EU-wide tendering.
Once published, this information is binding on the contracting authority.
Among other information, the contract notice has to include the specifications, the deadlines for the procedure and the performance of the contract, the special requirements, the award criteria and their weighting.
The EU-wide common procurement vocabulary (CPV) must be used to describe the subject of the contract.
The prior information and contract notices are published in the Official Journal of the European Union and in the buyer profile of the contracting authority.
To prevent any discrimination of foreign interested parties, notices published at national level may not contain any additional information and may not be published before the text of the notice has been posted to the Office for Official Publications of the European Union.
Incomplete or inaccurate information in the contract notice may impair competition and perhaps even facilitate manipulation.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
Both countries have fully implemented the EU provisions on prior information and contract notices in national law.
Differing provisions
In the Czech Republic, prior information and notices must also be published for the works contracts for which EU-wide tendering is not required.
Contract award procedures may not start earlier than one month after the publication of prior information in the EU’s Official Journal (in case of EU-wide award procedures) and in the national official gazette (in case of all award procedure).
The publication of prior information can only be omitted in exceptional cases.
In Germany, the publication of prior information is not needed in cases where no EU-wide tendering is required.
In case of national tendering procedures public invitations to tender and competitions for participation preliminary to restricted invitations to tender must be publicly announced on the Federal Government’s website and, where appropriate, in newspapers orjournals.
In case of restricted invitations to tender without competition for participation, notices have to be published where the estimated contract value amounts to or exceeds € 25,000 (ex ante transparency).
Preliminary information notices must set forth all planned lots of the work projects.
Given the small volumes of works contracts awarded in Germany, this is an important requirement.
As the number of work projects divided into lots for purposes of tendering is much smaller in the Czech Republic, this provision is much less important there.
Key audit findings
BRH
Preliminary information
The contracting authorities audited published prior information for all public works projects that involved work to be contracted out by EU-wide tender.
However, in the case of some open procedures, they shortened the deadlines for tendering at a time when the required minimum period of 52 days between sending preliminary information and sending the publications had not yet expired.
In the case of other shortened procedures, tenders were invited only when the twelve-month validity period of the preliminary information had already expired and had not yet been extended.
Many publications of preliminary information did not include advice to the effect that the total volume of work would be divided into lots.
Contract notice
Some of the contract notices issued by the audited bodies included CPV codes which deviated from the contents of preliminary information notices or did not accurately specify the work to be done.
In isolated cases, the contract notices published at national level included more information – e.g. concerning performance deadlines – or were published earlier than the notices published in the European Union’s Official Journal.
Ex-ante transparency
The units of one construction administration had commissioned a service company with publishing the national notices.
The latter published the notices on its own procurement platform for the use of which fees are charged.
The construction authorities had however not checked whether this company had complied with the requirement to pass on the notices to the Federal Government’s free internet portal.
Sample audits showed that only one third of the notices had been published on the latter portal.
NKÚ
Contract notice
In case of the construction of a water treatment plant, the contracting authority in its publication of award procedure to suppliers did not indicate the criteria it intended to apply in selecting tenderers.
The contracting authority was not able to prove the way of bid selection.
Reduction of number of bidders was, according to previous legislation, duly in place.
In case of a road circle construction the contracting authority did not specify the figures for evaluation of compliance with qualification criteria and did not indicate the number of bidders to be invited nor in publication of restricted procedure opening neither in the contract award documentation.
The contracting authority evaluated the qualification requirements of all 6 bidders in the restricted procedure as being complied with, but one bidder was excluded because he met the qualification requirements on the last sixth position.
These steps of contracting authority were not transparent, because no information concerning the qualification particulars evaluation and the method of evaluation had ever been published.
Publication of notices
In case of ex-military areas reconstructions, the contracting authority did not publish the written invitation to tender.
Conclusions and recommendations / summarised findings
The two-stage information procedure with prior information and contract notice is an important instrument for implementing the transparency requirement that applies to EU-wide tendering procedures and thus for enhancing competition and preventing corruption.
By extending the obligation to publish prior information to national tendering procedures in the Czech Republic and by applying this obligation in Germany in cases of open and restricted tendering, both countries have implemented EU requirements and thus increased the transparency of national tendering procedures.
Selection of candidates in case of restricted tendering procedures
In contrast to public tendering procedures, restricted tendering procedures do not permit all potential contractors who are interested in winning the contract to participate in the competition.
Under restricted procedures, the contracting authority must previously select potential contractors that will be asked to submit a tender.
Requirements of EU law and of corruption prevention
The EU provisions permit a limitation of the number of candidates in EU-wide restricted tendering procedures.
However, restricted procedure requires at least five candidates to be asked to submit tenders and in the case of negotiated procedures with previous publication of a contract notice at least three potential contractors must be invited.
In any case, the number of invited candidates must be sufficiently large to guarantee genuine competition.
The selection criteria must be objective and nondiscriminatory and must be published in advance.
The selection of potential contractors to be invited is a stage within the tendering procedure which is highly vulnerable to manipulation, e.g. undue preference being given to certain contractors.
Moreover, the restriction of competition to few contractors may facilitate collusive tendering.
In both case, such practices may considerably deteriorate the result of thetendering procedure to the disadvantage of the contracting authority.
Therefore, the latter, must make special arrangements to prevent manipulations, to ensure that adequate controls are in place and that this stage in the procedure is transparent and plausible.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
The provisions on the selection of candidates are similar in the two countries.
In addition to EU requirements, the contracting authorities are to alternate among the contractors to be invited.
It is also not permitted to restrict competition to contractors domiciled in particular regions.
The contracting authorities have to document and justify the selection of bidders and the course of the selection procedure in the contract award memos.
Differing provisions
In Germany, it is required to invite at least three candidates in the case of restricted tendering and several suitable candidates in the case of awards by negotiated contract.
Except in two specific cases, the new Czech regulations do not allow limiting the number of invited tenderers in case of restricted and negotiated procedure.
In Germany, it is required to observe the crosscheck principle when selecting the candidates.
If, e.g. one staff member has proposed a list of candidates, a senior manager of the construction administration or a commissioned staff member of the contracting authority must as a rule modify this proposal e.g. by deleting one of the candidates from the list and/or by adding a new candidate.
This is to prevent that a single individual can finally determine the circle of candidates participating in the competition.
In the absence of such a requirement, far-reaching collusion among the participants would be possible.
The list of candidates to be invited must be treated confidentially and not generally divulged.
This also applies to self-employed professionals.
In the Czech Republic, no similar provisions on the drawing up and confidential treatment of lists of candidates are in place.
Under the German provisions, self-employed professionals may not determine the candidates to be invited but may make proposals to the contracting authority.
Czech rules do not deal with this issue
Key audit results
BRH
Number of bidders
With few exceptions, the requirement for a minimum number of potential contractors to be asked to submit tenders in case of restricted procedures was complied with.
An analysis of nearly 7,000 tendering procedures for building construction limited to the national level showed that, in the case of Federal Government restricted procedures, the contracting authorities invited on average 6.6 potential contractors and, in the case of negotiated contracts, on average 4.4 potential contractors.
Change of contractors and regional restrictions
Especially where building trades with few contractors were involved, the contracting authorities did not make any changes in the circle of selected contractors.
Above all, contractors already known for their good performance were considered more frequently.
The contracting authorities argued that, in the case of non-public procedures, they were bound to ensure the suitability of the contractors to be asked to submit tenders even before actually asking them.
While there was no evidence for illicit restrictions to bidders located in the region, the circle of bidders in the restricted tendering procedures included a larger portion of regional bidders than was the case in public tendering procedures.
The contracting construction authorities attributed this mainly to the smaller contract volumes in comparison to those of public tenders which made long ways to the site a more significant cost item.
Cross-checking principles, proposals of self-employed professionals
The contract-awarding authorities largely disregarded the provisions on the fundamental change of the list of proposed contractors by an independent person.
They especially argued the shortage of staff resources for processing, time pressure or inadequate knowledge about alternative suitable contractors.
In many cases, the records did not indicate who had proposed the contractors to be asked to submit tenders.
The audit of some samples revealed that the lists of potential bidders had been made by self- employed professionals and had been adopted by the contracting authorities without any changes.
Thus, the contracting authorities did not adequately protect themselves against potential manipulations.
Confidential treatment of lists of potential contractors
In one contracting authority, the lists of the contractors to be asked for tenders were held on a data-processing system to which all staff of that authority had read access.
If there had been any intent to manipulate, the unauthorised divulgation of the names of the envisaged or admitted bidders would have been possible which might have enabled contractors to commit price-fixing.
Documentation
Only in few cases did the documentation of contract award procedures show reasons for the selection of bidders.
NKÚ
Selection of bidders
In case of a road circle the bidders had no information about the items of the qualification to be assesed and in which way.
In case of development and modernization of water ways and ports, notices of tender in restricted procedure did not indicate criteria of reduction of the bidders.
All eight participating bidders complied with the qualification requirements, but the limited number of bidders was thus exceeded.
Thereafter, the committee proceeded on the basis of accidental selection – by drawing, which, at that time, was a legal step.
This way of selection, however, should have been mentioned as one of criteria just in the tender notice.
Summarised findings
Given the high risk of manipulation in the selection of bidders in restricted contract award procedures, both countries have introduced special arrangements to prevent illicit restrictions of competition.
The German rules restrict such opportunities for manipulation by means of the cross-check principle, by keeping lists of bidders confidential and by restricting the authority to make proposals for the selection of bidders to the contracting authorities.
Under the new Czech rules potential manipulative restrictions tend to be prevented mainly by the requirement that the number of bidders in restricted procedures must be unlimited.
However, the audit evidence generated revealed that part of these rules was poorly implemented and that the potential for an abusive restriction of the circle of bidders was not adequately reduced in these cases.
The contract-awarding authorities should completely eliminate the deficiencies pointed out.
Tendering phase
The tendering phase, in which potential contractors may draw up tenders on the basis of the tender documents which they have received, begins with the publication of the contract notice and/or with the invitation of tenders.
Potential tenderers may submit tenders until expiry of the deadline for submission, prescribed by the contracting authority.
Requirements of EU law and of corruption prevention
EU law does not impose special requirements for this phase of the tendering procedure.
The contracting authorities have to comply with the national provisions designed to counteract the potential for manipulation that exists during the bidding phase.
Such compliance especially relates to organiational arrangements and controls.
Provision of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
As a matter of principle, the tender documents on the basis of which the potential contractors are to work out their bids must always be sent out by the contracting authority.
Private independent professionals involved in the tendering procedure may not perform this task.
The contracting authority has to make sure, that all candidates receive the same information during the tendering phase.
In case of ambiguities in the tender documents or where other questions arise, only the contracting authority may furnish information to the candidates.
The independent professionals commissioned to draw up the tender documents may not provide any information.
During the entire tendering phase, any direct contact between the commissioned independent professionals and the candidates must be prevented.
The firms are not to become a turntable of the contract awarding procedure which enables contacts to be made that adversely affect competition.
Tenders forwarded by post or directly have to be submitted in a closed envelope.
Tenders communicated electronically must be technically encoded.
Differing provisions
In Germany, the contracting authority may commission external service providers to print and send out the tender documents, whose staff must be made to pledge to keep the bids secret and to perform contractual obligations with due care.
In Germany, the tenders received must be marked with a date of receipt stamp and directly and immediately forwarded unopened to a public servant who is responsible for keeping them in custody.
This public servant must not be involved in the tendering procedure.
The tenders received must be kept under lock and key until the opening date.
In the Czech Republic, the tenders received are marked with a file number.
The contracting authority draws up a memo with the tender data including contract numbers and information about the drawing up and receipt.
There are no detailed provisions about the custody of the tenders.
Key audit findings
BRH
BRH audits of the tendering phase focused on the contract award procedures of one building construction administration.
Posting of contract documents
The contract awarding authorities of the building construction administration audited either posted the tender documents themselves or had them printed and posted by an external service company.
Self-employed professionals did not post any tender documents.
Information furnished to bidders
In its designation of the contacts for making queries and obtaining information, the audited building construction administration largely did not comply with the rules for separating planning from the contract award procedure.
Contrary to applicable provisions, it often did not name staff of the contract awarding authority as contact in the specifications but rather staff from the project management units.
Some contract award notifications even included the names of the firms of self-employed professionals who had drawn up the tender documents.
There were isolated cases in which bidders who made inquiries during the bidding stage did not receive identical information.
Marking of tenders
In the construction administration audited, all tenders received were marked with a received stamp and a receipt note.
In the case of some negotiated procedures, however, the tenders were received by self-employed professionals, a practice which prevention rules. infringed the corruption
Úschova nabídek
Ne všechny nabídky byly poslány přímo a bez zpoždění k oficiálnímu uložení, aby byly uzamčeny v ocelové schránce.
In one construction authority, the tenders were temporarily placed in an open pigeonhole of the post room to which each staff member had access.
Another authority had placed a letter-box in a corridor not under constant surveillance and the tenders thrown into this box partly remained there over night.
Since the slot of that letter-box was large and unsecured, not only staff of the authority would have been able to retrieve and manipulate tenders received.
NKÚ
No shortcomings found out in the Czech Republic.
Summarised findings
Provisions are in place in both countries which are to prevent contacts especially between interested enterprises and independent professionals involved in the contract award procedure during the tendering stage.
Equal treatment is to be ensured by furnishing the same information to all bidders.
The rules for the reception, custody and secrecy of the tenders appear suitable for counteracting manipulation and corruption.
In Germany, the relevant requirements are somewhat more comprehensive than in the Czech Republic.
The audit evidence generated in Germany has highlighted infringements of the rules in some areas.
These deficiencies could be remedied with a small input of resources.
Opening of the envelopes
Opening of envelopes
During the bid-opening session, the bids that so far have remained closed will be opened and their contents will be read out and published.
The period during which the bidder is bound by his tender begins at a moment of bidders´ submission date expiry, eventually at the moment of envelopes opening, and ends by deadline set by contracting authority.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
EU law does not include any specific provisions about the opening of envelopes.
However, national laws and regulations comprise extensive requirements for the protection of the bids and of the competition during this highly sensitive phase of the contract award procedure.
The crosscheck principle and the transparency and traceability of the opening of envelopes are to prevent manipulations and modifications of the tenders submitted.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
The bid-opening session must be conducted by several persons to be designated by the contracting authority.
Compliance with the crosscheck principle is to prevent that individuals can manipulate bids without this being noticed.
In both countries, the bidders may in majority of cases attend opening session.
The envelopes when being opened, must have been lain in front of the leader of the proceedings when the first bid was opened.
Bids that have been received late may never be considered.
In order to ensure the transparency of the opening session, the actions taken and the results of bid-opening are to be recorded and the record, among other information, must contain the names of the bidders and the prices quoted.
The minutes must be read out and must be signed by the leader of the proceedings.
The bidders present may also sign the minutes.
Differing provisions
In the Czech Republic, a committee is in charge of the opening of bids.
The participation of independent professionals is permitted.
The Committee may be tasked with conducting subsequent phases of the contract award procedure, e.g. the evaluation of bids.
In Germany, the opening of bids is conducted by a leader of proceedings and a keeper of the minutes.
The leader of proceedings must be a staff member of a contracting authority.
The leader of proceedings and – in the case of building construction – the keeper of the minutes are not to be involved in drawing up the tender documents, in awarding the contract and in contract management.
The German provisions demand that the minutes of the opening session include not only the prices quoted by bidders but also any information about discounts and rebates and extraordinary features e.g. bids received that were damaged or arrived late.
In the Czech Republic, the minutes of the opening session put on record – apart from the prices quoted by bidders – the language of the bid and the applicant’s authority to sign it.
The German provisions require that all parts of the opened bids must be marked so as to prevent any subsequent modifications and amendments.
The bids, which are usually marked by perforation with the date of the opening session, must be kept secret after the opening session and may be made accessible only to the persons commissioned with processing them.
There are no similar Czech provisions.
If only one bid is received in any contract award procedure in the Czech Republic, the bid may not be opened and is to be returned without any evaluation.
In Germany, no similar provision exists. If only one bid is received, it has to be opened and subsequently evaluated.
Basic audit findings
BRH
Cross-checking principle
During the bid-opening sessions, the contracting authorities audited complied with the crosschecking requirement.
They conducted the bidopening sessions always with a session leader and a minute writer to whom no other tenderrelated tasks had been assigned.
In isolated cases of smaller negotiated contracts, however, self-employed professionals opened tenders sent to them, without involvement of the contracting authority.
Minutes
The minutes of the bid-opening sessions did not always completely document the opening of bids.
In some cases, the bids that had been submitted late were not included and in some cases, even signatures were missing.
Marking of bids
The contracting authorities examined in the course of the horizontal audit marked the bids by perforation with the date of the bid-opening session, thereby complying with the requirements.
Audits of grant recipients conducted in the past, had revealed inadequate marking.
These contracting authorities changed their marking practice in response to the BRH’s objection.
NKÚ
Time limit for the receipt of tenders
In case of contracts awarded for road repairs, one bid was received by the contracting authority only one month after expiry of the time limit for the submission of tenders. The contracting authority nevertheless admitted this bid.
Summarised findings
The rules in place in the two countries for opening the envelopes are largely identical. They take into account both the cross-check principle and the principle of transparency which permits a significant restriction of the risks of corruption and manipulation.
The German rules are more comprehensive than those of the Czech Republic.
Especially the requirements for the precise documentation of the procedure, on the marking, safe custody and secrecy of the tenders substantially restrict subsequent changes of the tenders.
Moreover, the officials responsible for opening the envelopes may not perform any other functions in connection with the contracts to be awarded.
The fact that the audits revealed few contraventions proves that the rules for the opening of envelopes are largely accepted.
Examination and evaluation of tenders
The contracting authority has to examine and evaluate the tenders that have been received by the envelope-opening day.
It has to award the contract to the tender which best meets the award criteria.
Requirements of EU law and of corruption prevention
EU law provides for a procedure in several stages:
The first step is to determine the suitability of the tenderers.
These must have a good economic and financial standing and the required professional and technical knowledge or ability.
Economic operators that have been convicted by final sentence for bribery or fraud must always be excluded from the tendering procedure.
The tenders of the tenderers not excluded must be evaluated in terms of arithmetical accuracy, technical feasibility and value for money and on the basis of the previously published contract award criteria.
The contracting authority has to determine the economically most favourable tender. The contracting authority has to examine especially any abnormally low prices offered.
The examination and evaluation stage of the tendering procedure is particularly vulnerable to manipulation.
For instance, tenderers may be excluded without due cause or tenders that not meet the requirements may be kept in the competition.
The result of the evaluation may unduly be influenced by giving preference to a tenderer or putting him at a disadvantage, thereby preventing the determination of the economically most favourable tender.
The contracting authority therefore has to make special arrangements particularly to ensure that the persons commissioned with the examination and evaluation meet the requirements of integrity and technical expertise.
It also has to make sure that the tendering procedure and the decisions taken are transparent and plausible.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
In line with EU requirements, the relevant provisions in both countries call for the examination and evaluation of tenders by successive stages.
The requirements for the proofs of suitability to be submitted by the enterprises, the evaluation criteria for deciding about the award and the weighting of these criteria have been laid down in the contract notices or the tender documents and may not be changed during the tendering procedure.
After checking the suitability of tenderers, the suitability criteria may no longer be applied in the evaluation of the tenders.
Such evaluation has to be made only on the basis of the contract award criteria.
The tenders submitted must first be examined under formal criteria as to whether they are complete and whether they include conspicuous features that suggest an intention to manipulate.
Where tenderers are excluded from the further examination and evaluation of their tenders, they have to be notified of this without delay.
If the evaluation of tenders results in a price that appears inappropriately low, the tenderer must be given the opportunity to comment on this prior to the potential exclusion of his tender.
The reasons for the decisions taken in the process must be documented transparently.
Differing provisions
In Germany, the tenders must be kept secret and only the persons commissioned to process them may have the right of access.
Only the contracting authority may review the tenders and verify their arithmetical accuracy.
This work may be assigned only to staff not involved in the contract award decision or the implementation of the project.
There are no precise regulations as to who may perform the further examination and evaluation tasks.
Where self-employed persons are commissioned to examine and evaluate the tenders, they have to honour the confidentiality of these tenders.
They only may make decision proposals to the contracting authority.
In the Czech Republic awarding committees are set up for checking and evaluating the tenders.
The committees produce an evaluation report with proposals for the contract award.
However, in both countries the ultimate decisions about contract awards are made only by the contracting authorities.
If, in Germany, proofs or declarations required to be presented in connection with the submission of tenders are incomplete, the contracting authority must give bidders the chance to submit the missing documents within six days.
Only if the documents have not yet been received after expiry of this deadline, the bid must be excluded.
In the Czech Republic, the contracting authority may at its own discretion decide whether or not to give bidders the opportunity to supplement missing proofs or declarations.
Unless the bidder presents them he must be excluded.
In Germany, not only the total price of tenders has to be examined but also the unit prices (prices of work segments).
If the price structure of the tender suggests that prices for parts of the work to be done have been estimated excessively low or high, the tenderer must be asked to clarify these issues.
If he does not succeed in doing so and if the contracting authority can prove compensatory pricing, the tender in question must be excluded.
This is to prevent that tenderers calculate their tenders on the basis of the assumption that substantial quantitative changes will be made for certain parts of the work performed, which may lead to significant increases in the cost of work projects.
In the Czech Republic, the overall price is evaluated but not the appropriateness of prices for parts of the work.
Compensatory pricing is no justification for the exclusion of a tender.
In Germany, no contract may be awarded to tenders whose price is inappropriately high or low.
Where one or few tenders differ by 10% or more from the price estimated by the contracting authority or from the other tenders, the tenderers must prove that their tenders have been soundly calculated.
If they are unable to do so, the contracting authority may exclude these tenders.
Once value for money has been examined, tenders in the Czech Republic may be cancelled if only tenders with an excessively low price that cannot be justified have been received.
Where prices of tenders are substantially higher than the one estimated by the contracting authority, this is not a valid reason for refusing to award the contract to that tender (contrary to German procurement law).
If, in Germany, there is a suspicion of behaviour restricting competition, the contracting authority must immediately report to the authority in charge of its technical oversight.
The latter has to decide about the action to be taken and whether it is appropriate to inform the cartel authority (antitrust authority) or the public prosecution service.
The oversight authority has to approve e.g. also where the works contract is worth more than € 50.000 and the contract has not been awarded to the lowest-priced tender, where the award is to be made by negotiated contract or where the tendering procedure is to be cancelled.
Czech rules do not deal with this issue.
Key audit findings
BRH
Examination of suitability and award criteria
Most contract award procedures examined complied with the requirements set.
In the case of some potential contractors recommended by self-employed professionals, the contract awarding authorities did not check the suitability of these companies themselves.
One grant recipient commissioned contractors although the required proofs of suitability were not completely at hand.
In the case of some tendering procedures, there was no sound evidence as to whether the contract awarding authority’s choice had taken into account all published award criteria or whether its contract award decision had been based only on the criterion of price.
Selection of persons involved and secrecy of the tenders
Some of the contracting authorities used the services of unauthorised persons.
For instance, self-employed professionals or staff of the construction offices that were involved in the planning or implementation of a work project performed functions whose discharge was incumbent exclusively on the contract awarding authority.
The construction authorities sought to justify this by inadequate staff resources in the sectors concerned.
In some cases, the self-employed professionals commissioned to examine the tenders used staff that had not been formally obliged to keep the tenders secret and to exercise due care in the fulfilment of their contractual commitments.
Concerning the construction authorities, there usually was no conclusive evidence as to whether the tenders, when in the custody of the self-employed professionals, were accessible only for the persons to which their processing was directly assigned.
Review and arithmetical check of the tenders
Some contracting authorities handed over the opened tenders to self-employed professionals for further examination without having first performed the prescribed review of tenders and arithmetical check and documented the results of these examinations.
In case of any intention to manipulate, third parties could have made changes in the tenders which the contracting authorities would not have been able to identify.
The documents examined revealed a number of cases in which unusual features were not adequately marked or where information about prices and products was missing.
Performance audits
A sample audit in a construction authority revealed that, in 75% of all contract award procedures, the most favourable tenders deviated by more than 10% from the estimates made beforehand.
One in twenty contract award procedures was cancelled owing to inappropriate tender prices.
In a number of cases, there was a lack of evidence or sufficient documentation about examinations of tenders or discussions with tenderers held to clarify questions.
In many cases, detailed information was missing, e.g. concerning unit prices of the most important items in the invoices.
Factors such as changed market prices or increases of material costs were frequently given as reasons for the deviations.
The construction authorities stated that identifying and proving compensatory pricing was difficult.
In the case of one invitation to tender issued by a non-departmental body, the lowest price quoted in a tender was 66% lower than the previous estimate of the contract value.
Closer examinations of costing or investigations to identify the causes of this deviation were not on record.
In a discussion to clarify the question, the contract awarding authority did not find any evidence as to price dumping by the tenderer to whom the contract was eventually awarded.
Thus, it remained unclear whether the previous estimate was excessive or the tender price was too low.
Later, the contract awarding authority classified the contractor as “low-cost company” which was neither able to meet the quality requirements nor the deadlines.
In another tendering procedure, the construction authority adjudicated the contract to a tender whose price was 35% higher than the original cost estimate.
It did not cancel the tendering procedure, adducing the unfounded argument that the company in question could be expected not to base its pricing on unreasonably high costs.
Suspicion of irregularities
Two cases of irregularities were found in one audited construction authority and reported to the authority responsible for technical supervision.
In one tendering procedure, two bidders submitted identical cost calculations which prompted the construction authority to exclude both tenders.
The audits did not reveal any significant deficiencies in the application of the other provisions.
NKÚ
Verification of the suitability
In many of the construction projects audited such as university buildings, road and railway construction, and others, the contracting authorities did not exclude the bidders from participation in the procedure, even if they did not comply with the requirements of tender documentation or they did not prove their qualification in the extent prescribed. On the other hand, one contracting authority could neither prove nor explain the reason of excluding a bidder who complied with the requirements.
Evaluation
When awarding a contract for the construction of a water treatment plant the contracting authority did not base its examination and evaluation on the defined evaluation criteria.
In case of rail road construction, the contracting authority determined the weight of evaluation criteria as late as in the beginning of evaluation.
In case of road repairs, the defined criterion of “construction period shortening” was evaluated inappropriately.
As a result, the shortening offered by the bidders that were second and third in the competition was not adequately taken into account.
Documentation of the reasons why a bidder was selected
In three contract award procedures for the support of housing, the contracting authority did not document what criteria were used in the course of evaluation and what was the way of selection of successful bidder.
When awarding small scale contracts worth up to €20 000 in connection with a motorway construction, the contracting authority selected the bidders only on the basis of telephone consultations concerning the prices and terms of deliveries.
It was impossible to audit these selections, because these consultations were not documented.
Summarised findings
In both countries, the rules for examining and evaluating the tenders comply with EU requirements.
However, they differ with respect to detailed steps of the procedure and the selection of the individuals involved.
In Germany, the steps of the procedure are governed by stricter and more detailed requirements, especially concerning the implementation of the cross-check principle and the protection of bids than in the Czech Republic.
The same applies to the rules for verifying the appropriateness of the prices quoted.
In both countries it was found that in some of the cases audited essential steps of the procedure for examining and evaluating the tenders were not documented at all or, if they were, only incompletely.
However, the lack of an audit trail and of transparency in respect of the decisions taken during examination and evaluation facilitates manipulations.
A particularly grave deficiency was the handing over of tenders to third parties without prior appropriate examination and documentation of the tenders by the contract-awarding authority which would have prevented any manipulations.
Where contract-awarding authorities commission third parties to perform functions in connection with the examination and evaluation of tenders, appropriate arrangements and enhanced control are necessary to counteract the increased risk of manipulation.
When auditing the appropriateness of prices, the audited administrative entities in Germany did not always make use of the complete range of tools available and thus inadequately explored the price structure.
In the Czech Republic, the audit revealed irregularities especially in connection with the examination of suitability and the application of the evaluation criteria.
Completion of the tendering procedure
Once the tenders have been examined and evaluated, the tendering procedure is completed by awarding the contract or by cancelling the procedure.
Requirements of EU law and corruption prevention
In case of EU-wide tendering procedures, all tenderers must be notified in advance of the contract award decision taken.
The contractors have the opportunity to examine the intended decision within a period of 10 or 15 days and to seek a review where appropriate.
No contract may be concluded before expiry of this period.
If forwarded electronically or per fax, the limitation period is 10 days. If other means of communication are used, it is 15 days.
If a bidder applies for review within the notification period, a contract may be concluded only after the final decision taken in the review procedure.
Moreover, the enterprises may refer the award decision made under this procedure to an independent court of law for further review.
The review is to ensure both legal protection given to the contractors and compliance with procurement law by the contracting authority.
The contracting authority must adequately document the tendering procedure.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
Both countries have implemented the EU provisions about the information and review procedure.
In both countries, the decision about awarding the contract lies with the contracting authority.
The latter may however not arbitrarily deviate from the result of a duly conducted examination and evaluation.
The contracting authority is to award the contract within the announced examination period.
The reason is the fact that the bidders are no longer bound by their tenders once this period has expired.
In open and restricted procedures and public or restricted invitations to tender, the contracting authority may not stipulate a content of the contract which deviates from that of the tender.
The unsuccessful bidders are to be notified on a timely basis of the award decision made and the reasons why their respective bids have not been accepted.
The cancellation of tendering procedures is admissible only if certain conditions are met, e.g. if the prices quoted in the tenders are excessivesind or the tenders do not conform to the specifications.
Differing provisions
In the Czech Republic, the 10 or 15 days obligatory information and waiting period before awarding the contract also applies to work contracts that do not require Europe-wide tendering.
In Germany, the equivalent provision only applies to EU-wide tendering procedures.
In all other tendering procedures in Germany, the tenderers my not be informed about the contract award until the award decision has been taken.
In the Czech Republic, a tendering procedure must be cancelled, if only one tender has been received or only one tender met the requirements for being considered and evaluated.
In Germany, the contract must also be awarded, if only one single tender has been received, provided that this tender meets the conditions set forth in the tender documents and is cost-effective.
Key audit findings
BRH
Only few deficiencies in the completion of the tendering procedures audited were found.
In some cases of EU-wide tendering, companies received commissioning letters before expiry of the notification period, which may render the contract void.
Also, in some cases of open procedures, commissioning letters included modifications incompatible with the contents of the tender, e.g. new deadlines.
In several cases, the contracting authorities did not comply with the deadlines for awarding the contracts.
In case of an open procedure, the contracting authority commissioned the second most favourable bidder, because a bidder whose tender price was more than 50 % lower was no longer willing to perform the contract at the price originally quoted.
NKÚ
In case of a construction project in the field of higher education, the contracting authority did not conclude the contract with the bidder in correspondence to the contract proposal indicated in the bid of selected supplier.
In some contract award cases, such as repair and maintenance of the roads, construction of a motorway and of road circle, the contracting authorities concluded the contracts later than prescribed by law.
In case of contracts awarded in the context of exmilitary areas reconstructions, contracting authority dispatched the information of selected bid to all bidders only after expiration of legal deadline.
Summarised findings
Both countries have implemented the EU provisions about the completion of tendering procedures.
The legal protection of unsuccessful bidders contributes to reducing corruption.
Within Czech procurement law, the purview of legal protection also encompasses awards falling below EU thresholds.
In both countries, it was found that the limitation period for awarding contracts had been exceeded.
This may result in adverse economic consequences and increase the risk of manipulation.
In future, the construction authorities should eliminate such shortcomings in completing tender procedures.
Documentation, notification and reporting duties
During the successive steps of the contractaward procedures, relevant findings and decisions and their underlying reasons must be documented in a transparent way.
In case of EUwide procedure, contract awards are to be publicly announced.
The data on the contract awards are also included in EU statistics.
Requirements of EU law and of corruption prevention
The obligation to document contract-award procedures complies with a basic requirement of the transparency principle that applies EU-wide.
Only a careful and timely documentation ensures transparency as to the contract-award decisions and the reasons underlying them. In particular, it ensures the effective legal protection of bidders’ interests in cases where the contract value exceeds the EU thresholds.
Due documentation is also an essential ingredient to corruption prevention since the obligation to give detailed justifications for contract-award decisions significantly reduces the scope for manipulation.
In the case of EU-wide contract-award procedures, the contracting authorities have to notify all awards made under EU-wide contractaward procedures to the EU’s Office of Official Publications not later than 48 days after the contract award date.
The Office publishes the notifications in the EU’s Official Journal and thus also honours the transparency requirement.
The contracting authorities must collect the essential data on their contract-award procedures and report them to the EU Commission via the relevant national ministries.
On this basis, the EU Commission produces annual statistics which enable it to obtain an overview of the development of the Single Market in the field of construction works.
Provisions of German and Czech procurement law
Identical or similar provisions
Both countries have completely transposed into national law the provisions of EU law concerning documentation and notification.
The provisions on documentation and notification for the purpose of EU statistics are largely identical in both countries.
Differing provisions
In the Czech Republic, the duty to publish contract awards does not only apply to EU-wide procurements but also to national contract-award procedures.
The deadline for notification is only 15 days.
In Germany, public announcement duties apart from those imposed by EU law apply only to restricted tendering exceeding a threshold of €25,000 and discretionary awarding of contracts (negotiated contracts) exceeding a threshold of €15,000 VAT excluded (so-called ex-post transparency).
Below these thresholds and in the case of public tenders, only the participating enterprises are given information about the contract awards.
Basic audit findings
BRH
Documentation
A large number of the tendering procedures audited were not documented completly.
The contract award notices did not include all necessary information about e.g. reasons for product specifications and national regulations.
In the case of one tendering procedure, the contracting authority did not give any reason why it had awarded the contract to a bidder whose tender did not include obligatory proofs.
In a few cases, documentation of the contracting authorities did not include all records required for documenting the tendering procedure.
Publication of contract awards
In the case of some EU-wide tendering procedures, the contracting authorities failed to publish the contract award notices.
In the case of several tendering procedures, the proofs for the publication of contract award notices by the contracting authorities were missing.
Reporting duties
The statistical compilations reviewed included the required minimum information and had been produced and posted on a timely basis.
Ex-post transparency
In most cases, the construction administrations audited published the contract data of the completed tendering procedure.
In the case of one construction administration, however, these data were not published due to a communication error.
It took the construction administration half a year to notice the mistake.
As a result, contract data of the tendering procedures completed during that period were not published.
NKÚ
Documentation
In case of construction work connected with a large sports event considerable shortcomings in documentation in course of procurement procedure were found out, which concerned mainly incorrect data e.g. in evaluation committee records concerning the bid prices.
In adition, some of the minutes about the opening of envelopes were not signed.
Publication of contract awards
In case of repairs and maintenance of road construction projects, announcements of contracts awarded were distributed after the deadline, resp. they were not published.
Summarised findings
The provisions on documentation, reporting and notification implement the EU requirements and are largely identical in both countries.
This generally ensures the transparency of contract-award procedures and award decisions.
The Czech publication requirements are somewhat stricter than their German counterparts.
The examination revealed shortcomings substantially reducing the value of documentation and publication as a means of corruption prevention.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The construction authorities should further enhance the transparency of their contract award procedures and should fully meet reporting and notification requirements.
Summarised evaluation and recommendations
The parallel audits of the NKU and the BRH focused on two issues which are essential both in the Czech Republic and in Germany for the awarding of public works contracts: the application of EU procurement law and the prevention of corruption.
The provisions of EU law provide the opportunity for international competition within the EU in order to create a European Single Market.
Measures designed to prevent corruption do not only aim at avoiding or at least reducing corruption. They are also to prevent financial damage and potential loss of confidence in the integrity of government.
The audit findings generated by the two SAIs with respect to the application of procurement law in both countries and the comparison of the respective provisions of procurement law provide an insight into the common and differing features that may be helpful for both countries in further developing their procurement law and its application.
Application of EU procurement law
Both countries have transposed into national law the EU legislation concerning the awarding of public works contracts.
Thus, an important common basis exists in both countries for the awarding of public works contracts and the compliance with the essential requirements in this field: competition; equal treatment of the participating enterprises and transparency of the contract award procedure.
The construction administrations of both countries have underpinned these requirements by partly very extensive administrative regulations.
The Czech Republic has largely adopted the provisions on public works contracts requiring EU-wide tendering for those contract award procedures that are below the EU threshold and are therefore governed by national law.
However, the SAIs‘ audits revealed that the construction administrations did not always fully comply with all relevant provisions of EU-law.
The construction administration in Germany should continue to improve the quality of its contract award procedures in order to eliminate the deficiencies pointed out with respect to the implementation of EU requirements.
In the Czech Republic, the audits furthermore identified the risks impacting on the value for money achieved in contract award procedures.
For instance, incomplete specification of the public contract subject, resulting in need of extra works, often awarded in contradiction to the law. Furthermore, insufficient specification of the expected price was provided. Also, qualification requirements limited the possible number of bidders, thus restricting competition, namely in the area of transport constructions.
Corruption prevention
Our audits did not aim at detecting cases of corruption.
One of the reasons was that the SAIs do not have the necessary tools at their disposal.
However, the SAIs can check whether the administrations of the two countries have adopted measures to curb corruption and manipulation in connection with awards of public works contracts and how these measures are applied.
In respect of corruption prevention, the two countries have focused on different aspects.
The German provisions mainly provide for largely unrestricted competition, transparency and checks as central elements of corruption prevention.
The Czech provisions mainly aim at increasing the transparency of the procedures.
BRH
In Germany, general principles of corruption prevention are in place that apply to the entire federal administration.
These principles have also been implemented in the requirements for awarding public works contracts and have been adapted to meet the special needs of such contract awards.
The relevant provisions specify, partly with great precision, the ways in which the requirements of corruption prevention need to be met in the course of the contract award procedure and the selection of the persons involved in them.
In the BRH’s opinion, especially the principle that preference must be given to open procedures or public invitations to tender is a suitable tool for substantially reducing the risk of corruption in connection with the awarding of public works contracts, while restrictions of competition increase the risk of manipulation.
Risk analyses and adequate controls (especially the cross-check principle), the requirements concerning transparency, the documentation of contract award procedures and various organisational measures are also effective mechanisms to prevent corruption and manipulation.
We therefore do not perceive any need for fundamental changes of the respective provisions public entities have to comply with when awarding public works contracts.
The provisions on corruption prevention are largely implemented in practice.
The deficiencies found in some areas have highlighted weaknesses in complying with some requirements.
Therefore, the construction administrations should offer further training to their staff to enhance their familiarity with the requirements for corruption prevention and further increase their awareness of this issue.
An essential part of the weaknesses highlighted referred to tasks which the construction administrations had delegated to self-employed professionals.
However, in the absence of adequate checks and controls, the delegation of tasks increases the risk of abuse.
Tasks vulnerable to manipulation and corruption should therefore only be assigned to third parties, if the administration can guarantee a sufficient degree of protection against undue interference.
NKÚ
The Czech Republic adopted on governmental level the anti-corruption strategies which focus on public procurement.
Essential amendments of the Act on public contracts award and connecting implementation rules were made.
The NKÚ audits were carried out in the period of realization of this strategy.
The adopted strategy and new legal provisions may represent the efficient measures for improvement, whereas the contracting authorities have to justify effectiveness of public contracts, calculation of expected prices, adequacy of qualification requirements, definition of the basic evaluation criteria and the way of bid evaluation, and all that must be duly documented and published.
Recommendations
On the whole, the NKU and BRH have a favourable opinion about the way the EU requirements are implemented.
The fact that they are largely accepted in practice has confirmed that the EU requirements of competition, equal treatment and transparency are a suitable basis for awarding public works contracts within the European Union.
The supranational model implemented in the European Union may also serve as a basis for similar projects designed to facilitate and encourage international competition.
In view of the enormous potential for material and ideal damage from manipulation and corruption in connection with the awarding of public works projects, both SAIs hold that it is the duty of the construction administrations to continue their measures against corruption and manipulation and, where possible, to improve them.
In particular, the organisational structures and processes of the contract award procedures should be monitored continuously for weaknesses and risks in order to identify and respond to any need for corrective action.
Comparison of the Czech and the German practice indicates that the volume of open procedures offering the large space for competition and substantially decreasing the chances of corruption acts should be enforced in the Czech Republic.
Also, an increased segmentation of construction work into lots may positively impact on achieved price, if it results in more competition due to a higher number of bidders.
Ensuring the correct implementation of contract award procedures is an essential basis for efficient public sector procurement.
In Germany, the procedures are organized by special state institutions, while in the Czech Republic, except of the transport constructions, they are organized by central institutions themselves or by their contractual entities.
The SAIs of both countries wish to further develop the findings relevant to their work and, where appropriate, to raise the related issues with their respective Parliament and Government even beyond the completion of their joint project.
Furthermore, both SAIs are convinced that the principles of procurement law and their implementation described in this report are also matters of interest at the level of the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI), since the principles and findings expounded are of general importance for effectively curbing corruption and for ensuring that public works contracts are awarded under a regime of well-functioning and fair competition and that good value for money is obtained.

JOINT FINAL REPORT on the Results of Parallel Audits of Excise Duty Administration in the Slovak Republic and in the Czech Republic
Joint Report of the SAO of the Czech Republic and the SAO of the Slovak Republic
May 2017
Supreme Audit Office, Slovak Republic
Supreme Audit Office, Czech Republic
Introduction
This joint report provides information about the course and outcome of international cooperation on parallel audits conducted by the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic (“Slovak SAO”) and the Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (“Czech SAO”) in the field of excise duty administration in 2012-2015.
The cooperation between the Supreme Audit Institutions of both countries was carried out based on an agreement on cooperation on parallel audits of excise duty administration concluded between them in August 2015.
The topic of the parallel audits was chosen because both EU Member States follow common European legislation on this matter, thereby providing an opportunity to ascertain how European legislation is applied on a national level, how the excise duty administration system is set up, and how the system in Slovakia and the system in the Czech Republic differ.
The greatest benefits of these audits consisted in the exchange of experience, identification of differences and good practice.
Last, but not least, finding out that international comparability of data on efficiency and effectiveness of excise duty administration is extremely limited without performing parallel audits was also beneficial.

Results of Parallel Audits of Excise Duty Administration
Summary and assessment
Legislation in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia on excise duty and its administration complies with EU legislation and exceeds EU requirements substantially.
Differences have been discovered between Slovak and Czech excise duty regulations: in the Czech Republic, verification of the economic stability of applicants for permits and mandatory labelling and dyeing of several mineral and some other oils contribute to effective excise duty administration; in Slovakia, the distribution of excise stamps is simpler than in the Czech Republic and less of a burden on excise duty administrators.
In the fight against excise duty evasion, supervising the movement of raw tobacco or tobacco materials, the implementation of the institute of a transport fuel distributor, and keeping a registry of merchants of consumer packaged alcohol appear to be a good practice in the fight against excise duty evasion.
Excise duty revenues in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia grow more slowly than other tax revenues.
The objectives of the EU consisting in reducing labour taxation, introducing green measures, and reducing dependencies on tobacco and alcohol have not been yet implemented in the Czech Republic and Slovakia also because excise duty indexation has not been introduced in either country.
This has resulted in the reduced importance of excise duties on total tax revenues and, due to growing buying power, an actual drop in the tax burden in the form of excise duties.
In future, it will be necessary to replace the introduced green measures which the state subsidises and which have a negative impact on excise duty revenues by other revenues or by a reduction in public spending.
Administrative expenditure on excise duty administration in both the Czech Republic and Slovakia have been rising long especially because of wage growth and the diminishing effectiveness of such spending.
In Slovakia, such effectiveness is also negatively affected by the costs of computerisation of excise duty administration (IT expenditures) and the payroll costs of employees carrying out constant fiscal supervision in alcohol warehouses.
Computerisation of excise duty administration in Slovakia has not significantly affected the number of excise duty administrators.
Both the Czech and the Slovak SAO recommend that the Slovak Tax Directorate reassesses the justification for constant fiscal supervision in alcohol warehouses.
In the Czech Republic, the effectiveness of administrative expenditures is influenced by the fact that, in the audited period, the Czech Customs Administration did not apply procedures that would lead to a reduction in the staffing required for excise duty administration.
In each of the audited years, the number of comparable administrative tasks performed by excise duty administrators in Slovakia and in the Czech Republic was similar; however, the number of comparable tax subjects in Slovakia is about one third smaller than in the Czech Republic.
Slovak excise duty administrators perform administrative tasks predominantly in the form of physical fiscal supervision, whereas Czech excise duty administrators place emphasis on remote supervision and risk analysis.
Excise duty administration in Slovakia is administratively more demanding than in the Czech Republic and, with regard to the ratio of tax actions to entities, more expensive as well.
Excise duty administration in the Czech Republic and Slovakia was computerised in different areas.
In Slovakia, the administration of excise declarations is fully computerised; in the Czech Republic, documents proving taxation of various products in free circulation are submitted electronically.
As both computerisation methods support effective excise duty administration, both the Czech SAO and the Slovak SAO recommend applying them outside these two countries as well.
Total expenditures on implementing the Excise Movement and Control System (“EMCS”) could not be compared, as the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic only provided expenditure data pertaining to the system upgrade that took place between 2011 and 2015, although spending occurred even prior to this period.
Expenditure in the mentioned period only on the EMCS upgrade was 20% higher than total spending in the Czech Republic on both implementing and upgrading of the EMCS over a period exceeding ten years.
Excise duty administration in the Czech Republic and Slovakia did not attain comparable qualitative indicator values in comparable spending.
The level of supervision in both countries is comparable; in Slovakia, however, excise duty administration is much more demanding on resources.
Implementation of a computerised system for the movement and surveillance of excisable products has resulted in more effective excise duty administration in both countries but less so in Slovakia, as Slovakia spent much more than the Czech Republic on implementing and modernising the system.
Basic information
Cooperation of both audit institutions was based on the “Agreement on Cooperation on Parallel Audits of Excise Duty Administration” dated 18 August 2015.
The Czech SAO and the Slovak SAO agreed to conduct parallel audits aimed primarily at excise duty administration.
The results of the audits would allow analysis, comparison, and assessment of the findings.
The audit questions on which the parallel audits were based were agreed jointly.
Characteristics of the subject and objectives of the parallel audits: The parallel audits aimed to compare the performance of the excise duty administrators while taking into account qualitative and quantitative indicators and identifying weaknesses in the excise duty administration process.
Answers to the following audit questions in particular should have been sought:
Have excise duty administrators in the Czech Republic and Slovakia been attaining comparable values of qualitative indicators while incurring comparable costs?
Has implementation of the EMCS resulted in more effective excise duty administration and has been spending on its implementation effective?
The parallel audits should have ascertained the reasons for the differences affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of excise duty administration in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia, especially in the area of legislation and in the setup of the organisational structure.
The joint final report on the audit results was drawn up in accordance with ISSAI 300 - Fundamental Principles of Performance Auditing.
The General Directorate of Customs (“GDC”) and the Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic (“FD SR”) have joined the joint declaration on mutual cooperation of the Visegrad Four countries, the aim of which - in the area of excise duty - is to fight fraud, examine the possibility of harmonising legal regulations and finding harmonised interpretations of rules of various problems, examine the possibility of joint activities to increase the effectiveness of efforts to detect fraud, and share experience and best practice.
1 EMCS is operated according to Decision No 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 on computerising the movement and surveillance of excisable products.

Excise duty legislation in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia
Legislation on excise duty administration can be divided into two levels:
EU legislation (see Annex 1) and national legislation (see Annex 2). Council Directive 2008/118/EC concerning the general arrangements for excise duty and repealing Directive 92/12/EEC defines excise duty and lays down the basic rules for excise duty administration and the handling of energy products and electricity, tobacco products, ethyl alcohol, and alcoholic beverages.
This directive allows excise duties to be imposed on other products as well.
EU legislation regulates especially the minimum conditions for the following: Excise duty rates on specific products; Criteria for production, storage, processing, and holding excisable products; Establishment of the excise duty obligation; Excise duty exemption and refund; and Supervision over movement of various goods between EU Member States, international cooperation, and maintenance of a registry of economic entities and tax warehouses.
EU legislation allows the implementation of control procedures and institutions on the national level, provided that these do not lead to a distortion of competition.
Excise duty legislation in the Czech Republic
Specification of legislation in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, excise duty provisions are concentrated in the Excise Duty Act (Act No 353/2003 Coll.), which governs the administration of duty on mineral oil, duty on ethyl alcohol, duty on tobacco products, duty on beer, duty on wine and intermediate products, and duty on raw tobacco.
This act defines the forms of handling excisable products, duty payers, authorisation proceedings, conditions for moving products, excise declarations and penalties for violating legal regulations.
This act and the related decrees further regulate certain other conditions for handling mineral oils (marking mineral oils) and storing raw tobacco for purposes other than production of tobacco products.
Duties on other energy products (i.e., natural gas and some other gases, solid fuels, and electricity) are regulated in Parts 45-47 of Act No 261/2007 Coll., on stabilisation of public budgets.
In the Czech Republic, some special legal regulations contain several provisions related to excise duty administration, specifically the Fuels Act (Act No 311/2006 Coll.) and implementing regulations governing the conditions for selling, dispensing, and distributing fuel and keeping records of fuel placed in free circulation.
Act No 61/1997 Coll., on ethyl alcohol, and its implementing regulations define the conditions for producing, storing, recording, and controlling the production and circulation of ethyl alcohol.
Act No 307/2013 Coll., on mandatory labelling of spirits, and the related implementing regulations set out the mandatory labelling of consumer packaged alcohol, the conditions for using alcohol excise stamps, and the conditions for handling ethyl alcohol (i.e., production, processing, sale or other transfer, carriage, movement, storage, receipt, use, holding, import, or export).
The procedures in duty proceedings that are not set out in special regulations are regulated by Act No 280/2009 Coll., the Tax Code.
Penalties are imposed according to Act No 500/2004 Coll., the Code of Administrative Procedure.
The conditions for issuing trade licences (concessions) for carrying out the business of “production and processing of fuel and lubricants and distribution of fuels” and “production, modification, and sale of fermented ethyl alcohol, potable ethyl alcohol, and alcoholic beverages” are regulated by Act No 455/1991 Coll., on trades (the Trade Licensing Act).
The Czech Republic made use of its right to introduce control procedures and concepts for checking the movement of specific products placed in free circulation and overseeing the observance of legal regulations on handling various products on which excise duty has not been paid and on handling various products on which excise duty has been paid.
This applies to the handling of special mineral oils and raw tobacco, marking certain other mineral oils, and labelling tobacco products and consumer packaged alcohol.
The Czech Republic made use of its rights to impose excise duty on other products as well and introduced excise duty on raw tobacco as one of the measures against tax fraud.
Structure of amendments to legislation on each type of excise duty in relation to the subject of the audit in the Czech Republic
Based on Resolution No 735/2012 of the Government of the Czech Republic of 3 October 2012 implementing the “plan for zero tolerance of the alcohol black market”, fundamental legislative changes took place in the Czech Republic between 2012 and 2015 leading to the implementation of measures against excise duty fraud on ethyl alcohol.
In the same period, several amendments were made to legislation regulating duty on mineral oil, duty on tobacco products, and the criminal offence of planning tax evasion.
Criminal law protection of taxable revenues
Effective since 1 July 2016, planning “evasion of taxes, fees, and similar mandatory payments” has become a criminal offence, making it easier for the police to adopt measures in a more effective and timely manner to prevent tax fraud by, for example, deploying criminal intelligence operations.
General provisions on excise duty administration
The issuance of authorisations (licences) to handle excisable products pursuant to the Excise Tax Act is, effective since 1 January 2015, conditional upon satisfaction of the following: Credibility; Debt-free status; Economic stability; Possession of a trade licence allowing activities related to the authorisation; and Fact that the applicant is not in liquidation or in bankruptcy.
The aim of the legislation was to address tax arrears by reducing the number of entities with authorisation to handle excisable products.
The condition of economic stability now allows an excise duty administrator to consider the financial situation of tax entities both during the authorisation proceedings and after the authorisation is issued.
The purpose of this measure is to bar subjects without sufficient income that would allow them to duly satisfy duty obligations from handling certain products.
To assess the economic stability of applicants, several indicators have been laid down (profitability, liquidity, financial stability, activity, and productivity of labour), based on which a financial analysis is carried out.
In addition to these indicators, the final decision is also based on the excise duty administrator’s judgment with regard to the specific conditions of the respective proceedings.
The law sets out the frequency for checking the fulfilment of the conditions of economic stability based on current conditions as once a year in connection with the submission of the tax declaration.
The excise duty administrator can stipulate other conditions required for duty administration.
If the authorisation holder is no longer fulfilling the conditions, the excise duty administrator is authorised to cancel or suspend the authorisation.
Out of a total of 2,609 entities examined for economic stability by the Czech Customs Administration, 18.6% were found to be economically unstable with a high risk of arrears should the obligation to declare and pay tax exceed the amount of the tax guarantee (e.g., recurring consignee).
The authorisation of ten entities was cancelled; other applicants increased the amount of the tax guarantees, capitalised their contribution in their company, or submitted current data from their bookkeeping to show they satisfied all the conditions for receiving authorisation.
The conditions of credibility and debt-free status must also be satisfied by an individual (natural person) who is a governing body or a member of such body or by an individual who may not be the applicant’s governing body or member of such body but is carrying out this activity (chaining of legal entities in the position of governing body or member, so-called linked entities).
By the end of 2016, there were scrutinized more than 30,000 linked entities.
Records kept pursuant to the Excise Duty Act (Sections 37-40 and Section 60 of Act No 353/2003 Coll.) must contain the following data:
Type, name, code and amount of goods produced, received, issued or dispatched, categorised according to type of duty arrangement (duty suspension, import, placement back under duty suspension, export, free circulation, own consumption, loss);
Identifier (SEED ID) of consignee or consignor of various goods, declarant, event date, and date of entry in the records;
Movement of various goods (e.g., means of transport, carrier, transport number)
Registration numbers of related documents; and
Notification of placement of consumer packaged alcohol bearing an excise stamp into free circulation and data on its distribution.
A record of receipt must be drawn up immediately once transport ends.
Electronic recordkeeping has to be maintained in xls, xlsx or ods format, or it has to be possible to convert output into such format.
Ethyl Alcohol
After 2012, the Czech Republic introduced comprehensive measures consisting in a detailed overview of the operations of entities (see Annex 3, Diagram A), from production of raw ethyl alcohol and labelling with alcohol excise stamps to distribution to the final merchants or authorised users of duty-exempt ethyl alcohol.
In the Czech Republic, alcohol facilities not in operation are also subject to supervision by the customs authorities.
The aim of the new legislation was to improve the overview of ethyl alcohol processing and ethyl alcohol production, identify the persons handling consumer packaged alcohol, limit the handling of ethyl alcohol to financially stable and credible persons and ensure constant supervision over the production and labelling of alcohol.
The most important measures are as follows: Ethyl alcohol production, receipt, storage, and dispatch records contain information about the amount of ethyl alcohol in each stage of production and processing with document numbers indicated.
Restrictions on package volume, material of consumer packaged goods, and on the number of packages with a damaged excise stamp at the point of final sale or dispatch to consumers.
Consumer packaging means a container or other package holding a maximum of one litre or, if a container is made of glass, three litres.
Ethyl alcohol in bigger packaging is considered as being unmarked and may not be handled.
At the point of final sale to individuals for consumption, there can only be one consumer packaged item with a damaged excise stamp or, if the packaging is equipped with a one-way valve, three consumer packaged items with a damaged excise stamp.
Mandatory registration of persons who place consumer packaged alcohol with at least 15% ethyl alcohol per volume into free circulation and who are ethyl alcohol importers or producers in the Czech Republic or operators of warehouses under duty suspension, provided personal and technical conditions are met.
The personal conditions of credibility, integrity, and no record of being banned from doing business have to be met by the applicant and the person acting in the capacity of the statutory body or a responsible person.
Depending on the number of alcohol excise stamps ordered, the applicant has to pay a guarantee of CZK 100,000-5,000,000 (i.e., approx. EUR 3,700-185,000).
The technical conditions for registration include suitability of the alcohol labelling site and a camera security system that is located in the labelling facilities or warehouse, operates continuously and allows remote access to the duty administrator.
Registration markings of the excise stamp are used for labelling alcohol with a volume greater than 0.06 litres.
During movement of the alcohol excise stamps, the registration markings of the alcohol excise stamps must be indicated in the transport documents or, in the case of export, in the customs declaration.
Until 30 November 2013, alcohol excise stamps contained a 10-digit registration code that included a 4-digit offtake registration number, excise stamp application code, and ethanol concentration level classification code.
Effective of 1 December 2013, excise stamps contain two types of identifiers and the amount of ethyl alcohol in the consumer packaged alcohol expressed in millilitres of ethanol at 20°C, rounded down to whole millilitres.
[Registration Code, which is a 12-digit alphanumeric code - 1st to 4th position – registration offtake code of the person obliged to label alcohol - 5th to 8th position – information expressing the date of the excise stamp order - 9th to 12th position – information identical to the information allowing determination of the excise tax base Special 8-digit alphanumeric code comprising a unique, unrepeatable code allocated to only one excise stamp Electronically readable version of the special code allowing verification of the code on the excise stamp Source: Decree No 334/2013 of 17 October 2013] The alcohol excise stamp record contains daily entries on the ways in which the alcohol excise stamps are used according to the registration codes, as well as the documents that the entries are based on.
In case of destruction, loss, or theft of specific alcohol excise stamps, the holder is obliged to inform the excise duty administrator electronically on the next business day following the decisive event about the registration codes of the relevant alcohol excise stamps and the number of stamps in question.
Introduction of new offences and adjustment of the amounts of penalties imposed in case of a breach of legal regulations in connection with handling alcohol excise stamps.
Penalties may be imposed up to the amount of the excise duty or even exceed such amount ten times (e.g., in case of damage or loss of alcohol excise stamps exceeding 0.1% of the total amount of each executed order of alcohol excise stamps or in case of failure to return alcohol excise stamps by the statutory deadline).
Restrictions on handling alcohol excise stamps to allow only registered holders to do so. They may not assign the stamps to other persons except foreign suppliers for the purpose of labelling consumer packaged alcohol manufactured outside the Czech Republic.
Exported alcohol excise stamps have to be affixed to the consumer packaging and imported back within nine months of when the stamps were received from the duty administrator.
Mandatory registration of distributors of consumer packaged alcohol under the condition of satisfaction of similar conditions as in the case of a person obliged to label alcohol, with an obligation to pay a guarantee of up to CZK 5,000,000 (i.e., approx. € 185,000).
Specification of persons allowed to sell or purchase consumer packaged alcohol.
Authorised persons are obliged to sell consumer packaged alcohol to other registered persons, to final sellers, or they can sell it as final sellers themselves.
They may purchase alcohol from other registered persons, liquidators (insolvency administrators, receivers), administrative authorities, government establishments, or unregistered persons in connection with tax execution procedure.
Holders and distributors of alcohol are obliged to send notifications of placement of alcohol into free circulation or of the sale of consumer packaged alcohol in free circulation on the day immediately following the day after the decisive event to the duty administrator through the information system operated by the duty administrator (ORO WebKlient) or, upon observing content requirements, in xml format.
The notification contains the number of alcohol excise stamps used and the type of consumer packaging, percentage volume of ethyl alcohol, European Article Number (EAN), identification of distributor or final seller and the name of the product and production batch number.
Between 2014 and 2015, tax entities sent approx. 10.5 million notifications.
Mandatory concession (specific form of trade licence) not only for ethyl alcohol production and treatment, but also for the sale of consumer packaged alcohol by a business operator to individuals for their personal consumption or to other legal entities or entrepreneurs for their own internal needs.
A concession can only be run following the issuance of a decision by the trade licencing office and upon fulfilling professional and other qualifications.
The sale of ethyl alcohol does not require any prescribed professional qualifications.
A benefit for the excise duty administrator is an overview of ethyl alcohol merchants and their operating premises and restriction of trading to credible entities.
In the Czech Republic, approx.
94,000 concessions were registered in 2014 and 104,000 in 2015 for the field that includes production, treatment, and sale of fermented ethyl alcohol, potable ethyl alcohol, spirits, and other alcoholic beverages.
Other than the excise duty administrator, the following authorities can also conduct checks of the observance of legal regulations in connection with the handling of excisable products in the Czech Republic: Trade licensing offices; Czech Agriculture and Food Inspection Authority; Bodies of the Czech Financial Administration; Bodies of the Czech Trade Inspection.
The excise duty administrator is informed immediately if a breach of obligations or violation of a ban is discovered.
Mineral oils
The Czech Republic has in place a comprehensive system of supervision (see Annex 3, Diagram B) of excisable mineral oils and certain non-excisable mineral oils that have been misused for tax evasion purposes.
The system includes the supervision of activities ranging from the production, storage, movement, marking, and dyeing of various mineral oils and marking certain other mineral oils, to the delivery of mineral oils to end consumers or users and, in certain cases, even the consumption of mineral oils.
The supervision undertaken by customs authorities also includes production and handling of marking substances for marking mineral oils.
Mineral oils listed under combined nomenclature codes 2710 19 25 (Other kerosene), 2710 19 29 (other medium oils not listed elsewhere) and 2710 19 41, 2710 19 45, and 2710 19 49 (heavy gas oils) are subject to marking and dyeing, provided that marking is not prohibited.
Other mineral oils, such as benzol, toluol, xylol and lubricating oils, and other oils intended for uses other than engine propulsion are subject to marking.
Marking and dyeing various mineral oils and certain other mineral oils using a marking substance is possible only if permitted by the excise duty administrator.
2 Apart from beer, fruit wine, other wine and mead and fruit brandies obtained from distillation. 3 Council Regulation (EEC)
No 2658/87 dated 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff. 4 For example, in connection with use of mineral oils as fuel (save for boating if not private recreational boats) or as a component for the production of fuel if marking impairs use.
The most important new measures implemented since 2012:
Monitoring the handling of special mineral oils, which is the group of mineral oils found under combined nomenclature codes 2710 19 71 to 2710 19 99 (i.e., lubricating oils and other oils intended for uses other than engine propulsion) with a viscosity at 40°C that is less than 12 mm2/s-1, inclusive, and which have at least one of the following specifications: Flash point is lower than 150°C or During distillation, it is redistilled less than 20% of volume, including losses, at 350°C.
These mineral oils have been misused to adulterate final fuels, especially diesel, or have been used directly or sold as motor fuel, as the physical properties are very similar.
Entities handling monitored mineral oils either in bulk storage or in packaging exceeding 220 litres must be registered with the duty administrator.
For the registration to be issued, the applicant, the governing body, and the responsible representative have to meet the stipulated personal conditions, and these have to be satisfied for the duration of the registration.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
As at 30 November 2016, the registry of persons authorised to handle mineral oils contained 54 valid registrations; four registrations were cancelled on the request of the registration holders themselves.
Electronic records have to contain detailed information about income, own consumption, and sale or movement of mineral oils, including document numbers, numbers of the notifications of receipt sent to the excise duty administrator, storage and consumption sites, purpose of consumption, or, in the case of sale, place of delivery (destination) and customer registration number.
The excise duty administrator has to receive notifications of each receipt of special mineral oils 24 to 72 hours prior to the receipt.
The notification must include identification of the business partners, name and nomenclature of each special mineral oil, amount, purpose of consumption or sale/transfer information.
Notification of the expected amount of mineral oil to be purchased, sold or consumed in the respective year must be submitted by the entity at the time of submission of the registration application or by the end of the respective calendar year.
Notifications of the purpose of use and marking, storage, or consumption site, and identification data about the person to whom the special mineral oil is sold or transferred are to be submitted before each change of such information.
Notifications are submitted electronically using intelligent forms or via data box in PDF format.
A total of 630 notifications were submitted by persons handling special mineral oils during the audited period.
An excise duty administrator has to confiscate and forfeit special mineral oils or the transport vehicle when he discovers that special mineral oils are being handled without registration or if the registered person is not fulfilling his notification obligations.
Just like the case of failure to fulfil obligations connected to the transport/movement of excisable goods, these shortcomings cannot be remedied after the fact.
Fuel distributor registration is mandatory for persons who sell or are authorised to sell fuel.
Only persons who fulfil the following criteria can be registered distributors: ശശ Mandatory concession from the Trade Licensing Office (specific form of trade licence).
The customs office provides an opinion on the concession application or on the appointment of a responsible representative.
It examines whether the concession applicant or the governing body or members of the governing body of the applicant/legal entity and the appointed responsible representative fulfil the condition of credibility.
If these persons satisfy the credibility condition, the customs office issues a positive standpoint.
A credible person means a person with integrity, i.e., a person with no criminal record regarding propertyrelated, customs-related or tax-related offences.
Possession of professional qualifications is also a condition for the issuance of a concession.
Debt-free status of the same persons as in the case of credibility above.
A person with debtfree status is a person who provides a sufficient guarantee that he will satisfy his payment obligations to the state duly and on time, i.e., he has no arrears with respect to the state budget or general health insurance.
The fact that the fuel distributor was not disqualified, i.e., barred from carrying on his business activities, by a court or administrative authority.
The fact that the fuel distributor is not in liquidation or bankruptcy.
Payment of a guarantee (or provision of a bank deposit) in the amount of CZK 20,000,000 (i.e., approx. € 740,000), which can be reduced to CZK 10,000,000 (i.e., approx. € 370,000) after being registered as a fuel distributor after three years and satisfying other conditions.
A distributor is obliged to submit the fuel distribution notification within 20 days of the end of the calendar month.
The electronic notification has to contain information about each purchase and sale of fuel.
The reported data are data about business partners, document numbers, the specific product, amount, price, carrier, and means of transport, and loading and unloading site.
The entitlement to a refund of duty on mineral oils used in primary agricultural production was re-introduced in 2014.
The excise duty refund on mineral oils can only be claimed for those activities that clearly relate to activities carried out on land plots.
In 2015, there were about 64,000 such excise duty refund claims, totalling CZK 1,172,844,680 (i.e., € 43,401,720).
In 2017, the Czech Government also introduced an excise duty refund on fuel for farmers with livestock production.
Farmers or breeders of cattle, pigs, poultry, sheep, and goats are now also entitled to apply for a refund.
Tobacco products
Restriction of the sale of tobacco products with an old VAT rate
In response to the long-term failure to generate budgetary revenues from excise duty on tobacco products, the Czech Republic, effective of 1 December 2014, introduced a restriction on the sale of tobacco products with an old VAT rate should the VAT rate change.
Excise duty on tobacco products is paid through tobacco excise stamps.
Use of tobacco excise stamps is understood as the affixation of stickers on a unit package (Section 116 of the Excise Duty Act).
The production of tobacco products in a state intended for end users is decisive for the application of excise duty rates, even though their unloading, delivery, dispatch, sale, or sale to end users may not take place.
The letter of the alphabet representing the excise duty rate is indicated on the tobacco excise stamp together with the price for the end user in the case of cigarettes, number of pieces in the package or amount of loose smoking tobacco in kilogrammes.
A tobacco excise stamp has no identifier.
The length of the interim period for the sale of unit packages of cigarettes intended for direct consumption, affixed with a tobacco stamp with the previous old tax rate, was specified as the elapse of the last day of the second calendar month following the effective date of the new excise duty rate.
Developments in the offtake of tobacco stamps in 2014 and a comparison with developments in previous years suggest that each year, tobacco product manufacturers had substantially frontloaded tobacco products with the “old” tax rate, which led to the force of the “new” tax rate factually moving forward by about a year.
Duty on raw tobacco
Due to the risk of misuse of raw tobacco to produce tobacco products without a licence from the excise duty administrator and due to the non-payment of excise duty, imposing a duty on raw tobacco and monitoring the handling of raw tobacco were measures introduced to fight tax fraud.
Effective 1 July 2015, excise duty is imposed on raw tobacco that has not been used or supplied to produce tobacco products, supplied to a different Member State or a third country or in respect of which the origin, purpose of use or person to whom such tobacco should be supplied has not been proven.
Raw tobacco handling restrictions
Raw tobacco handling restrictions have been added to the supervision of the movement and production of tobacco products, labelling unit packages with excise stamps and restriction of sales to defined locations.
Facilities for processing raw tobacco and producing tobacco products are not subject to supervision by the customs authorities.
Storing raw tobacco for other purposes than producing tobacco products may only be carried out by a registered person. Such tobacco must not be processed or treated further, however.
Only a person that fulfils the personal conditions applicable to applicants, governing bodies and responsible representatives may become a registered person. This condition has to be satisfied for the entire registration period.
The registration conditions are as follows: a) authorisation to carry on a trade that allows storage of raw tobacco, b) credibility, c) debt-free status, d) the person storing the raw tobacco has not been disqualified from such activity, thus preventing him from carrying on such activity, e) the person storing raw tobacco is not in liquidation or bankruptcy, and f) payment of a guarantee of CZK 20,000,000 (i.e., approx. € 740,000).
Electronic records must contain the date of receipt or dispatch of the raw tobacco, document number, identification of business partner, and amount and type of tobacco.
Notification of each receipt of raw tobacco by the registered person storing raw tobacco has to be made to the excise duty administrator 24 to 72 hours prior to receipt or dispatch.
Data about the business partner, amount of raw tobacco, storage address, purpose of use, and carrier are reported.
Notification of amount of raw tobacco received or dispatched in the respective year is submitted by the entity either at the same time that the registration application is submitted or by the end of January of the respective year.
Notifications are submitted electronically via data box in PDF format.
Movement of raw tobacco has to be accompanied by a document containing the prescribed information.
Excise duty legislation in the Slovak Republic
The legal framework regulating excise duty in the Slovak Republic is based on EU legislation, thus helping to create a common tax system.
Each type of excise duty is defined in Slovak legislation, with such legislation being similar to that of the neighbouring countries.
Specification of legislation
Excise duty legislation comprises four laws according to the subject of the excise duty.
Harmonisation has been achieved by the adoption of the following excise duty laws: Act No 98/2004 Coll., on excise duty on mineral oil; Act No 106/2004 Coll., on excise duty on tobacco products; Act No 530/2011 Coll., on excise duty on alcoholic beverage; Act No 609/2007 Coll., on excise duty on electricity, coal, and natural gas.
All excise duty regulations represent substantive law regulations and focus on taxation of the subject of the excise duty in the fiscal territory.
Act No 563/2009 Coll., on excise duty administration (Tax Procedure Code) is a procedural law regulation governing excise duty administration and the rights and obligations of tax entities and other persons.
Within this legal framework, the provisions of Council Directive No 118/2008/EC of 16 December 2008, concerning the general arrangements for excise duty and repealing Directive 92/12/EEC, as well as other EU directives and regulation, have been transposed.
Structure of changes to legislation on the various types of excise duty in relation to the subject of the audit
Since 2011, excise duty legislation has undergone fundamental changes according to the structure of the various types of excise duty.
In EMCS, movements of excisable goods under duty suspension have become fully electronic, replacing the administrative paper document accompanying such movement. This new electronic system tracks movements in real time.
Within EMCS, the concept of suspension of access to tax entities was introduced in 2015.
Under this concept, the customs office has the possibility to suspend access should there be warranted concern that taxes from previous tax periods will not be paid or levied or due to their unenforceability.
The above pertains to the due date of the duty, as during movement, a guarantee has to be paid before excisable goods can be moved.
This guarantee is released, however, once the goods reach their destination.
Excise duty on mineral oil
A fundamental change in excise duty administration occurred in 2011, when the possibility to use “red diesel” was cancelled.
Marked gas oil, commonly called “red diesel”, used to be classified as a mineral oil.
In the past, “red diesel” was used for specific purposes defined under the law, e. g., in agriculture, and a lower excise duty rate was applied to it.
This change has had a positive impact on the revenue side of the state budget.
The reason behind cancellation of “red diesel” was to reduce the public deficit, simplify the system of taxation of mineral oils, and reduce the administrative burden for the affected tax entities.
In 2012, a new type of tax entity was created: motor fuel merchant.
The purpose of this legal amendment was to introduce a recordkeeping obligation for all service stations.
The obligation to purchase petrol and diesel from fuel distributors makes it easier to keep track of the movement of taxed petrol and diesel.
In 2014, two new tax entities were introduced: fuel distributor and fuel consumer.
This change was aimed at preventing tax evasion with respect to petrol and diesel and making the movement of these fuels easier to track (see Annex 4, Diagram A).
Provisions on recordkeeping requirements for tax entities trading with lubricating and base oils were expanded as part of the fight against tax evasion.
In Slovakia, these mineral oils do not have to be marked with an indicator substance.
Excise duty on tobacco products
In efforts to fight tax evasion and monitor tobacco, the scope of the Tobacco Act was expanded to include a new type of tax entity: raw tobacco merchant.
Raw tobacco is not a harmonised tobacco product and its movement is not monitored within the EU.
Also, the obligation to keep a record of technical equipment for the production tobacco products was introduced.
The legislation introduced a new system for ordering, assessing, printing, distributing, and using excise stamps intended for labelling consumer packaged tobacco products.
Tobacco excise stamps are used to label cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos, and tobacco.
As part of the new system, an excise stamp user has to request the customs office to issue excise stamps electronically through the excise stamp offtake information system.
This computerisation introduced electronic communication between tax entities and excise duty administrators.
One state printer of excise stamps was appointed: the Kremnica Mint (Mincovňa Kremnica).
Also, supervision over the printing of excise stamps was introduced.
The changes contributed substantially to eliminating tax evasion.
The new excise stamp printing system strengthens the product control system because a unique identification number is generated for each excise stamp, and this number makes it easy to check whether the product comes from legal sources.
A unique 12-digit identification number (1st-2nd position is the checksum; 3rd position indicates whether the code belongs to the excise stamp or a group of packages; 4th position is the series identifier; 5th-8th position is the alphanumeric part of the sequence; and 9th-12th position is the decimal part of the sequence) can be also applied in the form of a two-dimensional barcode.
Excise stamps designated for labelling cigarettes have to show the price of the cigarettes, the symbol for the valid excise duty rate, number of cigarettes per consumer package, and cigarette length.
Excise duty on alcoholic beverages
The biggest change in legislation affected ethyl alcohol, wine and beer, as the original three substantive law regulations were repealed and a single excise duty act on alcoholic beverages was created.
The main reason for this new law was the need for a collective solution to the taxation of alcoholic beverages, their production, movement monitoring, excise bonds, and the need to improve the business environment in the respective field, make excise duty administration more effective, and reduce the administrative burden for SME.
This new method for addressing the taxation of various types of alcoholic beverages introduced the use of a single excise duty rate for all alcoholic beverages with the percentage of actual ethyl alcohol by content being taken into account.
In the case of still wine, sparkling wine, and fermented beverages, the percentage of ethyl alcohol by content in the final product is taken into account.
The concentration in beer is also expressed as a percentage of actual ethyl alcohol content in the final product.
The term minor producer of fermented beverages was introduced, essentially to exempt from excise duty those individuals who produce sparking fermented beverages up to 1,000 litres per fiscal year for their own use and their household’s use.
The legislation introduced a new system of ordering, assessing, printing, distributing, and using excise stamps for labelling consumer packaged alcohol.
Under this new system, an excise stamp user has to request the customs office to issue excise stamps electronically through the excise stamp offtake information system.
This computerisation introduced electronic communication between tax entities and excise duty administrators.
One state printer of alcohol excise stamps was appointed: the Kremnica Mint (Mincovňa Kremnica).
Supervision over the printing of excise stamps was also introduced.
The changes contributed substantially to the elimination of tax evasion (see Annex 4, Diagram B) and excise stamp counterfeiting.
The new excise stamp printing system strengthens the product control system because a unique identification number is generated for each excise stamp, and this number makes it easy to check whether the product comes from legal sources.
A unique 12-digit identification number (1st-2nd position is the checksum; 3rd position indicates whether the code belongs to the excise stamp or a group of packages; 4th position is the series identifier; 5th-8th position is the alphanumeric part of the sequence; and 9th-12th position is the decimal part of the sequence) can also be applied in the form of a two-dimensional barcode.
Comparison and assessment
Comparison
Excise duty on ethyl alcohol, mineral oils, tobacco products, beer, wine, and intermediate products are regulated in the Czech Republic by a single piece of legislation: Act No 353/2003 Coll.
Duties on solid fuel, natural and other gases and electricity are part of Act No 261/2007 Coll.
In comparison, the Slovak Republic has a special law for each type of excise duty, save the excise duty act on alcoholic beverages, which applies to ethyl alcohol, beer, wine, and intermediate products.
A special law regulates excise duty on electricity, coal and natural gas.
As of 1 January 2015, the issuance of a licence to handle excisable products under the Excise Duty Act has been conditional in the Czech Republic upon proving the economic stability of applicants, which the customs authorities check annually by performing a financial analysis.
In Slovakia, a similar analysis is performed only when deciding on waiving or reducing the excise guarantee.
The FD SR performs fiscal supervision by having one its employees present when excise stamps are being affixed to alcohol and tobacco products, destroyed at the printer, and sold to individual users.
The law states that only the state-owned enterprise Kremnica Mint (Mincovňa Kremnica) is authorised to print excise stamps.
In the Czech Republic, the customs authorities do not supervise the production of tobacco excise stamps and alcohol excise stamps at the printer.
Tobacco excise stamps and alcohol excise stamps are collected from the printer by the authorised branch of the customs office in Kutná Hora.
Tobacco excise stamps are purchased by tobacco producers at this branch; alcohol excise stamps are further distributed to the various excise duty administrators pertinent to the labelling sites.
Czech legal regulations do not define producers of tobacco excise stamps and alcohol excise stamps.
In Slovakia, there is the obligation to register technical equipment for producing tobacco products or parts thereof. There is no such obligation in the Czech Republic.
In the Czech Republic, tobacco excise stamps bear the excise duty applicable to tobacco products, which is paid upon purchase of the tobacco excise stamps at the authorised customs office.
Tobacco excise stamps in Slovakia do not contain the applicable excise duty.
In the audited period, the Czech Republic introduced a refund of excise duty on mineral oils if such oils were used for primary plant production in agriculture, known as “green diesel”.
Since 2017, this refund was extended to include motor oils used in animal production.
In Slovakia, there is no support for farmers (support existed until 31 December 2010 in the form of “red diesel”).
To boost the fight against tax fraud, the Czech Republic introduced the obligation on fuel distributors to pay a guarantee of CZK 20,000,000 (€ 740,000).
A consequence of the introduction of this measure was a drop in the number of fuel distributors from 1,891 in 2013 to 174 in 2014 (i.e., 1,717 fewer tax entities).
Slovakia introduced a similar fuel distributor concept, but without the guarantee for securing the excise duty on mineral oil.
Slovakia registered 303 distributors in 2014 and 407 in 2015.
Slovakia has also the concepts of motor fuel merchant and motor fuel consumer, with the locally pertinent customs offices issuing the respective authorisations.
The Czech Republic has no such concept.
In the Czech Republic, various mineral oils and some other mineral oils are subject to marking; in Slovakia, after the cancellation of “red diesel”, mineral oils are no longer marked.
In the Czech Republic, alcohol excise stamps contain a unique 8-digit code to verify the source of the alcohol and a 12-digit registration code that also indicates ethyl alcohol strength, according to which the excise stamp register is kept.
Destroyed, lost, and returned excise stamps are recorded in the register on the business day that follows the decisive event.
Excise stamps holders are obliged to provide notification of the use of the stamps by the same deadline.
In Slovakia, excise stamps used to label consumer packaged alcohol contain a unique 12-digit identification number that is – in case of its usage - reported once per month to the excise duty administrator and is used to verify the authenticity of the excise stamps.
The register lists the number of purchased, used, and returned excise stamps.
Both the Czech Republic and Slovakia have introduced the concept of mandatory registration or registry of alcohol distributors.
In Slovakia, registration is conditional upon satisfaction of conditions linked directly to storage space exceeding 200m2; annual turnover from the sale of consumer packaged alcohol of at least € 100,000 or the paid-up capital amounting € 100,000; and at least 10 employees.
In the Czech Republic, registration is conditional upon payment to the 23 excise duty administrator of a guarantee of CZK 5,000,000 (i.e., € 185,000) which is kept for the entire period that the registration is valid.
In Slovakia, when producing ethyl alcohol generally, and not only consumer packaged alcohol, the constant presence of an excise duty administrator is required.
When producing consumer packaged alcohol in the Czech Republic, a special form of registration is required for the person obliged to label alcohol.
This registration is conditional upon payment of a guarantee ranging from CZK 100,000 (i.e., € 3,700) to CZK 5,000,000 (i.e., € 185,000), depending on the number of purchased excise stamps, and installation of a camera surveillance system that allows the duty administrator to access it remotely at any time.
Assessment
The laws of the Czech Republic and Slovakia greatly exceed minimum EU requirements for the subject and administration of excise duties. They also respond to identified risks from other Member States and risks specific to the fiscal territories.
The legislative changes adopted in the audited period allow excise duty administrators to prevent better possible tax evasion.
In the fight against tax evasion in the form of misuse of raw tobacco (e.g., of tobacco leaves), the Czech Republic and Slovakia introduced – above and beyond the legal framework of the EU – a duty on raw tobacco.
Even though raw tobacco, or tobacco raw material, is not a harmonised tobacco product, the Czech Republic and Slovakia track its movement nevertheless.
The Czech SAO and the Slovak SAO can recommend the application of such measure in other EU Member States as well.
In the Czech Republic, a good practice has shown that verifying the economic stability of applicants as a condition for issuance of a licence under the Excise Duty Act is a very successful way to reduce the risk of tax arrears.
For this reason, both audit institutions recommend the application of such verification procedures in Slovakia.
Distribution of excise stamps is more effective in Slovakia than in the Czech Republic because it does not burden the customs authorities with the costs associated with transporting the alcohol and tobacco excise stamps between the printer and the users of the stamps.
The Slovak Financial Administration has a better overview of the existence and location of technical facilities for the production of tobacco products.
The Czech Republic, however, has a more effective system for collecting excise duty on tobacco products as the order for tobacco excise stamps constitutes an excise declaration with subsequent payment of tax.
By implementing the concept of motor fuel merchant and motor fuel consumer, the Slovak Financial Administration has a better overview of fuel sales points.
The introduction of mandatory marking of mineral oils in the Czech Republic makes it easier to control misuse of mineral oils with a reduced duty rate or exempted from duty.
The Czech Republic (2013) and Slovakia (2014) introduced a new excise stamp containing an identification code.
The Czech excise stamp also contains a registration code, whereas new legislation in Slovakia abandoned the introduction of such code.
At this time, it is still not possible to assess the situation for the reason of the short time that the legislative changes have been in force.
Implementation of effective labelling of consumer packaged alcohol with an excise stamp is an effective measure in the fight against tax evasion.
The Slovak SAO and the Czech SAO can recommend implementation of this control measure even in other Member States.
Slovakia takes a client-friendly approach to its alcohol distribution conditions, as it does not block the funds of tax entities.
Conversely, the Czech Republic takes a rather restrictive approach, as it requires the payment of a guarantee, which blocks the cash flow of tax entities. This measure does, however, reduce the risk of tax arrears arising.
Development of excise duty revenues
Excise duty is an indirect tax imposed by the state to increase its budget revenues and to regulate the sale of goods, the consumption of which is considered detrimental to an individual and/or society (the regulatory function of taxes).
According to the strategic document Communication from the Commission “Europa 2020 - A strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth” of 3 March 2010, which is a part of the “Resource efficient Europe” flagship initiative, it is the European Commission’s aim to enhance a framework for the use of market-based instruments also in the form of revision of energy taxation with a focus on reducing energy and resource consumption.
To fulfil the EC’s plan, Member States should seek to shift the tax burden from labour to energy and environmental taxes as part of a “greening” of taxation systems.
The collection of excise duty revenues in the Czech Republic and Slovakia includes the collection of excise duties on mineral oils, tobacco products, ethyl alcohol, beer, wine and intermediate products, natural gas, fuel, and electricity.
Excise duties as a percentage of total tax revenues and as a percentage of GDP is monitored by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
Both Supreme Audit Institutions used the following criteria for submitting a query on the OECD.
The collection of excise duties in relation to macroeconomic indicators in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic, excise duties as a percentage of total tax revenues and as a percentage of GDP fell slightly according to OECD data.
For conversion of CZK to € as at 31 December of the respective year, the European Central Bank (“ECB”) exchange rate was used.
The nominal CZK/€ exchange rate in 2013 weakened year-on-year by 9.1% (from 25.140 to 27.425).
The reason for this was chiefly the foreign exchange intervention policy of the Czech National Bank (“CNB”) Bank Board of 7 November 20136.
The resulting excise duty collection, excise duty rates, and per capita revenue in € substantially decreased in response to the exchange rate difference.
A significant decrease in the share of excise duty in 2014 was caused by a one-off failure in collecting revenue from excise duty on tobacco products because of new legislation restricting the sale of tobacco products with an old VAT rate.
The share of excise duty is also influenced by an increase in the collection of income taxes, which, as a result of an improvement of the Czech economy, grew substantially.
Excise duty on mineral oils constitutes the biggest percentage of excise duty collection (about 55.7% in 2015); however, despite the marked growth of the economy, it fell compared to 2012.
The collection of excise duty on mineral oil in 2013 and 2014 was substantially lower than in 2012 and in 2015, although in 2013, the registration of fuel distributors was introduced as a measure against fraud.
The trend toward environmentally friendly cars and support for biofuels have negatively affected tax revenues.
The percentage of duty on natural gas, duty on solid fuels, and duty on electricity on total tax collection is negilgible, which, compared to neighbouring countries, is due to the low tax rate, which is close to the minimum rate set by the EU.
If rates do not increase in the future, their percentage will fall with regard to the ever increasing energy efficiency of buidlings and production processes.
The collection of excise duty on alcohol in 2013 and 2014 was negatively affected by the aftershocks of far-reaching tax fraud consisting of placing untaxed alcohol, alcohol containing methanol, or insufficiently denatured alcohol into circulation in the form of spirits.
After adopting numerous measures against such conduct in 2015 and a revival of the spirits market, the collection of excise duty on alcohol exceeded the amount collected in 2012 by € 4,000,000.
The share of duty on tobacco products grew as a result of an increase in rates.
Basic excise duty rates on tobacco products increased between 2012 and 2015. This occurred mainly because of the observance of the Council Directive 2011/64/EU on the structure and rates of excise duty applied to manufactured tobacco.
Because of the foreign exchange intervention strategy of the CNB, the actual excise duty rate in Euro fell significantly, apart from the tax on tobacco products, which grew slightly.
Indexation of excise duties is not set in relation to price growth, GDP, or standard of living; therefore, the function of excise duties to regulate socially undesirable activities might not be fulfilled.
With the growing Czech economy and the rising standard of living, actual excise duty rates are falling.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
The collection of excise duties in connection with macroeconomic indicators in Slovakia
Current excise duty legislation in Slovakia does not address indexation of excise duty rates based on consumer prices because the rates are fixed.
The full manifestation of the non-indexation of rates could especially be seen in the development of excise duty revenues on a cash basis and the proportion of such revenues to gross domestic product.
For the above reason, the proportion of tax revenues to GDP remained constant – without fluctuations or changes – in the audited period.
The total proportion of excise duties to total tax revenues appears to be falling, which is caused by the ad valorem method of calculating the rates.
The attained macroeconomic indicators are above average in relation to the OECD average.
Among all excise duties implemented in Slovakia, excise duty on mineral oils forms the largest proportion of annual tax revenues in the state budget. During the entire audited period, its percentage did not fall below 52% of such revenues.
Excise duty on tobacco products constitutes the second biggest share.
This duty forms about 32% of total excise duty collection.
Between 2012-2015, the collection of excise duties per capita in Slovakia grew.
This process was caused by the growth of excise duty rates on tobacco products, by higher purchasing power, and by bigger consumption of the population in the respective year.
Excise duty revenues as a percentage of total tax revenues in Slovakia fell by 1.2 percentage points despite excise duty revenues growing.
This was caused by the faster growth of total tax revenues compared to excise duty revenues.
In the Czech Republic, the proportion of excise duty revenues to total tax revenues fell by about one percentage point between 2012 and 2015, which was influenced by the implementation of measures in the area of excise duties and by the significant growth of the collection of other taxes, especially income taxes.

Assessment
Because of the CNB foreign exchange intervention, actual excise duty rates in the Czech Republic fell.
Energy taxes in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia as a percentage of total tax revenues is not growing and there is no shift from taxation of labour to taxation of consumption of various products subject to excise duties, which is not in line with EU strategies.
The attained values of the share of excise duties are permanently above average compared to the OECD average.
The total collection of excise duties is influenced especially by a change in the excise duty rates, development of economic conditions, and behaviour of the population.
Future failures of the excise duty collection due to green measures, which the state is subsidising in various forms, will need to be replaced by revenues or by reducing public expenditures.
As indexation of excise duty rates is not implemented in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia, the regulatory function of such rates is reduced and the EU objectives to make Europe less dependent on environmentally unfriendly resources and the objectives in the area of reducing dependencies on alcohol and tobacco are not sufficiently supported.
The higher consumption of various products by foreign consumers, which is influenced by the lower total price of the various products in €, is reflected in the higher per-capita collection of excise duties in the Czech Republic.
excise Administrative costs of duty administration
The effectiveness of administrative costs reflects the relationship between the expenditure and revenue associated with the administration of excise duties, i.e., it expresses the amount of expenditure per 100 units of revenue (CZK, €).
The higher the resulting amount, the worse the effectiveness of administrative costs is.
The effectiveness of an excise duty administrator during excise duty administration is influenced by the excise duty administrator’s powers and organisational structure, management of the organisation, legal environment, and level of computerisation of various operations.
Determining the effectiveness of administrative costs of excise duty administration using the conversion coefficient method is based on the number of employees taking part in excise duty administration in a line management structure.
In the Czech Republic, the administration of excise duties is carried out by the Customs Administration of the Czech Republic (Czech Customs Administration), which is an independent organizational unit of the state and an accounting entity.
In Slovakia, excise duty administration is in the purview of the Financial Administration of the Slovak Republic (Slovak Financial Administration), with customs administration authorities comprising an organisational unit within this body, and costs and income being included in aggregate for the whole unit.
To make it possible to compare the effectiveness of excise duty administration, expenditures and revenues of the Czech Financial Administration were also included in the model for calculating the effectiveness of administrative costs.
Administrative costs of the excise duty administration in the Czech Republic
Excise duty administration is a set of administrative tasks carried out especially by the Czech Customer Administration.
Some control tasks are carried out by other public administration bodies, but they are of negligible importance.
Excise duty administration is performed by these bodies in particular:
General Directorate of Customs:
Department 23 TAXES
Unit 231 Tax Methodology – monitors and proposes legislative measures, arranges interpretations of legal regulations, methodologically manages and coordinates: execution of the excise duty administration agenda and enforcement of related regulations, especially tax proceedings and related control and supervision activities, administration of the movement of various commodities.

Unit 233 Tax audits – methodologically manages and coordinates the execution of the tax audit agenda at customs offices.
Department 30 LEGAL
Unit 301 Legal – is responsible for methodologies in administrative sentencing, administrative procedure, fiscal audit process, registration procedure, discovery procedure, excise payments, fines for late excise declarations, penalties, and interests.
Unit 302 Administrative Operations – is responsible for making decisions in cases that are in the purview of the GDC, e. g., delegating territorial jurisdiction to another responsible administrator, deciding on attraction, i. e., on taking over the issue by a superior tax administrator, handling appeals against decisions made by customs offices, and investigating complaints about inactivity in tax and administrative proceedings.
Unit 303 Revenue Administration and Enforcement – coordinates and executes tasks within international cooperation on enforcement of tax arrears and fulfils tasks in the area of insolvency proceedings.

Unit 02 Analysis and Information Support – performs risk analyses, administration of risk profiles and collection and assessment of information from all available information sources.
Department 1 LEGAL
Unit 11 Legal and Administration Activities – drafts documents, opinions and reports for the appellate body, issues decisions on licences/authorisations in connection with the administration of excise duties and environmental taxes, with the Act on Mandatory Marking of Alcohol and with the Act on Ethyl Alcohol, and decides on the arrangement of payments of tax that is not yet due or has not yet been assessed.
Department 3 – TAX
Unit 31 Tax – carries out the activities of the following agendas: Fiscal supervision over tax subject entities, e.g., control of observance of the conditions set out in issued licences, supervision over the functionality and accuracy of manufacturing facilities for the production of ethyl alcohol and ascertainment of amounts and concentrations of ethyl alcohol produced, supervision over the alcohol denaturing process, physical inspections in the area of excise duty administration; Non-tax controls in the area of statutory controls indirectly related to excise duties, especially controls of mandatory marking and dyeing of various mineral oils, controls of taxation of various products, controls of labelling tobacco products, controls of whether buyers or sellers are breaching the Act on Prices and other pricing regulations, carries out tasks connected to the Fuel Act, the Act on Mandatory Marking of Alcohol and the Act on Alcohol, and performs tasks related to satisfaction of the obligation of placement of a minimum amount of biofuel in free circulation for transport purposes; Registration of economic entities for taxes, registration of persons obliged to label alcohol and of alcohol distributors, and registration of fuel distributors; Duty administration, especially conducting tax proceedings in the matter of duty assessment and prescription, or duty refunds, monitoring excise guarantees and use thereof to pay duties, conducting searches.
Unit 39 Tobacco Excise Stamps – is a unit of the Central Bohemian Customs Office and carries out activities in the area of ordering, manufacturing, distributing, and destroying tobacco excise stamps.
Representatives of the customs office and the GDC are present during the destruction of returned/damaged tobacco excise stamps to oversee the destruction process and draw up a record thereof.
In the case of alcohol excise stamps, the director of the customs office appoints, through an internal act of management, a three-member committee for overseeing the shredding of rejected uncollected/returned excise stamps.
Once the excise stamps are shredded, the destruction committee chair arranges a record about the excise stamp destruction process to be drawn up.
Department 5 – AUDIT
Unit 52 Tax audits – carries out tax audits.
Department 6 – SUPERVISION
Unit 61 Supervision over Entities – carries out supervision over entities at points of sale, e.g., controls of the sale of alcohol and tobacco products.
Unit 62 Mobile Supervision – performs controls of the transport of various commodities on roads.
Administrative costs of excise duty administration in Slovakia
Beginning 1 January 2012, the FD SR underwent a demanding transformation in line with the approved UNITAS programme.
The transformation of the FD SR was also reflected in the composition of the employees of the newly created departments of the merged customs and excise duty administrations.
In the organisational structure of the FD SR, the activities related to excise duty administration were included in multiple sections and the departments under them.
Financial Directorate of the Slovak Republic: Customs and Tax Section of the FD SR: Excise Duty Department (nation-wide jurisdiction):
Excise Duty Unit – directs and coordinates excise duty administration operations; submits proposals and comments to legislative changes; elaborate expert opinions; issues decisions on delegation of the territorial jurisdiction of tax entities; allocates and cancels offtake registration numbers
Fiscal Supervision Unit – directs and coordinates fiscal supervision and audit operations; carries out fiscal supervision.
ELO and Excise Duty Systems Unit – directs and coordinates mutual administrative cooperation in the field of excise duties including information exchange via the SEED and MVS systems; carries out administration and updates in SysNeD and EMCS
software Excise Stamp Unit – directs excise stamp handling and printing activities; carries out fiscal supervision over the handling and destruction of printing sheets and excise stamps at the printing house.
Section of the Vice-President of the Financial Administration
Excise and Customs Duty Appeals Department (nation-wide jurisdiction):
Excise Duty Appeals Unit – reviews decisions by the customs offices based on regular and extraordinary appeals; carries out activities under the second instance appellate procedure.
The Customs Office Section was established in 2012 and is responsible for all nine customs offices, eight of which have jurisdiction over higher territorial divisions and one of which oversees tasks related to the external border of the EU.
Customs Offices:
Excise Duty Department – executes methodological activities related to the customs office branches; in the case of certain entities, it carries out excise duty administration tasks directly, specifically it makes decisions on registration applications (tax warehouse, authorised consignee, registered consignor), excise bond amounts and tax refunds; carries out supervision and tax audits; makes decisions on excise bond waivers; makes decisions on waivers of the obligations to ensure the presence of a customs officer at the alcohol warehouse.
Legal Department – makes decisions on violations of excise regulations; performs activities related to regular and extraordinary remedies; conducts excise execution procedures.
Customs Office Branch – decides on registrations (other than with regard to tax warehouses, authorised consignees and registered consignors) and excise guarantees amounts; imposes and refunds duties; carries out excise duty supervision and audits; decides on the seizure and forfeiture of goods.
Customs Office Station – carries out excise duty supervision over the holding and movement of excisable goods; provides constant fiscal supervision at alcohol warehouses; decides on the seizure and forfeiture of goods.
The expenditures of the Slovak Financial Administration on excise duty administration are constantly growing, because in addition to rising wages, investment into the effectiveness of excise duty administration and computerisation of financial administration is also growing.
Although revenues from excise duties grew, spending grew faster because of IT modification related to the UNITAS project.
Payroll expenses in Slovakia are affected substantially by the practice of constant fiscal supervision at alcohol warehouses, a system that is not applied in the Czech Republic.
The expenditures of the Czech Customs Administration on excise duty administration between 2012 and 2015 grew more substantially in 2015. This rise was caused chiefly by growing payroll expenses and spending on technical support.
In the Czech Republic, excise tax revenues grew roughly at the same rate.
Compared to Slovakia, payroll expenses in the Czech Republic are positively effected by the broader powers of the customs administration, e.g., weighing trucks, checking fulfilment of road toll obligations.
The effectiveness of administrative costs in Slovakia is deteriorating year-on-year.
Employee numbers have not changed substantially, but spending per employee has grown.
In the Czech Republic, employee numbers have also not changed substantially, but spending per employee compared to Slovakia has not grown as fast.
Assessment
In the Czech Republic and in Slovakia, wage growth is an important factor behind the deteriorating effectiveness of administrative spending. This development can be seen as natural.
In both countries, the fact that excise duty administration continues to be highly demanding administratively is a negative factor, which is confirmed by the fact that the number of employees involved in excise duty administration is not falling.
In Slovakia, however, in light of lower incomes, excise duty administration is more demanding in terms of staffing.
Performance indicators for excise duty administration
Excise duty administration is a set of activities with the objective of accurately establishing, assessing, and enforcing payment of duties.
The main processes in excise duty administration are duty assessment, activity authorisation and registration, supervision of movement, audits and identification of tax entities.
The number of administrative tasks and entities under administration are indicators of the effectiveness of duty administration.
The mutual relationship between the monitored indicator and the number of excise duty administrators expresses the effectiveness of excise duty administration and defines the cost-effectiveness of the specific activity.
To handle certain products for business purposes and move them under duty suspension, it is necessary to apply for the respective authorisation and registration.
The excise duty administrator is obliged to carry out systematic administration of authorised or registered entities, with a focus on supervision of fulfilment of legal regulations and the conditions stipulated by the excise duty administrator, for which there has to be adequate staffing.
The numbers of authorisation or registrations as at 31 Dec. of the years concerned were the monitored indicators.
The number of issued authorisations or registrations is not the same as the number of tax entities.
Administrative tasks are the specific administrative acts performed in connection with a specific matter.
The frequency of the excise duty administrator’s most important tasks (duty assessments, administration of movement in EMCS) or activities which are a series of tasks ending with a report or decision are monitored.
Performance indicators in CR
Authorisation and registration for activity in the Czech Republic
Tax warehouse:
Producing, processing, storing, accepting, or dispatching certain products can only be carried out based on a tax warehouse operation authorisation from the excise duty administrator.
If a warehouse keeper operates several warehouses, a separate permit is issued for each warehouse and a separate excise guarantee is also required for each warehouse.
An excise guarantee is not required in the case of distilleries under constant supervision by an excise duty administrator (i.e., the physical presence of an official and facilities secured by an excise duty administrator seal).
In the Czech Republic, the practice of constant supervision is not applied.
A warehouse keeper registers for tax under Section 125 of Act No 280/2009 Coll.
The authorisation to operate a tax warehouse is required to move certain goods under duty suspension from the point of import to the tax warehouse, to an authorised consignee in a different Member State, to the point of export in a different Member State or to a consignee in a different Member State [replaces the status of registered consignor under Article 4(10) of Council Directive No 2008/118/ EU].
Tax warehouse statistics do not include authorisations to purchase electricity, natural gas, and solid fuels without duty, which by analogy are the same as a tax warehouse authorisation.
Growers’ distilleries producing spirits with a 50% reduced duty rate (CZK 14 300/hl of ethyl alcohol) – fruit brandy for fruit growers, are not tax warehouses, and operating permits are issued by the Ministry of Agriculture.
A reduced duty rate can be applied to 30 litres of pure ethyl alcohol per grower’s household for personal consumption during the production period (July – June).
Records of distillation by growers is kept by the distillery operators, who provide excise duty administrators with access to these records. These records have to contain information about the grower, the basic ingredient, origin of the fruit, and production of the distillate.
Authorised consignees and temporary authorised consignees are, based on authorisation from the excise duty administrator and the stipulated conditions, entitled to receive once or repeatedly various products moved under the duty suspension from a different Member State.
Authorised consignees are not warehouse keepers and, thus, may not store or dispatch certain products under duty suspension.
Users of certain duty-exempt products are legal or natural persons who accept and use or, pursuant to Section 52a or 53 of Act No 353/2003 Coll., sell duty-exempt products to other users; users are tax entities without the obligation to register for tax.
Certain tax exempt products can only be received or used based on a valid authorisation (licence) and from the supplier indicated on the authorisation.
Based on the authorisation, duty exempt mineral oil can be sold to a different authorisation holder for use or to a user who is entitled to use the mineral oil without authorisation.
It is possible to sell duty-exempt mineral oil without authorisation under specific situations laid down in the law, e.g.:
Less than 10 000 litres of waste oil per calendar year, provided that the user produced it himself or it is a product of his operations;
Various duty-free mineral oils in packaging not exceeding 20 litres, intended for purposes other than engine propulsion or heat generation for the purpose of selling to end users.
It is possible to move various duty-exempt products with a duty-exemption document.
Distributors of consumer packaged alcohol are authorised, upon mandatory registration with the excise duty administrator, to sell or otherwise move alcohol placed in free circulation.
Raw tobacco warehouse keepers are authorised, upon registration with the excise duty administrator, to store raw tobacco for purposes other than the production of tobacco products.
Persons handling special mineral oils are authorised, based on certain conditions, to purchase, sell, or otherwise move special mineral oils that are stored in bulk or in packaging exceeding 220 litres.
Fuel distributors are authorised, based on a concession (licence) and registration with an excise duty administrator and under certain conditions, to sell fuel in the Czech Republic, apart from fuel from service stations.
Movement of fuel has to be accompanied by a tax document, bill of sale or contract of carriage (shipping document) or, as the case may be, distribution schedule and fuel offtake receipts.
These documents may be substituted with electronic documents sent to the excise duty administrator prior to moving the goods.
Service station operators are the owners of the fuel sold at service stations.
Service stations are sites where fuel is issued and sold, usually into a fuel tank, based on a permit from the building authorities.
The Ministry of Industry and Trade keeps a register of service stations and their operators, under the following classification: Registered – regular sale or dispatch of fuel, usually into vehicle fuel tanks With defined access – operated usually on the company grounds (e.g., quarries, sawmills, agricultural farms, transport companies, construction yards); sales to other parties is restricted based on specific contractual relationships Private – refuelling sites only for the operator’s own needs.
A structure or operating tank located in a plant (e.g., on a chassis) is not deemed a service station if the fuel is available for own use only.
Operating tanks are not subject to a permit from the excise duty administrator and are not registered.
Natural and legal persons can purchase, receive and sell liquid petroleum gas in free circulation for further sale based on authorisation from the excise duty administrator.
Such persons also need authorisation if they purchase or receive liquid petroleum gas exceeding 20 tonnes per calendar year for their own use.
Administrative tasks in the Czech Republic
A tax audit is a set of tasks that includes examination of tax obligations, claims made by a tax entity, or other circumstances required to duly ascertain and assess tax relating to one tax proceeding.
A tax audit can be performed jointly for several tax proceedings pertaining to one tax entity.
A tax audit can be repeated only under conditions and reasons laid down in law at the time of commencement of the audit.
A tax audit is performed within a tax assessment period, which constitutes three years. Under conditions laid down in law, this period may be extended by one year (e.g., submission of a supplementary declaration related to the duty in question, commencement of criminal proceedings related to the duty in question) or suspended (court proceedings, international cooperation).
This period, under conditions laid down in law, ends no later than upon the elapse of the ten years that follow expiration of the deadline for filing a regular tax declaration.
Tax administrators are not obliged to perform an audit of every tax entity.
The commencement of a tax audit suspends deadlines for the possibility of submitting supplementary declarations or supplementary accounting by the tax entity (Section 141 Act No 280/2009 Coll.) and restarts regular deadlines for assessing tax (Section 148 of Act No 280/2009 Coll.).
Based on the results of the audit, additional tax may be assessed ex officio.
An on-site inspection is a separate, time-restricted task (one day) during which the excise duty administrator looks for evidence and searches the premises, goods, documents, records, transport means and packaging of tax subjects and other persons involved in excise duty administration outside the excise duty administrator’s premises (e.g., at the tax entity’s premises, on the road when the goods are being moved).
The tax administrator is authorised to take temporary possession of documents and items, take samples thereof, or seize them.
Taxes cannot be assessed based on the on-site inspection alone, but the tax entity can be asked to file a supplementary declaration [Section 145(2) of Act No 280/2009 Coll.].
A review of movement-related data in EMCS is not considered as an on-site inspection.
An order of alcohol excise stamps at the locally pertinent tax administrator may be made only by a registered person having the duty to label alcohol and such activity is carried out via intelligent forms that are imported automatically into the Alcohol Labeller Register.
The excise duty administrator processes the order, assesses the adequacy of the amount of excise stamps ordered and orders production.
It does not oversee the production of excise stamps.
Production is provided by the state enterprise Státní tiskárna cenin, státní podnik (government printing works).
The recipient of the excise stamps collects the excise stamps from the tax administrator with jurisdiction over the labelling site.
An order for tobacco excise stamps for labelling cigarettes, cigarillos, cigars, and smoking tobacco serves as an excise duty declaration.
The value of the tobacco excise stamps corresponds to the duty obligation, with the user of the tobacco excise stamps being obliged to pay for them within 60 days of collecting them from the tax administrator.
The user is obliged to calculate the duty obligation arising from the tobacco excise stamp order.
This deadline applies only if the value of the tobacco excise stamps is secured by a guarantee.
The tobacco excise stamp order is submitted in writing on a form specified by the Ministry of Finance or through a data box with intelligent forms being available.
The production of tobacco excise stamps is provided by the state enterprise Státní tiskárna cenin, státní podnik (government printing works).
The authorised tax administrator is the Central Bohemian Customs Office (Kutná Hora branch), which arranges the purchase and transport of tobacco excise stamps to the tax administrator, who then distributes them and keeps track of their movement, storage and use at the users.
Excise declarations includes regular excise declarations, supplementary excise declarations, and amended excise declarations, including tobacco excise stamp orders, submitted by tax entities.
Excise declarations do not include tax declarations in customs proceedings based on customs declarations and tax refund claims pertaining to: Mineral oils used for heating Other petrol used in business in other way than for heating and engine propulsion Mineral oil used for primary agricultural production Imposition of penalties includes administrative proceedings concerning violations of legal regulations and is a set of successive tasks.
The international exchange of information about tax entities (Excise Liaison Office – ELO) in accordance with Council Regulation (EU) No 389/2012 takes place in the form of: an application for administrative cooperation; a response to the application for administrative cooperation; spontaneous information; reports of events; reports on controls.
Movement in the duty suspension regime between the Czech Republic and Member States of the European Union, where the Czech customs office is the excise duty administrator of the tax warehouse of receipt or dispatch or of the authorised consignee.
Performance indicators in the Slovak Republic
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
Excise duty administration in Slovakia is in the purview of the customs authorities and the Excise Department of the Customs and Tax Section of the FD SR, where the excise duty administration procedure is regulated by various excise duty laws and the Tax Procedure Code.
These laws lay down not only the scope of power of the customs offices and FD SR in excise duty administration, but also the rights and obligations of tax entities in relation to registration for or payment of excise duties.
The biggest year-on-year increase in tax entities was registered between 2012 and 2013 and amounted to 234%. This rise was caused by an increase in the number of issued tax warehouse authorisations, increase in registrations of authorised consignees, and registration of a larger number of user undertakings.
Legislation specified the movement of certain bulk mineral oils as well as the notification obligations for moving minerals oils in bulk or in containers exceeding 150 litres or 230 litres, as the case may be, and expanded the list of mineral oils subject to control and transporting procedures to include anti-knock preparations, oxidation inhibitors, feldspathic inhibitors, viscosity improvers, and anticorrosive preparations.
In respect of lubricating oils, the obligation to indicate their kinematic viscosity was imposed.
The sections below discuss the registration process for certain tax entities under Slovak law in more detail.
Tax warehouse keeper
In connection with registration of tax warehouse keepers under Slovak national legislation, a person who wishes to operate a tax warehouse has to register as well as apply for a tax warehouse operating permit for each type of excisable commodity.
The resulting decision in the registration procedure is a certificate of registration for the respective excise duty through which the warehouse keeper acquires legal subjectivity for all warehouses.
At the same time, the customs office issues a tax warehouse operating licence which authorises the warehouse keeper to produce, process, receive, or dispatch excisable goods under duty suspension.
If a warehouse keeper has a warehouse in several locations, the excise duty administrator will issue a separate warehouse operating licence for each tax warehouse.
The movement of excisable goods under duty suspension are monitored electronically via EMCS.
For each movement, a unique reference code, called an ARC code, is generated.
It is possible to use this code to monitor the movement on-line, i.e., in real time.
If the tax warehouse keeper is also an authorised alcohol distributor, he is obliged to notify the customs office electronically about the name of the consumer packaged alcohol, the volume of ethyl alcohol and ethyl alcohol concentration by volume in the consumer packaged alcohol, and the EU barcode for each new type of consumer packaging that he is placing into free circulation no later than on the day of placing the alcohol into free circulation.
Registered consignor
A registered consignor is a unique type of tax entity that cannot at the same time be registered as a tax warehouse keeper even if he places excisable goods into free circulation after releasing them from duty suspension regime.
In connection with the registration of registered consignors under Slovak national legislation, a person who wishes to dispatch excisable items under duty suspension after releasing them into free tax circulation has to request the customs office at the same time for registration and authorisation to dispatch excisable items under duty suspension.
The customs office issues a certificate of registration for the respective excise duty and, at the same time, issues an authorisation (licence) to dispatch excisable items under duty suspension upon being released into free circulation.
Fruit growers’ distilleries
To operate a fruit growers’ distillery, at first it is necessary to obtain a permit to produce ethyl alcohol at a distillery from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Slovak Republic.
The permit alone does not authorise the holder to operate a growers’ distillery, however.
To be allowed to operate a growers’ distillery, a person must register at the customs office as a fruit growers’ distillery operator and request issuance of the respective registration certificate.
The customs office issues the registration certificate for the respective excise duty, which also authorises the growers’ distillery operator to produce ethyl alcohol in the growers’ distillery.
The purpose of a growers’ distillery is to provide a service for fruit growers.
A growers’ distillery cannot operate as a tax warehouse.
Legislators have allowed alcohol produced in a growers’ distillery to employ a 50% deduction on the basic duty rate, i.e., € 540/hl of alcohol.
The reduced duty rate applies to ethyl alcohol produced in a growers’ distillery up to 43l. of alcohol per grower and his household during one production period in the fiscal territory.
The production period is from 1 July of the current year to 30 June of the following year.
As a production year is not the same as a calendar year, it is possible to apply the reduced duty rate on the ethyl alcohol produced several times within a single calendar year, even though the ethyl alcohol in question is produced over two production periods.
Ethyl alcohol is produced outside the duty suspension regime, which means that the produced ethyl alcohol is in free tax circulation.
The grower pays the growers’ distillery not only the excise duty and value added tax, but also a fee for the services provided.
The growers’ distillery provides the growers with the delivery order, which is a document that proves not only the origin of the ethyl alcohol and how it was acquired, but also the payment of excise duty.
The movement of such ethyl alcohol is not subject to monitoring by the excise duty administrator.
Importer of consumer packaged goods
National legislation allows persons who, as part of their business, wish to import consumer packaged alcohol or cigarettes from a third country and place these commodities into free tax circulation in the fiscal territory, to request the customs office to be registered in the register of importers of consumer packaged goods.
An importer of consumer packaged goods does not register himself for the respective excise duty, but the customs office issues confirmation of inclusion in the register of importers of consumer packaged goods.
This confirmation authorises the importer to import consumer packaged alcohol or cigarettes from third countries.
At the same time, before excise stamps are issued, the importer has to pay a guarantee up to the amount of the duty applicable to the amount of the ethyl alcohol or cigarettes that he wishes to place into free circulation.
The importer of consumer packaged goods may place into free circulation only such consumer packaged goods that have excise stamps affixed to them.
For this reason, he must present the number and identification number of the excise stamps exported to a third country to the export customs office.
When importing, the importer is obliged to confirm to the import customs office the number of excise stamps imported from a third country.
When importing consumer packaged goods, the importer observes customs regulations according to which excise duty is part of the customs debt.
If the consumer packaged goods is released into free circulation, the paid guarantee will be refunded to the importer or it can be used to settle the customs debt.
An importer of consumer packaged goods is not a tax warehouse.
If the importer of consumer packaged alcohol is at the same time a person authorised to distribute ethyl alcohol, he is obliged to inform the customs office electronically about the name of the consumer packaged alcohol, amount and concentration of ethyl alcohol by volume in the consumer packaged alcohol, and the EAN bar code for each new type of consumer packaged alcohol that he is placing into free tax circulation no later than on the day of placing the packaged goods into free circulation.
Merchant of consumer packaged alcohol in free circulation
For the purpose of monitoring ethyl alcohol in free circulation and eliminating tax evasion, legislators have introduced the concept of merchant of consumer packaged alcohol.
A person who wishes to be a holder of a sales permit has to request the customs office for the permit and satisfy statutory conditions (trade licence to sell goods, no record of intentional economic crimes, no revocation of his trade licence in the last ten years, being not in liquidation or in bankruptcy).
As consumer packaged alcohol is in free circulation, no accompanying document is required during the movement of this commodity.
An invoice containing the number of the distribution licence holder is sufficient to demonstrate how the consumer packaged alcohol was acquired.
For each establishment, the authorisation holder is obliged to keep for each calendar month: a record of the number of pieces of consumer packaged alcohol received, the number of pieces of consumer packaged alcohol dispatched, the state of inventory of consumer packaged alcohol as at the last day of the month, and a record of shortage or surpluses in the number of pieces of received and dispatched consumer packaged goods.
The authorisation holder also has the obligation to purchase or otherwise take off consumer packaged alcohol only from a person authorised to distribute it.
Distributor of consumer packaged alcohol
For the purpose of monitoring the movement of ethyl alcohol in free tax circulation and eliminating tax evasion, legislators have introduced the concept of distributor of consumer packaged alcohol.
A person who wishes to become a distribution licence holder has to apply to the customs office for a distribution licence.
The applicant has to fulfil the statutory conditions (trade licence to sell goods, storage area of more than 200m2, annual turnover from the sale of consumer packaged alcohol of at least € 100,000 or paid up registered capital of at least € 100,000, at least 10 employees, no arrears payable to the customs office, no arrears on mandatory payments, no record of economic crime, no revocation of his licence in the last ten years, and being not in liquidation or bankruptcy).
As the consumer packaged alcohol is in free circulation, no accompanying document is required during movement of this commodity.
An invoice containing the number of the distribution licence holder is sufficient to demonstrate how the consumer packaged alcohol was acquired.
For each establishment, the authorisation holder is obliged to keep for each calendar year: a record of the number of pieces of consumer packaged alcohol received, the number of pieces of consumer packaged alcohol dispatched, the inventory of consumer packaged alcohol as at the last day of the month, and a record of shortages or surpluses in the number of pieces of received and dispatched consumer packaged goods.
The distribution licence holder also has the obligation to purchase or otherwise take off consumer packaged alcohol only from another person authorised to distribute it.
A distribution licence holder reports data for each calendar month electronically by the 25th day of the following calendar month.
Motor fuel merchant
To monitor motor fuels in free tax circulation and to eliminate tax evasion, a new type of tax entity was introduced: motor fuel merchant.
The Slovak Republic has no a special regulation on service stations.
For this reason, service stations are treated as motor fuel merchants under Slovak legislation.
A person who wishes to sell petrol, diesel, or LPG to end users as part of his business activities in the respective fiscal territory has to obtain a sales licence from the customs office first and present a document showing that the storage facility is certified and equipped with a suitable, certified metering device for measuring the amount of mineral oil received and dispatched. The storage tank also has to meet technical standards.
If the motor fuel merchant is also a warehouse keeper, authorised consignee, or authorised consigner, the customs office automatically also issues him a licence to sell motor fuels.
A motor fuel merchant is also obliged to keep a record of purchased and sold petrol, diesel, or LPG for each calendar month and to report any new motor fuel supplier (distributor) to the customs office.
A motor fuel merchant has the legal obligations to purchase or otherwise take off motor fuel only from motor fuel distributors or registered persons.
As the motor fuel is in free circulation, no accompanying document is required during its movement.
However, if motor fuel is being supplied using tank trucks, distributors will print out a delivery receipt from the metering device built into the tank truck for the merchant.
This document contains the amount of motor fuel delivered, date and time of delivery, and the registration number allocated to the fuel truck by the Road Traffic Inspectorate.
An invoice containing the motor fuel distributor’s number allocated to him by the excise duty administrator is also sufficient proof of the method of acquisition of motor fuels.
During their supervision over mineral oils, excise duty administrators in the Slovak Republic have encountered tax evasion related to the movement of these commodities.
Such evasion pertains chiefly to efforts to avoid road checks during transport, with carriers using secondary roads and bypassing the toll system due to movements being monitored more strictly.
The same holds true for transport of mineral oils in tank trucks that have been modified to have a false bottom.
Often, illegal transport takes place using two vehicles, with the first reporting any mobile patrols so that an alternative route can be found to avoid checks.
In addition, light heating oils or waste oils are often mixed with motor fuels.
Motor fuel distributor
To monitor motor fuels in free tax circulation and eliminate tax evasion, a new type of tax entity was introduced: motor fuel distributor.
A person who wishes to distribute petrol, diesel, or LPG in the fiscal territory must first submit a document showing that his storage facilities are certified and equipped with a suitable certified metering device and a list of suppliers and clients.
In addition to other legal obligations, a motor fuel distributor is also obliged to keep a separate record for each establishment showing the petrol, diesel, or LPG sold in each calendar month.
A motor fuel distributor has the legal obligation to purchase or otherwise take off motor fuels from other motor fuel distributors or registered persons only.
In the respective fiscal territory, a motor fuel distributor can only sell fuel to another motor fuel distributor, registered person, or motor fuel consumer.
However, if motor fuel is being supplied using tank trucks, the distributor will print out for the merchant a delivery receipt from the metering device built into the tank truck.
This document contains the amount of motor fuel delivered, date and time of delivery, and the registration number allocated to the fuel truck by the Road Traffic Inspectorate.
As the motor fuel is in free circulation, no accompanying document is required during its movement.
An invoice containing the motor fuel distributor’s or registered person’s number allocated by the excise duty administrator is also sufficient proof of the method of acquisition of motor fuels.
Motor fuel consumer
Motor fuel consumers have a special status under national legislation.
A person who purchases petrol, diesel, or LPG in the fiscal territory for his own use and stores this mineral oil in a storage facility able to hold 15,000 litres or more is obliged to report this to the customs office at the latest before using the storage facility for this first time.
The customs office will include the motor fuel consumer in a registry.
In addition to the statutory particulars, the motor fuel consumer is obliged to state the address where the storage facility is located.
In practice, motor fuel consumers constitute major carriers, cooperatives, bus lines, road construction companies, and other entities.
The storage facilities have to be certified and equipped with a metering device that measures the amount of motor fuel off-taken and used (level indicator, gauge rod).
The tank must meet technical standards.
A motor fuel consumer may only purchase motor fuel from a motor fuel distributor or from a registered person.
As the motor fuel is in free circulation, no accompanying document is required during its movement.
However, if motor fuel is being supplied using tank trucks, distributors will print out for the consumer a delivery receipt from the metering device built into the tank truck.
This document contains the amount of motor fuel delivered, date and time of delivery, and the registration number allocated to fuel truck by the Road Traffic Inspectorate.
An invoice containing the motor fuel distributor’s or registered person’s number allocated to it by the excise duty administrator is also sufficient proof of the method of acquisition of motor fuels.
During their supervision over mineral oils, excise duty administrators in the Slovak Republic registers duty evasion related to the movement of these commodities.
Small independent brewery
A small independent brewery operator is a person who brews beer as a business and fulfils certain statutory conditions.
Assuming the fulfilment of certain statutory conditions, a small independent brewery can apply a reduced duty rate of €2.652 per hl/percent of actual ethyl alcohol by volume.
Annual beer production is limited to 200,000 hl of beer.
As beer production is outside the duty suspension regime, an accompanying document is not required during movement because the beer is in free circulation.
A small independent brewery cannot be a tax warehouse.
In practice, such breweries are small family enterprises that also operate a restaurant or pub where they offer beer that they have brewed themselves.
Administrative tasks in Slovakia
Excise duty supervision over certain tax entities is divided up under Slovak law as follows.
The greatest increase in administrative tasks, i.e., by 5.3%, was registered in 2012 and 2013. This was caused by the greater number of movements executed in EMCS.
Conversely, the greatest year-on-year drop was registered in 2013 and 2014, specifically by 4.3%, which was caused by a smaller number of completed tax audits as well as a smaller number of submitted tax declarations.
The drop was due in part to changes in legislation.
Tax audits
Tax audits performed by the customs office aim to discover or examine facts required for the proper assessment of duties.
When performing tax audits, customs office employees present a tax audit authorisation to identify themselves. This authorisation contains information about the purpose and subject of the audit and periods covered by the audit.
In practice, this means that the audited period can be as short as one month or even as long as a number of taxation periods.
The scope of the audited periods is determined by the customs office.
A tax audit begins with a tax audit commencement report being drawn up.
Documents received or taken by the customs office are confirmed by a receipt.
The customs office is obliged to return any borrowed documents within 30 days of the end of a tax audit.
A customs office employee draws up a tax audit report.
If the tax audit finds a difference in the amount that the auditee was to pay, to report, or claimed as a duty refund, the customs shall send, along with the audit report, a request for a response to the report results.
The tax audit ends on the day of delivery of the report.
The deadline for performing the tax audit is one year from the date of its commencement.
A tax audit of registered persons and of certain listed persons is carried out as necessary, but at least once by the date of expiration of the right to levy tax, which is five years.
The FD SR issued an internal regulation governing such deadline to unify the excise duty administration procedures in Slovakia.
On-site inspections
On-site inspections are performed by the excise duty administrator to find evidence and to examine and ascertain facts that are required for excise duty administration.
A customs office employee draws up a record of the on-site inspection and provides the tax entity with a copy.
When carrying out an on-site inspection, the custom office employee has unrestricted access to the tax entity’s land, operating facilities, rooms and premises, including transport vehicles, transport packaging, and accounting documents.
Clearance of the amount of ethyl alcohol produced is examined through on-site inspections.
The findings form the basis for a tax audit.
During an on-site inspection, the customs office is entitled to take samples and seize items.
The FD SR issued an internal regulation governing fiscal supervision and on-site inspections for individual excisable goods to unify excise duty administration procedures in Slovakia.
Constant fiscal supervision in alcohol warehouses
When the Slovak Republic acceded to the European Union on 1 May 2004, a change in the area of excise duty administration occurred.
The need for more effective spending of resources from the state budget in connection with the administration of excise duty on ethyl alcohol, improving the business environment in the respective area and implementing legislative tools for more effective suppression of the grey economy in the respective area resulted in new legislation being adopted in 2004 in connection with excise duty administration.
One of the measures introduced by the new legislation was not only the transfer of excise duty administration duties performed by tax offices to the customs offices, but also the need for the presence of an excise duty administrator in tax warehouses for ethyl alcohol.
In Slovakia, national legislation stipulates that receiving, dispatching, producing, or processing ethyl alcohol in a tax warehouse is possible only in the presence of a customs office employee.
The above does not apply to tax warehouses that receive, store, or dispatch consumer packaged alcohol only.
The customs office is also obliged to ensure that the employee in the tax warehouse does not hinder the receipt, dispatch, production, or processing of ethyl alcohol.
The tax warehouse keeper is obliged to ensure that the customs office employee has suitable working conditions at the warehouse.
The tax warehouse keeper then charges the customs office for the space set up for the customs office employee on a monthly basis based on an agreement concluded with the FD SR.
When producing, processing, or storing ethyl alcohol at a tax warehouse, the ethyl alcohol production and storage facilities have to be set up to ensure that it is possible to ascertain at any time the amount of ethyl alcohol produced, processed, and stored.
The amount of spirits on stock and the ethyl alcohol content thereof must also be ascertainable at any time.
If a tax warehouse does not receive, dispatch, produce, or process ethyl alcohol, the customs office can waive the obligation to arrange the continuous presence of a customs officer. The premises, however, must be sealed off by the customs office.
This option is not often used in practice because tax warehouse keepers find the continuous presence of a customs officer beneficial.
Some tax warehouse keepers make use of the possibility under Act No 467/2002 Coll., on the production of ethyl alcohol and its placement on the market, and use ethyl alcohol production facilities and equipment in fruit growers’ distilleries also for the purposes of a distillery of spirits which has to be a tax warehouse.
Constant fiscal supervision in alcohol tax warehouses is provided by about 250 customs officers.
Issuance of vouchers for the collection of alcohol excise stamps
To be able to take off excise stamps, a request has to be submitted to the customs office for allocation of a registration number and issuance of a voucher for the collection of alcohol excise stamps.
An alcoholic beverage that is ethyl alcohol is understood as a goods under the combined nomenclature of 2207 and 2208 with actual ethyl alcohol by volume exceeding 1.2%.
The excise stamp is intended to label consumer packaged alcohol.
Consumer packaged alcohol is deemed to be a sealed consumer package filled with alcohol intended for direct human consumption.
Consumer packaged alcohol with a combined nomenclature code of 2207 and 2208 can be placed into free circulation in the fiscal territory only if an excise stamp is affixed to it.
Only tax warehouse keepers, authorised consignees, and importers of consumer packaged goods placing consumer packaged alcohol into free tax circulation may label consumer packaged alcohol.
The excise stamp contains among others a 14-digit identification number which consists of the registration number (digits in 1st-6th place), volume of ethyl alcohol (digits in 7th-11th place), and concentration of ethyl alcohol by volume in the consumer packaged alcohol (digits in the 12th-14th place).
Original design of alcohol excise stamp:
The customs office allocates a unique registration number to each excise stamp user.
Only an excise stamp with an identification number corresponding to the volume of the consumer packaged alcohol, ethyl alcohol concentration by volume in the consumer packaged alcohol, and excise stamp user can be used to label consumer packaged alcohol.
At the end of 2014, national legislation introduced a new excise stamp information system.
The objective of this new system was to facilitate and computerise the system for ordering, assessing, printing, distributing, and using excise stamps intended for labelling consumer packaged alcohol.
Only tax warehouse keepers, authorised consignees, importers of consumer packaged alcohol, and consignees (customers) of ethyl alcohol may label consumer packaged alcohol.
Excise stamp users who wish to take off excise stamps according to the “new system” have to file a request with the customs office to have excise stamps issued electronically.
Excise stamp users has to use the electronic excise stamp system not only to request that excise stamps be issued electronically, but also to report data required under Slovak national legislation and to keep a record of excise stamps.
No fewer than 500 excise stamps, or a multiple thereof, may be ordered.
In the same way, the excise duty administrator will communicate with excise stamp users through the electronic excise stamp system, especially when notifying them about the number of excise stamps they will be able to take off or when stipulating the deadline for collecting the excise stamps at the printing house.
Before collecting the excise stamps, the excise stamp user is obliged to deposit on the excise duty administrator’s account funds corresponding to the price of the excise stamps that he can take off and that the customs office notifies him about.
The price of the excise stamps takes into account printing fees but does not cover excise duty.
Excise stamps may only be printed by the state enterprise Mincovňa Kremnica, štátny podnik (the Kremnica Mint).
The FD SR performs fiscal supervision over the handing of excise stamps and their destruction at the printing house.
The FD SR is obliged to arrange the presence of one of its employee at the printing house during the handling of excise stamps.
The FD SR arranges the sale of excise stamps to excise stamp users at the printing house.
It is possible to take off excise stamps only from the Financial Directorate employee at the printing house.
Issuance of vouchers for the collection of tobacco excise stamps
An excise stamp user has to request the customs office for allocation of a user registration number and permit for the offtake of excise stamps.
Consumer packaged cigarettes can be placed into free circulation only if an excise stamp is affixed to them.
Only a cigarette manufacturing company can affix excise stamps to consumer packaged cigarettes.
Only a tax warehouse keeper, authorised consignee, or tobacco product importer who wishes to place tobacco products into free circulation in the fiscal territory can be an excise stamp user.
Only an excise stamp that contains information corresponding to the respective price of the cigarettes, number of cigarettes in the package, length of the cigarettes, valid tax rate symbol, and the offtake registration number can be used to label consumer packaged cigarettes.
It is possible to sell the consumer packaged cigarettes to end consumers only for the price given in the excise stamp.
At the end of 2014, national legislation introduced a new excise stamp information system.
The objective of this new system was to facilitate and computerise the system for ordering, assessing, printing, distributing, and using excise stamps intended for labelling consumer packaged tobacco, cigars, cigarillos, and cigarettes.
Excise stamp users who wish to take off excise stamps according to the “new system” have to file a request with the customs office to have excise stamps issued electronically.
Excise stamp users have to use the electronic excise stamp system not only to request that excise stamps be issued electronically, but also to report data required under Slovak national legislation and to keep a record of excise stamps.
Excise stamps may only be printed by the state enterprise Mincovňa Kremnica, štátny podnik (the Kremnica Mint).
The FD SR performs fiscal supervision over the handing of excise stamps and their destruction at the printing house.
The FD SR is obliged to arrange for the presence of one of its employee at the printing house during handling of the excise stamps.
The FD SR arranges the sale of excise stamps to excise stamp users at the printing house.
It is possible to take off excise stamps only from the Financial Directorate employee at the printing house.
Tax warehouse keepers or tobacco product importers can affix excise stamps to consumer packaged tobacco.
Tax warehouse keepers, tobacco product importers, or authorised consignees can affix excise stamps to consumer packaged cigars or cigarillos.
Only an excise stamp with the symbol indicating the valid excise duty rate can be used to label consumer packaged tobacco, cigars, and cigarillos.
Labelling of consumer packaged cigarettes with excise stamps may only be carried out by the company that manufactured the cigarettes.
No fewer than 500 excise stamps, or a multiple thereof, may be ordered.
The customs office will notify the excise stamp user electronically about the number of excise stamps that he may collect, the price of the excise stamps, and the bank account number of the FD SR no later than within three working days.
The customs office may reduce the number of ordered excise stamps if circumstances arise based on which it can be reasonable assumed that a breach of legal regulations might occur.
The FD SR determines the deadline for the excise stamp user to collect the stamps, but no later than within 10 working days.
The FD SR will inform the excise stamp user through the electronic excise stamp system about the deadline for collecting the excise stamps.
The FD SR hands over the excise stamps to excise stamp users only at the printing house against receipt of the funds corresponding to the price of the stamps specified in the electronic notification from the customs office.
Excise stamp users are obliged to keep record of excise stamps in the electronic excise stamp system separately for cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos, and tobacco.
Administrative cooperation between EU Member States (ELO)
In accordance with Council Regulation (EU) No 389/2012, the ELO and Excise Duty System Department of the Excise Duty Section of the Financial Directorate is responsible for arranging the exchange of information based on requests for administrative cooperation between EU Member States and the respective financial administration bodies.
Such requests pertain chiefly to verifying entities in connection with excise duty administration, obtaining information regarding excise duty administration, and confirming information from the SEED database.
Information is exchanged electronically through EMCS.
The following is included in administrative cooperation with EU Member States: Requesting administrative cooperation (request for verification, request for information on excise duty administration, request for confirmation of registration in SEED); Responding to requests for administrative cooperation; Spontaneous information; Reports of events; Reports on controls.

Growers’ distilleries in Slovakia must have a permit not only from the Slovak Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, but also from the excise duty administrator.
In the Czech Republic, growers’ distilleries only need a permit from the Ministry of Agriculture.
In Slovakia, consumer packaged alcohol can only be imported by tax warehouse keepers and importers of consumer packaged alcohol.
An importer permit is conditional upon registration of the applicant with the excise duty administrator.
In the Czech Republic, importing consumer packaged alcohol needs no special permit from the excise duty administrator.
In Slovakia, the sale of consumer packaged alcohol requires a sales permit issued by the excise duty administrator.
Sellers of consumer packaged alcohol have the legal obligation to keep a record of purchases and sales.
In the Czech Republic, the excise duty administrator does not issue any permits to final sellers of consumer packaged alcohol: it is sufficient for them to have a licence to sell alcohol from the Trade Licensing Office. The final seller keeps no special records.
In Slovakia, motor fuel merchants must have the respective sales permit from the excise duty administrator.
Slovak law has no special regulation governing service stations. All activities pertaining to service stations are only regulated in the Act on Excise Duty on Mineral Oils.
In the Czech Republic, service stations are regulated by the Act on Motor Fuels. The excise duty administrator, however, issues no licences to sell motor fuels.
Service stations are registered and the Ministry of Industry and Trade publishes their list.
In Slovakia, it is not technically possible to obtain a list of service stations from the financial administration system.
In Slovakia, there has been a sharp rise in the number of various permits or registrations of tax entities since 2012.
This increase was caused by a legislative change in the mentioned period.
In the Czech Republic, however, the number of permits fell substantially in 2013 due to the introduction of a guarantee for motor fuel distributors.
Administrative tasks
In Slovakia, substantive law regulations lay down the obligation to perform tax audits at various tax entities.
This issue is addressed in more detail by the internal regulation issued by the FD SR to unify the excise duty administration procedure in Slovakia.
In the Czech Republic, substantive law regulations do not regulate the obligation to perform tax audits; procedural regulations only state the possibility to perform a tax audit no later than by the duty assessment deadline.
The reason for the major difference in the number of conducted tax audits and on-site inspections in Slovakia and in the Czech Republic is the fact that the internal regulation of the FD SR stipulates the cases where the excise duty administrator has to perform a tax audit and the respective deadlines, whereas in the Czech Republic, on-site inspections are the main tools used to check the accuracy of excise declarations or excise duty refund claims.
The number of comparable administrative tasks in the Czech Republic grew in 2012 as a result of an increase in the number of movements in EMCS and in the number of tax declarations filed.
In Slovakia, the number of administrative tasks between 2012 and 2015 grew slightly, a trend that was influenced by the growing number of movements in EMCS and a concurrent decrease in the number of excise returns filed.
Assessment
Different legal regulations resulted in major differences in the number of comparable authorisations and registrations of tax entities.
The number of comparable administrative tasks by excise duty administrators in Slovakia and in the Czech Republic were similar in each of the audited years.
In Slovakia, the total number of comparable tax entities, of which there is one-third fewer than in the Czech Republic, shares almost the same number of administrative tasks.
Based on the above, it can be said that Slovakia is focused more on excise duty administrators carrying out administrative tasks, such as physical fiscal supervision.
In the Czech Republic, greater emphasis is placed on remote supervision, e.g., through camera surveillance systems, immediate dispatch of data through a web interface, and a risk analysis.
Computerisation of administrative tasks
Computerisation of administrative tasks in the Czech Republic
The excise declaration can be filed via data box.
The Czech Customs Administration introduced interactive excise declaration forms, which, however cannot be further processed by computer.
Furthermore, the data has to be rewritten to the tax entity’s tax account.
The benefit of this system is a reduction of errors in filed excise declarations, which reduces the number of tasks that need to be performed by excise duty administrators to manage errors in incorrectly filed excise declarations.
The GDC is working on a new application for computerising the excise declaration processing.
Through the intelligent forms, it is also possible to: file excise duty or registration applications or notifications of changes to data; file excise duty refund claims; satisfy the notification requirement related to handling special mineral oils, handling raw tobacco, and satisfying biofuel-related obligations.
Handling excise stamps is recorded by tax entities in the ORO WebKlient information system, which is available to registered tax entities to enter data required by the excise duty administrator.
Products under duty suspension can be moved in the Czech Republic based on an electronic accompanying document, which, in the Czech Republic, is implemented as a national functionality in the electronic excise movement and control system (EMCS).
Products in free circulation can move around the fiscal territory of the Czech Republic accompanied by a document proving their taxation, a duty exemption document, a customs office decision on release of products into the customs regime, a simplified accompanying document, or other decision on excise duty assessment.
The required content of the data is laid down in legal regulations.
To facilitate the satisfaction of these obligations, the Czech Republic implemented a voluntary electronic system for issuing alternative documents (Sections 5 and 6 of Act No 353/2003 Coll.).
This system allows paper documents to be replaced or supplemented with electronically issued documents that are sent via the Czech Customs Administration web interface to a data repository, where a unique 12-digit identification code (UIC) is allocated.
The UIC is used by the customs authorities for control purposes on the road and makes it impossible for goods to be moved again using the same document.
The Czech Customs Administration has online access to the electronic recordkeeping system of the biggest warehouse keeper for motor fuel in the Czech Republic, who places about half of the total volume of motor fuel into free circulation and who automatically enters the issued tax documents into this system.
The Czech Customs Administration is considering implementing e-VDO, i.e., an electronic system for recording and monitoring the movement of various products in free circulation.
This system should make use of 70% of existing EMCS functional specifications.
A benefit of this system will be a user-friendly environment for declarants and customs officers.
It will also be connected to the guarantee management system, the Tax Entities Register, and the risk analysis system (ERIAN).
The system should provide an overview of movements in free circulation between Member States, which at present is functioning based on paper documents without a record or exchange of the reference numbers of the simplified accompanying documents.
Misuse of the simplified accompanying document, repeated use of a single document, and illegal transport without any documents are the main risks of the current approach to recording the movements of products in free circulation.
Computerisation of administrative tasks in Slovakia
During excise duty administration, the Slovak Financial Administration uses electronic communication to monitor the movement of goods under duty suspension in EMCS, excise stamps, and the submission of excise declarations, and to register and record tax entities.
In 2014, one-way communication of tax entities with the excise duty administrator was also introduced and then, in 2016, expanded to allow two-way communication.
Under this electronic communication system, a tax entity, after entering login data, has access to its personal web zone, called a personal electronic mailbox, which is intended for communication with the financial administration.
In this zone, a tax entity has access to an electronic mailroom, through which it sends requests, notifications, tax declarations, and other documents pertaining to excise duty administration.
Electronic communication via the personal web zone does not involve all tax entities.
National legislation defines the tax entities that are obliged to communicate with the excise duty administrator electronically.
This pertains mainly to VAT payers, tax advisors representing tax entities, and lawyers representing tax entities.
During the audit, the Slovak SAO also addressed the questions of the computerisation extent of excise duty administration.
This pertained also to full computerisation of tasks – excise declarations and electronic communication within ELO.
Apart from movements in EMCS, there was an increase in computerisation of various comparable administrative tasks, which is also a requirement of modern excise duty administration.
Comparison and assessment
Comparison
In Slovakia, the excise declaration procedure is fully computerised from the submission of the excise declaration to the recording of the excise obligation.
In the Czech Republic, a computerised excise declaration procedure is not available.
In the Czech Republic, tax entities may upload mandatory documents for each movement in free circulation onto a website.
Notifications of movements in free circulation in the form and on the basis of EMCS are being prepared.
Assessment
The system for reporting movements in free circulation in the Czech Republic contributes to fiscal supervision, thereby eliminating the movement of certain products for which excise duty has not been paid.
This can be recommended as a good practice.
Computerisation of the excise declaration procedure has shown to be a good practice in Slovakia.
The Slovak SAO and the Czech SAO therefore recommend completion of the computerisation of the excise declaration procedure in the Czech Republic.
Analysis of changes to the organisational structure and staffing in the area of excise duties
The organisational structure of the Czech Customs Administration and the Slovak Financial Administration has undergone fundamental changes.
Organisational structure of the Czech Customs Administration
Effective of 1 January 2013, the Czech Customs Administration comprises the General Directorate of Customs and the customs offices, which are administrative authorities and branches of the government.
The Czech Customs Administration is the accounting entity for the entire customs administration.
The Czech Customs Administration has conducted comprehensive excise duty administration since 2004 as one of its many responsibilities.
The Czech Customs Administration is also responsible for the following areas:
a) Audits and inspections:
Road transport (weighing of freight vehicles, payment of road tolls, fulfilment of conditions for transporting hazardous goods, expert supervision of vehicle crews in international road freight transport, and in matters pertaining to international passenger transport);
Handling of waste and packaging material;
Safety of imported food;
Consumer protection and protection of intellectual property rights;
Employment of foreigners.
b)Customs administration – comprehensive application of customs regulations, commercial policy measures, and formalities in connection with importing and exporting goods
c) Collection and enforcement of monetary obligations imposed by other public authorities as part of shared administration
d)Activities of the police authorities (authorised customs authorities) in criminal proceedings related to violation of customs and related regulations and tax regulations when the Czech Customs Administration is the excise duty administrator.
Although the range of competencies (combination of control activities) increases spending for the Czech Customs Administration, savings are incurred on the scope, as public administration does not need to expend costs on creating control teams for each subject of control.
At the same time, the administrative burden for inspected parties subject to re-audit is being reduced.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
As part of the Modernisation of the Czech Customs Administration project, on 1 January 2013, the Czech Customs Administration changed from a three-level structure to a two-level one, eliminating the middle level (customs directorates).
The GDC spent about CZK 51,000,000 (about € 2,031,000) on the project.
As of 1 January 2013, the Czech Customs Administration has comprised the General Directorate of Customs and the regional customs offices, which are administrative authorities and branches of the government.
The customs offices and their responsibilities are laid down in the law, and all customs offices through their departments and local branches carry out excise duty administration.
Local branches are the internal organisational units of the customs offices.
Establishing and winding up local branches and determining their responsibilities is in the remit of the Ministry of Finance, which issues decrees in this regard.
Legal regulations do not lay down any responsibilities on the local branches – they act in the name and on behalf of the customs offices.
Organisational structure until 31 Dec. 2012
Organisational structure since 1 January 2013
Until 31 December 2012, excise duty administration was performed by the General Directorate of Customs, 8 customs directorates and 58 customs office departments (including branches), i.e., a total of 67 divisions and departments.
On 1 January 2016, excise duty administration was carried out by the General Directorate of Customs and 51 departments of the customs offices and their local branches, 8 offices of the Legal Section of the General Directorate of Customs, and customs office divisions providing mobile supervision, i.e., about 60 locations.
Spending by the Czech Customs Administration is affected most by payroll expenses.
Due to the reorganisation of the Czech Customs Administration, there were no savings on human resources.
Most of the work is undertaken by customs officers employed under the Act on the Service of Security Force Members.
The possibility to reduce the numbers of these officers is very limited in the Czech Republic, as pursuant to Section 42(1) of Act No 361/2003 Coll., on the service of members of the security forces, it is possible to dismiss an officer only under certain conditions. The law provides and exhaustive list of these conditions.
The reduction of positions due to organisation changes in security forces is not a reason to dismiss officers, and the employer is obliged to transfer them to corresponding positions within the forces or arrange positions at other security forces (e.g., the Czech Police, Czech Prison Service); alternatively, they are made temporary reserve officers during which time they collect in accordance with law 80% of their average service income.
11 ECB exchange rate as at 31 Dec. 2010, when the MoF approved funds for the modernisation of the Czech Customs Administration by a budgetary measure dated 28 June 2010.
Organisational structure of excise duty administration in Slovakia
As part of its Policy Statement for 2012 to 2016, the Slovak Government listed as one of its priorities the completion of excise duty administration reforms through the UNITAS programme, and by unifying the collection of tax, customs, and levies and supressing tax evasion, it will obtain sufficient budgetary resources.
In this context, the tax reform took place on the central level, which resulted in the merger of the Slovak Tax Directorate and the Slovak Customs Directorate into the FD SR and the creation of the financial administration.
On 1 January 2012, Act No 333/2011 Coll., on governmental agencies for taxes, fees and customs, as amended, established the FD SR as a state-funded organisation with its registered office in Banská Bystrica. It is included in the state budget through the budgetary heading of the Slovak Ministry of Finance.
The FD SR, the customs offices, and the Financial Administration Criminal Office are, pursuant to Act No 199/2004 Coll., on customs and on amendment to certain acts, as amended, customs authorities who fulfil their tasks according to customs regulations.
In accordance with Act No 333/2011 Coll., on governmental agencies for taxes and fees and customs, as amended, they constitute the financial administration along with the tax offices.
As of 1 January 2012, the new organisational structure has comprised the FD SR, the Financial Administration Criminal Office, the Financial Operations Competence Centre, the tax offices, the Specialised Tax Office, tax office branches, tax office contact points, customs offices, customs office branches (CO tax branch, CO combined branch, CO customs branch) and customs office stations.
The FD SR’s mission is the effective collection and administration of taxes and customs, i.e., including excise duties, to fulfil the revenue portion of the state budget and protect the economic interests of the state.
The President of the Financial Administration of Slovakia, who is appointed and recalled by the Slovak Minister of Finance, is the governing body of the FD SR.
The President of the Financial Administration is responsible to the Minister of Finance for all financial administration operations and, thereby, even for the activities of the FD SR, which he manages and represents in full.
The short form of the organisational structure as at 1 January 2012:
Excise duty administration activities and processes in Slovakia are the responsibility of the customs office branches (38 branches), customs office stations (18 stations), the excise duty departments (9 departments) and legal support departments (9 departments).
Comparison of the total number of financial administration employees involved in excise duty administration shows a slight downward trend in the number of such employees.
Employee numbers differ not only between units, but also year-on-year.
This is mainly due to the number of systemised positions per organisational unit and due to the number of excise duty administrations managing the individual customs offices.
The number of managers in financial administration is based on service requirements, especially in connection with the creation of new organisational units.
Comparison and assessment
Comparison
Within the organisational structure of the Slovak Financial Administration, the FD SR and 74 organisational units with a total of 1,300 employees administrating almost 48,000 tax entities were involved in excise duty administration in 2015.
Within the organisational structure of the Czech Customs Administration, close to 60 organisational units with a total of 1,011 employees administering about 114,000 tax entities were involved in excise duty administration in 2015.
In the Czech Republic, activities related to excise duty administration are divided up across several units that are independent of each other in terms of staffing.
Middle management and top management oversee their mutual coordination and cooperation.
In Slovakia, activities related to excise duty administration (registration, excise declarations, tax audits) are divided between the excise duty departments and the customs office branches, where often it is the same excise duty administration employees who deal with the agenda.
Assessment
In Slovakia, there are about two-third fewer tax entities falling on the total number of employee involved in excise duty administration than in the Czech Republic. The greater number of employees does not appear to have an affect on the effectiveness of excise duty administration.
EMCS system
According to the preamble of the Decision No 1152/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 on computerising the movement and surveillance of excisable products, the aim of setting up a computerised system for monitoring the movement of excisable goods is to allow Member States to obtain real-time information on those movements and to carry out the requisite checks, including checks during movement of products, and allow the intra-Community movement of goods under suspension of excise duties to be simplified.
When implementing this system, Member States should allow the economic operators, especially the small and medium-sized enterprises active in this sector, to use these national components at the lowest possible cost.
Article three of the mentioned Decision allows national specifications, the national databases forming part of the system, and any software or equipment which a Member State considers necessary to ensure full use of the system throughout its administration to be included in EMCS.
EMCS in the Czech Republic
Development and functionality of EMCS
In the Czech Republic, EMCS was preceded by the Registry of Selected Products (“Evidence vybraných výrobků” - EVV), which was in operation from May 2004 to the end of March 2010.
EMCS has been fully operational in the Czech Republic since 1 April 2010 and supplemented regularly by European and national functionalities (see Annex 5).
In the Czech Republic, a socalled customs module and declarant module have been implemented.
The customs module contains several national functionalities.
Going beyond the Community system, the Czech Republic monitors through EMCS movements of goods under suspension of excise duties that start and end in the Czech Republic.
Upon approval of the notice of receipt of a consignment intended for an authorised consignee for one-off acceptance, the system ensures the automatic dispatch of the information to the Tax Entities Register with subsequent invalidation of the permit.
The administration of received and sent requests for international cooperation and spontaneous information from ELO, including responses sent with attachments of any format, and translations are fully provided through the system.
It is also possible to receive reports on the manual termination of exports in ECS (in the EU, only assignment of automatically created reports is implemented).
Risk profiles for outgoing or incoming consignments are set up according to actually required criteria.
EMCS does not allow approval of e-AD or receipt notification without a response to the risk profile from the respective customs authority (it is not possible to ignore a risk profile).
The declarant module is available to tax entities for free in the form of a web application that users sign into using their user name and password (coordinates), which are allocated to them upon registration with the Czech Customs Administration.
Each action pertaining to an EMCS customs module has to bear a valid electronic signature in the EMCS declarant module.
The declarant module allows tax entities to enter data on commencement and termination of movements of goods under duty suspension directly; tax entities thus do not have to spend funds on purchasing a system.
The national functionalities of the declarant module allow data to be opened and stored off-line (saves time in the case of frequently used data), data about recipients to be filled in based on SEED ID checks and requests for filling in data that are voluntary on the EU level (maximum data for risk analysis).
The system also allows the excise guarantee in the corresponding amount to be held in respect of every consignment until its movement ends.
The amount of the guarantee is calculated by EMCS automatically.
Without a sufficient guarantee, it is not possible to send an e-AD proposal from the EMCS declarant module to the customs office for approval.
Each guarantee has a unique number and contains the ARC of the movement (including the amount of the blocked bond) for which it was used.
The tax entity can manage its guarantees in the EMCS declarant module, where it can see the current amount of the blocked and unblocked excise guarantees.
Expenditure on implementing and using EMCS
EMCS development was executed based on eight agreements between 2006 and 2017 worth CZK 46,791,924.60 (i.e., € 1,761,412.56), excluding VAT, in total.
In line with the agreements, the contractor issued invoices totalling CZK 43,577,255.19 (i.e., € 1,640,401.10),5 excluding VAT, between 2006 and the end of 2015.
In the audited period, CZK 14,545,454 excluding VAT (i.e., € 547,438.99), was spent upgrading EMCS.
The amount spent on upgrading EMCS in the audited period converted to one movement entered into EMCS amounts on average to CZK 16.49 (i.e., € 0.62); without national movements, spending per movement between the Czech Republic and EU Member States amounted to CZK 24.40 (i.e., € 0. 92).
The technical support of EMCS was provided based in four agreements between 2011 and 2017.
By the end of 2015, CZK 7,499,675 (i.e., € 281,389.77),13 including VAT, was invoiced for the technical support.
The average amount paid since 2011 for the technical support per movement entered in EMCS since 2010 amounts to CZK 6.18 (i.e., € 0.23).
Invoices for the development and technical support pertained to the national solutions, which led to the development of the EVV application, which the General Directorate of Customs operated before EMCS was launched.
The invoices were paid from national sources under programme financing.
Technical support is invoiced as part of services to other applications provided by the supplier to the Czech Customs Administration.
EMCS in Slovakia
EMCS (Excise Movement and Control System) is an electronic system operated by the EU Member States for the purpose of monitoring the movement of excisable goods under duty suspension between Member States.
It replaced the accompanying document that was used before this system came into effect, thereby ensuring better checks and supervision of movements.
EMCS was launched in Slovakia on 1 April 2010 and is updated regularly based on requirements stemming from EU legislation.
A unique administrative reference code, ARC, is generated for each movement.
This code is used to monitor movements on-line, i.e., in real time.

EMCS was implemented as another module of SysNeD application software. For this reason, the Slovak side cannot determine the costs of its first application.
Comparison and assessment
Comparison
The objective of EMCS was to replace a system based on movement administration in paper form.
The benefit of EMCS is a complex overview of transport between EU Member States, from notification of when transport begins up to when it ends. Another important aspect is the reduction of administrative costs spent by the excise duty administrator and tax entities on processing, submitting and storing documents.
In the Czech Republic and in Slovakia, national functionalities have been implemented into EMCS to allow surveillance of movement of goods under duty suspension between two spots in the Czech Republic or in Slovakia.
Moreover, in the Czech Republic, the automatic functionalities of on-line monitoring and securing the excise bond has been added.
National functionalities that monitor the risk profile of the tax entity or movement, with a subsequent mandatory response form the excise duty administrator, have also been implemented.
EMCS shows that Slovakia and the Czech Republic have comparable number of movements within the EU.
Between 2012 and 2015, Slovakia spent € 744,310.01 more that the Czech Republic upgrading this system.
The Slovak SAO obtained information from the FD SR about EMCS upgrades for the period since 2011 although this system was launched earlier.
Despite this fact, Slovakia spent € 188,134.44 more than the Czech Republic did on implementing and upgrading EMCS over the ten years that it has been in operation there.
Assessment
In the audited period, the costs associated with upgrading EMCS in Slovakia per movement was 2.3 times higher than in the Czech Republic.
Conclusion
Cooperation between the Czech SAO and the Slovak SAO has satisfied its objectives.
Both auditing institutions obtained greater knowledge and understanding of the excise duty administration system in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
Despite a shared basic legal framework, the cooperation revealed significant differences between the two systems affecting the effectiveness of excise duty administration.
During the parallel audits, examples of good practice were found. These could contribute to reducing tax fraud, the significance of which will grow as duty rates rise.
Procedures reducing the costs of excise duty administration were also identified.
Cooperation has revealed differences that significantly influence excise duty administration and hinder international comparison without mutually coordinated audits being conducted at the excise duty administrator.
In this the role of the supreme audit institutions is indispensable.
Report on the Results of the Parallel Audit of the Administration of Value Added Tax in the Czech Republic and in the Federal Republic of Germany
Foreword
The Lima Declaration was adopted in 1977 and emphasises that the supreme audit institutions (SAI) have powers to carry out audits of all public finances.
The Declaration requests that SAI shall be empowered to audit the collection of taxes as extensively as possible.
The European Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (EUROSAI) considers taxes one of the most significant parts of the public revenues.
The VI Congress EUROSAI held in Bonn in 2005 focused on an audit of public revenues by SAI.
One of the important steps on the way to optimise the audit activity of a SAI is to work out a special strategy for audit of public revenues.
This relates above all to taxes as the biggest source of public revenues that is also at a high risk of loss.
Since the economies of individual countries are more and more interconnected and interdependent SAI can be, in a certain manner, unable to perform audit activities without cooperation with SAI of other countries.
As an example we can mention the audit of internationally organised fraud that causes significant revenue losses in many countries.
In fighting against such crime, the cooperation between authorities is a necessity.
SAI that carry out audits in this area need to be willing to work closely together.
The idea to carry out an audit on value added tax (hereinafter “VAT”) and the VIES system came up at the VI EUROSAI Congress in Bonn. This audit was performed in cooperation between the Czech Supreme Audit Office and the German Supreme Audit Institution, Bundesrechnungshof.
During following detailed preparations, both SAI had to familiarise with the law environment and procedures of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and in Germany.
Based on an information analysis, we had made the selection of audit topics that we put on the audit programme.
Achieving efficiency and effectiveness in the administration of VAT is a long-term problem and individual countries (the EC Member States especially) are looking for an answer on how to improve the system, how to simplify VAT collection and make it more transparent.
We are convinced that the results of our audit may help not only to improve tax administrators´ work, but also serve as a basis for improving an international information exchange system.
Report on the Results of the Parallel Audit of the Administration of Value Added Tax in the Czech Republic and in the Federal Republic of Germany
Introduction
Audit number: (CZ) 06/27 (D) VIII 2 – 2005 – 1215
Subject of audit:
(CZ) Administration of value added tax following accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union
(D) Review of the administrative cooperation in the field of VAT according to the Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and the Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2004
Objective of audit:
(CZ) The objective of the audit in the Czech Republic was to review the procedure used by financial authorities in administrating value added tax following integration of the Czech Republic into the common internal market of the European Community (hereinafter “EC”), connected with free movement of goods and services, and to review the use of the VIES, particularly monitoring the exercise of the right to exempt intraCommunity deliveries from value added tax.
(D) The objective of the audit was to review the system of intraCommunity VAT control with a special focus on administrative cooperation in the field of VAT according to the above mentioned regulations.
As a result of this, weaknesses should be reported and recommendations be developed to address the problems stated.
Value Added Tax Information Exchange System The audits were performed by the Supreme Audit Office, Czech Republic (hereinafter the “SAO”) and by the German Bundesrechnungshof (hereinafter “BRH”) in mutual cooperation on the basis of an agreement concluded between the two audit institutions on June 8, 2006.
The cooperation primarily concerned the review of selected commercial transactions between taxpayers from the Czech Republic (hereinafter “CR”) and from the Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter “Germany”), use of information obtained via international cooperation between tax administrations and comparison of the VAT administration systems in the two countries.
A joint final report on the results of the audits was processed in the sense of European Directive No. 31 for implementing the INTOSAI audit standards.
The audited period covered the period from May 1, 2004 to December 31, 2005.
Summary of results and evaluation of parallel audits
Based on an agreement between the two SAI the parallel audit on the administration of VAT in the CR and Germany was carried out.
Besides the main point – exchange of information based on the Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 and the Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2004 – the audit covered other topics as for instance the registration of taxpayers, VAT returns and recapitulative statements that are closely linked with it.
Additionally, the legal situation in terms of international bus transportation of passengers and the comparison of certain statistical data were part of the audit.
By comparing the systems of administration of VAT in the two countries differences were found in the following areas:
1) Registration for VAT.
Whereas entrepreneurs in Germany are registered regardless of the volume of their turnover, in the CR the prime criterion (except others) for registration is exceeding of the turnover limit set down in the law on VAT.
In the CR, taxpayers are assigned one tax identification number only, which they also use in intra-Community transactions.
For VAT registration purposes in Germany taxpayers are assigned a tax number that serves only for business transactions within the German territory.
If German taxpayers intend to do intra-Community transactions, they have to apply for assignment of a special identification number, so-called VAT ID.
Since the different ways of registration cause problems, the conditions should be harmonised in the whole EC (see 4.1).
2) International bus transportation of passengers.
In the CR, the international bus transportation of passengers is exempt from VAT with the right for VAT deduction.
In Germany, the part of transportation that takes place in the German territory is subject to VAT.
At EC level, efforts should be undertaken to harmonise the situation, in the sense of article 393 of the Council Directive 2006/112/EC, on the common system of VAT (see 4.2).
3) VAT returns.
While in the CR taxpayers submit VAT returns only for particular taxable periods (month or quarter), taxpayers in Germany are obliged to submit preliminary VAT returns (monthly or quarterly) and after the end of a calendar year, they have to submit an annual VAT return.
In contrast to Czech taxpayers, taxpayers in Germany are obliged to submit preliminary VAT returns electronically.
Introducing the obligation to submit VAT returns electronically in the CR would increase the efficiency of the Czech tax administration (see 4.3).
4) Recapitulative statements.
Whereas taxpayers in the CR submit recapitulative statements to tax offices, in Germany taxpayers submit recapitulative statements to the CLO.
Therefore, tax offices in the CR have the data contained in recapitulative statements available immediately after their submission.
German tax offices have information from recapitulative statements available only after their processing at the CLO.
Combating VAT fraud requires updated information about intra-Community transactions as soon as possible.
The monthly submission of recapitulative statements would shorten the time lag between the date of the transaction and the update of VIES data.
Consequently, this would allow timely review of the taxation in the Member State of the acquirer (see 4.4).
For this purpose all Member States of the EC would have to introduce the same deadline for submission of recapitulative statement.
5) International exchange of information in the area of VAT.
On receiving a request for information, the Czech CLO observes compliance with the three-month deadline.
The German CLO does not follow up elapsed time.
As a result of this the German tax administration dealt with a significantly lower percentage of received requests within the set deadline.
Because of these problems the BRH recommended to the German CLO to introduce a steady reminding exercise (see 4.6).
6) Risk management.
Each of both Member States is developing its own risk management system (hereinafter “RMS”), that has its strengths and weaknesses.
The SAO and BRH point out that an effective RMS cannot be developed by only one Member State.
Successful criteria, components or approaches of a RMS have to be exchanged and implemented in each Member State of the EC, if not so fraudsters will choose that Member State with the weakest RMS (see 5.).
As part of cooperation, the two SAI reviewed selected cases of intra-Community transactions processed by tax entities in the CR and Germany.
Thirty-one cases of business transactions were reviewed jointly using the legal provisions of the CLO, where there were doubts about their realization, their proper treatment or suspicion of VAT fraud.
The SAI found that:
In some cases, tax offices made use of the information obtained via international exchange and have reassessed taxpayer’s VAT liability.
In those cases, taxpayers either unlawfully applied the right for exemption of supplies from VAT, or did not declare acquisition of goods in their VAT return.
In some cases, tax offices could not make use of the information obtained, because the information was incomplete or incomprehensible.
In other cases, the information could not be used because of differing legal provisions in both Member States.
In some cases, the tax administration of another Member State refused to reply to a request for information.
Some cases were detected, where taxpayers wrongly declared business transactions in their recapitulative statements.
As a result of this, data in VIES were erroneous and therefore the tax administrators had to review those cases (see 6).
Audit procedure
Audit procedure in the CR
The audit was performed in the period from June 2006 to March 2007 by the Division II – Department of State Budget Incomes and by the territorial departments of Central Bohemia, North-Western Bohemia, Southern Bohemia Southern Moravia, Central Moravia and Northern Moravia.
The audited entities were: the Ministry of Finance (hereinafter the “MoF”) and 10 tax offices – the tax office in Humpolec, the tax office in Jihlava, the tax office in Kadaň, the tax office in Liberec, the tax office in Nymburk, the tax office in Otrokovice, the tax office for Prague 1, the tax office for Prague 4, the tax office in Sokolov and the tax office in Třinec.
The SAO Collegium approved the conclusions of this audit on April 23, 2007.
Audit procedure in Germany
The audit was performed in the period from July 2006 to February 2007 by the audit unit for indirect taxes and staff of the assigned regional audit offices in Berlin, Frankfurt/Main and Munich.
It was part of the audit programme for 2006 and therefore announced to the Federal MoF in 2006.
After a test phase the audit started in the fourth quarter of 2006.
According to the cases selected by the BRH and later selected by the SAO, the BRH notified a number of federal states of the audit mission.
Besides interviews at the Federal MoF and the CLO the audit was conducted in the following federal states:
Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony.
Tax files of the following tax offices were included:
Bruchsal, Ettlingen, Freudenstadt, Karlsruhe-Stadt, Leonberg, Mühlacker, Singen, Tuttlingen, Cham, Fürstenfeldbruck, München-Körperschaften, München II, IV und München V, Starnberg, Hamburg-Altona, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg-Mitte, Hamburg-Nord und Hamburg für Großunternehmen, Hannover-Nord, Winsen-Luhe, Bonn-Innenstadt, Köln-Mitte, Köln-Porz, Köln-Süd, Sankt Augustin, Pirmasens, Bautzen, Chemnitz-Süd, Dresden II, Freiberg, Leipzig I und Zschopau.
Additionally, discussions were held with the tax offices Augsburg-Stadt, Aurich, Düsseldorf-Altstadt, Eisleben, Kelheim und Verden.
The audit findings were reported to the MoF in May 2007.
Cooperation of the two audit institutions
As part of preparing parallel audits, several meetings of representatives of the two audit institutions were held in the period prior to their commencement.
Participants in these meetings became acquainted with the organisation of the tax administrations, legislation on VAT and the VAT administration system in the two countries.
The subject matter of the testing phase was agreed at the meeting that was held in May 2006.
The results of the testing phase were evaluated at the next joint meeting in August 2006.
At this meeting, also a timetable was agreed for further procedure, and the following subjects for parallel audits were selected:
1. Registration of VAT payers.
2.
International passenger bus transportation – legislation in the CR and Germany.
3. International exchange of information, in particular the processing of requests for information and furthermore how the tax offices reviewed selected problem cases mentioned in the requests for information, and in the spontaneous information supplied between the CR and Germany.
4. VAT returns.
5.
Recapitulative statements.
6.
Statistical information on supply and acquisition of goods between the CR and the Germany.
7. VAT risk management.
At a meeting of the SAO and the BRH, held in December 2006, the two parties became acquainted with the audit procedure in the CR and Germany and discussed results achieved in the parallel audits.
A report on the results of the parallel audits of the administration of VAT between the CR and Germany was elaborated at the working meeting in July 2007.
4. Administration of value added tax in the CR and Germany
Registrace plátců k DPH
A) Taxpayers with their offi cial seat, place of business or commercial premises in the CR
Pursuant to Act No. 337/1992 Coll., on administration of taxes and fees (hereinafter “Act No. 337/1992 Coll.”) the term tax entity refers to a taxpayer, a taxable person and the legal successor of a natural or legal person that is a tax entity definedby law.
As of December 31, 2004, a total of 421,865 tax entities were registered for VAT in the CR.
The number of tax entities registered for VAT has increased to 457,590 by 1 December 2005.
A person obliged to pay tax, who has his official seat, place of business or commercial premises in the CR, whose turnover in the most recent 12 preceding consecutive calendar months exceeded the sum of CZK 1,000,000 (EUR 33,575) becomes a taxpayer on the 1st day of the third month following after the month in which he exceeded the registration limit (§ 94 (1) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., on value added tax; hereinafter “Act No. 235/2004 Coll.”).
This person is obliged to submit an application for registration within 15 days after the end of the month in which he exceeded the registration limit.
The current legislation does not permit registering a person obliged to pay tax retroactively in cases taxpayers exceed the legal term to submit the application for registration.
A person obliged to pay tax, who has his official seat, place of business or commercial premises in the CR, who performs taxable transactions or transactions exempt from VAT with the right to tax deduction, is obliged to register for VAT even if he does not exceed a turnover of CZK 1,000,000 (EUR 33,575), provided that he fulfils any of other conditions stated in the Act No. 235/2004 Coll.
A person obliged to pay tax, who has his official seat, place of business or commercial premises in the CR, who does not fulfil any of the conditions stated by the law, may apply for registration for VAT voluntarily.
When the application for registration is submitted to the competent local tax administrator the registration procedure pursuant to Act No. 337/1992 Coll. starts.
A voluntary VAT payer shall also state, in the application for registration for VAT, the date as of which he requests registration as a VAT payer.
The tax administrator shall verify the data communicated by the tax entity, i.e. the completed application for registration with all its annexes.
If he is in doubt as to the stated data, he shall request the tax entity to explain, supplement or document the data.
When the tax administrator has verified that the tax entity meets the conditions for registration, he shall issue a decision in the form of a certificate stating that the tax entity is registered and that it has been allocated a tax identification number (hereinafter the “ID”).
In the certificate the tax administrator shall state the date when the registration for VAT became effective and the periodicity of the tax period for VAT.
The taxable period is one calendar quarter unless the taxpayer’s turnover for the previous calendar year reached the amount of CZK 10,000,000 (EUR 335,750).
If the taxpayer’s turnover for the previous calendar year reached the amount of CZK 10,000,000 (EUR 335,750), the taxable period is one calendar month.
A taxpayer, whose turnover for the previous calendar year attained an amount of CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150), is entitled to choose a calendar month as the tax period and shall notify the tax administrator of this change.
The assignment of an ID in the certificate of registration is always constitutive in character.
The tax entity is obliged to state it in all communications (including payments) with the tax administrator, and in those cases stipulated by a special law (e.g. Act No. 235/2004 Coll., in drawing up tax documents).
The ID contains the code “CZ” and a basic part, consisting of a general identifier.
For natural persons, the general identifier is the birth certificate number or some other general identifier if so stipulated by a special law, and for a legal person, the general identifier is the business identification number (provisions of § 33 (12) of Act No. 337/1992 Coll.).
If the tax entity has not fulfilled its obligation in spite of being requested to do so by the tax administrator, the competent local tax administrator shall register it at his own initiative.
The registration proceeding results in the issuing a Certificate of Registration ex officio, which shall be delivered to the tax entity.
In the CR, a tax entity that has acquired authorisation for a business activity is assigned an ID at the moment of his first registration for any kind of tax.
The tax entity also uses the same ID when he is registered as a VAT payer.
According to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., which came into effect on January 1, 2005, in case of failure to comply with the registration obligation for VAT, the tax administrator may require that the taxable person has to pay up to 10% of the total revenues or income for taxable transactions that this person performed illegally without tax, for the period from the date on which he should have been registered as a taxpayer by law to the date on which he became a taxpayer on the basis of a decision by the tax administrator (provision of § 98 (1) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.).
Payment of this stipulated amount is considered to constitute payment of tax of § 98 (3) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.), i.e. it is not a penalty.
When the conditions laid down by law are met, the registration of a VAT payer may be cancelled for two reasons:
1)
Cancellation of the registration at the taxpayer’s request, i.e. primarily for reasons of the level of turnover, which does not attain the registration limit (§ 106 (1) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.).
Taxpayers may request cancellation of registration not earlier than 1 year after the date of legal force mentioned in the certificate of registration.
2) Cancellation of registration “ex officio” (§ 106 (7) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.), “if: a) the taxpayer did not perform any transactions without notification of the reason for this to the tax administrator for a period of 12 consecutive months, b) the taxpayer failed to fulfill his obligations pursuant to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., c) the taxpayer ceases to be a person obliged to pay taxes”.
B) Taxpayers without an official seat, place of business or commercial premises in the CR A person registered for taxes in another Member State, who does not have an official seat, place of business or commercial premises in the CR, or a foreign person obliged to pay tax, who performs a transaction which takes place in this country and who is a person obliged to report and pay taxes on such supply pursuant to § 108 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. (i.e. an “non-resident taxpayer”) becomes a taxpayer on the date of performing this transaction.
This person is obliged to submit an application for registration with the tax office for Prague 1 at the latest on the date of performance of the supply.
In the application for registration, he is obliged to report all VAT IDs that he was assigned to in other Member States or in a third country.
If a “non-resident” taxpayer submits an application for registration later than on the date of performance of the first taxable transaction in the CR, the tax office for Prague 1 shall register him retroactively as, pursuant to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., the tax entity became a VAT payer on the date of performance of the first taxable transaction in the CR.
In cases of retroactive registration, the tax office for Prague 1 shall request from tax entities a document that the supply was performed (invoices or explanatory letters).
If a “non-resident” tax entity requests registration in the CR, prior to performance of the first taxable transaction the tax office for Prague 1 shall request submission of agreements that the performance of the transaction will occur.
As of December 31, 2004, a total of 473 “non-resident” taxpayers were registered at the tax office for Prague 1, of which 124 were taxpayers from Germany; as of December 31, 2005, a total of 951 “non-resident” taxpayers were registered, of which 233 were taxpayers from Germany.
Pursuant to the provisions of § 106 (9) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., tax administrators shall be authorised to cancel the registration of an “non-resident” taxpayer as of January 31 of the following calendar year if this taxpayer does not incur any obligation to report and pay tax.
The SAO found that, if a “non-resident” taxpayer submitted a tax return abroad for postal transport on 25 January, i.e. in accordance with the legal requirements of the date for submitting a tax return, the tax office often has not yet received it by 31 January.
In cases where these facts, decisive for the possibility of cancelling registration, are known by the tax office later than 31 January, it is not possible to cancel the registration for VAT for the “non-resident” taxpayer in the CR in the given calendar year.
Registration of taxpayers in Germany
Due to the legal provisions in the German fiscal code (§§ 137, 138 Abgabenordnung, hereinafter “AO”) anybody who performs a business is obliged to inform the municipality and/or the tax office in charge.
The deadline for submitting the information is one month after the start of the business.
The municipality conveys the information to the tax authorities.
If the tax authority finds out a going but unregistered business the competent tax office is able to register the taxpayer ex officio – even retroactively.
Taxpayers in Germany, both being resident or non-resident, are legally obliged to register for VAT whenever they fulfil the criteria set forth in § 2 of the German VAT law (hereinafter “UStG).
This does not depend on the volume of turnover produced.
A voluntary registration does not exist in Germany.
For entrepreneurs who are resident abroad special tax offices exist.
For instance for those who have their seat in the CR the tax office Chemnitz-Süd is responsible.
As of 30 April 2004 a total of 295 Czech entrepreneurs were registered by the tax office Chemnitz-Süd; as of 1 March 2006 a total of 1,050 Czech entrepreneurs were registered.
The BRH found that those special tax offices frequently denied the registration of so called quasi-dependent freelancers with a residence in the new eastern Member States of the EC.
Since after joining the EC the labour permits for employees of the ten new European Member States are limited, those freelancers tried to avoid these limits by starting a business.
These businesses do not fulfil the criteria for entrepreneurs as set in § 2 UStG because they are usually dependent on a sole employer who determines their labour time and the way of doing their labour.
In order to get registered the entrepreneur has to complete a questionnaire of the competent tax office, in which he has to give information about the company and the activities performed.
The questionnaire is a standard form that is binding for all tax offices in Germany.
It is processed either in special units of the tax office or in the general units that are responsible for the assessment of taxpayers.
With the help of this form a risk assessment of the individual taxpayer is carried out before the tax office issues a tax number.
The structure of the tax number for domestic transactions follows specific rules:
First three figures provide the information which tax office is in charge of, the subsequent three (or four) give information about which department in the tax office is responsible, the next five (or four) are for classifying taxpayers whereas the last one is always a check digit.
If an entrepreneur intends to participate in intra-Community trade, he needs a VAT ID in order to receive tax-exempt intraCommunity supplies.
A VAT ID is granted by the CLO upon application if the entrepreneur is registered in Germany and has a VAT number.
The VAT ID will be assigned automatically by the CLO when taxpayers declare intra-Community deliveries in their VAT returns.
The structure of the VAT ID is the country code (DE) followed by a string of nine numbers.
An entrepreneur can be deregistered: 1. On application (for instance when he gave up his business) after all the administrative work is done (assessments for all business years) and 2. in case the tax administration realises that he no longer carries out a business.
Usually the validity of the VAT ID is aligned with the validity of the VAT number.
The tax offices have to inform the CLO about the cancellation of the VAT number so that the CLO can end the validity of the VAT ID in those cases.
According to German VAT law (§ 19 (1) UStG) resident taxpayers are not obliged to pay VAT in case 1. the turnover plus respective VAT of the previous calendar year did not exceed the amount of EUR 17,500 and 2. is not likely to exceed the amount of EUR 50,000 in the following year.
The so-called „Kleinunternehmer“ (small entrepreneurs) are not allowed to invoice other entrepreneurs for VAT and are not entitled to deduct input tax.
Though they are not obliged to pay VAT small entrepreneurs have to be registered by the tax office and have to submit an annual VAT return.
A small entrepreneur can declare the non-application of § 19 (1) UStG.
This declaration is binding for the following five years.
He is then allowed to invoice VAT and to deduct input tax.
Non-resident taxpayers may appoint a fiscal representative (§ 22a UStG).
The precondition for this is that they are involved in tax exempt transactions only and are not entitled to deduct input tax.
The fiscal representative fulfils the tax obligations of the foreign entrepreneur so that he does not need to register for VAT.
The invoices have to mention that fiscal representation is applied.
Comparison and evaluation
The situation is different in both countries.
Whereas in Germany entrepreneurs are registered independent of their turnover volume, in the CR, the first criteria (besides other) for registration is the excess of the limit set forth in the VAT law.
If a tax entity does not exceed the set limit, it has an option to ask for voluntary registration.
The registration process is standardised in Germany but differences may occur because of varying organisational patterns in the federal states.
In the CR, a taxpayer is assigned a tax identification number at the time of his first registration for any tax.
In case taxpayers register for VAT, they use the same ID also in intra-Community transactions.
In Germany, a taxpayer registering for VAT is assigned a tax number serving only for transactions within the territory of Germany.
If the German taxpayer intends to do intra-Community transactions, he has to ask for assignment of a special identification number, a so-called VAT ID.
Both the SAO and the BRH found the German two-stage system of registration could cause a lot of misunderstandings in other Member States such as the CR that allocates one single identification number for both national VAT registration and registration for intra-Community transactions.
On the other hand, the two-stage system permits the retroactive (national) registration in cases where taxpayers refuse to inform the municipality or the competent tax office about his business.
This retroactive registration ensures the proper VAT assessment of previous assessment periods, especially an exact estimation of a VAT liability.
Since the different ways of registration cause problems, the conditions should be harmonised in the whole EC.
German Parliament recently decided to establish a tax identification number (hereinafter TIN).
The Federal Finance Office will allocate the TIN after the birth of a natural person.
This TIN will be valid for the whole life of a natural person resident in Germany.
If a natural person starts a business the competent tax office will apply for an economic TIN that will be used as a VAT ID.
So in future there should be no time lag between the national registration of a taxpayer and the allocation of the VAT ID.
The work to implement an IT medium to administrate the TINs has not been finished until now.
International passenger bus transportation
Legislation in the CR
Pursuant to the provisions of § 70 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., the transportation of passengers between the individual Member States and also between the Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT in the CR, with the right for tax deduction, as from May 1, 2004.
This transportation is exempt from VAT even if performed by entrepreneurs who are registered for taxes in other Member States or a foreign person obliged to pay tax.
In this respect, return transport is considered to be a separate transport.
If “non-resident” tax entities do not perform any other economic activity in the CR except for international passenger bus transport, they are not obliged to register in the CR as VAT payers.
International passenger transport was exempted from VAT in the CR on the basis of the Act on Accession of the CR, Annex No. V, Chap. 5 (1) (b), where it is stated that:
“For the purposes of applying Article 28(3)(b) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Czech Republic may maintain an exemption from value added tax on international transport of passengers, referred to in point 17 of Annex F to the Directive, until the condition set out in Article 28 (4) of the Directive is fulfilled or for as long as the same exemption is applied by any of the present Member States, whichever is the earlier.”
Legislation in Germany
According to Article 46 of the Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 as implemented into § 3b (1) UStG the place of the supply of transport of passengers is the place where the route takes place.
So the German taxation does not make a distinction between a national and an international cross-border transport of passengers.
Only the part of the transport occurring on German territory, is a taxable supply of transport in Germany.
Also the German taxation does not distinguish between resident and non-resident taxpayers.
If a non-resident taxpayer transports passengers through Germany the part of the route in Germany is also considered as a taxable supply of transport.
The non-resident taxpayer has to announce his intention to supply the transport of passengers to the tax office in charge before he accomplishes his services in Germany.
The tax office registers the non-resident taxpayer for taxation (compare 4.1.2) and issues a special certificate for any bus or coach that is named in the taxpayer’s announcement.
The taxpayer has to declare his taxable supplies of transport in a German VAT return.
As of 1 March 2006, the tax office Chemnitz-Süd registered 741 Czech taxpayers whose business was the transport of passengers.
If the transport of passengers is supplied to a resident taxable person for VAT, the non-resident taxpayer does not have to pay VAT to the tax office by himself.
Instead of him the resident acquirer of the services has to pay VAT to the tax office and the invoiced net amount to the non-resident taxpayer; this process is known as reverse charge and consistent with Article 196 of the Council Directive 2006/112/EC.
Apart from the announcement of a non-resident taxpayer and his VAT return the German tax administration has several means to assess the accurate declaration of taxable supplies of transport of passengers:
Mobile control groups of the customs authority audit the certificates of foreign-licensed busses that are used to transport passengers through Germany.
After each audit the mobile control groups send an inspection note to the tax office in charge.
If the bus driver lacks a valid certificate the mobile control group is authorised to demand the VAT from the bus driver before he continues the transport.
The non-resident taxpayer can deduct this paid VAT from the tax calculated in his VAT return.
If the tax office has doubts about the accuracy of a VAT return it can announce an audit that has to take place in the tax office or it can use the means of administrative cooperation that are named in the Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 (see 4.6).
Even if the non-resident taxpayer declines the payment of the lawfully stated VAT, the tax office can ask for the administrative cooperation of Council Directive 76/308/EEC.
To review a non-resident taxpayer’s VAT return or the fulfilment of his obligations, the BRH considered all these means of administrative cooperation as too labour-intensive compared to the small amounts of VAT that have to be paid for taxable supplies of transport of passengers.
Especially an audit of a non-resident taxpayer’s accounting leads to disproportional costs for both taxpayers and tax administration.
The latter has to audit the foreign accounting that does not only mean to understand the foreign language but to also know the foreign accounting standards.
So this audit is likely to take more time than an audit of a resident taxpayer, yet the audit is restricted to those passenger transports, that take place in Germany.
On the other hand, the non-resident taxpayer has not only to accept the audit rights of his national tax administration but also audits of other Member States wherever he transports passengers.
Moreover, for each Member State in that only one supply of transport of passengers takes place, taxpayers have to fulfil any duties of taxation in all of these Member States, respectively in all different languages and using all tax forms of these EC Member States.
So the actual taxation of crossborder transport of passengers causes unreasonable bureaucratic costs.
Comparison and evaluation
The legal situation in both countries is different.
In the CR, the transport of passengers between the individual Member States of the EC and also between the Member States and third countries is exempt from VAT with the right for tax deduction, on the basis of the Act on Accession of the CR.
In Germany, the part of the transport, that takes place within the German territory, is a taxable transaction.
If a non-resident taxpayer provides such transport for the first time, he is obliged to announce it to a competent tax office in advance.
The tax office registers taxpayers and taxpayers have to declare the taxable portion of transport in a tax return in Germany.
Applying the law in Germany is very time-consuming.
At least three of four Czech taxpayers registered in the tax office Chemnitz-Süd do their business in the transport of passengers.
Compared to the efforts required tax revenue is rather low.
The Member States – that levy VAT in accordance to Article 46 of the Council directive 2006/112/EC of November 28th, 2006, on the common system of VAT – are burdened with time-consuming duties without a financially sensible goal.
To avoid the disproportional costs to assess the VAT, the supplies of cross-border transport of passengers should be taxed in one Member State only.
This could be the state where the transport begins or where the supplier is resident.
Such taxation would require a modification of the Council directive 2006/112/EC.
VAT returns
Submitting and processing of VAT returns in the CR
A taxpayer is obliged to submit a VAT return on a form prescribed by the MoF within 25 days after the end of the taxable period, even if he has not incurred a tax liability, unless the law stipulates otherwise.
The actual tax liability falls due within the deadline for submitting the VAT return, with the exception of tax assessed in connection with import of goods pursuant to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., where the due date for the taxes is stipulated by the customs regulations.
If a returnable overpayment occurs as a consequence of excessive deduction, it is returned to the taxpayer without request within 30 days after assessing the excessive deduction.
The deadline is not applied in cases, where the tax administrator commences tax proceedings concerning taxpayer’s tax liability.
In accordance with § 73 (11) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., the right to deduct input tax may be exercised in a regular VAT return at the latest for the last taxable period of the calendar year in which the right to tax deduction could be exercised.
After expiry of this deadline, the right to deduct input tax may further be exercised within 3 years after the end of the tax period in which the right to tax deduction could first have been exercised.
However, this is possible only through submission of an additional VAT return.
An amendment to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., effective from January 1, 2005, permits submission of an additional VAT return only for the period when the right to tax deduction could first have been exercised.
A taxpayer is obliged to submit an additional VAT return if a) the sum of the corrections increases the tax liability, b) he performs corrections in which the last known tax liability does not change, but only information formerly stated by the tax entity is changed, c) he corrects the rate and amount of taxes pursuant to § 49 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll.
A taxpayer may submit an additional VAT return if the sum of the corrections reduces his tax liability.
The taxpayer is obliged to submit the additional VAT return by the end of the following month after determination of these facts.
A VAT return may be submitted in electronic form either via the Internet or on a technical data carrier.
Submission by Internet may be performed as a submission with a data report attached with a certified electronic signature or as a submission without attaching a data report with a certified electronic signature.
If a data report is not attached with a certified electronic signature, it must also be submitted in written form, i.e. delivery of the computer file to the tax administrator (e-form).
The VAT return contains separate lines related to values of intra-Community supply/acquisition of goods.
Values of acquisition of services are reported on special lines of the VAT return.
Some lines are used for the purpose of primary automated controls as part of the ATIS system.
The value of goods supplied to other EC Member States for entrepreneurs registered for tax in other Member States is compared to the data given in the recapitulative statements submitted by Czech taxpayers.
The value of goods acquired from other Member States from entrepreneurs registered for tax in other Member States is compared with the values obtained via the VIES system from recapitulative statements of taxpayers from other Member States of the EC.
Under the ATIS system, a test of the trustworthiness of VAT returns takes place at the tax office.
This test occurs automatically as the VAT return cannot be assessed without performance of the test.
The test of the trustworthiness includes a calculation of the trustworthiness criteria and an evaluation of the risky types of VAT returns.
Pursuant to the Provisions of § 37 (1) of Act No. 337/1992 Coll., the tax office may repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) on a person who does not meet his obligations of a non-monetary nature following from this or a special tax law or imposed in a decision pursuant to this law.
Automated tax information system, which the tax office uses for technical support for administration of taxes.
The SAO found that the tax offices mostly did not make use of the possibility of imposing a fine on taxpayers for failure to submit a VAT return.
Submitting and processing of VAT returns in Germany
In Germany we differentiate between preliminary monthly or quarterly VAT returns and the annual VAT return.
Those taxpayers who are obliged to submit preliminary VAT returns nevertheless have to submit an annual VAT return.
Even small entrepreneurs who are not obliged to pay VAT have to submit an annual VAT return.
Taxpayers generally have to submit quarterly VAT returns by the 10th day of the month following the quarter in which VAT arises (§ 18 (2) UStG).
However, if the VAT liability exceeded EUR 6,136 in the previous calendar year or in case of a newly established business the entrepreneur is obliged to submit monthly VAT returns by the 10th day following the respective month.
The taxpayer may also choose to submit monthly VAT returns if there was a refund in the preceding year, which exceeded EUR 6,136 (§ 18 (2a) UStG).
VAT returns need not be submitted if the annual VAT did not exceed EUR 512.
The corresponding VAT liability has to be paid by the 10th day of the month following the tax period in which the VAT arose.
A refund may lead to a more detailed investigation by the tax authorities.
Deadlines (by law) for the processing of VAT returns and for the refund of excessive VAT do not exist.
To achieve the refund in time, it is possible to offer a security for the repayable amount.
It is a basic principle to process VAT returns and refunds promptly.
Under German VAT law this time limit may be extended (§ 18 (6) UStG).
Such extension has to be applied for separately.
Taxpayers may submit VAT returns and pay the corresponding VAT liabilities one month later, provided that in case of monthly returns a special advance payment is made.
This payment is balanced against the December VAT liability.
Whenever a mistake is detected a corrected VAT return has to be submitted by the entrepreneur.
An “additional” VAT return does not exist.
Once the annual VAT return which has to be submitted until 31 May of the following calendar year is filed with the tax office the entrepreneur cannot correct a wrong preliminary VAT return but his wrong annual VAT return.
A correction of this VAT return to the advantage or disadvantage of the taxpayer is possible during the following four years after the year in which the first annual VAT return was submitted.
As a rule, after these four years an annual VAT return may be corrected only in cases of tax fraud or tax evasion.
Taxpayers are obliged to submit the preliminary VAT returns electronically.
The tax offices to avoid undue hardships can apply exceptions to this rule.
Submission of the annual VAT return is possible on paper or via Internet with or without certification.
If done without certification taxpayers have to submit the return once more on paper with their personal signature.
In cases of non-submission of VAT returns the tax administration is authorised to make a rough estimate of the taxpayer’s turnover.
In cases of delayed submission an additional penalty charge can be levied on the taxpayer (the maximum is 10 % of the tax to be paid or EUR 25,000).
During a previous audit the BRH found that the tax offices frequently do not impose this default fine.
In the other cases the tax offices imposed the penalty the amount was assessed inconsistently and highhandedly.
So the default fine misses its goal to shorten the average delay particularly in the submission of the annual VAT return.
The tax return contains separate lines related to values of intra-Community supply/acquisition of goods.
Values of acquisition of services are reported on special lines of the VAT return.
Non-taxable transactions have to be declared in a separate line of the VAT return.
VAT returns that are submitted on paper have to be recorded either via scanner or by special staff.
The data of electronically submitted VAT returns are available to the tax administrator immediately.
THISsegmentISintentionallyLEFTblank
After all data are logged in the system the risk management is applied to it and all cases meeting certain criteria are selected.
Those VAT returns chosen have to be checked by the tax administrator based on the inspection note produced by the system (see 5.2).
Although the tax administration has to estimate roughly the VAT the taxpayer has to pay, the estimated tax has to be as exact as possible.
Comparison and evaluation
In the CR, taxpayers submit VAT returns until 25 days after the end of a taxable period.
Depending on taxpayer’s turnover, taxable period is either the calendar quarter orcalendar month.
In Germany, taxpayers submit preliminary VAT returns, depending on their tax liability in the previous year either until 10 days after the end of the calendar quarter or the calendar month.
By 31 May of the following year, taxpayers are obliged to submit an annual VAT return.
The obligation to submit an annual VAT return has some pros and cons:
+ after the expiration of the calendar year taxpayers are able to correct the errors in the monthly preliminary VAT returns by submission of one single VAT return;
– if taxpayers correct their statements concerning intraCommunity transactions the correction cannot be related to a reporting period of the recapitulative statement;
– the federal states compare the data of VIES about intraCommunity acquisitions of German taxpayers not until the annual VAT returns are usually processed.
In accordance with the registration (see 4.1.3) German entrepreneurs are obliged to submit an annual VAT return independently from the amount of their turnover.
This duty enables the German tax authority to check the maximum turnover limit for small entrepreneurs.
Furthermore the tax office in charge is able to compare the annual VAT return with those for direct taxes and with the year-end accounts.
In the CR, tax administrators are able to determine the volume of taxpayer’s turnover only from submitted income tax return.
In contrast to the CR, taxpayers in Germany are obliged to submit VAT returns electronically.
Introducing the obligation to submit VAT returns in the CR electronically would increase the efficiency of Czech tax administration.
Recapitulative statements
Submitting and processing of recapitulative statements in the CR
Pursuant to the provisions of § 102 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., recapitulative statements (hereinafter “RS”) are submitted by a taxpayer who supplied goods to another Member State to a person registered for taxes in the other Member State.
Information on the value of goods supplied is always stated in the RS in Czech currency and is classified according to individual tax entities with specification of their VAT IDs, under which they are registered in their country.
Data on services are not provided in the RS.
Taxpayers submit an RS for monthly and quarterly taxable periods for each calendar quarter to the 25th day after its termination to the competent local tax office.
Erroneous data are corrected in the corrected RS within 15 days after identifying the errors.
Erroneous data stated in the RS are always replaced by the data stated in the corrected RS.
Similar to tax returns, taxpayers may also submit RS in electronic form.
If a taxpayer does not submit a RS or corrected RS and was obliged to do so pursuant to Act No. 235/2004 Coll., the tax administrator shall invite him to submit them and shall simultaneously advise him about the consequences of not submitting the RS or corrected RS, i.e. that in case of a failure to comply with obligations of a non-monetary nature, the tax administrator is authorised to repeatedly impose a fine of up to CZK 2,000,000 (EUR 67,150) pursuant to § 37 of Act No. 337/1992 Coll.
The SAO found that the tax offices frequently did not make use of the possibility of imposing a fine on taxpayers failing to comply with their legal obligations.
Particularly in relation to submitting RS, tax entities are not adequately motivated to comply with their obligations as a failure to submit RS does not affect their VAT liability.
Pursuant to § 102 (5) of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., the tax administrator is obliged to verify data in the RS or corrected RS, to eliminate any lack of clarity and use the data for determining tax liability.
Where the data in the RS and the data in the relevant VAT returns (taxpayers with monthly taxable period) or relevant VAT return (taxpayers with quarterly taxable period) do not correspond, the tax administrator should verify the accuracy of tax liability stated in the VAT return.
The tax entity eliminates erroneous information in the RS through submission of a corrected RS at its own initiative or it may be invited to do so.
The tax administrator shall correct data on supply of goods to other Member States in the ATIS system if:
– if taxpayers can not justify the data stated in the RS (or corrected RS) and therefore correct them by submission of a corrected RS,
– the tax administrator demonstrated that the data stated by taxpayers in the RS or corrected RS are not accurate.
Corrections entered by the tax administrator without the submission of a corrected RS by these taxpayers shall not replace a submission by the tax entity, but only adjust the data in the VIES database so that it is up to date, complete and precise.
Data from the RS are sent to the relevant Member States.
Solely the national financial administrative authority, designated for cooperation with the other Member States in the area of VAT may send and receive this data. This is the CLO (in CR this function is fulfilled by the MoF, International Cooperation in VAT Administration Department (CLO)).
O_MCTL is an automatic report that the CLO obtains from other Member States.
It contains all the erroneous VAT IDs entered in the sent RS lines.
If the erroneous VAT ID is used on some of the transferred common lines of the RS or corrected RS, an entry is made in the table of the erroneous VAT IDs.
The table contains a “Notification of doubts on VAT ID”.
The tax administrator verifies the data and records the result of verification in the system.
Concerning acquisition of goods from another Member State, taxpayers are obliged to declare VAT and state the acquisition value in separate lines of the VAT return.
Selected cases of discrepancies in the value of the acquired goods declared by Czech taxpayers in their VAT returns and the value of the supplied goods as entered by taxpayers from another Member State in their RS, are sent from the CLO to the tax office for review.
The tax administrators are obliged to investigate discrepancies.
Three situations can occur:
a) The value declared by a Czech taxpayer in the relevant lines of the VAT return is lower than the value of the supply declared by taxpayers from the EC.
In this case, the tax administrator verifies the accuracy of the data.
b) The amount of the difference equals 0.
This situation can occur either through a change in data in the EC (the foreign supplier corrects his RS) or through a change in data in the VAT return (the Czech tax entity submits an additional VAT return by itself in the meantime).
In this case, the tax administrator is free to decide whether he nonetheless verifies the accuracy of the data in the VAT return.
c) The value of goods acquired from other Member States, which the Czech taxpayer entered in the relevant lines of the VAT return, is higher than the value of the supplied goods declared by EC taxpayers.
Here again, the tax administrator is free to decide whether he verifies the accuracy of the data.
After the verifying the difference and clarifying the underlying reasons the tax administrator enters the results of the verification into ATIS.
The results of verification are transferred to the CLO.
The number of cases sent from the CLO to tax offices for review for the individual quarters of 2005 is illustrated in graph No. 1 (Note: source: MoF).
Graph No. 1 above documents that the number of cases sent from the CLO to tax offices for the individual quarters of 2005 decreased.
There was a substantial decrease in the number of the 4th quarter of 2005, because the CLO increased the minimal financial limit, i.a., with respect to the possibility of sending a request for information to the other EC Member States.
Discrepancies between data in the VAT returns and data from the EC need not always to be caused by an error on the part of the domestic taxpayer.
It may also be attributable to an error on the part of the EC taxpayer or an error that occurred because some types of supplies may be entered in the RS differently in the individual EC Member States.
The most common reasons for discrepancies in the values of reported transactions revealed at the audited tax offices are given in Table No. 1.
Submitting and processing of recapitulative statements in Germany
Entrepreneurs who make intra-Community deliveries from Germany to other EC Member States or participate in triangular transactions are required to file quarterly RS in that the intra-Community deliveries per recipient are listed (§ 18a (1) UStG).
The RS must be filed until the 10th day of the month following the respective calendar quarter.
If extension is granted for the preliminary VAT returns, this also applies to the RS.
The RS needs to be delivered to the CLO.
Starting from 1 January 2007 they have to be delivered electronically.
The competent tax offices may grant exceptions to certain taxpayers to avoid undue hardships.
In cases where taxpayers realise that the RS was wrong they are obliged to submit a corrected statement within one month.
If taxpayers failed to submit an RS the CLO will initiate a procedure to ensure submission of the statement.
This procedure includes: – first reminder – second reminder linked with the threat of a fine and – imposing the fine.
Although the German Fiscal Code permits imposing a fine up to EUR 25,000 (§ 329 AO), the CLO assesses fines in three steps in the amounts of EUR 125, 250 and 500.
Besides this, § 26a (1) Nr. 5 UStG stipulates that taxpayers act illegally if they intentionally or carelessly do not issue a RS properly, state it incompletely or not in time or if they do not amend a RS at all or not in time.
This offence can be sanctioned by a fine up to EUR 5,000.
Data on intra-Community supplies cannot be entered into VIES by the tax office because processing of RS is an exclusive task of the CLO.
RS data are stored in the system of the CLO only.
So the figures of the RS are visible to the tax office only after their processing at the CLO.
The deadlines for processing RS are set forth in the Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
Data of the RS have to be stored within three months after the respective calendar quarter.
In case of erroneous VAT IDs in the RS of German taxpayers the CLO gets an O_MCTL from the other Member State.
The CLO contacts the entrepreneur and asks for the accurate data.
If the CLO does not succeed in getting the correct information the case is handed over to the competent tax offices.
It is now their turn to ask for the correct data.
The BRH found out that most of the entrepreneurs corrected the VAT ID on request of the CLO.
However, the reminder, the threat and the assessment of three additional fines take too much time in cases where a taxpayer may be involved in a cross-border carousel fraud.
Those cases that were finally reported to the competent tax offices, were usually completed within one or two months.
The tax office refused the tax exemption of the declared intra-Community supplies in 73 % of these cases.
If taxpayers submitted the right VAT ID the tax office asked them to submit a corrected RS to the CLO, because the tax offices are not able to correct the VIES data by themselves.
The BRH found that neither the tax offices nor the CLO monitored the submission of the corrected RS. So often taxpayers did not comply with the request.
Due to the fact that the CLO does not have access to the VAT return data a comparison of the data on supply of goods declared in the VAT return and in the RS does not take place before submitting those data to the CLO of the other Member States.
This check is possible only for the tax offices and is usually made when preparing a VAT audit.
Data received from other Member States are processed in the CLO.
Incorrect VAT IDs are selected and submitted to the respective Member States.
The data are used for purposes of acquisition control in the tax offices.
As soon as they are in the system the CLO checks them against the data of previous calendar quarters.
In cases that comply with certain criteria (see 5.2) control information is created and sent to the competent tax offices.
This is done permanently whereas a compilation of the acquisition data for all taxpayers is created later and submitted to the tax offices.
The RMS installed for the assessment procedure then checks those data against the data of intraCommunity acquisitions.
This system completely covers those entrepreneurs, who are not fully entitled to VAT deduction.
Comparison and evaluation
In the CR, taxpayers that delivered intra-Community supplies to a person registered for VAT in another Member State, submit a RS within 25 days after the end of the calendar quarter to a competent local tax office.
Tax offices process RS and transmit the data to the CLO.
Values of intra-Community supplies, stated by taxpayers in the RS, are compared by the tax offices with the values of intraCommunity supplies, stated by the same taxpayers in VAT returns.
Results of the comparison are used as part of assessment proceedings.
In Germany, taxpayers that performed intra-Community supplies are obliged to submit quarterly RS within the first 10 days of the following calendar quarter.
Taxpayers submit the RS to the CLO, as from 1 January 2007 electronically.
For tax offices, the data from RS are at disposal only after their processing at the CLO.
Taxpayers both from the CR and Germany declare in RS only supplies of goods.
Rendering of services is not stated in RS.In contrast to the Czech tax offices the German tax offices are not able to correct wrong lines in a submitted RS by themselves.
Owing to this limited access to the German VIES data wrong VAT IDs were not corrected even if taxpayers communicated the right VAT ID to the tax office.
The German tax administration does not compare the data of intra-Community supplies that are declared in a German taxpayer’s VAT return with his RS.
Differences between the data of these two returns are usually not detected before the German CLO submits the VIES data to other Member States.
Considering these findings of the BRH it is obvious that a comparison would increase the reliability of the submitted VIES data.
Data on supply of goods for the Czech taxpayers, delivered from other Member States, are compared in the CR with data on acquisition of goods as stated in the Czech taxpayers´ VAT returns.
Comparison is made by CLO separately for each calendar quarter.
The most important deviations are transmitted to the tax offices for review.
Unlike the Czech tax administration, the German one does not generally check the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions.
Such a general verification is carried out only for taxpayers, which are not fully entitled to deduct input VAT.
Furthermore, the German tax administration checks the taxation of intra-Community acquisitions of other taxpayers only if the RMS produces an inspection note or if taxpayers are selected for an audit at any rate.
This process disburdens the tax offices to clarify the reasons of any difference.
On the other hand the disclosure of VAT fraud depends on the quality of the RMS.
Combating carousel fraud requires continually updated information about intra-Community acquisitions.
The current system of RS, especially VIES, provides the tax authorities with information which may even be six months old.
This time lag could be shortened by up to four months if taxpayers had to submit a monthly RS.
The monthly submission would not be a considerable increase in bureaucratic costs because most of the taxpayers in CR and Germany are obliged to submit monthly VAT returns anyway – and the RS do not require any further information than the VAT return.
To avoid any bureaucratic costs the submission of the RS could be connected with the submission of VAT returns.
However, an obligation to submit monthly RS would cause more temporary mismatches between the declaration of intra-Community supplies and intra-Community acquisitions and it would increase the data ﬂows between CLO.
In 2006 the German Federal Government considered the general institution of monthly RS.
The implementation failed because of doubts of the federal states.
They feared that a monthly submission of VIES data to CLOs of other Member States could lead to misunderstandings and confusion.
In fact – if the obligation of monthly RS and the monthly submission of VIES data should be effective – a monthly update of VIES would require a European standard of monthly RS.
Statistical information on supply and acquisition of goods between the CR and Germany
As regards foreign trade, Germany is the most important business partner for the CR.
The total quantities of intra-Community transactions in goods between the CR and Germany are set forth in Table No. 2.
The two SAI requested data on the number of erroneous IDs or VAT IDs contained in the O_MCTL reports transferred between the CR and Germany for the individual quarterly periods reviewed.
These data are contained in the following tables.
They show significant differences.
The reason of these differences may be a different basis for calculation of numbers of O_MCTL reports.
While the Czech CLO relates its numbers to the respective calendar quarter, for which RS were submitted, the German CLO relates its numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O_MCTL report was received.
International exchange of information at level 3
International exchange of information in the CR: Procedure
International exchange of information helps tax administrators to obtain information from other Member States related to intra-Community business transactions and the taxpayers who carried out these transactions.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 218/92 makes a distinction between two basic categories of exchange of information: exchange of information on request and exchange of information without a prior request.
International exchange of information on request is performed through a “request for information” (hereinafter “RFI”) using the standardised SCAC form.
Tax administrators in the CR communicate their RFI or answer a delivered RFI via the financial directorate to the CLO, which provides for translation of information entered in the standardised SCAC forms into the foreign language and their sending to other Member States.
The CLO also provides for receipt of RFI from other Member States and answers to sent RFI, their translation into Czech and distribution to the competent local tax administrators for processing.
Art. 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 stipulates that the maximum period of time for processing RFI is 3 months from receipt of the request.
All RFI submitted during the audited period between the CR and Germany were subjected to SAO audit.
Out of the total number of 94 RFI received in the CR from Germany, 70 cases (i.e. 74.5%) were processed within the set three-month deadline; a further 23 cases (i.e. 24.5%) were processed after this deadline and, in the remaining 1 case, an answer had not been sent to Germany by the time of the SAO audit.
More detailed information on the periods of time within which answers to RFI received from Germany were sent from the CR is contained in Graph No. 2.
Of the total number of 335 RFI sent from the CR to Germany, an answer was sent in 136 cases (i.e. 40.6%) within the set three-month deadline, a further 179 (i.e. 53.4%) of requests were answered after this deadline and, in 19 cases, an answer had not been sent from Germany at the time of the SAO audit (in the remaining one case, it was not possible to identify on the basis of the data provided when the answer was delivered from Germany).
More detailed information on the periods of time within which answers to RFI were furnished from Germany to the CR is contained in Graph No. 3.
The percentages of the values of intra-Community transactions stated in RFI submitted between the CR and Germany are disclosed in Graph No. 4.
The above graph illustrates that the value of business transactions reviewed through RFI was most frequently in the range above EUR 60,000.
International exchange of information without a prior request occurs either by means of automatic or structured-automatic exchange of information, or by spontaneous exchange of information.
Tax administrators from other Member States often received information that might be important for VAT administration without a previous request.
In the CR, all the information is collected at the CLO.
Information is transferred electronically between the individual Member States.
“Automatic exchange” pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 refers to systematic communication of prespecified information to other Member States, without a prior request and at preset regular intervals.
“Structured-automatic exchange” refers to systematic communication of pre-specified information to other Member States without a previous request as soon as the relevant information is available.
The CR provides other Member States with information on supply of new means of transport via automatic exchange.
This information is available for the tax administrator from the form Report of the supply of a new means of transport pursuant to § 19 of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. and from a copy of the issued tax document.
In processing this form, the tax administrator enters the necessary data in a specially created template and immediately submits this to the contact employee at the financial directorate, where these data are collected and submitted to the CLO for subsequent processing. Then they are transferred to other Member States within a set deadline, i.e. by the latest within two months after the end of the quarter in which these data were available.
The CR also provides the other Member States with information on mail-order sales, which are exempt from VAT in the Member State of origin, information on operations within the EC that seem unauthorised and information on potential “missing traders”.
Such information is sent to other Member States via spontaneous exchange using a SCAC form.
International exchange of information in Germany: Procedure
In Germany the local tax office in charge initiates both requests for information and spontaneous information.
The tax office sends the completed form SCAC 2004 by e-mail directly to the German CLO, which transmits the SCAC forms to the foreign CLO.
The tax offices are instructed to write their requests for information or their spontaneous information only in German; even the used SCAC form is monolingual.
Half of the German requests for information checked by the BRH were sent to ensure the taxation of an intra-Community acquisition in the other Member State and prove the tax exemption of the intra-Community supply from Germany to the other Member State respectively.
When the German CLO receives a request for information from another Member State, it checks the amount of supplies mentioned in the request for the minimum threshold of EUR 15,000.
If there is no adequate reason for the request, the German CLO declines any request for an amount below this threshold.
Furthermore, the German CLO translates the free texts of the SCAC form [(B1-17) or (E)] if these texts are neither in German nor English.
To answer the requests for information the CLO sends the request to the tax office in charge referring to the 3-month-time-limit.
There are no other deadlines set for processing the request on specific organisational levels of the tax administration.
Although the German CLO has the technical conditions to monitor the elapsed time limits, it lacks the staff capacity to remind the tax offices of answering the incomplete requests for information.
The tax offices get the information required by sending a letter to the taxpayers or by conducting an audit.
The auditors usually chose between two different types of audits: A special VAT audit which covers any taxable process of a period of some months or a so called VAT inspection which can cover only one transaction which has been done recently.
This short and ﬂexible kind of audit does not require any notification of the taxpayer and it has been of merits to investigate a single taxable transaction.
In the context of the automatic exchange without a prior request Germany provides other Member States with information – about VAT IDs granted to entrepreneurs who are resident in other EC Member States, – about the refund of input tax to those entrepreneurs who are resident in other EC Member States.
Furthermore, Germany has committed itself to providing other EC Member States with the following information through a structured automatic exchange:
a. The supply of new means of transport to entrepreneurs without using their VAT ID, b. supplies by distance or catalogue selling to other Member States which are not taxable in Germany, c. significant differences between the intra-Community acquisitions declared by a taxpayer and the VIES data submitted by other Member States, d. intra-Community supplies of goods which the German taxpayer did not report in RS, because the supplies were treated as domestic transactions, e. potential “missing trader” which made intra-Community transactions independent of the validity of their VAT ID and f. entrepreneurs who supplied goods to potential “missing traders” or recipients who misused their VAT ID.
Comparison and evaluation
Sending of RFI or spontaneous information is initiated both in the CR and Germany by competent local tax offices that send filed SCAC forms to the CLO.
While the Czech CLO uses bilingual SCAC forms (CzechEnglish) and translates dispatched information into English or German language, respectively, German tax offices comply with the instruction, according to which they have to write RFI or spontaneous information exclusively in German on a single-language form.
The German CLO does not provide a translation of German texts.
When reviewing RFIs transmitted between the CR and Germany in the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005, the SAO found that the Czech tax administration settled 74,5 % of received RFIs in a given three months deadline, while RFIs sent to Germany were settled by the German tax administration in the given deadline in 40,6 % cases only.
Although the German CLO refers the tax offices to the 3-month-deadline it does not monitor the elapsed time limits.
The outcome of the missing reminders is the high quantity of delayed answers to RFIs.
Because of these problems the BRH recommended a steady reminding exercise of the CLO.
The situation has already improved.
According to our latest information the German CLO now reminds the Tos tax offices of answering the incompleted requests for information.
VAT risk management
Risk management in the CR
In the CR, several units at various organisational levels of the tax administration are concerned with VAT risk management.
Within the MoF, the following units are concerned with the aspect of risk management and combating VAT fraud:
VAT Methodology and Performance Department and, in its framework, the VAT Risk Management Unit that, i.a., manages the selection of risks of potential tax evasion and evaluates trends in these risks at a domestic and community level.
Nationally it coordinates the performance of the task of “Trustworthiness of VAT returns” and VIES data utilisation from the standpoint of tax evasion as part of intra-Community transactions.
On the basis of data on the trade balance of the CR it evaluates risky commodities, prepares VAT risk management conceptually and cooperates in this area with the relevant EC institutions and with other Member States.
The Department of International Cooperation in VAT Administration that, i.a., provides for exchange of information in the area of VAT, participates in the creation and maintenance of an information database, analyses data from other Member States contained in the VIES system, provides for informing the public and for other forms of international cooperation in the sense of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003.
The two SAI requested data on the number of erroneous IDs or VAT IDs contained in the O_MCTL reports transferred between the CR and Germany for the individual quarterly periods reviewed.
These data are contained in the following tables.
They show significant differences.
The reason of these differences may be a different basis for calculation of numbers of O_MCTL reports.
While the Czech CLO relates its numbers to the respective calendar quarter, for which RS were submitted, the German CLO relates its numbers to the calendar quarter in which the O_MCTL report was received.
The Methodology of Tax Control and Investigation Department that, i.a., performs risk analysis as part of methodological management of tax audits and, in accordance with risk analysis, establishes priorities for orientation of tax audits in the plans of the financial directorates, prepares risk analyses as part of reducing tax evasions including the collection of information obtained in tax administration and from other sources and proposes measures to reduce tax evasion.
Investigation departments are established at the financial directorates and, i.a., look for tax entities and high-risk areas regarding tax fraud (i.e. internet business, gold, pharmaceutical industry), look for unregistered tax entities from the standpoint of tax evasion (e.g. in the area of internet services, mediation of work, radio and printing services, etc.), analysis of connections in chain frauds and provision of information to local financial authorities.
Specialised audit departments have been established at 12 selected tax offices.
They have regional competence and perform tax audits outside the territorial competence of the tax offices on the basis of authorization.
The need to establish specialised tax audit departments followed from the increasing number of determined new and advanced types of tax evasions that occurred particularly amongst entities connected in chains.
This department concentrates on audit of tax entities according to the requirements of the investigation departments, tax entities with specific activities and international companies and tax entities with a large scope of activities as regards the magnitude of turnover.
The following mechanisms used to reduce risks in the area of VAT were integrated into the ATIS system: – the task “Trustworthiness of VAT returns” for evaluating the risk level of submitted tax returns, – the task “Choice of tax entities for inspection”, enabling selection of taxpayers for audit on the basis of selected criteria, – the task “VIES”, through which the tax administrators have access to data provided from the other EC Member States.
The task “VIES” permits, i.a.: – verifying the validity of VAT ID of taxpayers from other Member States, – obtaining from other Member States the value of goods supplied to a Czech taxpayer, declared in the RS by all its suppliers in other Member States, – generating a list of taxpayers who did not submit RS, – performance of formal control of data that taxpayers in the CR entered in RS prior to sending these data to other Member States, – generating a list of taxpayers for which data on supply of goods to other Member States entered in their VAT returns does not coincide with RS data, – generating a list of taxpayers, for which the value of goods acquired from other Member States entered in VAT returns do not coincide with the data declared in the RS of all his suppliers from other Member States.
As part of activities to reduce the risk of tax evasion, tax staff have access to the registers of the state administrative authorities, such as the commercial index, real estate register, motor vehicle register, business license register, etc.
More detailed information is provided in Chapter 4.4.1 Submission and processing of recapitulative statements in the CR.
Risk management in Germany
Because of the federal structure in Germany both the federal tax administration (in particular the CLO) and the tax administrations of the 16 federal states participate in the development and the operation of RMSs.
Although there are joint working groups for the development neither the CLO nor the tax administrations of the federal states share a completely consistent database.
At the level of the CLO unit ST I 2 (hereinafter the “KUSS“ – coordination unit for special VAT audits and tax investigations) collects audit findings on tax fraud in a separate database called OPUS.
KUSS established another database called ZAUBER in cooperation with the tax offices to communicate the names of discovered “missing traders” or VAT fraudsters.
KUSS coordinates both connected cases of national and cross-border tax fraud.
The experience gathered by KUSS is incorporated into the development of RMS in the working groups.
Furthermore, experts of several other units of the CLO and the MoF are entrusted with RMS duties and responsibilities.
At the level of the CLO, a formal control is done of the composition of VAT IDs of other Member States in submitted RS of German taxpayers.
This formal control is processed before RS data are submitted to other Member States to improve the clarity and use of the VIES data submitted (see 4.4.2).
The verification of VAT IDs mentioned in RS is proven on the basis of O_MCTL-Codes submitted by other Member States (for the process of correcting an invalid VAT ID see also 4.4.2).
Furthermore, the RMS of the CLO is based on the VIES data transmitted by other Member States and it creates several types of inspection notes based on several characteristics usually found in carousel transactions to detect a potential “missing trader”.
The tax offices of the federal states are instructed to process these inspection notes and in some cases to report the result of their investigation to the CLO.
The audit findings of the BRH confirmed that it is necessary to include all available characteristics in order to be able to assume a case of tax fraud with a sufficient probability (instead of focussing on a company’s turnover only).
So the BRH suggested to the MoF to imply a mix of diverse characteristics for producing the reports.
The RMS should include other facts like the taxpayer’s payment behaviour, the (economic) branch or the shareholders.
A second level of RMS is processed by the tax administrations of the federal states and focuses on processing of VAT returns.
RMS for example generates a list of those taxpayers who declared intra-Community supplies in their VAT returns.
This list is sent to the CLO to monitor the complete submission of RS.
Furthermore, this type of RMS compares the intra-Community acquisitions declared in the taxpayer’s annual VAT return with the data of the VIES-system.
The tax administrations of the federal states avoid a comparison of the quarterly data because this comparison would disclose too many mismatches which may attributed to other reasons than tax evasion or tax fraud; for example:
– differing times when the supplier and the acquirer thought the intra-Community transaction was carried out;
– differing accounting and declaring of sales discounts and incentives.
In addition to comparing the VAT return data and VIES data many federal states implemented components of RMS based on the data of VAT returns, and some other facts (like the composition of the firm‘s name, the age of the shareholders, the number of employees and the taxpayer’s payment behaviour).
Bavaria implemented a rule-based RMS, permitting a team of tax fraud specialists (hereinafter the risk managers) to program their own rules to identify potential tax fraudsters.
This RMS is applied when the tax offices are processing the monthly VAT return.
So the tax office in charge receives suspected cases of the RMS before the VAT is fixed.
Since this RMS is not able to learn the risk managers have to adjust the rules on the basis of the feedback of the tax offices.
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has programmed an adaptive neural network with the data of tax files in which an audit disclosed tax evasions.
Based on these data the RMS is able to learn the characteristics of tax evasion.
The RMS produces a list of tax files monthly, which are suspected of being involved in tax evasion.
On the basis of this list the tax offices in charge decide to audit the proposed taxpayers.
After the audit the auditors have to report their findings, so the RMS can learn from the results of its list.
North-Rhine Westphalia uses an adaptive neural network which is combined with a rule-based fuzzy-system.
Based on many data of assessed VAT returns and some other facts this neuro-fuzzy- or data mining system calculates the probability that a taxpayer is involved in tax fraud.
Afterwards it produces a monthly list of potential tax fraudsters.
Based on this list the local tax offices choose relevant taxpayers for an audit and report the audit findings to the data processing centre.
The implementation of any of these three RMS in other federal states is in progress.
Since none of these three RMS is based on the same approach a combination of all the systems seems to be useful for tackling tax fraud.
It will remain to be seen if such a system achieves the expected results.
Comparison and evaluation
Although specific criteria of the RMS of CR and Germany could not be discussed in this report, the SAO and the BRH found that each Member State developed its own RMS.
Like the different approaches of the three federal states in Germany the RMS of each European state has its own strengths and weaknesses.
The tax authorities of the European Member States currently discuss new tendencies and new models of crossborder VAT fraud.
VAT fraud – especially carousel fraud – did not turn out to be a national but a European problem rather.
Taxpayers involved in fraudulent activities act simultaneously not only in one Member State but in several states.
An effective RMS cannot be developed by one Member State only.
Successful criteria, components or approaches of a RMS have to be exchanged and implemented in each Member State of the EC, if not so fraudsters will choose that Member State with the weakest RMS.
VAT loss caused by the Europe-wide fraud need not to affect the Member State of the initiator of the fraud.
Each Member State that is involved in the fraudulent activities can be affected.
So there should be a European exchange and discussion of RMS.
Selected audit findings on verification of commercial transactions
As part of the parallel audits the SAO and BRH reviewed the quality and use of information on selected business transactions that were subject to international exchange of information between the tax administrations of the CR and Germany.
In addition, the two audit institutions jointly reviewed several business transactions where there were doubts about their execution or discrepancies in the manner in which taxpayers in the two countries reported such business transactions in their VAT returns or RS.
At the request of the BRH, the SAO reviewed a total of 8 cases related to business transactions performed between 8 Czech and 8 German tax entities.
In addition, in 43 cases, on the basis of notification by the BRH, the SAO reviewed the values of intra-Community transactions with Germany, reported by Czech taxpayers in their tax returns and RS.
Upon request from the SAO, the BRH reviewed a total of 23 cases related to business transactions performed between 23 German and 21 Czech tax entities.
Relevant information was exclusively exchanged on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 using official communication by the CLO.
The review of those selected cases revealed, i.a. that, the different ways of registration in the EC Member States cause problems as mentioned in chapter 4.1:
1.
According to the data from VIES, in the 3rd quarter of 2004, a Czech taxpayer acquired goods from a German taxpayer at a value of EUR 60,500.
When the Czech taxpayer declared acquisition of goods at a value corresponding to only EUR 29,869 the Czech tax administration sent a request to Germany for verification of the value of the supplied goods.
The German party stated in the answer to the RFI delivered from Germany that, in the 2nd quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer supplied goods to the Czech taxpayer at a value of EUR 27,381, in the 3rd quarter at a value of EUR 31,997 and, in the 4th quarter, at a value of EUR 10,276.
It further followed from the answer that the VAT ID of the German taxpayer was valid only from 28 September 2004 but, on the basis of an additional request by the German taxpayer for certification of the validity of VAT ID, in 2006 the German CLO retroactively issued a certificate with validity of the VAT ID from 1 May 2004.
The German taxpayer corrected the RS.
On the basis of this information, this was a case of acquisition of goods by the Czech taxpayer.
Through an inquiry at the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that, on the basis of an investigation by the tax administrator, the Czech taxpayer submitted additional VAT returns for the individual taxable periods in 2004, in which he increased the value of the goods acquired from other Member States and simultaneously made claims for deduction of VAT on acquisition of goods from other Member States.
However, the Czech tax administrator could not unambiguously determine from these additional VAT returns whether they also include the value of supplies from the above-mentioned German supplier.
On the basis of a request from the SAO, the BRH found that the German supplier was registered for VAT in September 2003.
However, because he did not request the allocation of a VAT ID on registration, he was allocated only an identification number for transactions in Germany.
Although it is not usually possible to allocate a taxpayer a VAT ID retroactively in Germany, in this case, in 2006 the German tax official assigned to this German taxpayer a VAT ID retroactively as of 1 May 2004.
The German CLO allocates a VAT ID retroactively if the German entrepreneur did not cause the delay of the allocation; for example if the CLO caused the delay after the taxpayer’s application of a VAT ID.
In this case the CLO allocates VAT ID retroactively because the entrepreneur does not provide an own valid VAT ID for an intra-Community supply according to § 6 UStG.
Vice versa a German recipient does not provide a valid VAT ID of his supplier to declare an intra-Community acquisition.
Because of these different processes between the Member States the German CLO allocated VAT ID retroactively in this special case.
2.
As part of international exchange of information, the Czech tax administrator requested review of the VAT registration of the German taxpayer.
VIES gives a registration date of 5 March 2005, while the date 1 October 2004 is given in the certificate of registration of the German taxpayer issued by the competent local German tax office.
The German authorities stated in the answer sent from Germany that the German tax entity was registered on 1 October 2004, but that, for organisational reasons, he was allocated a VAT ID in Germany only on 16 February 2005.
Through a question sent to the competent local tax administrator, the SAO found that the Czech tax administrator performed a VAT audit at the Czech taxpayer for the taxation periods of the 3rd quarter of 2004 to the 2nd quarter of 2005.
In this audit, the tax office found that the Czech taxpayer included in his VAT return services at a value of CZK 9,897 (EUR 314), provided to the German taxpayer prior to his VAT registration (i.e. prior to 1 October 2004).
The tax office subsequently assessed VAT of CZK 1,880 (EUR 60) for the tax entity for the taxation period of the 3rd quarter of 2004.
On the basis of a request from the SAO, the BRH found that the VAT ID was allocated to the German taxpayer only on 16 February 2005, when he informed the tax office about his business which was started in 2004.
Furthermore the tax office registered him retroactively for VAT as 1 October 200415 to monitor the submission of the annual VAT return of the year 2004.
In this VAT return the taxpayer declared intra-Community acquisitions from CR in the amount of EUR 160 (» CZK 5,000).
3. In the VAT return for September 2004 and RS for the 3rd quarter of 2004, the Czech taxpayer declared the supply of goods at a value of CZK 114,615 (EUR 3,642) to a German taxpayer.
In reviewing the registration of the German taxpayer in the VIES system, the Czech tax administrator found that his registration was valid from 11 November 2004, i.e. after supply of the goods to Germany by the Czech taxpayer.
The Czech taxpayer submitted an additional VAT return, in which he declared a tax base for performed domestic supplies at a value of CZK 114,615 (EUR 3,642) and VAT of CZK 21,777 (EUR 692), which he paid.
Through a question to the competent local tax office in the CR, the SAO found that the Czech taxpayer subsequently submitted a request for renewal of the proceedings in the matter of the additional VAT return and, as evidence, submitted the statement of the German tax administration that the German taxpayer had been registered for taxes since 1 January 2000.
Consequently, the Czech tax administrator reviewed the validity of registration of the German taxpayer as part of international exchange of information.
It followed from the answer delivered from Germany that the German taxpayer was allocated a VAT ID only on 11 November 2004, i.e. after the date of supply of the goods.
Consequently, the tax administrator in the CR rejected the request for renewal of the proceedings.
The BRH found that, in this case, intra-Community acquisition of goods was not involved because the German taxpayer obtained a VAT ID only on 11 November 2004.
However, the German recipient declared the acquisition as an intra-Community acquisition and he declared VAT on this intra-Community acquisition, as he demanded the refund of the input VAT in the same amount.
Since there would be no change in VAT value that the German taxpayer would be obliged to pay, the tax administrator in Germany did not correct the data in his VAT return.
The BRH further found that the name of the German taxpayer mentioned in the RFI was changed during the processing of the answer in Germany, as a consequence of which there was confusion between two German tax entities.
This change of the name of the German taxpayer also confused the Czech tax administrator.
4.
As part of international exchange of information, the German tax administrator reviewed the acquisition of goods by a Czech taxpayer in the 1st quarter of 2005, at a value of EUR 22,686 from a German taxpayer.
Through an inquiry to the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that this administrator performed a local investigation concerning the Czech taxpayer in which he reviewed whether the supply of the goods was performed and whether the Czech taxpayer entered the invoice for these goods in the accounts and paid it.
The Czech taxpayer did not declare the acquisition of the goods in his VAT return, because the German supplier did not state his VAT ID in the tax document, but only the tax number intended for domestic transactions in Germany.
In the VIES application, the Czech tax administrator found that the German taxpayer was registered for VAT for intra-Community transactions only from 21 April 2005, i.e. after performance of the supply to the Czech taxpayer.
The Czech tax administrator also requested that the German tax administration send a copy of the certificate of registration of the German taxpayer so that, if required, he could take steps to assess taxes.
The Czech tax office assessed this business transaction as acquisition of goods from a nontaxpayer in Germany and thus did not subsequently assess taxes for the Czech taxpayer from this business transaction.
The BRH found that, according to the German legislation, for a taxpayer supplying goods to other Member States there is no need for a VAT ID ensuring that intra-Community supplies of goods are exempt from VAT.
The supplier must only have the VAT ID of the acquirer in the other Member State and must be capable of demonstrating transport of the given goods to the other Member State.
Thus, according to the German VAT law, this was an intra-Community transaction and VAT should be assessed in the CR.
Anyway it is important that the Czech tax administrator took note of this transaction because the supply of a machine of that value was not the German supplier’s core business.
As described in chapter 4.6.2 the German CLO declines to answer RFIs which are applied to intra-Community transactions if the amount is less than the minimum threshold of EUR 15,000:
5. According to VIES data in the 3rd quarter of 2004, the Czech taxpayer acquired goods from the German taxpayer at a value of EUR 12,561.
The Czech tax administrator performed a tax audit of the tax entity for this taxable period.
As part of international cooperation, the Czech tax administration requested review of supply of these goods via a SCAC form.
The Czech taxpayer stated that he did not receive the goods, that he had never done business with the German company and that the acquisition of these goods was not entered in his accounts.
The German tax administration rejected the request for provision of evidence – contracts, orders, invoices and transport documents, stating that the turnover did not exceed the amount of EUR 15,000 and no other explanations were given.
As the Czech tax administrator did not obtain any evidence for retrospective tax assessment on the goods acquired, the tax audit ended without any findings and the tax liability remained assessed in the original amount.
On the basis of a request from the SAO, the BRH found that the German taxpayer acted as a “fiscal representative” (§ 22 (a) – (e) UStG).
The German taxpayer reported these supplies in its annual VAT return and in the RS.
His right to exemption of the supplies was recognised.
On the basis of notification by the BRH, the German tax office will send documents to the CR, required for subsequent assessment of taxes on the acquired goods.
It was shown in chapter 4.6.1 that replies to RFIs sent by the German tax administration exceeded the 3-monthtime limit more often than replies of the Czech tax administration:
6. SAO found in the audit that, on 5 October 2005 the Czech tax administration sent a request for information to Germany, related to reviewing the value of goods supplied in the 4th quarter of 2004.
In the RS for this period, the German taxpayer declared supply of goods to the Czech taxpayer in the value of EUR 86,307; however, for the same period, the Czech taxpayer declared in the VAT return only the acquisition of goods for a value corresponding to EUR 35,314.
In the answer to the RFI delivered to the CR on 9 May 2006, i.e. following expiry of the deadline for processing, stipulated in Art. 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003, the German party stated that the request could not be processed, as the operation of the German company was terminated at the end of 2005.
Since the German tax administration did not comply with the deadline for processing the RFI, the Czech tax administration did not have the documents necessary for the tax proceedings in the CR.
7. In 2005, the Czech tax administrator requested - via a SCAC form - review of a supply of automobiles to a German taxpayer at a value of EUR 1,265,554, performed in the 3rd and 4th quarter of 2004 since the transaction showed characteristics of carousel fraud.
The SAO found that an answer to the RFI had not been received from Germany at the time of the audit.
Through an inquiry to the competent local tax administrator, the SAO found that the Czech taxpayer did not include in his VAT return the supplies of new means of transportation for this German taxpayer at a value of CZK 11,816,103 (EUR 37 5,472).
The Czech tax administrator corrected the tax return information and the Czech tax entity submitted a corrected RS.
On the basis of the request by the SAO, the BRH found that, for technical reasons, the German CLO did not transfer this RFI to the competent local tax office for review.
Following notification by the BRH, an audit was performed at the German acquirer in Germany, which provided evidence that the acquisition of all the automobiles was properly taxed and that the relevant automobiles were sold to other taxpayers in Germany.
8. According to VIES data in the 4th quarter of 2004 the Czech taxpayer acquired a passenger car from the German taxpayer, at a value of EUR 48,500.
The Czech taxpayer did not declare acquisition of these goods.
In an inquiry to the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that the Czech taxpayer has not submitted a VAT return since August 2004.
The Czech taxpayer did not submit tax returns even after being invited to do so by the tax administrator; consequently, on 23 May 2005, the tax office assessed VAT for the period from October to December 2004 in the amount of CZK 0.
On 2 June 2005, the CLO referred to this supply from a German taxpayer.
Since the Czech taxpayer did not cooperate with the tax administrator, the administrator sent a RFI to Germany in relation to the above-mentioned supply.
As the answer to the RFI was delivered only on 7 February 2007, it was not known by the time of completion of the SAO’s audit in which way the Czech tax administrator used the information obtained by international exchange.
Because of failure to comply with obligations following from the Act on VAT, registration for VAT was cancelled for the Czech taxpayer as of 23 August 2005.
In some cases only a partial reply was sent because the audit carried out by tax offices at taxpayers was not finished at the time of the audit of the SAO and BRH:
9.
In 2005, through a SCAC form, the Czech tax administrator requested review of supply of automobiles to a German taxpayer at a value of EUR 16,991 performed in the 3rd quarter of 2004, showing the characteristics of carousel fraud.
In his answer to the RFI, the German tax administrator stated that he had available only the invoices issued by the Czech taxpayer for supplies at a value of EUR 16,335.
On the basis of the request from the SAO, the BRH found that the audit performed by the German tax office at the acquirer in Germany had not yet been completed.
The German acquirer declared the acquisition of goods at a value of EUR 16,335 twice, in the tax returns for the months of August and September 2004.
10.
In 2005, through a SCAC form, the Czech tax administrator requested review of supplies of automobiles to a German taxpayer at a value of EUR 198,167, performed in the 4th quarter of 2004 and 1st quarter of 2005, showing the characteristics of carousel fraud.
The German tax administration sent a partial answer to the RFI to the CR, in which it confirmed that the German taxpayer acquired several automobiles and further stated that the investigation in Germany had not yet been completed.
The SAO found that the competent local tax office performed several local investigations at the Czech supplier for the purpose of reviewing the claim of excessive VAT deductions, in which it did not find unauthorised claiming.
The BRH found that in this period the German taxpayer declared in his VAT returns the acquisition of goods from other Member States with a total value of EUR 579,114 and that the audit performed by the German tax office at the acquirer in Germany has still not yet been completed.
In chapter 4.4.1 the reasons of mismatches between the declaration of intra-Community acquisitions in the recipient’s VAT return and the data of the RS of the supplier are described.
The audited cases showed that temporary mismatches or the improper declaration of a transaction as an intra-Community supply of goods in RS were not the most frequent causes for the deviations:
11.
According to data from the VIES system, in the 1st quarter of 2005, the Czech taxpayer allegedly acquired goods at a value of EUR 35,716 from the German taxpayer; however, the Czech taxpayer did not declare this acquisition.
Since the Czech taxpayer failed to cooperate with the tax administrator and no activities were performed in the registered seat of the company, the Czech tax administrator requested, as part of international exchange of information, review of the way in which the German taxpayer communicated with the Czech taxpayer.
The answer to the RFI delivered from Germany showed that, according to the findings of the German tax administration, the Czech tax entity was unknown at the address communicated and an agreed transporter accepted the goods.
The order was for the total sum of EUR 155,000 but the German taxpayer supplied only goods at a value of EUR 21,659.
The Czech taxpayer sent the German taxpayer false confirmation of payment of the sum of EUR 155,153 in favour of the German taxpayer.
Following identification of the fraudulent conduct on the part of the Czech acquirer, the German taxpayer managed to reobtain the supplied material, with the assistance of his other Czech customers, with the exception of one item at a value of EUR 7,916.
Through an inquiry at the competent local tax office in the CR, the SAO found that the tax administration, i.a., on the basis of the obtained information, subsequently assessed the Czech taxpayer VAT for the goods acquired from other Member States in the amount of CZK 388,522 (EUR 13,044).
On the basis of an inquiry from the SAO, the BRH confirmed that, following corrections, the German supplier declared supply of goods to the Czech taxpayer at a value of only EUR 7,916.
According to the German legal situation the German taxpayer declared the reclaim of the goods and the reduction of the taxable amount in the quarter of the reclaim.
So his RS contained the following declarations concerning the Czech taxpayer:
12.
As part of international exchange of information, the German tax administration requested, through a SCAC form, review of supply of goods and provision of services, performed in the 3rd quarter of 2005.
According to this RFI in this period, the Czech taxpayer had supplied goods to the German taxpayer at a total value of EUR 396,126 and had provided services at a value of EUR 11,885.
The SAO found that the Czech tax administration performed a local investigation concerning the Czech taxpayer for the purpose of reviewing this supply.
In response to the RFI, the Czech tax administration stated that the Czech taxpayer supplied the German taxpayer with a production line, including assembly.
The Czech taxpayer supplied the individual parts of the production line prior to accession of the CR to the EC and the line was assembled after May 1, 2004 on the basis of an order.
The German taxpayer did not accept the assembled line because of asserted defects.
In the 3rd quarter of 2005, the Czech taxpayer issued an invoice to the German taxpayer for the sum of EUR 107,100 for assembly and EUR 11,885 for services.
The German taxpayer accepted the invoices, but did not recognise them and did not pay them.
Through an inquiry at the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that all the invoices were properly entered in the accounts of the Czech taxpayer.
VAT returns for the 3rd quarter of 2005 contain only those amounts that were documented by the Czech taxpayer and that were related to invoicing after May 1, 2004.
The BRH found that, on the basis of the answer from the Czech tax administration, the competent local tax office arrived at the conclusion that those transactions were a consistent supply of goods from the Czech taxpayer to the German taxpayer including the service of the assembly.
In this special case, the place of this so-called work supply is where the production line is assembled.
The German recipient of the work supply is obliged to pay the VAT according to the German VAT law.
Simultaneously, the recipient may apply for deduction of VAT in the same amount.
As there would be no changes in the VAT value that the German taxpayer would be obliged to pay, corrections in the tax return were neglected by the German tax office.
13. According to VIES data, in February 2005 Czech taxpayer A purchased a machine from German taxpayer C at a value of EUR 58,000.
The Czech tax administrator sent a request to Germany for review of this information.
In answer to the RFI, the German party stated that German taxpayer C supplied that machine to Czech taxpayer B in 2004, but that he returned the machine to German taxpayer C in October 2004.
According to the information of the German tax administration, the machine was not transferred back to Germany, but was transported to the organisational unit of German taxpayer C in the CR.
It further followed from the answer to the RFI that, in February 2005, German taxpayer C sold the machine to Czech taxpayer A.
This taxpayer received the machine in the seat of the organisational unit of the German taxpayer in the CR.
As the supply was performed only within the CR, this did not constitute an intra-Community supply of goods.
By means of a question to the tax administrator in charge of taxpayer B, the SAO found that according to VIES data, German taxpayer C supplied goods to Czech taxpayer B in the 3rd quarter of 2004 (another machine), at a value of EUR 88,027.
Taxpayer B stated that he did not receive these goods and these the competent local tax administrator in the CR sent a RFI to Germany.
According to the answer to this request, the machine was supplied.
In a further investigation at taxpayer B, the Czech tax administrator found that the machine at a value of EUR 88,027 was not entered in the accounts of taxpayer B and that this could be a machine of the same kind as was supplied by the organisational unit of German taxpayer C to Czech taxpayer A in February 2005.
The SAO further found that the Czech tax administrator competent local for taxpayer A performed a local investigation concerning this taxpayer.
The tax administrator had the invoice of German taxpayer C of 7 February 2005, in which taxpayer A is stated as the customer for the machine.
The Czech tax administrator found that taxpayer A had not entered this invoice in his accounts.
Taxpayer A had concluded a leasing agreement with another Czech company, where the subject of the leasing was a machine of the same kind.
The leasing company supplied the machine on 9 February 2005 and the leasing company provided for the transport of the machine.
The Czech tax office failed to use the information contained in the answer to the request for information for assessing the tax obligation of taxpayer A.
The BRH found that German taxpayer C did not supply the machine at a value of EUR 88,027 to the CR, but to another German taxpayer D.
Thus, this did not constitute intra-Community supply of goods, but taxable supply in Germany.
Consequently, the German tax administrator did not recognise the claim of German taxpayer C to exemption from VAT and corrected the data in his tax return.
The German taxpayer D supplied the machine to the Czech taxpayer B.
According to the German legislation, this supply was not taxable in Germany, but was subject to VAT in the CR.
BRH further found that, in his RS for the 1st quarter of 2005, German taxpayer C entered the supply of a machine at a value of EUR 58,000 to Czech taxpayer A.
This supply was not reviewed during the tax audit performed by the German tax office.
The following figure shows the contractual relationships between participants of the above mentioned business transactions.
14.
Auditing received RFIs, SAO found that on 4 October 2005 the Czech tax administration received an RFI from Germany, in which a German tax administrator requested confirmation of intra-Community supply from a German taxpayer at a value of EUR 879,680,625 to a Czech taxpayer.
According to the German tax administrator, there was a suspicion that that was a case of fictitious intra-Community supply of goods.
It was further stated in the RFI that the German taxpayer had not done any active business since 1999.
SAO stated that the Czech tax administrator performed a local investigation concerning the Czech taxpayer.
The executive of the Czech company stated that the above-mentioned case was probably a claim of the German taxpayer in relation to the German tax administration that was set up by the Czech taxpayer as a shareholder in the German company at the German tax office.
According to information provided to the SAO, to the present time the Czech tax administrator has not had any information that the German tax administration is processing the matter in relation to the Czech taxpayer.
The available information indicates that this was not a case of supply of goods; nonetheless, this value is still included in the VIES system as intra-Community supply of goods to a Czech taxpayer from Germany.
The most important reason for those discrepancies was that the recipients did not declare the intra-Community acquisitions in their tax returns (see also chapter 4.4.1):
15. According to the VIES data, a German taxpayer supplied goods to a Czech taxpayer in a total value of EUR 33,205 in the period from the 3rd quarter of 2004 to the 1st quarter of 2005.
The Czech taxpayer did not declare this acquisition.
The Czech tax administrator requested review of the supply of the goods from Germany as part of international exchange of information.
In its answer to this request, the German party stated that the German taxpayer sent part of the goods to the address of the Czech taxpayer and that the Czech taxpayer picked up the remaining goods in person.
In an inquiry to the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that, prior to obtaining an answer to the RFI, the Czech taxpayer submitted an additional VAT return for this period.
In spite of this submission, the differences in the acquisition values were not resolved and thus the Czech tax administrator recommended that a tax audit be performed at the Czech taxpayer.
The audit has not been carried out yet.
16. According to the data from VIES, in the 3rd quarter of 2004 a German taxpayer supplied to a Czech taxpayer goods at a value of EUR 46,854.
For the same period, the Czech taxpayer declared intra-Community acquisition of goods only in an amount corresponding to the sum of EUR 14,856.
As part of international exchange of information, the Czech tax administrator asked for a review of the amount of the actual supply.
In the response to this request delivered from Germany, 3 invoices were provided, with a total stated value of supplied goods of EUR 31,999, i.e. a value corresponding to the difference between the acquisition declared by the Czech taxpayer and the data in the VIES system.
In an inquiry to the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that, following receipt of the answer from Germany, the Czech tax administrator contacted the accountant of the Czech taxpayer and they agreed that, after reviewing these invoices with the owner of the company, she would discuss the submission of an additional VAT return for the 3rd quarter of 2004.
By now, the additional tax return was not submitted.
The Czech tax administrator informed the SAO that he would proceed so as to comply with the set deadlines for any retroactive assessment of VAT for the relevant taxation period.
17.
In the 4th quarter of 2004, the German taxpayer supplied goods to the Czech taxpayer at a value of EUR 11,600.
As part of international exchange of information, the German tax administrator requested confirmation of whether the Czech taxpayer actually existed, because the alleged shareholder of the German taxpayer established a number of fictitious companies in Germany.
During reviewing of the business transaction by the tax office, the Czech taxpayer confirmed the acquisition of the goods.
However, according to a statement by the Czech taxpayer, the goods were not transported from Germany to the CR and were further sold in Germany during 2005.
The Czech taxpayer submitted documents on sale of the goods in January 2005.
The Czech taxpayer was not registered in Germany as a VAT payer and did not declare or pay taxes for the sale of the relevant goods neither in the CR nor Germany.
All these facts indicated tax evasion in the territory of Germany and the Czech tax administrator communicated these facts to the German tax administration in the answer to the RFI.
In an inquiry to the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that, on the basis of a performed investigation, the Czech taxpayer submitted an additional VAT return for the 4th quarter of 2004, in which he included the value of goods acquired, i.a. from a German taxpayer and simultaneously exercised the right to tax deduction in acquisition of goods from other Member States.
He did not enter VAT on sale of goods in Germany to the Czech VAT return.
The Czech tax administrator assessed an additional VAT return following the local investigation without any changes.
According to the Czech legislation, the case in question did not consist in acquisition of goods from other Member States, as the goods were not sent or transported from another Member State to the CR.
Thus, the Czech tax administrator drew an erroneous conclusion in the local investigation.
The BRH found that, immediately after receiving the answer to the RFI, stating that the goods did not leave Germany, the German tax administrator corrected the tax return of the German taxpayer and requested payment of VAT of EUR 1,600.
Furthermore, the competent tax office sent a hint to the tax office of the real recipient of the goods to ensure that the further sale of these goods is properly taxed.
In the following cases taxpayers declared intra-Community transactions, which were probably not realised in fact:
18.
The Czech tax administrator obtained a request from the German tax administration for information on whether the Czech taxpayer acquired a passenger car at a value of EUR 47,400 from the German taxpayer in February 2005.
The request included an annex consisting in a copy of the VAT registration certificate of the Czech taxpayer.
It also included a copy of the passport of the person who was said to have performed the transport of this automobile.
The Czech tax administrator found in the investigation that this was a stolen passport, that the person mentioned in it did not import any vehicle into the CR and he stated that he did not have any contacts with a German tax entity.
The Czech tax administrator never issued the certificate of VAT registration, whose copy was sent by the German party.
The Czech tax administrator entered these data in the answer to the RFI together with the fact that he cannot confirm the acquisition of the goods – the automobile in question.
Through a question to the competent local tax administrator in the CR, the SAO found that the Czech taxpayer does not have his seat at the address listed in the Commercial Register and the executive of the company could not be contacted.
After performance of a tax objection proceeding for the taxation period of February 2005, the Czech tax administrator assessed the Czech taxpayer tax obligation in the amount of CZK 0.
In a further investigation, the Czech tax administrator found that the relevant automobile was sold to a further Czech entity, who purchased it through an Internet advertisement.
BRH found that, on the basis of the Czech answer to the RFI, the competent local German tax administrator did not recognise the claim of the German taxpayer to VAT exemption for this supply.
19. During an audit a German tax office was not able to clarify a difference of EUR 3,000 between the amount of acquired goods declared in the taxpayer’s tax return and the amount submitted from other Member States.
A Czech taxpayer was said to have supplied goods at a value of EUR 89,424 to a German taxpayer during the 4th quarter of 2004 and 1st quarter of 2005.
As the acquisition declared by the German taxpayer did not correspond to the data in VIES, the German tax administrator requested review of supplies and their payment as part of international exchange of information.
In the answer to the RFI, the Czech tax administrator stated that the single executive for the Czech company had been erased from the Commercial Register on 8 July 2005 and a new executive had not been entered.
The German recipient of the goods was presumably a relative to the shareholder in the Czech company.
The Czech taxpayer submitted a VAT return and a RS that, following deletion of the executive from the Commercial Register, was signed by an unauthorised person – this shareholder in the company.
The accountant of the Czech taxpayer told the tax administrator that the shareholder in the company deposited the cash paid for the invoiced goods in EUR to the account of the company.
Cash documents were not drawn up.
Through an inquiry to the competent local tax office, the SAO in the CR found that the tax administrator recognised that the Czech taxpayer had the right to exemption from VAT for supply of goods to other Member States in the value of CZK 1,326,307 (EUR 42,145) for the 1st quarter of 2004 and CZK 1,416,180 (EUR 47,548) for the 1st quarter of 2005.
The BRH found that the tax administrator in Germany did not correct the VAT return of the German acquirer because a German court had confirmed the insolvency of the German taxpayer in the meantime.
Since the earlier audit did not detect any signs for tax fraud there would not be any chance to recover an assessed VAT liability.
20. According to VIES data in the year 2005 a German taxpayer acquired goods from CR in the amount of EUR 4,251,196 after he had acquired goods in the amount of EUR 43,274 in the previous year.
Neither in his VAT return of 2004 nor in his VAT return of 2005 did the German taxpayer declare intraCommunity acquisitions.
Furthermore, he did not declare any proportionate supplies.
Because of these differences the German tax office started an RFI concerning the 4th quarter of 2005 and the 1st quarter of 2006.
In the RS for these two quarters a Czech supplier declared intra-Community supplies of goods in a total value of CZK 167,246,083 (EUR 5,615,299).
On 6 September 2006, the RFI was delivered, in which the German party requested review of whether the intra-Community supply declared by the Czech taxpayer had actually occurred.
In the answer to this RFI, the Czech tax administration stated that it was not possible to comply with the German request because the Czech taxpayer did not have an executive.
As can be seen from the documents provided to SAO by the relevant tax administrator, a protocol was drawn up with the executive of the Czech taxpayer on 30 March 2006 on commencement of VAT audit for the 4th quarter of 2004 and for January to December 2005.
The taxpayer was simultaneously invited by the tax administrator to submit all the accounting and tax documents for that period, but he did not submit any documents.
According to the Commercial Register, the functional term of the sole executive ended as of 16 May 2005 but a new executive was not appointed.
The Czech taxpayer ceased submitting VAT returns in April 2006.
As part of this audit, the SAO reviewed jointly with the BRH several cases of intra-Community supplies performed between the CR and Germany that were not subject to previous exchange of information between the tax administrations of the two countries.
The two supreme audit institutions shared information on the reviewed cases via CLO of both countries.
21. A Czech company (eCR) which is not resident in Germany informed the competent tax office (Chemnitz-Süd) that it was going to accomplish taxable transactions in Germany.
Because of this information the company has been registered since June 2005 but it did not get a German VAT ID.
The (eCR) accepted an order of a Danish entrepreneur (eDK) to manufacture several wind power stations and to deliver those wind power stations on behalf, at risk and for account of the Danish customer to Austria.
For lack of sufficient capacities of its own the Czech company passed a part of the order to a German taxpayer (eD) who is resident in Germany.
The following figure shows the contractual relationships and the way of transport of the wind power stations:
According to the German legal situation the place of these transactions has to be determined as described in the following:
– The Danish entrepreneur (eDK) sent the wind power stations for assembly in his name, at his risk and for his own account to Austria.
Because of the assembly his supply takes place in Austria – the supply of the wind power stations is taxable in Austria.
– Since the forwarding agent was instructed by the Danish entrepreneur (eDK) and the transport was on his behalf, on his risk and for his own account, the supply of the German subcontractor (eD) takes place where the transport started – in Germany.
Although the wind power stations have been sent to another EC Member State (A) and the recipient is a registered taxpayer of an EC Member State (CR) the supply of the German subcontractor (eD) could not gain any tax exemption because the EC Member State of destination differs from the EC Member State of the residence of the Czech company.
So this supply is properly taxed in Germany and the Czech company (eCR) deducted the input VAT in its tax returns.
The place of the supply of the Czech company (eCR) is also determined by where the transport started.
However the transport of some wind power stations started in the CR and of some others in Germany.
– The supply of those wind power stations, which are manufactured in the CR, takes place in the CR.
– The supply of the other wind power stations, which are manufactured in Germany, takes place in Germany.
So the Czech company (eCR) delivered both intra-Community supplies from the CR to Austria and intra-Community supplies from Germany to Austria.
The BRH found that neither the Czech company (eCR) declared any intra-Community acquisitions in its German tax return nor submitted a RS to the German CLO.
So it may be possible that the Czech company declared all the intra-Community supplies uniformly as intra-Community supplies from the CR.
The SAO found that the eCR did not declare any intra-Community supplies to Austria but intra-Community supplies to Denmark.
To provide evidence for the taxation of the intra-Community acquisitions in Austria the cooperation of at least four tax administrations (the Austrian, the Czech, the Danish and the German) would be required although that case does not show any sign of tax fraud or of tax evasion.
Furthermore, the SAO and the BRH reviewed transactions to show the size of the differences between the declarations in the VAT return and the VIES data caused by the different legal provisions of VAT in 2004.
The reviewed cases demonstrate also that a change in these legal provisions takes time until the taxpayers and the tax offices apply the new legislation:
22. In the RS for the 2nd to 4th quarter of 2004, a Czech taxpayer declared supply of goods to a German taxpayer in a total value of CZK 792,977,452 (EUR 25,197,885).
In the same period, another Czech taxpayer declared in its RS intra-Community supplies to another German taxpayer in a total amount of CZK 18,157,265 (EUR 576,970).
Information provided to the SAO by the BRH indicated that both cases involved the supply of electrical energy.
Both Czech taxpayers stated the above-mentioned supplies in their RS in accordance with Act No. 235/2004 Coll., valid in 2004.
In a further review of these transactions, an audit group from the SAO found that there were differences in legislation on supply or acquisition of electrical energy between the CR and Germany in 2004.
While, in the CR, taxpayers declared the supply of electrical energy in accordance with the applicable statutory text of Act No. 235/2004 Coll. as intra-Community supply of goods, on the basis of German legislation applicable in 2004, this did not correspond to intra-Community acquisition of goods, but rather to taxable transaction with place of transaction in the territory of Germany.
Differences in the legislation were eliminated in the CR by adoption of Act No. 635/2004 Coll. amending some laws to comply with the administrative fees act effective as from 1 January 2005.
23. A review of selected intra-Community transactions in cooperation with the BRH, showed that a Czech taxpayer declared intra-Community supplies to a German taxpayer in a total value of CZK 240,411,163 (EUR 8,071,823) in his RS for the 1st and 4th quarters of 2005, and that another Czech taxpayer declared, in the RS for the same period, intra-Community supplies to another German taxpayer in a total value of CZK 263,470,776 (EUR 8,846,050).
Information provided to the SAO by the BRH indicated that both cases involved the supply of electrical energy.
Pursuant to statutory text of Act No. 235/2004 Coll., effective as from 1 January 2005, in the case of supply of electrical energy, the place of transaction is the place where the acquirer has his registered office, the place of business or where he has his commercial premises for which these goods are supplied.
Therefore, the Czech taxpayers should not have entered the supplies of electrical energy in their RS in 2005.
The fact that both taxpayers declared intra-Community supply of electricity in their RS led to distortion of data in VIES by a total of CZK 503,881,939 (EUR 16,917,873).
Conclusion
The cooperation achieved the objectives of BRH and SAO.
Both SAI obtained a deeper knowledge of the systems of administration of VAT in the CR and Germany.
The cooperation revealed differences of the two systems and disclosed that the legal provisions governing VAT administration vary.
During the parallel audits, suspicious cases of intra-Community transactions were detected.
Some of them merit further review.
On the basis of audit findings, both SAI produced recommendations on VAT administration.
To monitor implementation of these recommendations and to review the above mentioned cases a follow-up audit should be conducted..
The new experience and knowledge gained by cooperation of both audit institutions are the basis for successful accomplishment of future audit missions of VAT administration.

This Report has been drawn up in Czech, English and German and signed by the President of the Supreme Audit Office, Czech Republic and the President of the Bundesrechnungshof, Germany.
Report on the results of the international cooperation in excise duty administration audits between the Czech and the Slovak Republic in 2006
Introduction
The joint report presents information about the course and result of international cooperation in parallel audits performed by the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic, and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic, focused on excise duty administration after the accession of both countries into the European Union.
The cooperation was performed pursuant to the Agreement on Audit Cooperation signed in February 2006.
Parallel audits were chosen with respect to radical changes in the excise duty collection system as a result of the accession of the Czech and Slovak Republic into the EU internal market as of 1 May 2004.
The functioning of the EU internal market requires free movement of goods, including excisable goods.
The basic principle is to enable circulation of tax-free goods up to the date of their presentation for end use.
The new legislation adopted in both countries enables movement of goods under tax supervision under the duty-suspension arrangement in accordance with the aforementioned principle.
The system imposes high requirements on tax authorities and anticipates mutual cooperation of particular administrative authorities of the Member States in the fight against tax fraud.
Report on the result of the international cooperation in excise duty administration audits in the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 December 2005 1.
Introduction
Audit No: (CR) 05/34 (SR) 48/11
Subject of audit: (CR) Excise duty administration (SR) Customs authorities procedures in excise duty administration
The Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic (hereinafter only „SAO, CR“), and the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter only „ SAO SR“) concluded an Agreement on Audit Cooperation (hereinafter only „the Agreement“) on 8 February 2006.
The subject of the Agreement was cooperation in parallelly performed audits of „Excise duty administration“ included in the Audit plan of the SAO, CR for 2005, No. 05/34 and „Customs procedures in excise duty administration“ included in the SAO SR Audit plan for 2006, No. 48/11.
Parallel audits had the nature of a coordinated audit.
The cooperation consisted both, in the exchange of information that could not be obtained by Parties to the Agreement in course of excise duty administration audit on the territory of the respective state, and in drafting the joint final report on the result of audits in accordance with the European Implementing Guidelines for the INTOSAI Auditing Standard No 31.
The audit on the territory of the Czech Republic (hereinafter only „the CR“) was performed by audit teams composed of representatives of the State Budget Department and of the regional offices in the Central Bohemia, South Bohemia, West Bohemia, Northwest Bohemia, Northeast Bohemia, South Moravia, Central Moravia, and North Moravia from 7 February to 2 June 2006.
The audit was performed by 27 auditors.
One of the audited entities was the General Directorate of Customs (hereinafter only „the DGC“) and 11 tax offices.
12 out of 54 customs offices of the DGC were selected for the audit.
The audit on the territory of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter only „the SR“) was performed by the Financial and Tax Section of the SAO SR in cooperation with the SAO sub-offices in Banská Bystrica and Košice in 5 out of the total number of 9 regional customs offices between 13 February and 2 June 2006.
The audit was performed by 8 auditors.
The objective of parallel audits was to check procedures of the customs authorities in excise duty administration, as well as adherence to valid legislation in both countries and in the EU.
The international cooperation was aimed at the procedures of tax authorities in supervising movement of excisable goods, specifically at the register of started and ended movements of products under the duty-suspension arrangement, as well as on information exchange in the framework of mutual administrative assistance between Czech and Slovak tax authorities.
2. Excise duty administration
Before 31 December 2003, the excise duty administration in the CR was performed by tax authorities.
This responsibility was taken over on 1 January 2004 by the customs authorities that were only responsible for the collection of excise duty on import before that.
In the CR, the excise duty is applicable to mineral oils, spirits, beer, wine and intermediate products and tobacco products.
The 2004 state budget revenue from excise duty amounted to 82,2 billion CZK, which represents 19,5 % of the total revenue of 424,7 billion CZK from duties and charges.
In 2005, the state budget revenue from excise duty amounted to 103,6 billion CZK, which is 22,5 % of the total revenue of 460,4 billion CZK from duties and charges.
The revenue from excise duty on mineral oils represented 80 % of the total revenue of excise tax in 2004 and in 2005 it was 90,9 %.
The remainder of the revenue, e.g. 13,0 billion CZK in 2004 and 6,9 billion CZK in 2005, represented the revenue of the Transport Infrastructure State Fund.
Customs authorities became administrators of the excise duty in the SR on 1 May 2004, with the exception of excise duty from mineral oils, which they have been managing since 1. January 2002.
Previously, tax authorities carried out the excise duty administration.
In the SR, mineral oils, beer, wine, tobacco products and spirits are subject to the excise duty.
The state budget revenue from excise duty in 2004 in the SR amounted to 43,4 billion SKK, which is 20,7 % of the total tax revenue of 209,5 bill. SKK.
In 2005, the state budget revenue from excise duty amounted to 50,0 billion SKK, which is 22,5% of the total tax revenue of 222,6 billion SKK.

Legislation of both countries is based upon the EU regulations governing this field, specifically: - Council Directive 92/12 EEC on the general arrangements for products which are subject to excise duty and on the holding, movement and monitoring of such products as amended (hereinafter referred to as “Council Directive 92/12 EEC”), - Council Regulation (EC) 2073/2004 on administrative cooperation in the field of excise duty (hereinafter referred to as “Council Regulation 2073/2004”), - Commission Regulation (EEC) 2719/92 on the accompanying administrative document for the movement of goods subject to excise duty under the duty-suspension arrangement as amended (hereinafter referred to as “Commission Regulation 2719/92”), - Commission Regulation (EEC) 3649/92 on simplified accompanying document for the intra-Community movement of goods subject to excise duty as amended (hereinafter referred to as “Commission Regulation 3649/92”).
The basic legal norm regulating the field of excise duty in the CR is the Act No. 353/2003 Coll. on excise duty as amended (hereinafter referred to as “Act No. 353/2003 Coll.”), which came into effect on 1 January 2004.
The customs authorities in the SR are inter alia governed by the following generally binding legal regulations: - Act No. 98/2004 Coll. on the excise duty on mineral oil as amended (hereinafter referred to as “Act No. 98/2004 Coll.”), - Act No. 104/2004 Coll. on the excise duty on wine as amended (hereinafter referred to as “Act No. 104/2004 Coll.”), - Act No. 105/2004 Coll. on the excise duty on spirit as amended (hereinafter referred to as “Act No. 105/2004 Coll.”), - Act No. 106/2004 Coll. on the excise duty on tobacco products as amended (hereinafter referred to as “Act No. 106/2004 Coll.”), - Act No. 107/2004 Coll. on the excise duty on beer as amended (hereinafter referred to as “Act No. 107/2004 Coll.”).
2.1 Movement of excisable products under the duty-suspension arrangement between the EU Member States
Conditions of the movement of excisable products under the duty-suspension arrangement are governed by the Council Directive 92/12/EEC in Title III - Movement of goods, Arts. 15 to 20.
Under these provisions, the movement of products can only be performed by an authorised warehousekeeper. That is a physical or legal entity with granted permission by respective authorities of the Member States to produce, process, hold, receipt or dispatch products subject to excise duty.
The consignee in another member state may be an authorised warehouse keeper or trader without the authorised warehousekeeper status who is not allowed either hold or dispatch products under excise-duty suspension arrangements.
An authorised warehouse keeper in the CR and SR means a tax warehouse operator. A trader is an authorised consignee of repeated or single receipt of products liable to excise.
The movement of excisable products under the duty-suspension arrangement is under Council Directive 92/12/EEC possible only with an accompanying document.
The accompanying document is issued by the consignor in four identical copies before the start of the movement, unless respective authorities of a member state of dispatch request more copies.
2.2 Procedure at the start and the end of a movement of products under the duty-suspension arrangement between the CR and SR
Movement from the CR
The procedure at the start of the movement of products under the duty-suspension arrangement is regulated in the provision § 25 (3) Act No. 353/2003 Coll., where the following is indicated:
“The operator that dispatches selected products from the tax warehouse is obliged to notify the customs office with the appropriate territorial competence before the start of the movement of the selected product;
the movement of products can only start upon the approval of the customs office.
The customs office issues approval of the movement of selected products without delay upon a deposit of guarantee to secure the tax ...”
The consignor in the CR can only start the movement of any type of excisable products upon approval of the competent customs office.
The customs office grants such approval only when the guarantee to secure the tax has been deposited in the amount equal to the tax on transported products.
The consignor is obliged to issue the accompanying document in five copies before the start of the movement.
The customs office indicates its approval to start the movement on the accompanying document.
The copy 1 is kept by the consignor, the copies 2, 3, and 4 are given to the transporter and the copy 5 is kept by the customs office which approved the movement.
Under the Slovak legislation, the consignee in the SR keeps the copy 2 of the accompanying document, he confirms taking over the products on the copies 3 and 4 and presents both copies to the competent customs office.
The copy 3 validated by the customs office, is sent to the consignor no later than the 15th day of the subsequent calendar month from when the transfer began.
The copy 4 is kept by the customs office of the consignee.
The movement of products is ended when taken over by the consignee.
The customs office in the CR which approved of the movement to commence discharges the guarantee within 5 working days since the date of presentation of copy 3 of the accompanying document, which is validated by the consignee and the Slovak customs office.
Graph 2 - Circulation of accompanying document when the movement started in the CR and ended in the SR
Movement from the SR
Before 31 December 2005, the procedure at the movement of spirits and tobacco products from SR to another EU member state was regulated in the following manner:
Pursuant to the provision of § 26 (4) Act No 105/2004 Coll.
“During the transportation of spirits from the tax warehouse in the tax territory to the tax warehouse or to a registered trader, or to authorized tax representative in another Member State, the consignor (supplier) is obliged on the day of start of the transportation to send a copy of the copy 1 of the accompanying document via fax or electronically the Customs Office Poprad; the consignor (supplier) is obliged to send this copy in written form also to the customs office no later than 5 working days after the day of the start of the transportation”.
Pursuant to the provision of § 22 para 4 Act No. 106/2004 Coll.
“During the transport of tobacco products from a tax warehouse in the tax territory to the tax warehouse or registered trader, or authorized tax consignee in another Member State the consignor (supplier) is obliged to on the day of the beginning of the transport dispatch a copy of copy 1 of accompanying document electronically or by fax to the Customs Office Poprad; it is also obliged to dispatch this copy in written form no later than 5 working days after the day of the beginning of the transport”.
Between 1 May 2004 and 31 December 2005, (hereinafter referred to as the “audited period”), the tax entity was not obliged to notify the Customs Office Poprad or a respective customs office about the start of the movement of goods under the duty-suspension arrangement of other excisable products (mineral oils, wine and beer).
The tax authority learned about such movements from accompanying documents and accounting documents of the tax entity only during on-the-spot investigations or tax audits.
In the SR, the consignor is obliged to issue the accompanying document in four copies before the start of the movement.
The copy 1 is kept by the consignor (he sends copy 1 electronically or by fax to the Customs Office Poprad and to the respective customs office when spirits and tobacco products are transported).
The copies 2, 3, and 4 accompany the transported products.
In accordance with the Czech legislation the consignee in the CR keeps the copy 2 of the accompanying document issued by the consignor in the SR and certifies the receipt of goods on the copies 3 and 4.
The certified copies 3 and 4 shall be sent to the competent customs office in the CR no later than on the first working day after the movement ended.
The customs office keeps copies 4, and returns validated copy 3 to consignee.
The consignee sends certified copy 3 to consignor in SR at the latest on the first working day after its receipt.
In the SR, the movement is considered to be complete on the date of receipt of products by the consignee.
The end of the movement is proved by the consignor presenting the copy 3 of the accompanying document certified by the consignee and the tax authority in the CR.
Graph 3 - Circulation of the accompanying document at the movement of products (spirits and tobacco products) started in the SR and ended in the CR
All the Slovak acts on excise duty were gradually amended in 2006. According to these legal norms the consignor of products under the duty-suspension arrangement is obliged to send the copy 1 of the accompanying document by e-mail or fax to a competent customs office where the consignor resides.
The copy 3 of the accompanying document certified by the consignee and respective tax authority proves the delivery of spirits and tobacco products.
The copy 3 of the accompanying document certified by the consignee proves the ending of the movement of mineral oils, wine and beer.
The certificate of receipt issued by a tax authority of other member state is required when the tax authority is obliged to issue such a certificate on the copy 3 of the accompanying document under the legislation of the respective member state.
2.3 Register of started and ended movements managed by the Czech and the Slovak Customs Authorities
There is currently no single computer system established for monitoring the movement of products under the duty-suspension arrangement between the EU Member States.
However, the European Parliament and the Council Decision 1152/2003/ES of 16 June 2003 on computerising the movement and surveillance of excisable products imposes on Member States and the European Commission to implement a computerised system (Excise Movement and Control System) by 1 July 2009. This system would enable tax authorities in individual Member States to obtain real-time information on the movement of excisable products.
The system shall enable electronic transmission of the accompanying documents, which only have existed in the hard copy form so far. This would help simplify the movement of products under the duty-suspension arrangement and improve the control of duty free products in all Member States.
National databases of the Member States on the movement of products will be part of this system.
The Customs Administration of the CR records all movements starting and ending within the Czech territory in the Record of Selected Products module (hereinafter only “RSP”).
All the Czech customs offices have online access to this system.
Tax authorities may obtain information about the start or the end of the movements carried out only within the territory of the CR as soon as the customs office enters the accompanying document into the RSP record.
When the customs office of the consignee enters the end of the movement to RSP, the customs office discharges the guarantee covering the duty on the goods deposited by consignor.
Customs offices in the SR use the software database based on the SysNed application, for the automation of their processes of the excise duty administration and for communicating with EU systems.
Data on registration of a tax warehouse, a tax warehouse operator, or an authorised consignee entered in the SysNed application are automatically transmitted to the SEED database.
3. Preparation and course of cooperation
The first co-ordination meeting of the representatives of the SAO, CR and the SAO SR took place in January 2006, where parallel audits of the excise duty administration were discussed.
Both Parties informed each other about the legislation on excise duty and the organisation of the excise duty administration in their countries.
Special attention was paid to the procedures of the Czech and Slovak Customs Authorities in granting permission, starts and ends of movements of products under the duty-suspension arrangement between the EU Member States and exchange of information between tax authorities administering the excise duty in both countries.
In the meeting it was agreed that the Czech and the Slovak Party: - shall specify data on excisable products transported between the CR and the SR, started in the audited period, - shall compare data on movements of mineral oils, CN heading 2710 and 2711 and spirits CN heading 2207 and 2208 under the duty-suspension arrangement between the CR and the SR, in November 2004 and September 2005.
The audit was expanded by including October and November 2005 and by the movement of tobacco products under the duty-suspension arrangement in these months.
Tables 1 and 2 indicate the total amount of products subject to excise duty, which were transported under the duty-suspension arrangement between the Czech and Slovak tax entities in the audited period.
4. Comparison of registers of the movement of products under the duty-suspension arrangement
The SAO, CR handed over the database of movements ending in the Czech territory to the Slovak Party. It contained a total of 5,876 items from the accompanying documents, of which 5,738 items referred to mineral oils, 134 items referred to spirits and 4 items to tobacco products.
The SAO SR handed over the database of movements ending in the SR to the Czech Party. The database contained a total of 3,319 items from the accompanying documents, of which 696 items referred to mineral oil, 2,066 items referred to spirits and 557 items to tobacco products.
The SAO, CR made a comparison of the data in the Register of the movements started in the CR with the data on movements ended in the SR.
The results of this comparison are indicated in the Table 3:
The SAO, CR compared data on movements in November 2004 and September 2005 with the Database of the Slovak Customs submitted by the SAO SR at the beginning of the audit.
The database did not contain accurate data making it difficult to rely upon the confirmation of individual movements and thus only 63 % of started movements were confirmed.
Individual movements were confirmed on the basis of various data, e.g. consignor, consignee, date of transportation, amount of transported products.
The SAO, CR compared data on movements in October and November 2005 started in the CR and ended in the SR with the Slovak Customs Database. Since all the data in the Database were in accordance with the accompanying documents, 93 % of started movements were confirmed outright.
In the Czech Customs Database the volume of mineral oil was indicated in litres or tonnes, depending on the type of mineral oil.
The volume of spirits was in the majority of cases indicated in litres, which could be converted to litres of 100 % alcohol by the alcohol content percentage indicated in the Database.
The volume of tobacco products was indicated in pieces, in thousands pcs or kg by start or the type of tobacco products.
The accompanying documents were checked in cases when movements that started in the CR could not have their end confirmed with certainty in the Slovak Database, or when figures on volume of transported goods did not match.
The accompanying documents were checked in 487 cases concerning the movement of spirits, mineral oils and tobacco products.
Documents were checked in customs offices where the SAO, CR pursued its audit.
In cases where movements were approved by other customs offices, the accompanying documents were requested via the General Directorate of Customs.
The Czech Party requested the Slovak Party to verify 141 movements where there was no certified copy 3 of the accompanying document attached by the Czech Customs Authorities or the amount of products indicated in accompanying document did not match the amount in the Database.
Also data on movements recorded in the Slovak Database and missing in the Czech Database were presented to the Slovak Party.
The SAO SR identified 95 movements in the Slovak Customs Database.
Upon request of the Supreme Audit Office to verify the remaining 46 cases, the competent customs offices presented the certified copies of the accompanying documents proving the movement's completion.
The copies of the accompanying documents were passed over by the Slovak Party to the Czech Party and were used for the identification of movements in the Czech Database, with the exception of two movements performed by two Czech tax entities which were not found in the Czech Database of started movements.
When auditing these cases it was found that:
- 11 movements of spirits were recorded in the Slovak Database in total volume of 276,7 litres of alcohol, performed by the Czech tax entity in 2004, and 20 movements of spirits in total volume of 404,66 litres of alcohol performed in 2005.
The SAO, CR found out that these movements concerned taxed products which the consignor did not need approval of the tax authorities to start their transportation for.
The consignor instead notified the tax authorities in writing about the start of delivery upon possession of a duty-suspension accompanying document.
- In the Slovak Database, 94 movements of mineral oil (CN code 2710 11 21) were recorded with a total volume of 173 000 litres performed by the Czech tax entity in the period of September 2004 to December 2005.
The SAO CR found out that the tax entity performed movement of 102 000 litres of tax-free mineral oils without the respective authorisation from May 2004 to June 2005.
However, the tax entity was a holder of a specific authorisation for the receipt and use of tax-free products, on the condition that the tax-free products were supplied to a holder of equal authorisation only.
This tax entity did not notify the Czech customs authorities about the start of the movement and did not deposit a tax guarantee in the amount of 1,207,680 CZK.
It transported 71 000 litres of taxed mineral oil from July 2005 to December 2005 to the territory of the SR and in these cases it also did not fulfil the legal obligation since it did not notify customs authorities about the start of movement.
The movement of goods under the tax-free circulation in the tax territory of the CR to another Member State may be started by the consignor in the CR without an approval of the customs authority, but it is still obliged to notify customs authorities about this fact in writing before the start of the movement.
The tax entity withdrawing products from the tax-free circulation in another Member State is obliged to notify the amount and deposit a guarantee to cover the tax.
Movement of products can be only performed with a simplified accompanying document, whose particulars are regulated by the Commission Regulation 3649/92.
This Regulation allows the use of an accompanying document for movement under the duty-suspension, but it must be clearly marked that it is a “simplified accompanying document for tax audit purposes (products subject to excise duty)”.
The movement and receipt of products placed in the tax-free circulation in a Member State is also valid in the SR.
In the aforementioned cases, tax entities transported products placed in the tax-free circulation with the accompanying document for movement under the duty-suspension arrangement and the consignee submitted copies 3 and 4 of this document to the tax authority in the SR for validation.
The Slovak Customs recorded these movements in the Database of movements of products under the duty-suspension arrangement, as the accompanying documents were not marked as simplified.
The SAO SR compared the Database of movements of the Czech Customs Administration with the SR Customs Database and found out the following:
- product were recorded in the Database in different ways, for example, mineral oil was recorded in litres, hectolitres and kilograms; spirits were listed in litres or in litres of alcohol, making the comparison of transported products more difficult,
- the total volume of supplied spirits documented in invoices did not match the volume recorded in the Database,
- not all of the invoices were recorded in the customs administrations' Databases,
- in the Slovak Customs database there were two movements of denatured spirits from the CR to the SR that were recorded separately and performed in November 2004 in total amount of 47,237 litres of alcohol. These records were not found in the Czech Customs Database.
The Slovak Party forwarded the copies of related accompanying documents to the Czech Party.
5. International exchange of information between the Czech and Slovak Customs Authorities
Before 30 June 2005, conditions of the cooperation between administrative authorities of the Member States competent for the administration of excise duties were regulated by the Council Directive 77/799/EEC on mutual assistance by the competent authorities of the Member States in the field of direct taxation and taxation of insurance premiums.
On 1 July 2005 the Council Regulation 2073/2004 on administrative cooperation in the field of excise duties came into effect that set out rules and procedures enabling respective authorities of the Member States of the European Union cooperation and exchange of information necessary for correct assessment of excise duties.
Each Member State identifies a central liaison office, which provides for contacts with other Member States in the field of the excise duty administration and is responsible for exchange of information on movement of excisable products.
In the CR the „Excise Liaison Office“ unit was created at the General Directorate of Customs for the purpose of excise information exchange between the EU Member States (hereinafter only „ELO CR “).
Tasks associated with the administration of movement verification systems (SEED, MVS, EWSE) and exchange of information under mutual administrative assistance between the EU Member States and the SR were performed since 1 July 2004 by the ELO at the Customs Office Poprad.
Since 1 July 2005 tasks of the ELO office are accomplished by the ELO unit located in Poprad, a part of the Division of Excise Duties of the Slovak Customs Directorate (hereinafter only „ELO SR“).
Under Article 3 (3) of the Council Regulation 2073/2004 the ELO SR is responsible specially for: - exchange of data of the electronic register of the System for Exchange of Excise Data (hereinafter only „SEED“), - Early Warning System for Excise, (hereinafter only „EWSE“), - applications for movement verification of excisable products to or from other Member States (Movement Verification System, hereinafter only „MVS“).
Contents, scope and functions of SEED, EWSE and MVS are regulated under the Articles 22, 23 and 24 of the Council Regulation 2073/2004.
SEED - System for Exchange of Excise Data on tax entities trading in excisable goods.
System consists of national registers of excise taxpayers and enables tax authorities on the territory of the European Union to find out whether excisable products are traded by persons authorised for this purpose.
Each national register is accessible to the respective authorities of other Member States only for the purpose of excise duty.
The ELO ensures in each Member State that persons involved in movement of excisable products on the EU territory could obtain confirmation of information kept in this Database.
In accordance with § 41 Act No. 98/2004 Coll., § 39 Act No. 104/2004 Coll., § 46 Act No. 105/2004 Coll., § 40 Act No.106/2004 Coll., and § 39 Act No. 107/2004 Coll. the ELO SR maintains electronic database with the register of warehouse operators, authorised consignees and tax warehouses - the SEED Database.
The Slovak Customs Authorities contribute to the SEED by feeding data on registered tax warehouses, warehouse operators or authorised consignees into the SysNed application, which is directly connected to the ELO SR.
It means that if there is a new warehouse operator or an authorised consignee or a tax warehouse entered into the SysNed, the respective data are automatically transmitted to the SEED database.
The SAO SR established that exchange of SEED files between the Slovak and Czech customs authorities took place normally once a month and exceptionally more times a month during the audited period.
The Slovak Customs received 22 SEED files and sent 25 SEED files.
In the CR the data are fed into the SEED from the national register of persons authorised to handle excisable products and the register of issued authorisations on handling these products.
The Czech customs offices do not have access to the international database SEED.
Applications of customs offices to obtain information from the SEED Database of other Member States are presented to and obtained via the ELO CR.
EWSE - Early Warning System is aimed at checking movement of excisable products and it also notifies about movement of high-risk consignments.
As a high-risk consignment is designated the movement of some excisable products in amount exceeding limits set by the Commission Regulation and movements which are classified as high-risk by the tax authority.
Information exchange is made in two forms:
- informative message - sent in case where amount of products exceeds set limits,
- warning message - sent where risk analysis classifies certain movement of products as high risk.
To identify the level of risk the ELO SR uses the SEED Database to verify data in the accompanying document and to send a warning message.
When data in the SEED Database differ from the data in the accompanying document (e.g. different registration number of the consignee or domicile of the consignee), the ELO SR sends a warning message to the ELO of the Member State competent for the products recipient.
While drafting messages the ELO SR abides by Commission Regulations CED 317 and CED 457 for tax and customs business, which inter alia establish the type and volume of products in measurement units for the purposes of informative and warning messages.
During the audited period, the ELO SR sent one warning message to the ELO CR.
In the CR information on started movements of products in volume exceeding set limit are generated automatically upon entry of data from the accompanying document to the Database after the approval of the movement.
If the tax authority in the CR classifies the consignment as high-risk following its own analysis, drafts a warning message and sends it via the ELO CR to the respective Member State.
In 2005 the ELO CR sent two warning messages to the ELO SR.
MVS - Movement Verification System enables to verify movements of excisable products on presentation of application and to verify notified transport route between entities indicated on the accompanying document.
Information exchange takes place on the basis of application in which the ELO of the country of dispatch specifies its requirements.
This system is used mainly in cases where a consignor takes over the certified copy 3 of the accompanying document and requests excise repayment, for example, or in cases when data in the accompanying document cannot be verified in the international database SEED.
In the audited period the ELO SR sent 33 applications for the MVS to the ELO CR.
The ELO CR sent 25 applications for the MVS to the ELO SR.
The Czech Customs Offices most often verified data in accompanying documents, specially volume of received or dispatched products, and authorisation of the consignor to handle excisable products, when this information could not be verified in the international database SEED.
Applications received by the MVS were forwarded in both countries to customs authorities competent for the consignee or consignor of excisable products.
Customs Authorities verified requested data and sent the result of verification to the ELO of the other Member State.
6. SUMMARY
The cooperation between the SAO, CR and the SAO SR enabled comparison of legislation governing the field of excise duties in both countries, procedures of the Czech and Slovak Customs Authorities at the start and end of the movement of goods under the duty-suspension arrangement between both countries, registration of movements and also comparison of information exchanged between Customs Authorities under international cooperation.
6.1 Comparing legislation on excise duty in the CR and the SR the following differences were established in:
a) procedures of tax entities and tax authorities at the start of movement of goods under the duty-suspension arrangement.
In the CR a tax entity can initiate movement of goods under the duty-suspension arrangement only with the approval of a tax authority, which grants such approval only if a potential tax on transported products has been guaranteed in full amount.
Whereas, in the SR the start of the movement of goods under the duty-suspension arrangement is not liable to approval of tax authorities.
During the audited period, a tax entity had to notify tax authorities about the start of the movement of spirits and tobacco products.
Movement of mineral oils, beer and wine could start without notifying tax authorities.
In 2006 in the SR amendments of all Acts on excise duty were adopted, whereby the consignor of products under the duty-suspension arrangement was obliged to send the copy 1 of the accompanying document before the start of the movement by e-mail or fax to the consignor's appropriate customs authority.
b) deadlines for submitting the copy 3 of the accompanying document.
In the CR the consignee is obliged to send the copies 3 and 4 to tax authorities for verification no later than next working day after the date of the end of the movement.
The verified copy 3 must be sent to the consignor of products no later than next working day after its receipt from tax authorities.
The consignee in the SR is obliged to send the copy 3 confirmed by a tax authority and the consignee of products to the consignor no later than on the 15th day of the month following after the calendar month when he received goods.
6.2 The Slovak and Czech Customs Authorities keep an electronic register of movements of goods under the duty-suspension arrangement.
Neither the content nor the form of register is regulated by legal norms in the CR or the SR.
The customs authorities of both countries enter all data from accompanying documents into the register on the basis of which the movement is realized.
At present, there is no single system for monitoring of movements of goods under the duty-suspension arrangement between the EU Member States which would enable tax authorities in particular states to obtain information on the movement in real time.
The decision of the European Parliament and Council No. 1152/2003/EC of 16 June 2003 envisages implementation of an electronic movement monitoring system for excisable goods since 1 July 2009.
On the basis of the Agreement the Czech Party handed over to the Slovak Party a database of movements of goods under the duty-suspension arrangement started in the SR and ended in the CR.
The Database contained 5 876 items of transported mineral oils, spirits and tobacco products.
The Slovak Party handed over to the Czech Party a database of movements of goods under the duty-suspension arrangement started in the CR and ended in the SR.
The Database contained 3 319 items of transported mineral oils, spirits and tobacco products.
The Czech Party compared data on movements in the register of movements started in the CR with the register of movements ended in the SR.
The Slovak Party matched data on movements of goods under the duty-suspension arrangement started in the SR and ended in the CR.
The data comparison was difficult due to the fact, that a lot of transported products were not indicated in the Databases in a unified manner.
In cases where it was impossible to clearly identify and match data on particular movements, verification of accompanying documents was performed. In course of verifications neither violations of conditions of movement of goods under the duty-suspension arrangement nor tax evasions were established.
On the bases of information obtained from parallel audits it may be stated that the register of movements is a source of good information needed for enhancement of the excise tax administration.
Development of an electronic system for movement and monitoring of excisable products pursuant to the Decision of the European Parliament and Council No. 1152/2003 EC enables the electronic transmission of an accompanying document and more efficient verification of movements of goods under the duty-suspension arrangement on the territory of the European Union.
Conununiqué
This report has been drafted in the Czech, English and Slovák languages.
The report was signed by the Chairman of the Supreme Audit Office of the Slovák Republic and President of the Supreme Audit Office, the Czech Republic.
Administration of Value Added Tax in the Czech Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany
Follow-up Audit Report
Foreword
Taxes in general constitute the key source of public revenues.
It therefore goes without saying that Supreme Audit Institutions (hereinafter “SAIs”) should place focus on that audit area.
Value added tax (hereinafter “VAT”) fraud is an example.
It causes an estimated loss of some EUR 100 billion in the European Union (hereinafter “EU”) each year.
Already in 2005 during the VI. EUROSAI Congress in Bonn the participants outlined the need for working together very closely.
In so doing the SAIs would be able to share audit approaches etc. and find out best practices.
VAT is an audit area which is very suitable for tax audit cooperation because it is the only tax harmonised within the EU.
The Supreme Audit Office of the Czech Republic (hereinafter “Czech SAI”) and the Federal Court of Auditors - Bundesrechnungshof (hereinafter “German SAI”) conducted a first ever parallel audit in the field of VAT in 2006.
The report was published in 2008.
As it is known that VAT fraud is a phenomenon not limited to a single country but spread throughout the EU close cooperation amongst the SAIs is needed to ensure comprehensive evaluation of the steps taken to address this problem.
The two SAIs decided therefore to pursue their cooperative efforts in this field and conducted a second parallel audit.
1. Introduction
Audit number: (CZ) 09/11 (D) VIII 2 - 2009 - 0892
Subject of audit: (CZ) Administration of value added tax (D) Bilateral audit with the NKÚ (follow-up audit)
Objective of audit:
(CZ) The audit objective was to review the procedure used by financial authorities in administrating VAT and the procedure used to address selected cases of business transactions between the Czech Republic and Federal Republic of Germany (hereinafter “Germany”) and to review the procedures used by the tax administrations of the two countries as part of international cooperation.
(D) On the one hand, the audit was designed to evaluate the steps taken by the tax administration to implement the recommendations made by the SAIs.
On the other hand, other fields linked with VAT were to be covered.
The resulting audit findings were to be compared and best practices identified (if any).
The audit period covered the years 2006 through 2008 including relevant information dating from the time preceding the audit up to the time of audit conclusion.
2. Summary of findings and evaluation of parallel audits
The follow-up audit of the administration of VAT in the Czech Republic and in Germany was carried out on the basis of an agreement between the two SAIs.
During previous parallel audits, suspicious cases of intra-Community transactions were detected.
Some of them merited further review.
On the basis of audit findings the two SAIs produced recommendations on VAT management.
The follow-up audit was conducted to evaluate the action taken in response to these recommendations and to review the suspicious cases selected.
The audit also covered other topics such as the selected cases of high risk intra-Community transactions, mutual assistance for the recovery of claims and the VAT audit of large tax entities.
When auditing VAT administration in selected areas in the two countries, auditors developed the following audit findings:
1. Recommendations from the previous audit
• Recommendation 1: Conditions for registration of taxpayers should be harmonised within the EU
By comparing the systems of registration for VAT in the two countries auditors found discrepancies in the previous parallel audits.
Since the different ways of registration caused problems, the SAIs recommended harmonising the conditions for registration of taxpayers within the EU.
This issue was taken up at EU level.
The draft of the amended Council (EC) Regulation No. 1798/2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No. 218/92 (hereinafter the “Council (EC) Regulation No. 1798/2003”) had proposed to expand the current databases within EU, including a database of the tax identification numbers of the VAT payers.
It also provided for common standards for registration and deregistration of taxpayers.
The SAIs expected Member States to agree on adequate standards supporting their decision to keep unreliable traders as early as possible out of the VAT system.
However, the latest version of this document being subject of political agreement among Member States within ECOFIN does no longer cover those issues mentioned before.
The two SAIs regret, that the idea of common minimum standards has been abandoned.
They still consider this idea relevant to combat VAT fraud preventively.
• Recommendation 2: Monthly submission of recapitulative statements
As part of international cooperation, the previous audit recommended that all Member States introduce the monthly submission of recapitulative statements in order to enable earlier reviewing of the values of intra-Community transactions.
Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common VAT system to combat tax evasion associated with intra-Community transactions has reduced the time limit for submission of recapitulative statements of intra-Community transactions to one month.
In the Czech Republic, this issue was implemented by the amended VAT Act effective as of 1 January 2010, in Germany it was implemented as from 1 July 2010.
Germany had not implemented the obligation for submitting recapitulative statements monthly on schedule, whereas the Czech Republic was in line with applicable EU guidelines.
• Recommendation 3: Matching data of VAT returns and recapitulative statements in Germany to reach a higher reliability of VIES data and considering the merger of the two procedures for VAT returns and recapitulative statements
The German tax administration accepted the recommendation of the German SAI and established a working group to explore possible solutions.
The work is still under way and the German SAI will closely monitor further developments.
• Recommendation 4: Sharing good practice criteria, components or approaches of a risk management system at EU-level In earlier audit work, the two SAIs concurred that an effective risk management system could not be developed by one Member State only.
Good practice criteria, components or approaches of a risk management system have to be shared and implemented in each EU Member State.
If not so, fraudsters will choose the Member State with the weakest risk management system.
We found that the two Member States used differing risk management systems that have its strengths and weaknesses.
In this field, the Czech SAI audited the system of exchange of information within EU - EUROCANET and the German SAI focused on German participation in the “Platform on Risk Management”.
2. Follow-up audit of selected intra-Community transaction cases
During the earlier audit, a joint review was performed on business transactions where doubts existed as to their realisation or discrepancies in the method used by the taxpayers of the two countries to report the business transactions in the VAT returns or recapitulative statements.
The two SAIs selected nine cases for the follow-up audit that included intraCommunity movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany.
Inspections carried out by the tax offices of the respective countries had not been finished at the conclusion of our previous joint audit.
The follow-up audit verified that most of the tax proceedings relating to the selected cases of business transactions between the taxpayers into/from the Czech Republic were concluded and adequate measures were taken by the tax administrations in the Czech Republic or in Germany (i. a. additional VAT assessments or prevention of reimbursement of input tax).
3. Audit of selected cases of high-risk intra-Community transactions
We selected high-risk cases of intra-Community transactions made by EU taxpayers presented in EUROCANET.
The EUROCANET system is a tool for the detection of high-risk taxpayers within EU.
The Member States can participate in the system on a facultative basis.
The Czech Republic is an active participant of EUROCANET, whereas Germany has a passive status.
From the point of view of an active participant, it is unsatisfactory that other Member States are opposed to active participation.
Given the fact that the German tax administration took no part in data exchange in the EUROCANET system, no information could be obtained what suppliers with German VAT ID were assessed as high-risk cases.
The Czech SAI found that cases including normal business transactions were identified during the audit as well as cases of suspected involvement in carousel trading and fraudulent activities related to VAT.
The tax administrators have limited possibilities for inspecting high-risk transactions, concerning in particular “missing traders”, while a physical review of the documents alone can hardly serve to prove any fraudulent activity to the tax entity.
The same applies to tax administrators, when import from and export to third countries are additionally combined with intra-Community carousel trading.
In these cases, it would be recommendable to provide for increased mutual cooperation between the customs and tax authorities aimed at identifying goods and irregularities with transportation documents as well as monitoring their physical movements within the EU in direction to the final consumer.
Germany as well as a number of other countries were reluctant to actively join the EUROCANET system due to the nonexistence of a sufficient legal basis.
In Germany, other tools for the detection of risk taxpayers are used that have proven to be suitable for the German tax administration so far.
In this area, there is a need for communication and sharing experiences among all EU Member States.
The EU Council reached political agreement on the draft regulation, which recasts Council (EC) Regulation No. 1798/2003.
Its main innovation is the creation of EUROFISC.
The experiences gathered so far with EUROCANET should become part of the envisaged network for fighting against VAT fraud.
4. Mutual assistance for the recovery of claims
In the area of international assistance for the recovery of claims all EU Member States are governed by the same European legislative arrangements.
Therefore the handling of requests for international assistance for the recovery of claims is the same in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The German and the Czech SAI compared the statistics that the two Member States had sent to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.
The statistics contained inconsistencies.
The SAIs considered it useful to discuss again the statistics at EU level with a view on how to avoid the inconsistencies still persisting.
Otherwise statistics are not reliable and comparable.
Moreover, the SAIs are of the opinion that reliable statistics should contain more information concerning VAT.
It may be useful for the Commission to provide for an analysis - based on more detailed statistics - to help Member States to enhance effectiveness in combating VAT fraud.
The two SAIs consider it helpful for Member States with a low rate to increase their efforts to reach at least the average recovery rate of the EU.
If a Member State so desires, the Commission should take an active part in this process.
5. VAT audit of large tax entities
The SAIs analysed the legal situation concerning the VAT audit of large tax entities in the two countries.
Additionally, they gathered information from the tax administrations in a questionnaire concerning areas that they considered essential for managing this issue.
Based on the replies received, it has become obvious that the situation in the two countries is diverging.
The Czech Republic has a system for steering the selection of risk prone cases which is based on a large number of relevant data (i. a. information from conducted VAT audits, data from the balance sheets and profit and loss accounts etc.).
This ensures an effective management and analysis of VAT control in general.
The establishment of a specialised tax office for the administration of large tax entities is planned for 2012.
In Germany, a similar system does not yet exist which makes it more difficult to manage and analyse VAT control in general.
Germany is still more focused on the selection of respective individual cases especially based on data from VAT returns and recapitulative statements.
The analysis of those data is supported by different risk management components which are going to be enhanced.
3. Audit procedure
3.1 Audit procedure in the Czech Republic
The audit was performed in the period from May 2009 to February 2010 by Division II - Department of State Budget Incomes and by the territorial departments IX Pilsen, X České Budějovice, XIII Brno and XV Ostrava.
The audited entities were: the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic (hereinafter ”Czech Ministry of Finance”) and 25 tax offices: tax office Brno II, tax office Brno III, tax office Brno IV, tax office in Břeclav, tax office in Domažlice, tax office in Hodonín, tax office in Hradec Králové, tax office in Cheb, tax office in Jablonec nad Nisou, tax office in Karlovy Vary, tax office in Kralupy nad Vltavou, tax office in Kraslice, tax office Ostrava I, tax office Ostrava III, tax office in Písek, tax office in Pilsen, tax office for Prague 1, tax office for Prague 4, tax office for Prague 8, tax office in Rakovník, tax office in Sokolov, tax office in Tábor, tax office in Vysoké Mýto, tax office in Zlín and tax office in Žamberk.
The board of the Czech SAI approved the audit conclusions on 27 April 2010.
3.2 Audit procedure in Germany
The audit was conducted from February 2009 to February 2010 by the audit unit for indirect taxes and staff of the assigned regional audit offices in Berlin, Frankfurt/Main and Munich.
After selecting the case examples a number of federal states were notified of the audit mission.
Apart from interviews at the Federal Ministry of Finance, the audit took place in the following federal states: • Bavaria, • Hamburg, • Hesse, • North Rhine-Westphalia, • Saxony.
Tax files of the following tax offices were included: • Erlangen, Zentralfinanzamt München, Hof, Schwandorf, Regensburg, Weiden in der Oberpfalz, Grafenau; • Hamburg-Nord, Hamburg-Hansa, Hamburg für Großunternehmen; • Wiesbaden I, Wiesbaden II, Darmstadt; • Essen-NordOst, Essen für Groß- und Konzernbetriebsprüfung, Lüdenscheid; • Chemnitz-Süd. • Wiesbaden I, Wiesbaden II, Darmstadt; • Essen-NordOst (Essen-severovýchod), Essen für Groß- und Konzernbetriebsprüfung (Essen - kontrolní úřad pro VDS a koncerny), Lüdenscheid; • Chemnitz-Süd (Chemnitz-jih).
Additionally, discussions were held with the tax offices Muhlacker, Reutlingen, Starnberg, Verden, Erfurt, Leipzig, Halle-Sud and with the financial directorates in Frankfurt/Main, Chemnitz and Muenster.
The audit findings were reported to the Federal Ministry of Finance in April 2010.
3.3 Cooperation of the two Supreme Audit Institutions
To prepare for the parallel audits, representatives of the two audit institutions met in September 2008, to discuss and determine the audit topics.
After that in December 2008, the two SAI heads signed the agreement on cooperation in conducting the parallel audit.
At a meeting held in Bonn in June 2009, the audit teams informed each other on initial results developed during the preparation of the audit, discussed possible audit approaches and agreed upon further action.
A second meeting was held in Prague from 2 to 4 December 2009.
The audit teams shared the findings gathered by then and agreed upon the timetable for preparing the joint report.
The two SAIs decided to examine the following matters in their parallel audit mission: • follow-up on the implementation of the recommendations made in the previous report, • review of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between taxpayers from the Czech Republic and Germany that were not resolved during the previous parallel audit, • review of selected cases of intra-Community transactions between taxpayers from the Czech Republic and Germany that were classified as high-risk cases, • audit of the tax administrations' procedure in the field of international assistance for the recovery of VAT claims, • VAT audits of large companies.
The report on the results of the parallel audits was drawn up during the working meeting in June 2010.
4. Audit of administration of VAT in selected areas
4.1 Evaluation of recommendations from the previous audit
4.1.1 Evaluation of the recommendations in the Czech Republic
Recommendation 1
Conditions for registration of taxpayers should be harmonised within the EU
Based on the the previous audit results, the Czech SAI recommended adjusting the requirements of VAT payer registration and introducing new rules for cancelling the VAT payer registration in the Czech Republic.
The adjusted requirements should more effectively reduce the risk of potential VAT evasions.
In certain cases, it was found out that tax offices failed to apply their authorisation to cancel the VAT registration for the VAT payers who failed to fulfil their obligations arising from Act No. 235/2004 Coll., on value added tax (hereinafter „VAT Act“).
So far, the Czech Ministry of Finance has not drafted any amended provisions to introduce an obligation for the tax administrators to cancel the registration for a VAT payer in the event of a repeated failure to submit a VAT return.
According to the VAT Act the tax administrator can cancel the registration of a tax payer “ex officio”, if: a) The taxpayer did not perform any transactions without notification of the reason for this to the tax administrator for a period of 12 consecutive months, b) The taxpayer failed to fulfil his/her obligations pursuant to the VAT Act, c) The taxpayer ceases to be a person obliged to pay taxes.
As revealed by the previous audit, the current legislation enabled the tax office for Prague 1 to cancel the VAT registration as at 31 January of the following calendar year of the “nonresident taxpayers” who incurred no liability during the current calendar year to report and pay tax.
The tax office for Prague 1 frequently did not cancel VAT registrations for those taxpayers, since the respective provision did not lay down a sufficient time limit for cancelling the registration.
The problem was remedied by the amended VAT Act effective from 1 January 2009.
The tax administrator is authorised to cancel the registration of a non-resident tax payer, if he has found out that this tax payer has not supplied any taxable goods or services or tax exempt goods and services with a claim to deduct input VAT in the previous calendar year.
Recommendation 2
Monthly submission of recapitulative statements
As part of international cooperation, the previous audit recommended introducing monthly submissions of recapitulative statements.
The council directive that reduced the period for submissions of recapitulative statements to one month was implemented in the Czech Republic by the VAT Act, which took effect as of 1 January 2010.
A new obligation to submit the recapitulative statements in electronic format was developed.
Taxpayers have to submit their recapitulative statements also in the event of supplies of services, which are subject to determination of their place of transaction under § 9 (1) of VAT Act, to another Member State to a person registered for VAT in another Member State, provided that the recipient is obliged to report and pay VAT on those services.
The foregoing obligation ensues from Council Directive 2008/8/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC as regards the place of supply of services.
Recommendation 3
Matching data of VAT returns and recapitulative statements to reach a higher reliability of VIES data This recommendation related to the German tax administration.
The Czech administration matches data of intra-Community transactions from VAT returns and recapitulative statements of Czech taxpayers automatically in the system ATIS.
Recommendation 4
Sharing good practice criteria, components or approaches of a risk management system at EU-level
The proper collection of VAT is an indispensable prerequisite for adequate functioning of the EU internal market.
Combating VAT fraud is therefore included among the priority interest areas and has been paid considerable attention to in recent years.
The importance of this fight has been evidenced inter alia by the conclusions of a study published by the European Commission in October 2009, in which an external evaluator attempted to calculate the difference between the due and actually collected VAT amounts in 25 Member States during the period 2000-2006.
Based on an analysis of the available data, the evaluator arrived at the conclusion that the estimated loss amount of uncollected VAT for that period totalled from EUR 90 to 113 billion, while EU-25 fails to collect 12 % of due VAT on average each year.
The loss incurred on VAT by the Czech Republic in 2006 was estimated even at 18 %.
The previous audit noted, as part of international cooperation, that an effective risk management system cannot be developed by one Member State only.
Successful criteria, components or approaches of a risk management system have to be exchanged and implemented in each Member State of the EU.
Concerning the risk management system the Czech SAI audited the system of exchange of information within EU -EUROCANET.
Cases of risky intra-Community transactions carried out by taxpayers from EU presented in EUROCANET were selected for the audit (see chapter 4.3).
The objectives of improved administrative cooperation and enhanced effectiveness of combating VAT fraud should be achieved also through establishing the EUROFISC network, meant to assist improving cooperation of the responsible authorities to a level enabling disclosure of fraud already at an early stage.
Later on, the network should become a resource for assessing risk exposures in intra-Community transactions.
ECOFIN approved establishment of the EUROFISC network already on 7 October 20089 and stipulated the key principles to govern the network at the same time.
A model for EUROFISC can be seen in EUROCANET, the system already operative for the swift and selective exchange of information developed by the Belgian tax authorities in cooperation with the other Member States and with support from the European Commission and OLAF.
The objective of the system is to detect risky business transactions and entities involved in organised VAT fraud.
4.1.2 Evaluation of the recommendations in Germany
The evaluation of the recommendations of the first report resulted in the following findings:
Recommendation 1
Conditions for registration of taxpayers should be harmonised within the EU
The tax administration in Germany established a well functioning system for the registration of taxpayers that is based on a detailed questionnaire.
The Federal Ministry of Finance brought this system to the attention of the Commission in October 2007.
The system itself is being improved continuously.
The data of the questionnaire are now being recorded electronically and will subsequently be available for research so that the data are part of risk management during registration.
The Commission made a proposal to amend Regulation 1798/2003. This proposal included common standards for the registration and deregistration of taxpayers.
The Member States needed further explanation and detailed elaboration of these issues.
The German SAI requested the Federal Ministry of Finance to make sure that Germany will not go below the standards achieved.
Recommendation 2
Monthly submission of recapitulative statements
On April 8, 2010 a law was adopted for the implementation of EU directives into national law.
The law includes provisions regarding the monthly submission of recapitulative statements for intra-Community supplies.
The provisions take effect as of 1 July 2010.
Recommendation 3
Matching data of VAT returns and recapitulative statements to reach a higher reliability of VIES data and in this context considering the merger of the two procedures for VAT returns and recapitulative statements
A joint working group with staff from the federal states and the Federal Ministry of Finance had been established.
The group elaborated a strategy for the automatic matching of data from VAT returns and recapitulative statements.
The strategy is still under discussion with the federal states.
Additionally, this working group also dealt with a tool to optimise the control procedure for the internal market transactions.
Recommendation 4
Sharing of good practice criteria, components or approaches of a risk management system at EU-level Relevant information is exchanged at EU level.
Germany takes part in this exchange at “Platform on Risk Management”.
The European Commission supported the idea of such a platform and following a written consultation of 18 October 2006, the establishment of the platform on risk management was added to the Fiscalis 2006-2007 Action Plan.
The members of the platform split into sub-groups which dealt with topics such as: • Risk tools, • Influencing behaviour, • Evaluation, • Updating the risk management guide.
New reports of the sub-groups were published at the beginning of 2010.
4.1.3 Evaluation
Registration
The issue of requirements for registering and cancelling a VAT registration in different countries was addressed at EU level.
The draft of the amended Council Regulation No. 1798/2003 had proposed to expand the current databases within EU, including a database of the tax identification numbers of VAT payers.
It also provided for common minimum standards for the registration and deregistration of taxpayers.
The issues of registration and cancellation of registration have been so far left to the national legislations of the EU Member States.
The Member States needed further explanation and detailed elaboration of these issues.
The German SAI requested the Federal Ministry of Finance to make sure that Germany has not to go below the standards already achieved.
On 8 June 2010 the ECOFIN reached political agreement on the above-mentioned draft regulation.
The idea of common minimum standards has been abandoned.
Member States have to implement national procedures and only have to inform the Committee on Administrative Cooperation of these procedures.
The SAIs regret that the Commission did not succeed in convincing Member States of the necessity of common standards for registration and deregistration of taxpayers as they consider this an important element in the preventive fight against VAT fraud.
They therefore would appreciate further efforts of the Commission in this direction.
Monthly submission of recapitulative statements
As part of international cooperation, the previous audit recommended that all Member States introduce the monthly submission of recapitulative statements in order to enable earlier reviewing of the amounts of the intraCommunity transactions.
Council Directive 2008/117/EC amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax to combat tax evasion connected with intra-Community transactions has reduced the interval for submission of recapitulative statements on intra-Community transactions to one month.
In the Czech Republic, this issue was implemented by the amended VAT Act effective 1 January 2010. In Germany it was implemented as of 1 July 2010.
Germany had not implemented the obligation for submitting monthly recapitulative statements on schedule, whereas the Czech Republic was in line with the EU directives.
Matching data of VAT returns and recapitulative statements in Germany to reach a higher reliability of VIES data and in this context considering the merger of the two procedures for VAT returns and recapitulative statements
The German tax administration accepted the recommendation of the German SAI and established a working group to explore possible solutions.
The work is still under way and the German SAI will closely monitor further developments.
Sharing of good practice criteria, components or approaches of a risk management system at EU-level
Germany and the Czech Republic use different risk management system approaches to identify risk-prone traders.
The Czech SAI audited the system of information exchange within EU - EUROCANET (see chapter 4. 3).
In this field the German SAI focused on German participation in the Platform on Risk Management.
4.2 Follow-up audit of selected intraCommunity transaction cases
During the previous audit, a joint review of business transactions was performed where doubts existed as to their realisation or discrepancies in the method used by the taxpayers of the two countries to report the business transactions in the VAT returns or recapitulative statements.
The two audit institutions selected nine cases for the follow-up audit that include intra-Community movement of goods between the Czech Republic and Germany, the audit of which carried out by the tax offices of respective countries had not been finished at the time of our previous joint audit.
1)
A Czech taxpayer acquired goods at the value of EUR 22,686 from a German taxpayer in the 1st quarter of 2005.
The Czech taxpayer did not declare the acquisition of the goods in his VAT return as the German taxpayer had no VAT ID assigned in the said period, only a tax number intended for domestic transactions in Germany.
Based on international administrative cooperation in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003, the Czech tax administrator received information that a taxpayer supplying goods to other Member States was not required by the German VAT Act to be assigned a VAT ID ensuring that intra-Community supplies of goods are exempt from VAT.
A follow-up audit by the Czech SAI revealed that based on an audit carried out by the Czech tax administrator, the Czech taxpayer submitted an additional VAT return, in which he declared the goods acquisition in the above amount and simultaneously exercised the right to a tax deduction in the same amount in the VAT return.
2)
A Czech taxpayer allegedly acquired goods worth of EUR 12,561 from a German taxpayer in the 4th quarter of 2004.
The Czech taxpayer stated he did not acquire the goods and he did not declare it in his VAT return.
The German tax administration refused cooperation upon request, invoking Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003 as the turnover on the transactions did not exceed the value of EUR 15,000.
As the Czech tax administrator did not obtain any evidence, he concluded his audit without any findings and the tax liability remained assessed at the original amount.
A follow-up audit by the Czech SAI revealed that the Czech tax administrator received two pieces of spontaneous information from Germany in accordance with the Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003, showing that the German taxpayer billed the said goods to Slovakia.
The Czech taxpayer acquired the goods from the Slovak taxpayer and stated the acquisition in his regular VAT return for the month of October 2004.
3)
A Czech taxpayer allegedly acquired a passenger car worth EUR 48,500 from a German taxpayer in the 4th quarter of 2004.
The Czech taxpayer did not declare the acquisition of the goods.
The same taxpayer did not submit any VAT returns as from August 2004. Therefore the tax administrator assessed VAT at CZK 0 for the said quarter.
Based on information obtained from Germany under international exchange of information according to Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003, the tax administrator called upon the taxpayer in March 2007 to submit an additional VAT return, which the taxpayer however failed to do.
A follow-up audit revealed that the tax administrator performed further acts in the tax proceedings in 2007 that showed that the respective passenger car was sold by the taxpayer to a secondhand car dealer in the Czech Republic.
The Czech tax administrator issued a tax assessment for the taxation period of December 2004 VAT on the acquisition of goods from another Member State and on their resale was additionally assessed in the amount of CZK 295,379.
Based on the ruling of a Regional Court, the Czech taxpayer was dissolved with liquidation and a liquidator was appointed.
In the absence of any sizable assets of the tax debtor, the above arrears appear uncollectible.
4)
A Czech taxpayer allegedly supplied new means of transport (passenger cars) to Germany in the total value of EUR 198,167 in the 4th quarter of 2004 and in the 1st quarter of 2005.
The response to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003 indicated that there have been criminal proceedings for a tax offence pending against the German entity in Germany.
A follow-up audit of the German SAI revealed that proof was obtained after conclusion of the tax proceedings in Germany to the effect that the German taxpayer was involved in fraudulent activities.
The intra-Community acquisition of the goods was taxed at EUR 182,424 (for 2004) and EUR 369,690 (for 2005).
A follow-up audit of the Czech SAI established that the Czech taxpayer was involved in carousel trading in new means of transport.
Based on information obtained from the German tax administration with regard to a review of the supply of goods, a VAT audit of the Czech tax entity was commenced for the taxation periods of April, May and June 2005.
Based on the audit findings and information obtained from international exchange of information, the tax administrator assessed additional VAT of CZK 703,031 for May 2005 and of CZK 726,551 for June 2005.
5)
Czech taxpayer A allegedly acquired a machine in the total value of EUR 58,000 from a German taxpayer in February 2005.
The foregoing German taxpayer allegedly supplied a machine at the value of EUR 88,027 to Czech taxpayer B in the 3rd quarter of 2004, while taxpayer B denied the acquisition.
A follow-up audit of the Czech SAI revealed that taxpayer B acquired the machine from a German company that had an organisational unit established in the Czech Republic.
Czech taxpayer A did not declare the acquisition of the goods from the German taxpayer in his VAT return.
The response by the German tax administrator to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003 indicated that the German taxpayer did not perform any intra-Community supply of a machine in the value of EUR 58,000 but performed a supply of goods within the Czech Republic.
A follow-up audit of the German SAI revealed that, subsequent to a completed tax audit, the intra-Community supply of the machine was reclassified as a domestic supply of the machine and the VAT exemption was cancelled.
6)
A German taxpayer allegedly supplied goods in the value of EUR 11,600 to a Czech taxpayer in the 3rd quarter of 2004.
The goods were purchased and subsequently sold in Germany in 2005.
A follow-up audit of the Czech SAI revealed that the Czech tax administrator assessed an additionally submitted VAT return that contained an unauthorised declaration of acquisition of goods from another Member State that included also the acquisition of the goods in the above value.
The German SAI found out that the German tax administrator, upon receipt of a response to a request for information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003, corrected the German taxpayer's VAT return and additionally assessed VAT of EUR 1,600.
Further movements of the goods in Germany and application of VAT in Germany are subject of a tax audit.
The German taxpayer's recapitulative statement has not been corrected as yet as any recapitulative statement adjustments may be carried out only by the taxpayer who has submitted the recapitulative statement.
7)
The Czech tax administrator received a request for information from the German tax administration in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003, inquiring whether or not a Czech taxpayer acquired a passenger car in the value of EUR 47,400 from a German taxpayer in February 2005.
After conduct of an audit for the taxation period of February 2005, the Czech tax administrator assessed the tax liability at CZK 0 for the Czech taxpayer and notified the German tax administrator that he was unable to confirm the car acquisition by the Czech taxpayer.
A follow-up audit of the Czech SAI revealed that the registration of the Czech VAT payer was cancelled in 2007 on grounds of non-compliance with obligations and the Czech tax administrator referred the supporting documents to the Czech Police.
A follow-up audit by the German SAI revealed that the German taxpayer moved his registered office and that, based on a performed audit the new competent local tax administrator cancelled the VAT exemption for the supply of the said car to the Czech taxpayer.
The German taxpayer has not so far corrected the data in his recapitulative statement and he has filed an appeal against the tax administrator's decision.
8)
According to the data in the VIES system, a German taxpayer supplied goods in the total value of EUR 33,205 to a Czech taxpayer in the period from the 3rd quarter 2004 to 1st quarter 2005.
A follow-up audit of the Czech SAI revealed that the Czech tax administrator was investigating the reasons of the differences that occurred with the Czech taxpayer at the acquisition of the goods during the period from the 3rd quarter 2004 to 1st quarter 2005.
The Czech taxpayer repeatedly submitted an additional VAT return for the 1st quarter of 2005.
The Czech tax administrator did not explain the difference in the value of the acquired goods of CZK 134,273 during the period from the 3rd quarter 2004 to 1st quarter 2005 because, according to the Czech tax administrator, business transactions for separate quarters could not be precisely traced and the tax administrator therefore accepted the submitted VAT returns.
9)
A German taxpayer supplied goods worth EUR 46,854 to a Czech taxpayer in the 3rd quarter of 2004.
For the same period, the Czech taxpayer declared an intra-Community acquisition of goods only in the value of EUR 14,856.
The Czech tax administrator reviewed the amount of the performed supplies as part of international exchange of information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003.
Attached to the response to the request for information delivered from Germany were three invoices stating the total value of the goods supply at EUR 31,998, which is an amount corresponding to the difference of the acquisition declared by the Czech taxpayer in the VAT return and VIES system data.
A follow-up audit by the Czech SAI revealed that the Czech taxpayer, following repeated reminders by the tax administrator, submitted an additional VAT return in January 2007 for the taxation period of July 2004.
In the said VAT return, the taxpayer at the same time exercised his VAT deduction right and the tax liability for the respective taxation period remained unchanged as a result of that.
The follow-up audit verified that most of the tax proceedings relating to the selected cases of business transactions between the taxpayers in Germany and the Czech Republic were concluded and adequate measures were taken by the tax administrations in the Czech Republic or in Germany (i. a. additional VAT assessments or prevention of reimbursement of input tax).
4.3 Audit of selected cases of high-risk intra-Community transactions
4.3.1 Audit findings in the Czech Republic
EUROCANET can be a major source of information for detecting risky entities within a Member State where the goods were acquired.
In the Czech Republic, the early-warning information obtained from the EUROCANET system is compared with the acquirers' data by the competent local tax offices.
Since the 1st quarter of 2008, the Czech Republic has been sending information to the EUROCANET system on risky transactions and tax entities acting as suppliers.
Nine Czech tax entities being part of the EUROCANET were selected for the audit.
They acted either as supplier to or as acquirer from the tax entities.
Relevant data was captured in the EUROCANET system by the tax administrations of other Member States.
Given the fact that the German tax administration took no part in data exchange in the EUROCANET system, no information could be obtained with the help of it whether or not suppliers with a German VAT ID have been assessed as risky entities by the German tax administration.
The audit revealed cases which included normal business transactions as well as cases of suspected involvement in carousel trading and other fraudulent activities related to VAT.
In the respective cases, tax administrators share information in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003.
For example:
• The tax administrators did not detect any suspected involvement in risky transactions during the verification of the early-warning information.
Tax offices continuously monitor the tax entity for the reason of being involved in the EUROCANET system.
• The tax offices did not succeed in proving deviations from the rules for calculating the tax base and VAT from the presented accounting records during the verification of risky transaction, even though tax offices found out discrepancies in transportation and warehousing of goods or detected business relationships with suspicious and non-contactable companies from the other Member States.
• The verification of business transactions was complicated, because certain taxpayers did not cooperate with the tax administrator and could not be contacted.
Competent local tax offices mostly reviewed the risky tax entities and risky transactions set out in early-warning information from the EUROCANET system.
The tax administrators have only limited possibilities to review risky transactions concerning particularly those of so-called “missing traders”, because an inspection of the documents alone can hardly serve to prove any fraudulent activity of the tax entity.
Stricter requirements for registering taxpayers for VAT and more flexible cancellations of the registration would assist in reducing missing trader fraud.
On behalf of the tax entities involved in carousel trading and other fraudulent activities, registrations for VAT are made for the purpose of reporting EU-wide fictitious supplies of goods or issuing formally accurate tax documents to the taxpayers who then make unauthorised deductions of input VAT.
In case of suspicion that tax entities are involved in carousel trading and other fraudulent activities in connection with imports from and exports to third countries, it would be recommendable to provide for increased mutual cooperation between the customs and tax authorities.
This would help to identify goods and irregularities with transportation documents as well as monitor their physical movements within the EU in direction to the final consumer.
The Member States can participate in the system on an optional basis.
The fact that three large Member States (Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) did not participate in the operation of the EUROCANET system was considered as a weakness of the system by the European Parliament at the end of 200814, which should be remedied by establishing a compulsory EUROFISC network.
4.3.2 Audit findings in Germany
The German SAI analysed data available in the Federal Central Tax Office with EUROCANET data included.
These data served as basis to select six German taxpayers' files for review.
Germany as well as some other countries refused to actively join EUROCANET.
Therefore, Germany has a passive status which means that it does not send data to Brussels but is only a recipient of EUROCANET data.
The justification for doing so is that “in the view of the government it is legally not allowed that state (governmental) institutions submit data to EUROCANET.
Currently there is no legal basis in place that would permit to break applicable tax secrecy provisions.
Additionally, the government has no reliable information on how those data are used within EUROCANET by the other Member States.”15 Since October 2007, the Federal Central Tax Office has analysed the EUROCANET data and has submitted them to the tax authorities of the federal states according to a procedure agreed between them.
The German tax offices receive control information about the direct business relations of a taxpayer registered in the specific tax office with a trader from another EU Member State which was entered into EUROCANET.
However, the German tax office does not receive any information on whether the trader of the aforementioned other EU Member State had risky business relations with traders in other Member States which also did business with the respective German trader.
4.3.3 Evaluation
The Czech Republic is an active participant of EUROCANET, whereas Germany has a passive status.
From the point of view of an active participant it is unsatisfactory that other Member States refuse to become an active member.
Consequently, the audit in this field had to be conducted in different ways.
Nevertheless, the results did not reveal great differences with regard to detecting VAT fraud cases. The reason for this is that EUROCANET is only one tool in a risk management system.
The tax administrations of both countries have a number of other tools to detect fraudulent transactions, but it is necessary to create a comprehensive risk management system within the EU.
The Council of the EU reached political agreement on a draft regulation whose main innovation is the creation of EUROFISC.
The experiences gathered so far with EUROCANET should become part of the envisaged network for fighting VAT fraud.
Member States should therefore communicate their experiences at European level.
On the other hand, the cases brought before courts of law nationally and at European level revealed that a discussion between the Member States and the Commission about the conditions for the tax exemption of intra-Community transactions seems to be necessary.
4.4 Mutual assistance for the recovery of claims
4.4.1 International assistance for the recovery of claims in the Czech Republic
The core legislation on international cooperation in recovery of certain financial claims within the EU comprises the following directives without limitation:
• Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims resulting from operations forming part of the system of financing the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, and on the agricultural levies and custom duties;
• Council Directive 2001/44/EC amending Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims resulting from operations forming part of the system of financing the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, and on the agricultural levies and customs duties and in respect of value added tax and certain excise duties;
• Commission Directive 2002/94/EC laying down detailed rules for implementing certain provisions of Council Directive 76/308/EEC on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to certain levies, duties, taxes and other measures.
Council Directive 76/308/EEC was implemented in the Czech Republic by Act No. 252/2000 Coll., on international assistance for the recovery of certain financial claims.
Following adoption of Council Directive 2001/44/EC, the Directive had to be implemented into the Czech system of law and the foregoing act had to be amended at the same time.
New Act No. 191/2004 Coll., on international assistance for the recovery of certain financial claims (hereinafter “Act No. 191/2004 Coll.”), was adopted in this connection.
A new relevant legal provision has recently been put into place by Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1179/2008 of 28 November 2008.
Annexes to the Regulation set out new models of the application forms in use as from 1 January 2009, and the Regulation newly stipulated the obligation of electronic communication and obligation of the applicant authority to certify the conformity of any sent documents with their originals.
Key principles of providing international cooperation in recovery of claims are:
1. reciprocita (vzájemnost);
2. assistance is always provided only upon request and where all requirements are fulfilled;
3. assistance shall not include any financial claims that are described as a sanction of a criminal nature in the requested state;
4. the procedure at providing international assistance for the recovery of claims must abide by the national laws of the requested state;
5. foreign claims shall have no priority over domestic claims in the recovery process;
6. assistance is provided only to recover indisputable claims;
7. exhaustion principle: the applicant state has exhausted all available means of recovery of the claim enabled by its system of law.
Act No. 191/2004 Coll., specifies three forms of giving assistance: provision of information; delivery of instruments; and recovery of claims in particular.
Procedure of sending requests for recovery to other EU Member States
A competent local tax office shall electronically transfer the request for information, request for notification or request for recovery of claims together with respective documents, to the Czech Ministry of Finance through the financial directorates.
The Czech Ministry of Finance shall provide for translating the request into the respective language, shall scan it including its attachments and, through the CCN/CSI network, and shall send it to the respective tax administration authority of the specified state.
Two basic requirements have been imposed with respect to the recovery - the claim shall exceed EUR 1,500 and shall not be older than 5 years.
The requested authority may refuse the claim recovery, if the requirements have not been met.
Procedure of receiving requests for recovery from other EU Member States
Where requests from another Member State are received, the Czech Ministry of Finance must forthwith acknowledge receipt of the request as soon as possible upon receiving it, however within seven days at the latest.
If the Czech Ministry of Finance decides it is not going to admit the request, it shall notify the applicant authority of the reasons for rejecting the request and shall set out concrete provisions of the Directive which it relies on.
Such notification should be sent no later than within three months of the date of acknowledgement of the receipt of the request.
Upon receipt of the request, the Czech Ministry of Finance shall verify if the request meets all legal requirements. After that, the Czech Ministry of Finance shall transfer the request through a financial directorate to the competent local tax office for processing.
In the event the request for recovery is accepted, the tax administrator shall i. a. identify the debtor's assets, e. g. through the extracts from the Cadastre of Real Estate, identification of bank accounts, registrations of motor vehicles with the Traffic Inspectorate etc.
When six months have elapsed from the date of the request receipt acknowledgement, the Czech Ministry of Finance should notify the applicant authority of the outcome of the investigation that has been undertaken in order to obtain the requested information.
The applicant authority should also be informed in the event that the tax entities in question cannot be contacted and the claim can therefore not be recovered.
Any amount successfully recovered by the tax administrator shall be transferred to the applicant authority within one month from the date on which such claim was recovered.
The Czech tax administrator making efforts to recover foreign claims may use an option to allow a moratorium on the payment of the claim or its payment by instalments, providing the applicant state gives its consent to that.
The interest or penalty charge is assessed to the debtor for the recovery period in accordance with Act No. 337/1992 Coll., on administration of taxes and fees.
Such interest or penal charges shall pertain to the state that has requested the recovery.
Concerning received requests for recovery, the Czech Ministry of Finance did not submit the requests to the competent tax administrators in time, particularly during 2006 and 2007.
A similar situation was identified with respect to the requests for international assistance for the recovery of the claims received from the tax administrators in the Czech Republic.
The audit revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance did not proceed in accordance with the Act on the international assistance for the recovery of claims because it failed to notify a competent authority of the Member State of the progress made with the recovery within the six months time period from the day when the receipt of the request was acknowledged.
The situation has improved since 2008.
Statistical data
The Czech Ministry of Finance prepares statistical data for the European Commission in accordance with § 13 (4) of Act No. 191/2004 Coll., by 15 March each year, setting out the number of information, notification and recovery requests sent and/or received in the previous year, the amount of the claims involved and the amounts recovered according to the year of request to which they relate.
Based on the supporting data provided by all Member States, the European Commission reports the Council and the European Parliament on the use of the provisions on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims.
The audit revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance understated its statistical data by EUR 5,250,000 due to an error in the item of claims recovered in 2008, as a result of an incorrectly stated amount of the VAT claim subject to recovery (the error consisted in a shifted decimal marker when translating the CZK amount of the claims into its EUR equivalent).
The error subsequently was reflected in the European Commission statistics.
Information on the mutual assistance with recoveries is set out in the table below.
4.4.2 International assistance for the recovery of claims in Germany
The legal authority for international administrative assistance in tax matters derives from European Community law, Council Directive 2008/55/EC of 26 May 2008 (EC Recovery Directive) and Commission Regulation of 28 November 2008 (EC implementing Directive).
For the sake of better readability and clarity, the EC Recovery Directive codifies Council Directive 76/308/EEC of 15 March 197619, whose provisions have been amended substantially several times.
The provisions apply i. a. to the recovery of VAT and of taxes on income and capital including the related interest charges and penalties.
The EC Recovery Directive was transposed into domestic German law by the Collection of State Taxes (EC) Act of 3 May 2003.
The enforcement procedure in Germany is governed by the German Fiscal Code.
Article 117.2 of the Code points out, that tax authorities may provide international judicial and administrative assistance by virtue of international treaties and legal instruments of the European Communities that are applicable within the national jurisdiction and of the EC Administrative Assistance Act.
Part six of the German Fiscal Code (Articles 249-346), embodies the legal provisions governing enforcement procedure.
The administrative operations of the tax authorities are governed especially by the Execution Instruction and the Enforcement Instruction.
The Federal Ministry of Finance reached agreement with the representatives of the supreme tax authorities of the federal states (Laender) on the principles of administrative assistance with tax assessment and transferred its own responsibility in this matter to the Federal Central Tax Office.
General preconditions for submitting requests for recovery are:
• Legal prerequisites have to be fulfilled (§§ 251, 254 German Fiscal Code (AO)).
• All available domestic means of recovery have been exhausted.
• The claims for which recovery assistance is requested have to be definitive.
• The period between the issuing of the enforcement order or the date when the claim becomes final (is no longer subject to appeal) and the date of the request may not exceed 5 years.
• The total amount of the claim shall exceed EUR 1,500.
Procedure of sending requests for recovery to other EU Member States
German requests for recovery of delinquent tax liabilities are sent from the execution units of the tax offices to the relevant foreign authority as for instance the Czech CLO via the intermediate authority and the Federal Central Tax Office.
Details are governed by the Guidance on International Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (Recovery) of 19 January 2004.23 This Guidance is currently being revised by a Federal Government/Laender working group and adapted to the new Recovery Directive.
The request together with the attachments is submitted electronically by the tax office to the intermediate authority.
This authority checks whether it is correct in terms of content and form.
If not, the request is returned to the respective tax office.
Otherwise the request is submitted to the Federal Central Tax Office.
The Federal Central Tax Office will then provide for the necessary communication with the respective foreign authority, including the translation of the request.
Procedure of receiving requests for recovery from other EU Member States
Requests for recovery received from other Member States are being registered in the Federal Central Tax Office and an acknowledgement of receipt is sent out within 10 days.
Additionally, the Federal Central Tax Office checks whether the formal requirements are met.
In principle the Federal Central Tax Office submits these requests to the intermediate authority, which in turn submits them to the respective tax office and monitors execution.
The Federal Central Tax Office also sends interim and/or final reports.
If the handling of a request takes more than 6 months, it will remind the intermediate authority of the interim report that is required according to the article 16 of Commission Directive 2002/94/EG.
After having checked the formal and factual preconditions of a request, the execution units announce enforcement measures.
Any amount recovered has to be transferred to the bank account given in the request within one month after receipt.
Statistical data
Information on the mutual assistance for the recovery of claims between Germany and the Czech Republic for 2006-2008 (as of 31 December 2008).
4.4.3 Audit of recovery requests, case studies
A total of 21 requests for international assistance for the recovery of claims between the Czech Republic and Germany were selected for the audit as part of international cooperation.
A review of ten selected cases revealed, without limitation:
1.
On 20 October 2006, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request from Germany for the recovery of a claim to VAT for the years 2004 and 2005, totalling EUR 3,883 = CZK 109,820, concerning a Czech tax entity.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request for recovery to the tax administrator as late as on 26 February 2008.
In order to secure the claim to be recovered, the Czech tax administrator established a security interest in real estate owned by the Czech tax entity.
Since the pledged property alone was not sufficient to satisfy the total claim to be recovered, payment by instalments of at least CZK 2,000 monthly was agreed with the Czech tax entity.
On 31 August 2009, information on the claim recovery progress was sent to the German tax administration, noting that the claim was partly recovered in the amount of CZK 49,600 through the instalments as of 25 August 2009.
The said amount was remitted to Germany and, on 28 August 2008, another instalment of CZK 3,000 was sent to Germany.
2.
On 7 January 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for recovery of the tax arrears of a Czech tax entity owing in Germany the amount of EUR 180,869 = CZK 4,434,915 of VAT, income tax and interest and fees.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request to the tax administrator as late as on 27 November 2008.
The tax administrator, based on a review of ownership of bank accounts, securities, real estate, motor vehicles and movable assets established that the debtor owned no distrainable assets.
An investigation on site further revealed that the debtor had not been present at his permanent domicile address for more than a year.
His whereabouts in the Czech Republic are unknown.
This notification was received by the Czech Ministry of Finance on 6 April 2009, while the tax administrator sent its response to the German tax administration on 16 April 2009.
3.
The Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for recovery from Germany on 21 November 2007, concerning the tax arrears of a Czech tax entity totalling EUR 3,139 = CZK 84,846 in VAT plus interest and fees.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the recovery request as late as on 6 August 2008, although the Czech Ministry of Finance meanwhile received a notification from Germany on 18 February 2008 that the Czech tax entity already had settled the claim in Germany.
On 9 December 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance notified the tax administrator that this recovery case had been closed because the claim had been paid by the Czech tax entity in Germany.
The said claim, however, was paid also in the Czech Republic under the recovery process and credited to Germany on 27 October 2008.
Given the long time taken by the Czech Ministry of Finance to inform the authorised tax administrator, the claim was paid twice - by the entity itself in Germany and once again through the claim recovery by the Czech tax administrator.
In cooperation with the German SAI, it was ascertained that the recovered amount will be offset against a claim under another recovery request totalling EUR 6,649 and intended for sending to the Czech Republic in September 2008.
With respect to the company in question, the Czech Ministry of Finance records show only a request for claim recovery at EUR 3,139 while the request for recovering the claim of EUR 6,649 was not in the Czech Ministry of Finance records.
4.
On 15 September 2008, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request from Germany for recovery of the tax arrears of a Czech tax entity owing in Germany the amount of EUR 39,957 = CZK 956,654 of income tax and VAT, interest and fees.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request to the Czech tax administrator on 19 December 2008.
On 1 June 2009, a procedure for claim recovery was started; an order for the distraint of the bank accounts in the Czech Republic and for the attachment of wages in the amount of CZK 7,000 was issued.
During the negotiations with the tax administrator, the debtor stated that he disagreed with the amount of the claim and considered it disputable.
According to the Czech tax administrator, the tax entity was previously willing to pay EUR 250 monthly, which was, however, not accepted by the German tax administrator.
The tax entity promised to discuss its application with the German tax administrator, with an aim to reach a changed amount of the claim.
The claim recovery process still continued during the Czech SAI's audit.

On 19 November 2007, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a request for recovery from Germany concerning a Czech tax entity owing the total of EUR 113,444 = CZK 3,116,304 of income tax for 2005 and VAT for the years 2003-2007, interest and fees.
The Czech Ministry of Finance sent the request to tax office for Prague 1, which is authorised to administer taxes of the non-resident tax entities in the Czech Republic, as late as on 14 November 2008, since the competent local tax administrator could not be determined based on the available address of the tax entity.
The tax office obtained information during the performed investigation that the debtor has an income of EUR 4,704 on 19 September 2008, for which the tax office has been however unable to issue an execution order as the request for the claim recovery was transferred to the tax office after that date.
On 26 January 2009, the Czech tax administrator commenced the claim recovery process and issued an execution order to secure the claim against the debtor's cash held in the accounts kept with banks and credit unions.
The claim recovery process still continued during the Czech SAI's audit.

On 4 February 2009, the German tax administrator called upon the debtor to pay the arrears.
In view of considerable drops in the company's turnover in the second half of 2008 and in the first half of 2009 in particular and given the related liquidity situation of the company, the following payments were made to repay the arrears: on 8 April 2009 -EUR 4,600; on 6 May 2009 - EUR 3,000; and, on 16 June 2009 - EUR 2,500.

The Czech Ministry of Finance sent a request for recovery to the German tax administration on 2 October 2008.
On 3 April 2009, the Czech Ministry of Finance received a notification from the German tax administration that the request was returned by the German tax administration.
The German tax administration justified the return by explaining that the property transfer tax did not constitute a tax as per Art. 2(e)(f)(g) and (h) of Directive 2008/55/EC.
The German tax administration further added that Art. 2(g) applied to the claims relating to income tax and taxes on assets.
Accordingly, Art. 3 of Directive 2008/55/EC applies to income and asset taxes not listed in Art. 1(3) in combination with paragraph (4) of Council Directive 77/799/EEC.

As a result, the German tax administration deemed the request for recovery complied with.
4.4.4 Comparison and evaluation
In the area of international assistance for the recovery of claims, all EU Member States are governed by the same European legislative arrangements.
The procedures for handling requests for international assistance with the recovery of claims are similar in the Czech Republic and Germany.
The German and the Czech SAI compared the statistics that the two Member States had sent to the European Commission for the years 2006 to 2008.
The statistics contained inconsistencies.
In its report of 2006, the European Commission recommended that the Member States needed to take greater care in establishing their statistics.
In its report from 2009 the Commission concluded that the discrepancies in the statistics had decreased although the number of requests had increased.
The two SAIs considered it useful to discuss the matter of statistics again at EU level.
Discussion should focus on how to avoid the inconsistencies that still persist. Otherwise statistics are not reliable and comparable.
Moreover the two SAIs are of the opinion that reliable statistics should disclose the annual number of requests as well as the nature of claims concerned (VAT, income tax etc.) and amounts of the claims recovered per Member State.
The two SAIs consider it useful that the Commission provides for a more detailed analysis of the statistics submitted by the Member States, because this may help the Member States to assess their own effectiveness in combating VAT fraud.
As the recovery rate can be calculated per Member State, the two SAIs consider it helpful that Member States with a low rate should increase their efforts to reach at least the average recovery rate of the EU.
If a Member State so desires, the Commission should take an active part in this process.
Concerning the requests for recovery received, the Czech Ministry of Finance submitted the requests to the competent tax administrators with delay in particular during 2006 and 2007.
A similar situation was identified with respect to the requests for international assistance for the recovery of the claims received from the tax administrators in the Czech Republic.
The audit revealed that the Czech Ministry of Finance did not proceed in accordance with the Act No. 191/2004 Coll. for the international assistance for the recovery of claims, because it failed to notify a competent authority of the Member State of the progress of the recovery efforts within the six months time period from the day of acknowledgement of receiving the request.
4.5 VAT audit of large tax entities
4.5.1 VAT audit of large tax entities in the Czech Republic
Všeobecné informace
Správa DPH u VDS byla zajišťována obdobně jako u ostatních daňových subjektů.
The procedure for the large tax entity audit is based on Act No. 337/1992 Coll., on administration of taxes and fees.
The Czech Ministry of Finance defined large tax entities as natural or legal persons founded or established for the purpose of doing business and whose net turnover for the taxation period declared in their individual or corporate income tax return amounted to CZK 2 bn and more.
Classification of a tax entity as large tax entity was carried out following its income tax return submission for the respective taxation period, and for 2003 for the first time.
The tax entity ceased to be classified as an large tax entity in the event that its net turnover for the taxation period dropped below the above mentioned limit during three successive taxation periods counted from the end of the period for which the entity submitted its tax return based on which it was then classified under large tax entity.
No tax entity could be removed from the large tax entities' records without a tax audit of at least one tax type for at least one period being performed before.
All large tax entities were audited at least every five years until the end of 2009.
Since 2010, a written evaluation of the tax entity needs to be performed at least once every 2 years, while the selected follow-up procedure has to eliminate tax risks and their negative implications for the accurate assessment and collection of taxes.
The audits shall focus on at least one tax type, while, as a rule, the tax administrator selects several tax periods for a single exercise.
The large tax entities were audited by staff of the specialised audit departments - established at 13 tax offices in total -or audit departments of the competent local tax offices.
A specialised audit department carries out tax audits within its local competence area as determined by the director of the financial directorate.
Kromě kontroly VDS kontroluje též:
• tax entities engaged in uncommon and specific business fields,
• entities whose tax audits involve special expertise and time demands,
• entities with an intricate territorial and organisational structure,
• entities suspected of large-scale tax evasions,
• entities that are members of chains and networks, where suspicions exist of large-scale tax evasions and of unjustifiable excessive deductions.
The number of tax audits performed by the specialised audit departments of tax offices and their results are set out in Table No. 3.
The Czech Ministry of Finance proposed to amend the Act No. 531/1990 Coll., on territorial financial authorities, specifically by establishing a specialised tax office with the nation-wide competence for the selected tax entities (i. a. for legal persons incorporated for the purpose of doing business and having a turnover of more than CZK 2 bn).
4.5.2 VAT audit of large tax entities in Germany
Obecné informace
VAT audits of large companies are governed by the same rules as tax audits in general, i. e. the relevant provisions are laid down in • the German Fiscal Code (AO), • the Fiscal Administration Act (FVG), and • tax audit regulations (BpO).
Additional documents for guidance are in place.
German Fiscal Code
The legal provisions provided for in articles 193-203 of the German Fiscal Code in “Section IV - tax field audit”: in particular, these articles embody the rules for the admissibility of a tax field audit (audit on the premises of an enterprise), its scope as to subject matter, rules on allocation of responsibilities, the form and content of audit notification, audit principles, the taxable person's duties to cooperate and the prerequisites for holding final discussions and communicating the audit report.
Tax field audits are carried out by the responsible tax offices (Article 195 of the Code).
Fiscal Administrative Act According to Article 5.1 item 1 in connection with Art. 19 of the Act, the participation in tax field audits carried out by tax offices is incumbent on the Federal Central Tax Office.
The nature and scope of the participation of the Federal Central Tax Office in tax field audits are agreed between the authorities involved.
Moreover the Federal Central Tax Office is entitled to demand that specific enterprises it has named are audited at a time it has specified.
In this case it may promulgate rules for the conduct and contents of audits on the premises of these companies.
Tax Audit Regulations Pursuant to Article 108.7 of the German Constitution, the Tax Audit Regulations (German abbreviation: BpO 2000) were promulgated with the consent of the Bundesrat (the upper chamber of the German Parliament on which the Lander governments are represented).
The administrative regulations applied to tax field work of Lander tax authorities and the Federal Central Tax Office.
Enterprises are classified according to size at regular intervals pursuant to Article 3 of the Regulations.
Large enterprises are to be subjected to a follow-up audit (Article 4.2 of the Regulations).
Article 33.1 of the Regulations, each cognisant tax authority has to keep a register of groups of companies being also defined in the Regulations.
Administrative guidance
In addition, the following documents provide additional guidance for the tax administration:
• Uniform Manual for special VAT audits in Germany;
• USLO Manual, which provides guidance on the use of the data on intra-Community business relations held on VIES;
• working aids for different and special subjects.
• ZAUBER Manual, which provides guidance on the use of the database ZAUBER;
The classification of tax entities is based on criteria like turnover and net income with different thresholds according to the line of business.
The figures are made public by the Federal Ministry of Finance.
They are evaluated every three years and fixed for the following three years.
The number of businesses - not only large businesses - has to be ascertained at regular audit intervals (latest interval: 1st January 2010).
In general, large businesses have to be audited continuously.
The audits are generally announced including VAT.
That means: during the audit timeframe especially income tax or corporation tax, trade tax, and VAT - all kinds of relevant taxes - have to be audited finally.
VAT audits can be carried either by tax auditors or by VAT auditors.
This varies and depends on the organisational structure in the federal states.
The number of taxation periods covered by an audit varies regularly between 3 and 5 years.
The BpO 2000 assumes an audit period of 3 years.
All taxes a company was assessed for are subject to review.
4.5.3 Management of audits of large tax entities
As both SAIs decided not to review individual cases they focused on management questions to get a picture on how the tax administrations handle the issue of VAT audits of large tax entities.
Based on a questionnaire, they gathered information from the tax administrations concerning areas that they considered essential for managing this issue.
• What statistical records and analyses concerning the VAT audit of large businesses are available to the management of the tax administration?
In particular:
• Are there any statistics or records about the extent to which a distinction is drawn between fighting VAT fraud and general VAT inspection?
The Czech Republic: No, system ATIS in current data version does not allow drawing this difference.
Germany: The tax administration does not differentiate between an audit designed to combat VAT fraud and a general VAT inspection.
• Are there any statistics or records about the timeliness of VAT audits (in relation to the time of the transactions audited)?
The Czech Republic: Records about the timeliness of enquiries relevant to intra-Community acquisition of goods of selected VAT taxpayers are shown in system ATIS.
Additionally, such information as how long did the enquiries take is also part of the data recorded in ATIS.
Germany: No, the unified statistics on federal level for tax auditors only contain information on the average last audit period (year).
This is a figure that does not provide an overview of the selected audit periods with respect to individual entrepreneurs.
VAT auditors focus on the latest VAT assessment periods and are also entitled to audit large tax entities.
But the statistics on federal level for special VAT auditors does not provide information concerning the classification of tax entities.
• Are there any statistics or records about the nature of the additionally generated VAT revenues; divided e.g. according to the following features:
i. genuine increase in tax liability (e. g. application of a reduced tax rate instead of the standard VAT rate)
ii. only nominal increase in tax liability (e. g. shift of a full-compliance VAT case to a different taxable period)
iii. additional tax revenue collected (payment of the outstanding additional tax due)
The Czech Republic:
The Czech tax administration monitors the numbers of tax verifications performed, levels of additional tax assessment broken down by types of tax, by the number of audited tax subjects and by the number of controlled taxable periods.
Other tax procedures (local investigation, reproach procedure) are monitored in the same way.
As an independent task, data and the amount of additionally paid taxes are recorded.
Statistics of general debts broken down by types of tax but not according to declared tax or tax found out by a tax administrator are also kept.
Germany: No, the unified statistics on federal level for tax auditors and special VAT auditors do not distinguish between the above mentioned criteria.
Moreover most of the tax administrations visited do not make such a distinction either.
• Are audit fields that yield high additional revenues recorded?
The Czech Republic: Yes, the tax administrator is in a position to select taxpayers for verification on the basis of criteria which can be linked with chosen indicators in special parts of ATIS.
Germany: There are no regulations at federal government level (Bund).
Subsequently the unified statistics on federal level for tax auditors and special VAT auditors do not provide such information.
But there is one coordinated approach of the ministries of finance of the “Lander” and the “Bund”.
In the ZAUBER data base, tax auditors or tax investigators of the federal states (Lander) have to register their assessed increase in VAT liability if it exceeds a certain amount.
In this case, they have to specify e. g. the nature of the assessed increase in VAT liability.
• What are the most frequent findings?
The Czech Republic:
- large tax entities exercised an unauthorised right to deduct input VAT for supplies and services,
• that were not used to perform any economic activity as per § 72 (1) of the VAT Act;
• that were used for any entertainment purposes as per § 75 (3) of the VAT Act;
• based on tax documents that did not meet the requirements as laid down in § 73 (1) of the VAT Act;
- large tax entities did not declare output VAT as per § 21 (1) of the VAT Act.
Germany: There are no regulations at federal government level (Bund).
Subsequently the unified statistics at federal level for tax auditors and special VAT auditors do not provide such information.
Findings in respect to VAT are not separately recorded by the federal states (Lander) as far as they result from tax audits of large companies.
But in the ZAUBER database in which tax auditors or tax investigators of the federal states (Lander) have to register their assessed increase in VAT liability exceeding a certain amount, the Federal Central Tax Office is able to analyse such information.
• Does the tax administration analyse audit fields that produce a high ‘yield' and does it draw the consequences for the management?
The Czech Republic: Yes, for example they launch national audit proceedings aimed at risky commodities or a subject of economic activity.
Germany: There are no regulations at federal government level (Bund).
The unified statistics on federal level for tax auditors and special VAT auditors do not provide information about audit fields that produce a high ‘yield'.
There are diverse opinions on the process of analysing as well as of managing cases under the aspect of materiality.
Some regional tax offices provide special information; but the tax offices are free to make use of them.
4.5.4 Comparison and evaluation
The different answers of both Member States show that the Czech Republic provides a system that collects a lot of information including information about conducted VAT audits as well as data of the balance sheets and the profit and loss accounts.
On the basis of a wide range of information the Czech Republic is able to steer the selection of risk prone cases.
The same applies to analysis and management of VAT control in general.
In the Czech Republic the establishment of a specialised tax office for the administration of large tax entities is planned in 2012.
In Germany, the tax administration does not collect such information.
Subsequently it is more difficult to fulfil these tasks in a similar way.
But nevertheless Germany's philosophy places more focus on selecting respective individual cases based on VAT return information submitted.
Therefore risk management components are going to be enhanced and improved.
On the basis of adequate reference notes, well trained tax auditors have to assess the accurate amount of VAT.
The two SAIs are of the opinion that Member States should be able to provide adequate management as well as an adequate risk management system.
This will help reduce VAT shortfalls.
As a result, VAT revenue as well as the risk for unreliable entrepreneurs to be detected will increase.
5. Conclusions
The cooperation of the two SAIs within the parallel audits of the administration of VAT achieved the objectives set by the German and Czech SAI.
The two SAIs developed a deeper understanding of the applicable systems in the Czech Republic and Germany in the fields of: • intra-Community transactions, • risk management of VAT, especially concerning the selection of risk prone transactions, • recovery of VAT claims, and • VAT audits of large tax entities.
Due to mutual cooperation, differences of strategies to detect VAT fraud cases and in the above mentioned areas of VAT administration in the Czech Republic and Germany were revealed.
Audit findings were compared and on their basis best practices were identified.
Furthermore, the SAIs hope that the results achieved may encourage stakeholders to enter into discussions about approaches and strategies within and among Member States as well as with the EU Commission.
The invaluable experience and knowledge gained by cooperation of the two SAIs may serve as an encouragement to conduct future audit missions of VAT administration.
6. Communique
The report has been drawn up in Czech, English and German and signed by the two Presidents of the Czech and German SAI.
Editorial deadline: June 2010.
