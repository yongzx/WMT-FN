<seg id="1">Why the Queen made an error of judgement on proroguing Parliament - Joyce McMillan</seg>
<seg id="2">Once, long ago, a committee I sat on had some dealings with people from Buckingham Palace; not the Royal Family itself, but a small group of senior officials.</seg>
<seg id="3">I suppose that even 20 years on, it's a beheading offence to give precise details of what they said on the subject of the Queen's role in the planned official opening of the new Scottish Parliament, on 1 July 1999; but I can say that they were an impressive crew, much more politically savvy about the constitutional nuances of devolution than most UK Government representatives at the time, and much more sharply aware - given their vast experience across the Commonwealth - that political self-determination is one thing, and the role of the monarch as head of state is another.</seg>
<seg id="4">Amid all the sound, fury, and swings of the constitutional wrecking-ball that have accompanied the latest traumatic episode in Britain's Brexit crisis, one question has therefore been nagging at the back of my mind; the question of what exactly happened on the morning of 28 August, when Jacob Rees-Mogg, as Lord President of the Council, presented himself at Balmoral, where the Queen was on her usual late summer holiday, to seek the royal assent to the exceptional five-week prorogation of Parliament proposed by the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is, of course, a mere sub-plot in the wider Brexit drama which reached such an appalling crisis in the Commons on Wednesday night, with the Prime Minister dismissing the unanimous decision of 11 Supreme Court judges as "wrong," inciting warlike attitudes by using terms like "surrender" and "betrayal" in relation to Brexit, and dismissing as "humbug" the fears for their own safety of women MP's - friends and allies of the murdered MP Jo Cox - who are now subjected to a daily barrage of Brexit-related hate mail.</seg>
<seg id="6">Yet it is a sub-plot worthy of a one-act play in its own right; and perhaps not one of those jolly, reassuring ones in which the Queen is portrayed as an infinitely wise and perceptive old lady, who has seen 13 prime ministers come and go, and will doubtless outlast the 14th.</seg>
<seg id="7">For the truth is that on that day, the Queen and her advisers seem to have made an error of judgment, of the kind they have almost entirely avoided, in her 67-year reign to date; and arguably a much more serious one than the intervention in the Scottish independence referendum suggested by David Cameron in his memoir, which, after all, amounted to no more than the Queen suggesting people "think carefully" before casting their votes, a phrase which only a dyed-in-the-wool Unionist would interpret as meaning that they should necessarily vote for the status quo.</seg>
<seg id="8">This time, though, warning bells should have sounded in the royal household as soon as they heard that the new Prime Minister was proposing such a long prorogation in the run-up to the Brexit deadline date; and a couple of quick concerned phone calls from palace to Downing Street should have been enough to persuade the PM to shorten his pre-Queen's Speech prorogation to the usual length of a few days or a week.</seg>
<seg id="9">To the royal household, after all, past custom and practice is 99 per cent of the law.</seg>
<seg id="10">So what went wrong?</seg>
<seg id="11">We will probably never know, or not for decades.</seg>
<seg id="12">It may be that the Queen and her advisers simply felt that they did not want to question a new government trying to implement a referendum result, however narrow.</seg>
<seg id="13">It may be that Johnson and Rees-Mogg genuinely caught the Queen off guard, at a holiday period when many key people were not available.</seg>
<seg id="14">Or it may be, as some republican thinkers would suggest, that the whole idea of the Queen as a wise and moderate sovereign, who always hopes to promote the wellbeing of her subjects, is simply another layer of royalist mythology, disguising an edifice of wealth and inherited privilege which, under stress, will unhesitatingly assist a right-wing government in undermining institutions - Scottish, British or European - that might threaten that traditional power structure.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is 42 years, after all, since punk poet John Lydon of the Sex Pistols first noisily linked the Queen with the idea of a "fascist regime"; and although the history of postwar Europe strongly suggests that there is no inevitable connection between royalty and reactionary politics, it can be argued that the 1970s punk movement at least tried to open up a conversation about monarchy and democracy, one which the UK has since failed to pursue.</seg>
<seg id="16">Whatever the truth about the Queen's role in the prorogation, though, this much is clear; that as the current Brexit crisis is testing Britain's unwritten constitution to its limits, and provoking a dangerous moment of open constitutional warfare among government, parliament and the courts, it has also succeeded in undermining the monarch's conventional stabilising role in that constitution, associating her with a rash act that has now been declared unlawful, by a government that commands no parliamentary majority.</seg>
<seg id="17">The global merchants of democratic instability and breakdown - the Putins and Bannons, with their armies of hate-mongering internet bots - must be delighted by the spectacular progress of their project, over just three years, in one of the world's most stable democracies.</seg>
<seg id="18">And Scotland, which has not been the primary target of this destabilisation, must now soon be given a second chance to consider its position, in relation to a UK so radically changed by Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="19">In 1977, Lydon and the Sex Pistols famously warned that "there is no future for you, in England's dreaming."</seg>
<seg id="20">Yet now, England's fierce dream of a glorious past, filtered through layers of 21st-century lies and delusion, is starting to shape all of our futures on these islands; and we will all have to live in that landscape of dream or nightmare, until we find our own ways - with or without the Queen, and inside or outside the UK - of resisting the lies, rejecting the illusion, and coming together to re-engage with reality of our lives, as citizens of the 21st century.</seg>

<seg id="2">FORMER Emmerdale cast member Kelvin Fletcher has swapped the Dales for the dancefloor on BBC's Strictly Come Dancing 2019.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what do we know about him?</seg>
<seg id="4">How much is Kelvin Flecther being paid for Strictly Come Dancing?</seg>
<seg id="5">The father-of-one is said to have been paid something in the region of £25,000 and £40,000 to take part in the 17th series of Strictly Come Dancing.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Sun previously reported that each celebrity is given a standard £25,000 payment for joining.</seg>
<seg id="7">For those who stay until the end of October the fee rises to £40,000.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, his earnings could increase significantly if he makes it to the quarter-finals as he will pocket £60,000.</seg>
<seg id="9">With Kelvin being a strong competitor there is every possibility he could walk away with £100,000 if he wins the entire competition.</seg>
<seg id="10">Why did Kelvin Fletcher leave Emmerdale?</seg>
<seg id="11">Kelvin first joined Emmerdale at the tender age of six-years-old in 1996.</seg>
<seg id="12">He played the part of Andy Sugden for 20 years, before quitting the role in 2016 for good.</seg>
<seg id="13">During an appearance on This Morning, the actor opened up about his decision to leave the ITV soap.</seg>
<seg id="14">Speaking to host Emmon Holmes and Ruth Langsford, he explained: "Twenty years is a long time.</seg>
<seg id="15">It's been an incredible twenty years.</seg>
<seg id="16">I am so grateful to Emmerdale.</seg>
<seg id="17">Throughout that period I have always had a real sense of fulfillment and purpose."</seg>
<seg id="18">He added: "What started out as a hobby at six years old - I was then able to do something like that every day on a professional platform on one of the country's greatest shows.</seg>
<seg id="19">I have been extremely lucky.</seg>
<seg id="20">Looking back over 20 years it has been a rollercoaster and for me it's give me passion to leave and continue."</seg>

<seg id="2">African countries are building increasingly strong partnerships for advancing peace and security, as well as inclusive sustainable development across the continent, the Security Council heard on Thursday, during a briefing by the UN Secretary-General's Chef de Cabinet, Maria Luiza Ribeiro Viotti.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ms. Viotti recognized the African Union and Member States' success in achieving important milestones in their pursuit for higher effectiveness, self-reliance and cooperation, and welcomed the work of the African Union Mediation Support Unit and the FemWise Network of African Women in Conflict Prevention and Mediation, which are, she said, "boosting capacity to defuse crises and making such efforts more inclusive."</seg>
<seg id="4">Progress evident at regional and country level</seg>
<seg id="5">Ms. Viotti went on to outline some of the progress being made in certain African countries, such as the peace talks, led by the African Union, in the Central African Republic which led a Political Agreement which is being overseen by the UN; the signing of a Constitutional Declaration in Sudan, which has allowed for the establishment of a civilian-led government, following efforts led by Ethiopia and the African Union (AU), with UN support; and free and fair elections in Madagascar, supported by the Southern Africa Development Community, the African Union, and UN.</seg>
<seg id="6">Cooperation between the UN, African Union and other partners in the area of elections is growing, said Ms. Viotti, citing visits organized by the UN Office for West Africa to several countries, ahead of legislative or presidential elections, over the last two years.</seg>
<seg id="7">The UN and AU, she continued, are cooperating closely to ensure that the voices of women and youth are integral to peace processes, and both organizations have youth envoys and strategies, acting as advocates and agents of change.</seg>
<seg id="8">More effective support needed from international community</seg>
<seg id="9">Despite the many examples of progress, Ms. Viotti declared that the international community needs to do much more to support African efforts.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, more predictable, flexible and sustainable financing for African Union-led peace support operations is needed; more political will and resources for peacebuilding and sustaining peace efforts; and active support for the AU Initiative on Silencing the Guns.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Building partnerships and harnessing their power requires long-term vision and commitment," Ms. Viotti told the Security Council, adding that the Secretary-General is looking forward to "even greater partnership and collaboration, enabling the African Union to achieve its 2063 vision of equitable, people-centred transformation and lasting peace and security."</seg>

<seg id="2">The Court of Appeal in Belfast has dismissed an application that the UK government's Brexit policy will damage the Northern Ireland peace process.</seg>
<seg id="3">Three applicants appealed against a Belfast High Court judgment that rejected their challenge against the UK government's handling of the Brexit process.</seg>
<seg id="4">One of the applicants was high-profile victims' campaigner Raymond McCord, whose son was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries in 1997.</seg>
<seg id="5">It comes after the UK Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Prime Minister Boris Johnson acted unlawfully in shutting down parliament for five weeks.</seg>
<seg id="6">The three-judge Court of Appeal, led by the region's Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan, gave their judgment on Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="7">The three challenges focused on various aspects of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October.</seg>
<seg id="8">One that argued the Government's Brexit policy will damage the Northern Ireland peace process was previously dismissed by the High Court.</seg>
<seg id="9">During the appeal hearing last week, Mr McCord's barrister Ronan Lavery QC told the court that if a Brexit extension could not be secured by the government in the absence of a deal, then the default position should be halting Brexit - through the revocation of Article 50 - rather than exiting with no deal.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr McCord, who was not at court due to ill health, said he would study the Belfast Court of Appeal judgment with his lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I, along with many other people, believe that it will affect the peace process," he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">I hope I am proven wrong.</seg>
<seg id="13">We did not take this case to alarm people, it is what I believe in.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It would be nice if in the coming years people can come across and say: "Look Raymond, you were wrong."</seg>
<seg id="15">It did not affect the peace process.</seg>
<seg id="16">I don't want it to affect the peace process.</seg>
<seg id="17">I don't want people to go through what my family and members of other families have went through.</seg>
<seg id="18">I respect the judgment of the Appeal Court in every way, I believe the judges sitting there are amongst the best judges in the UK.</seg>
<seg id="19">I have to respect their judgment.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, it is a fear I have that the peace process will be affected."</seg>

<seg id="1">No. of women in science field far from satisfactory; need to increase participation: President Kovind</seg>
<seg id="2">President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday said the participation of women in the field of science in the country is far from satisfactory and steps need to be taken to ensure greater involvement of girl students in the area.</seg>
<seg id="3">In his address on the 78th foundation day celebrations of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), he said achievements in the field of science and technology will become more wholesome and desirable if there is a greater participation of girl students and of women in this area.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this context, he said Project Director of Chandrayaan-2 mission M Vanitha and Mission Director Ritu Karidhal have become household names.</seg>
<seg id="5">We have to take the necessary steps to ensure greater participation of girl students and of women in science and technology.</seg>
<seg id="6">"When this happens, our scientific achievements will become even more wholesome and more desirable," the President said.</seg>
<seg id="7">"None of our successes will have any meaning without equal opportunities for our girl-children," he added.</seg>
<seg id="8">Science and Technology Minister Harsh Vardhan, Principal Scientific Advisor K VijayRaghavan and CSIR Director General Shekhar Mande were also present at the event.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Kovind called upon the scientific community to take calculated risk.</seg>
<seg id="10">There, he said, lies the possibility of developing truly transformative technologies and innovations.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said the academic, scientific institutions, industry and entrepreneurs must collaborate to ensure that scientific research can move from labs to industry, agricultural fields, incubation centres and start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mr Vardhan also presented the President a Fuel Cell Prototype developed by CSIR labs.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is the first indigenous prototype and the fuel cells use hydrogen to produce electricity.</seg>

<seg id="1">Joker is chilling, unnerving and absolutely brilliant</seg>
<seg id="2">Joaquin Phoenix turns in an Oscar worthy performance as a comic-book villain whose power once lay in his ambiguous mythology, but has now been bolstered in Joker by an unflinching deep dive into his origins.</seg>
<seg id="3">Pulling back the curtain on the Joker was a risk, but it's one that pays off hugely here as Phoenix's portrayal of the character, who has been played many ways by many actors to varying degrees of success, is unique and if anything, more terrifying, as this story is so grounded in a quasi-reality and the most real-worldly Gotham we've seen.</seg>
<seg id="4">What transpires on screen is chilling, unnerving, completely compelling, anxiety-inducing, sleep-disturbing, and absolutely brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="5">Joker is a character study that explores how a mentally ill aspiring stand-up comedian, Arthur Fleck, becomes the homicidal clown we're familiar with, and the film deftly walks the tightrope of making him a somewhat sympathetic character without pushing this aspect too far.</seg>
<seg id="6">The balancing act is truly engaging.</seg>
<seg id="7">Phoenix gives the performance of the year here, but DeNiro is also at the top of his game once again and his involvement in the project really solidifies the Scorsese-ian undertones that pepper the film.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is not a comic-book movie and aside from a few hat-tips to Batman lore, it is completely its own beast, and that is precisely why it works so well; there is no format, there is no convention and there are no rules.</seg>
<seg id="9">You might not put on a happy face for a while after the credits roll, but it is so worth the weird dreams that will likely follow.</seg>

<seg id="1">Saudi Arabia To Offer Tourist Visas For First Time, Abolish Abaya Rule</seg>
<seg id="2">Visas in Saudi are currently restricted to expat workers, their dependents and Muslim pilgrims.</seg>
<seg id="3">Saudi Arabia said Friday it will offer tourist visas for the first time, opening up the ultra-conservative kingdom to holidaymakers as part of a push to diversify its economy away from oil.</seg>
<seg id="4">Kickstarting tourism is one of the centrepieces of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 reform programme to prepare the biggest Arab economy for a post-oil era.</seg>
<seg id="5">The announcement comes just two weeks after devastating attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure -- blamed by Washington on Iran -- which roiled global energy markets and raised fears of a wider regional conflict.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Opening Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," tourism chief Ahmed al-Khateeb said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="7">Visitors will be surprised... by the treasures we have to share -- five UNESCO World Heritage Sites, a vibrant local culture and breathtaking natural beauty.</seg>
<seg id="8">Saudi Arabia will open applications for online tourist visas to citizens of 49 countries on Saturday, Bloomberg News quoted Khateeb as saying.</seg>
<seg id="9">Khateeb said the kingdom will also ease its strict dress code for foreign women, allowing them to go without the body-shrouding abaya robe that is still mandatory public wear for Saudi women.</seg>
<seg id="10">Foreign women, however, will be required to wear "modest clothing," he added, without elaborating.</seg>
<seg id="11">Visas in the desert kingdom, endowed with rich bedouin heritage and archaeological sites, are currently restricted to expat workers, their dependents and Muslim pilgrims travelling to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a rare move, Saudi Arabia last year began issuing temporary visas to visitors to attend sporting and cultural events in a bid to kickstart tourism.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the austere kingdom, which forbids alcohol and has a strict social code, is seen by many as a hard sell for tourists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Prince Mohammed is seeking to change that through a sweeping liberalisation drive that has brought new cinemas, mixed-gender concerts and sporting extravaganzas to Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id="15">International criticism of the kingdom's human rights record, including the gruesome murder last year of critic Jamal Khashoggi and a crackdown on female activists, could further put off foreign visitors, observers say.</seg>
<seg id="16">Fears of a regional conflict after the September 14 attacks on state oil giant Aramco may also dampen the kingdom's appeal to holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id="17">The government, reeling from low oil prices, says it hopes tourism will contribute up to 10 percent of the gross domestic product by 2030, compared to three percent currently.</seg>
<seg id="18">It says by 2030 it aims to attract up to 100 million annual visits by both domestic and foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="19">But the kingdom currently lacks the infrastructure to accomodate visitors in such high numbers, with officials estimating 500,000 new hotel rooms will be required nationwide over the coming decade.</seg>
<seg id="20">The sector is expected to create up to one million tourism jobs, the government says, as it battles high youth unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Saudi Arabia has splurged billions in an attempt to build a tourism industry from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="22">In 2017, the kingdom announced a multi-billion dollar project to turn 50 islands and other pristine sites on the Red Sea into luxury resorts.</seg>
<seg id="23">Last year, construction of Qiddiya "entertainment city" was launched near Riyadh, which would include high-end theme parks, motor sport facilities and a safari area.</seg>
<seg id="24">The country is also developing historic sites such as the centuries-old Mada'in Saleh, home to sandstone tombs of the same civilisation which built the Jordanian city of Petra.</seg>

<seg id="2">Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) named banking veteran Charles Scharf as chief executive officer on Friday, the lender's third CEO since a wide-ranging sales scandal erupted three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scharf will take over from interim CEO Allen Parker, who was thrust into the position in March when former CEO Tim Sloan resigned abruptly.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sloan had said increased pressure from politicians and regulators had become a distraction in running the scandal-plagued bank.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scharf will take charge at a time when the bank is under a regulatory microscope and is working at rebuilding its tarnished reputation following the scandal.</seg>
<seg id="6">Internal and regulatory probes since the scandal have uncovered other issues in each of the bank's primary businesses, resulting in billions of dollars in fines, penalties and an unprecedented cap on its balance sheet by the Federal Reserve.</seg>
<seg id="7">Wells Fargo's board has been shuffled many times since the scandal, with more than half of its independent directors joining the board after 2016.</seg>
<seg id="8">Most recently, Scharf was heading Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N).</seg>
<seg id="9">Before joining the custodian bank, he held the top job at Visa Inc (V.N), the world's largest payment network.</seg>
<seg id="10">Separately, BNY Mellon named finance head Thomas Gibbons as its CEO on an interim basis.</seg>
<seg id="11">The bank also said Scharf had forfeited all of his equity and incentive awards which were unvested as of Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="12">KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said he was unsure what to expect from Scharf as Wells Fargo's CEO since his tenure at Bank of New York Mellon lasted only for two years.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Scharf's first task will be appeasing regulators and making the changes necessary to remove the asset cap currently in place," Kleinhanzl said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Scharf, 54, started his career in 1987 at Commercial Credit Corp, a consumer finance company run by Jamie Dimon and Sandy Weill - executives who went on to lead two of America's biggest banks.</seg>
<seg id="15">He was named Dimon's assistant six months into the job at Commercial Credit, according to an alumni magazine for the NYU stern business school.</seg>
<seg id="16">Scharf will start in his new role next month, Wells Fargo said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="17">"He moves from a bank with far less retail business than Wells Fargo, so he will face a steep learning curve," said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.</seg>
<seg id="18">The lender's board had considered keeping Parker as CEO on a permanent basis even after saying they would seek an outsider to fill the role, sources had told Reuters in June.</seg>
<seg id="19">Wells Fargo said Scharf's base salary at the bank would be $2.5 million - nearly the same as Sloan's base pay in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="20">Regulatory filings showed that Scharf's total compensation for 2018 at BNY was $9.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="21">Sloan's total compensation for the year was $18.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="22">Shares of Wells Fargo were up nearly 3.2% at $50.44 in premarket trading.</seg>

<seg id="2">LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) - The parents of 4-year-old Palmdale boy Noah Cuatro who died in July under suspicious circumstances were arrested Thursday, officials confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="3">Jose Cuatro and Ursula Juarez were arrested for the murder of their son, Noah, on September 26, 2019, at approximately 8:00 a.m., the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Dept. announced.</seg>
<seg id="4">The two were booked at Palmdale Sheriff's Station and a search warrant was served at their residence in an attempt to recover any additional evidence related to Noah's murder.</seg>
<seg id="5">Noah had been ordered by a court back in May to be removed from his parents' custody over concerns about abuse.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was never removed from the home and placed in foster care and on the afternoon of July 5, Noah's parents called 911 to report that he was drowning in a pool at an apartment complex in the 1200 block of East Avenue S, the L.A. County Sheriff's Department reports.</seg>
<seg id="7">Noah was rushed by ambulance to a local hospital.</seg>
<seg id="8">He died the following morning, on July 6.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hospital staff found signs of trauma on Noah's body and determined there were issues with his parents' explanation for his cause of death.</seg>
<seg id="10">Noah's three siblings had since been removed from the home and the sheriff's department launched an investigation.</seg>
<seg id="11">DCFS had previously investigated several reports of abuse in Noah's home.</seg>
<seg id="12">Noah's maternal great-grandmother Eva Hernandez told CBSLA that he was in and out of foster care his entire life.</seg>
<seg id="13">"DCFS has blood on its hands," said Hernandez's attorney Brian Claypool.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even though we're talking today about the arrest of his parents, we will be back some point in the future to hold that agency accountable for the death of this little boy.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 2016, according to the Times, Noah was removed from the home and placed in foster care for two years.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was returned to his parents' custody in November 2018.</seg>
<seg id="17">Hernandez said she often cared for her great-grandson.</seg>
<seg id="18">"He begged me, "grandma, let me stay, don't do this to me, don't send me back,"" Hernandez said.</seg>
<seg id="19">It's hard because I remember every word he used to tell me.</seg>
<seg id="20">Noah's parents are being held on $1 million bail each and are due in court Monday, Sept.</seg>

<seg id="2">Warren Gatland has named an unchanged team for Wales' Pool D showdown against Australia, with Alun Wyn Jones set to become the country's most-capped player when he leads his side out in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Wales skipper wins his 130th cap, breaking the previous record held by prop Gethin Jenkins.</seg>
<seg id="4">Gatland has placed his faith in the starting XV that secured a 43-14 victory over Georgia four days ago, this despite the knocks suffered by centre Hadleigh Parkes and hooker Ken Owens.</seg>
<seg id="5">There is one switch among the replacements, with Ospreys centre Owen Watkin taking over from Leigh Halfpenny.</seg>
<seg id="6">Gatland's side features nine survivors from Wales' narrow win against the Wallabies last November.</seg>
<seg id="7">There are also further opportunities for prop Wyn Jones and flanker Aaron Wainwright after they made their Rugby World Cup debuts in the Georgia game.</seg>
<seg id="8">And flanker Aaron Shingler will again provide second-row bench cover for starting locks Jake Ball and Alun Wyn Jones.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sunday's clash at the Tokyo Stadium will likely decide the winner of Pool D, setting up a potential quarter-final against either France or Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="10">Should Australia claim victory - in what would make for their 14th win from the last 15 meetings between these two sides - Gatland's men could find themselves on a collision course for a last-eight encounter with England.</seg>

<seg id="2">Canada rugby captain Tyler Ardron is under no illusions of the monumentality of the task facing his side in their next two World Cup fixtures but said it would put his players in the "shop window" and ultimately help improve the team in the long run.</seg>
<seg id="3">The North Americans were beaten 48-7 by Italy in their Pool B opener at Fukuoka Hakatanomori Stadium on Thursday and now face three-times world champions New Zealand on Oct. 2 in Oita before meeting South Africa on Oct. 8 in Kobe.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ardron, one of the few Canadians playing in a top-tier club competition - for New Zealand club Waikato Chiefs in the international Super Rugby competition - recognized his side were unlikely to upset either of the southern hemisphere nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We're at the World Cup to play against the best (and)... for this game (against Italy) we were definitely not the favorites and that showed on the scoreboard," Ardron said.</seg>
<seg id="6">(Against New Zealand) we have to go out and put out something that we are proud of.</seg>
<seg id="7">For a lot of guys this is a shop window and hopefully some of them can put on a hell of a performance out there and get a contract.</seg>
<seg id="8">That would be a win for us.</seg>
<seg id="9">Wins on the field may be few and far between for tier-two nations at the tournament, such as Uruguay's victory over Fiji in Kamaishi on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Italians, however, were in no mood to allow a second shock within the space of 24 hours and demonstrated the benefits of having a team comprised of full-time professionals playing regular test matches.</seg>
<seg id="11">Canada coach Kingsley Jones, however, said Thursday's performance had been a major step up for his side, which has struggled internationally for a number of years and was the last to qualify for the tournament.</seg>
<seg id="12">The advent of Major League Rugby (MLR) in North America launched two years ago, however, is an important development in bridging the gap between tier-one and tier-two nations and for the development of players in Canada and the United States, he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">It was a big reality check when I came to Canada just how difficult it was to get the players together.</seg>
<seg id="14">"They all held down day jobs," said Jones.</seg>
<seg id="15">But I think the MLR is a lifeline for Canada and the United States.</seg>
<seg id="16">It's a pathway for players and coaches.</seg>
<seg id="17">Jones said there were 51 Canadians contracted to MLR clubs last season.</seg>
<seg id="18">Less than 18 months ago, more than 40 were working other jobs.</seg>
<seg id="19">"That's a big step in the right direction," he said.</seg>
<seg id="20">MLR still has a way to go.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's still in its infancy but it is certainly a pathway into the top levels.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the long term I'm sure it will get up to speed and be a good competitive competition, so that is critical.</seg>

<seg id="2">President Donald Trump speaks while participating in a tour of border wall prototypes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The House voted Friday to block the national emergency declaration President Donald Trump is using to fund his proposed border wall.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Democratic-held chamber passed a resolution to terminate Trump's action by a 236-174 margin, sending it to the president.</seg>
<seg id="5">Eleven Republicans and one independent supported it.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Senate already approved the measure in a 54-41 vote, as 11 Republicans joined Democrats in backing it.</seg>
<seg id="7">Trump will likely veto the resolution, the sixth time he will have blocked congressional legislation as president.</seg>
<seg id="8">He already vetoed a measure to end the emergency declaration in March.</seg>
<seg id="9">Neither chamber of Congress appears to have the two-thirds majority needed to override the president's opposition.</seg>
<seg id="10">Failing to get the funding he desired for borders on the southern border from both the Mexican government and Congress, Trump declared the national emergency in February.</seg>
<seg id="11">His administration plans to pull $3.6 billion from military construction to fund border projects.</seg>
<seg id="12">Democrats have accused Trump of both circumventing Congress' power of the purse and raiding key Defense funds for unnecessary barriers.</seg>
<seg id="13">A handful of Republicans in both the House and Senate also had concerns about the precedent Trump's declaration would set for executive overreach in the future.</seg>
<seg id="14">Some Senate Republicans facing elections next year have faced sharp political pressure over the national emergency vote.</seg>

<seg id="1">Babies exposed to air pollution have greater risk of death</seg>
<seg id="2">Babies living in areas with high levels of air pollution have a greater risk of death than those surrounded by cleaner air, a study has found.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is not the first study to investigate the link between air pollution and infant mortality , but the study drew particular focus on different pollutants and its analysis at different points in babies' lives.</seg>
<seg id="4">Dr Sarah Kotecha , a researcher at Cardiff University, said the results were difficult for pregnant women and their families to do much about.</seg>
<seg id="5">"You live where you live and you can't avoid pollution day in day out," she said, adding that it was down to policymakers to reduce pollution levels and for researchers to unpick how pollutants affect health.</seg>
<seg id="6">"If you can find out some of the mechanisms you can look at potential interventions," she added.</seg>
<seg id="7">A growing body of research has revealed links between different components of air pollution and health issues, including lung problems, heart disease, mental health problems, dementia and low birthweight.</seg>
<seg id="8">The latest study, yet to be peer-reviewed or published, will be presented at the European Respiratory Society international congress in Madrid.</seg>
<seg id="9">Kotecha said the research was based on data for almost 8 million live births in England and Wales between 2001 and 2012.</seg>
<seg id="10">The team divided England and Wales into 35,000 areas, each containing approximately 1,500 residents, and looked at the annual death rates for babies up to one-year-old, together with the average annual levels for three pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="11">These were particulate matter known as PM10, which comes from sources including vehicles and waste incineration, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulphur dioxide (SO2), which is released through burning of fossil fuels in power stations and refineries as well as metal extraction.</seg>
<seg id="12">For each pollutant the team compared the death rate for babies in the worst fifth of polluted areas with those in the best fifth.</seg>
<seg id="13">Once factors such as maternal age, deprivation level for the area and birthweight were taken into account, the team said that babies aged up to one year had a greater chance of dying living in areas with the worst air pollution compared with areas with the cleanest air.</seg>
<seg id="14">The results held across all three pollutants, with the odds of death 7% worse for NO2, 4% worse for PM10 and 19% worse for SO2.</seg>
<seg id="15">Further analysis suggested that of the three pollutants, only SO2 was associated with deaths within a baby's first 28 days.</seg>
<seg id="16">The study was unable to prove whether high levels of air pollution were to blame for the increased risk of death in those areas.</seg>
<seg id="17">It also did not take into account levels of indoor air pollution.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prof Mireille Toledano, an expert in population child health at Imperial College London, said the study confirmed that air pollution is a major public health hazard, adding that current standards are failing to protect people.</seg>
<seg id="19">She said the latest study had a number of limitations.</seg>
<seg id="20">It looked at average pollution levels over relatively large areas while in reality levels can vary greatly over a small distance - meaning the babies' true exposure was not captured.</seg>
<seg id="21">The study also did not take into account fluctuations in air pollution with the weather or over seasons, and did not take into account where the mother spent her pregnancy or factors such as maternal smoking.</seg>
<seg id="22">Toledano said it was also unclear how factors like birthweight were accounted for.</seg>
<seg id="23">"It is showing there is some kind of additional risk from air pollution for infant death but the way that it has been set up is quite a crude analysis," said Toledano.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dr Penny Woods, the chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, said action must be taken to tackle the public health crisis of air pollution - including introducing clean air zones in the most polluted cities.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The evidence linking infant mortality and air pollution is still emerging but Dr Kotecha's study, which suggests babies born in the UK's most polluted areas see a significantly increased risk of death, should be a wake-up call to government," she said.</seg>
<seg id="26">A second study found that exposure to PM10 from traffic during pregnancy and children's early life was linked to a slightly lower lung function of the children at eight years old - although the effect was no longer seen by the time the children were 15.</seg>
<seg id="27">Woods said the study mirrored previous findings, adding that children cannot protect their own lungs.</seg>
<seg id="28">"Both these studies concentrate on the damage done by air pollution to some of the most vulnerable members of our society - the very young," she said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Muslim Woman Says Company Didn't Hire Her As She Wanted To Pray At Work</seg>
<seg id="2">Shahin Indorewala is suing the firm, claiming that she was discriminated against.</seg>
<seg id="3">Shahin Indorewala had a job working with children with autism, but she wanted to gain more experience in marketing.</seg>
<seg id="4">So she applied to Fast Trak Management, a small company that bills itself as "the number 1 marketing firm in the Northern Virginia Area."</seg>
<seg id="5">Now, Indorewala is suing the company, claiming that she was discriminated against because of her religion when she asked to use break time to pray.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a lawsuit filed in US District Court on Tuesday, Indorewala said she was "humiliated" by Fast Trak's CEO mocking her Muslim beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="7">The CEO, Ramses Gavilondo, disputes her version of events, saying Indorewala decided she did not want the job.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Council on American-Islamic Relations, which brought the lawsuit on Indorewala's behalf, held a brief news conference outside Fast Trak's Falls Church office on Wednesday, when CAIR labeled Fast Trak "a company that disregarded federal law and chose not to hire her because of her faith."</seg>
<seg id="9">In a video of the news conference, Indorewala said that her first interview went well, and that she was asked to return for a second interview.</seg>
<seg id="10">At that interview, Indorewala said, an assistant manager at Fast Trak told her that the company offers a long lunch break.</seg>
<seg id="11">Indorewala asked if she could take a shorter lunch break, so she could take two five-minute breaks during the workday to pray.</seg>
<seg id="12">She promptly ended the interview.</seg>
<seg id="13">She said, 'That's not going to work.</seg>
<seg id="14">We have fixed hours here,' " Indorewala said.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the lawsuit, the assistant manager then allegedly walked with Indorewala to Gavilondo, and said that the job's hours wouldn't work for Indorewala.</seg>
<seg id="16">Indorewala said she then explained to Gavilondo that she prays five times a day.</seg>
<seg id="17">At that point, Indorewala says, Gavilondo pointed to her headscarf and made mocking comments about religion.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Am I really being made fun of for my religion in public in what's supposed to be a professional workplace? . . .</seg>
<seg id="19">Clearly I was being discriminated against because of my religion," Indorewala said at the news conference.</seg>
<seg id="20">That was it.</seg>
<seg id="21">I just kind of quietly left the office.</seg>
<seg id="22">I didn't want to create a scene or anything, but I was pretty hurt and pretty embarrassed.</seg>
<seg id="23">Reached by phone on Thursday, Gavilondo said he didn't reject Indorewala's application; instead, he said, she was the one who decided she did not want the job.</seg>
<seg id="24">Someone came for an interview.</seg>
<seg id="25">They didn't want to work here. . . .</seg>
<seg id="26">"It's like me going to a store to buy Kit-Kats, and then I don't want to eat the Kit-Kats," he said.</seg>
<seg id="27">He said he recalled that Indorewala brought up her Muslim faith, but he did not specifically recall her request for five-minute prayer breaks during the day.</seg>
<seg id="28">And he said he had not made fun of her hijab: "I'm not a fashion expert.</seg>
<seg id="29">People can wear whatever they want."</seg>

<seg id="1">Scott Morrison will consider Donald Trump's formula, but it's unlikely he'll follow it</seg>
<seg id="2">And Morrison does not have to say "fake news" to echo the President at times.</seg>
<seg id="3">He complained about the media on Wednesday for running "completely false" and "completely misleading" accounts of his climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="4">So when Morrison needs answers on how to win the next election, he will no doubt consider Trump's formula - and whether it works in November 2020.</seg>
<seg id="5">But political tactics do not transfer so easily across the Pacific.</seg>
<seg id="6">Those around Morrison are not planning a Trumpification of the Prime Minister for the simple reason that the intensely partisan tactics that work in the United States cannot work in a world where elections are won and lost in the centre.</seg>
<seg id="7">Compulsory voting stays the hand of anyone who wants to appeal to the edge and forget the middle.</seg>
<seg id="8">Trump is divisive in Australia and his friendship with Morrison may alienate some Australian voters, which means copying the President is no guarantee of victory.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some of Morrison's critics on the left see a world they fear, or perhaps secretly the almighty battle they want, when they make the Prime Minister out to be like Trump.</seg>
<seg id="10">Imagine Morrison if that were so.</seg>
<seg id="11">He would not only skip the United Nations climate summit.</seg>
<seg id="12">He would ridicule it as a waste of time.</seg>
<seg id="13">The fact that Morrison used his speech to the UN to talk about action on climate shows he does not want to lose voters in the middle who expect their political leaders to take it seriously.</seg>
<seg id="14">And there is a gulf between the two leaders on the right of a superpower to dictate terms in the world.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The future does not belong to globalists.</seg>
<seg id="16">The future belongs to patriots," Trump said at the United Nations on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="17">The fact that Morrison used his speech to the UN to talk about action on climate shows he does not want to lose voters in the middle.</seg>
<seg id="18">What that means may require long study, but it is an immediate contrast with the Australian support for negotiated settlements between countries rather than the will of one group of patriots imposed on others.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We will be more secure and prosperous in a global order based on agreed rules, not one based on the exercise of power alone," Morrison told Asialink in Sydney in June.</seg>

<seg id="2">Zvamaida Murwira in NEW YORK, United States</seg>
<seg id="3">Illegal and ruinous sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe by the West have markedly slowed down the country's development, President Mnangagwa has said.</seg>
<seg id="4">He further dismissed the embargo as an attack on the rights of citizens.</seg>
<seg id="5">The President said this here during his address to the 74th Ordinary Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA 74).</seg>
<seg id="6">He applauded Southern Africa for solidly standing by Zimbabwe in calling for the unconditional removal of the two-decades-old embargo.</seg>
<seg id="7">While Zimbabwe had registered significant progress in providing safety nets for vulnerable groups of society, the President said, more could have been achieved had it not been for the illegal sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="8">These achievements are in spite of the continued albatross of the illegal economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Furthermore, sanctions are slowing down our progress, inhibiting our economic recovery and punishing the poorest and most vulnerable," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The President said Zimbabwe was in a transition and was determined to overcome the reality that it had a collapsed economy and currency due to illegal sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="11">Namibian President Hage Geingob weighed in, calling for the unequivocal lifting of sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe so that Harare could pursue its economic development agenda.</seg>
<seg id="12">President Mnangagwa urged the United Nations (UN) to assert its authority and honour its principles by reining in countries that imposed the sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="13">As the United Nations, let us boldly honour the principles of our Charter.</seg>
<seg id="14">The wrongs of the world must be set right.</seg>
<seg id="15">Unfair practices must be challenged; injustice, racism and all forms of oppression of man by man must be opposed and rejected.</seg>
<seg id="16">"My country applauds the South African Development Community, the African Union and all those who stand with us in demanding the immediate and unconditional removal of these illegal sanctions," said President Mnangagwa.</seg>
<seg id="17">Those that imposed these illegal sanctions must heed this call and lift them now.</seg>
<seg id="18">Cooperation is a win-win game.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sanctions are a lose-lose game.</seg>
<seg id="20">Zimbabwe deserves a restart.</seg>
<seg id="21">The West, specifically the US and the European Union (EU), imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe at the turn of the millennium in protest over the irreversible land reform programme that sought to correct land ownership imbalances that had been inherited from the racist colonial regime.</seg>
<seg id="22">Both the US and the EU claim to be champions of democracy and human rights, yet they are stifling economic growth in Zimbabwe through the maintenance of the racist sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="23">Analysts have suggested that the West was using the sanctions as a ploy to effect regime change through making living standards difficult in Zimbabwe so that citizens turn against their Government.</seg>
<seg id="24">The 39th SADC Summit of Heads of State and Government held in Tanzania noted the adverse impact on Zimbabwe's economy and the region at large, of the prolonged economic sanctions, and expressed solidarity.</seg>
<seg id="25">SADC called for the immediate lifting of the sanctions to facilitate socio-economic recovery in the country, and declared October 25th as the date on which SADC member States can collectively voice their disapproval of the sanctions through various activities and platforms until the sanctions are lifted.</seg>

<seg id="2">Caller Bob insisted MPs seeking to oppose Brexit in Parliament will soon realise they are in the "wrong" position.</seg>
<seg id="3">Members of Parliament have been engaged in a bitter battle with Boris Johnson and his Cabinet in an attempt to make sure Britain does not leave the European Union without an official agreement.</seg>
<seg id="4">Phoning in Mike Graham's show on talkRADIO, Bob said: "I think it's a watershed moment because the Brexit blockers in Parliament are beginning to show their true colours."</seg>
<seg id="5">It's not that they want a deal for Brexit, they just don't want Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="6">They're getting more and more outspoken and frustrated because they are beginning to realise they are fundamentally wrong.</seg>
<seg id="7">Bob continued: "The reason for that, the fundamental reason for that, is that they are defying the people of this country who are sovereign."</seg>
<seg id="8">It all goes back to one fundamental thing, this wonderful thing that we have in this country - that is our Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="9">A lot of people say we don't have a Constitution, well, we do.</seg>
<seg id="10">Boris Johnson on Thursday refused to apologise for describing attempts to block a no-deal break with the EU as the "surrender act."</seg>
<seg id="11">But the Prime Minister acknowledged that he would have to be able to "reach out" to opposition MPs if he was to secure their support for any new deal he negotiated with the EU.</seg>
<seg id="12">Speaking to BBC South, Mr Johnson said: "I need to reach out across the House of Commons."</seg>

<seg id="1">Trump Attacks Whistleblower Sources, Suggests Complaint Is Treason: Reports</seg>
<seg id="2">President Donald Trump on Thursday attacked anyone involved in the whistleblower complaint regarding his dealings with Ukraine as "almost a spy" and suggested their actions to expose his alleged impropriety were "treason," reported The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">The president made the remark as acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the House Intelligence Committee about the complaint, which prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Tuesday to announce the opening of an impeachment inquiry into Trump.</seg>
<seg id="4">The whistleblower, an unnamed U.S. intelligence officer, alleges several White House officials accused Trump of pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.</seg>
<seg id="5">Biden is a front-runner in the Democratic race to challenge Trump's reelection in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="6">The White House then attempted to cover up the exchange, according to the complaint.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Los Angeles Times posted audio of Trump's spy remarks he reportedly made in front of a crowd of staff from the United States Mission to the United Nations in New York City.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Basically, that person never saw the report, never saw the call, and he never saw the call - heard something and decided that he or she or whoever the hell it is - they're almost a spy," Trump said.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Who's the person who gave the whistleblower the information?</seg>
<seg id="10">Because that's close to a spy," the president continued.</seg>
<seg id="11">You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart with spies and treason, right?</seg>
<seg id="12">We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.</seg>
<seg id="13">No one in the U.S. has been convicted of treason ― a crime punishable by death ― in the last 70 years, according to NBC News.</seg>
<seg id="14">The House Intelligence Committee released the declassified complaint Thursday ahead of Maguire's hearing.</seg>
<seg id="15">The complainant alleges Trump's call with Zelensky amounted to an "abuse of his office for personal gain" and that White House officials were directed by White House lawyers to store a transcript of the call in an electronic system used to handle classified information.</seg>
<seg id="16">Maguire, whom Trump appointed to head the U.S. intelligence community last month, testified Thursday that he believed the whistleblower had "acted in good faith" when filing the complaint.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I have every reason to believe they have done everything by the book and followed the law," he told the committee.</seg>
<seg id="18">House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) condemned Trump's attacks on the whistleblower and his or her sources.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The President's suggestion that those involved in the whistleblower complaint should be dealt with as "we used to do" for "spies and treason" is a reprehensible invitation to violence against witnesses in our investigation," Schiff tweeted.</seg>
<seg id="20">All Americans must denounce such witness intimidation.</seg>

<seg id="1">Fife Flyers expect toughest test yet in Belfast Giants double-header</seg>
<seg id="2">Fife Flyers will face their toughest test of the season to date when they take on Belfast Giants in a Challenge Cup double-header this weekend.</seg>
<seg id="3">That's according to head coach Todd Dutiaume who wants his team to rise to the challenge against last season's Elite League champions, with a ferry trip to the Northern Irish capital on Saturday followed by the return match at Fife Ice Arena on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="4">"From what we've seen on tape, Belfast are an incredibly deep, well-rounded, physical and hard-working side," Dutes said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I imagine that will be our toughest challenge to date as a group, and we want to respond well to it.</seg>
<seg id="6">With a win and a defeat each, Flyers and Belfast both have two points after two games in Challenge Cup Group B.</seg>
<seg id="7">The weekend results could go a long way towards claiming a top three finish, and a quarter-final place.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Kirkcaldy side will need to find a way past former netminder Shane Owen, who moved to Belfast in the summer after an impressive season between the pipes in Fife.</seg>
<seg id="9">"We have a tremendous amount of respect not only for Shane but all our former players," Dutiaume said.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was recruited by an opposition team for a reason, and he seems to have settled in well there.</seg>
<seg id="11">I'm sure we'll have an opportunity to shake hands with him after the game, but up until that point it has to be business as usual.</seg>
<seg id="12">Instead of focusing on who we know or don't know, we have to be prepared to go into battle with these guys and grind out two crucial wins in the Challenge Cup.</seg>
<seg id="13">While the cup takes focus this weekend, Flyers have enjoyed a positive start to their league campaign, sitting top of the standings despite a 4-2 defeat in Guildford on Sunday that saw the team endure a 24-hour round bus trip.</seg>
<seg id="14">Depsite their early success, Dutiaume believes there is still room for improvement.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We've had a great start to the season, but we'd still like to be better at retrieving the puck, defensively, in all three areas of the ice," he explained.</seg>
<seg id="16">That's a work in progress.</seg>
<seg id="17">For instance, in the Nottingham game, all six players played a significant part in not only retaining possession but also getting it back when there was a turnover.</seg>
<seg id="18">It's a commitment to stick with the plan, and work hard in all aspects of the game.</seg>
<seg id="19">If the puck goes in people are fast to blame the goaltender or defencemen, but these are the last lines of defence.</seg>
<seg id="20">You need all guys on the ice, at all times, buying into playing on both sides of the puck and this is going to be key to our success.</seg>
<seg id="21">Sitting top of the standings is a good place to be, but if as a group we rest on that then we're all not doing our jobs.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to fight for the right to stay up around top of the table, and it takes a commitment every night.</seg>
<seg id="23">Dutiaume also stressed the importance of keeping five men on the ice after taking nine minor penalties in Guildford on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"We ran into early penalty trouble and that's a big momentum swinger," he said.</seg>
<seg id="25">We need to stay out of the box consistently because when you're on the back foot killing for big portions at the start of a hockey game, regardless if it's evened up later, you can lose that momentum quickly and it's hard to gain it back.</seg>
<seg id="26">All teams will talk about having a great start and making sure they take early steps to get a psychological and physical advantage.</seg>
<seg id="27">Dutiaume is also hoping his team can become more potent on the powerplay, adding: "Our powerplay is successful when we stick with it and stay patient, rather than trying to force passes because a team is killing great against us, and we end up getting ourselves isolated.</seg>
<seg id="28">We have an incredibly offensive bunch so the powerplay is not concerning, we just have to get comfortable with the system and make sure we're not standing around."</seg>

<seg id="1">Toyota said to be increasing stake in Subaru to more than 20%</seg>
<seg id="2">Toyota Motor plans to raise its stake in Subaru to more than 20% from around 17% now, a deal that would also see the smaller firm invest in Japan's top automaker, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The deal is due to be approved at a Toyota board meeting on Friday, the people said, declining to be identified because the information has not been made public.</seg>
<seg id="4">The investment would come a month after Toyota and another smaller Japanese automaker, Suzuki Motor, said they would take small equity stakes in each other.</seg>
<seg id="5">Such tie-ups highlight how automakers are scrambling to chase scale, manage costs and boost development.</seg>
<seg id="6">Traditional carmakers, especially smaller ones like Subaru and Suzuki, are struggling to meet the fast pace of change in an industry being transformed by the rise of electric vehicles, ride-hailing and autonomous driving.</seg>
<seg id="7">Toyota's investment is likely to cost more than 70 billion yen ($650 million) based on Subaru's stock market value, said the Nikkei business daily, which first reported the news.</seg>
<seg id="8">Subaru is likely to reciprocate with a stake in Toyota that would roughly equal the value of Toyota's additional investment, one of the people told Reuters.</seg>
<seg id="9">Representatives for both Toyota and Subaru said the news was not something that had been announced by their companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Subaru is particularly strong in sport-utility vehicles (SUV) and all-wheel-drive technology.</seg>
<seg id="11">The two automakers in June said they planned to jointly develop an electric sport-utility vehicle on a platform produced together, to split costs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Carmakers around the world have been joining forces to slash development and manufacturing costs of new technology.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ford Motor and Volkswagen have said they will spend billions of dollars to jointly develop electric and self-driving vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="14">Toyota seems to be particularly keen to build scale now by investing in smaller, domestic automakers, rather than forging cross-border tie-ups like some of its rivals.</seg>
<seg id="15">It has been looking to expand scale in next-generation technology and said this year it would offer free access to patents for electric vehicle motors and power control units.</seg>
<seg id="16">Shares of Toyota were down 0.9% while shares of Subaru fell 1.5% on Friday morning.</seg>

<seg id="2">Thunberg's U.N. speech inspires Dutch climate protesters</seg>
<seg id="3">THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Thousands of Dutch children skipped school to join a global climate strike on Friday, blocking traffic and asking their leaders "how dare you?" in a reference to Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg's speech at the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="4">A participant holds a drawing depicting Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg during a protest march to call for action against climate change, in The Hague, Netherlands September 27, 2019.</seg>
<seg id="5">Turnout at the march in The Hague exceeded expectations with organizers estimating the crowd at about 35,000.</seg>
<seg id="6">Police were forced to reroute the march to a location with more space.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thunberg, 16, gave an impassioned address at the United Nations in New York this week, after millions of people worldwide joined a climate strike protest last Friday in the run-up to a U.N. climate summit.</seg>
<seg id="8">"This strike is going to have a lot of effect when people keep showing up, not just today but also in the future and we see different kinds of people from all walks of life," said protester Reinder Rustema.</seg>
<seg id="9">Banging drums and holding pictures of Thunberg, protesters walked through the city center with placards reading: "For the Greta good," "Don't be a fossil fool," and "You will die of old age, we will die of climate change."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I understand their concerns, I believe they are being heard," Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told journalists at a weekly press briefing within earshot of the protests.</seg>
<seg id="11">We have presented very ambitious plans to deal with these problems.</seg>
<seg id="12">But we have to do it in a smart way, which also creates jobs.</seg>
<seg id="13">Thunberg's brief address electrified the start of the summit aimed at mobilizing government and business to break international paralysis over carbon emissions, which hit record highs last year despite decades of warnings from scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">How dare you?" she said, her voice quavering with emotion.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Netherlands, with 17 million inhabitants, generated less than 7 percent of all energy from sustainable sources in 2017, compared to 15 percent in Germany and over half of all energy in Sweden.</seg>
<seg id="16">The government has pledged to halve CO2 emissions from 1990 levels by 2030, but by 2017 had only achieved a 13 percent cut.</seg>
<seg id="17">Thunberg was taking part in a protest in Canada on Friday where U.N. aviation leaders were gathering in Montreal to discuss plane emissions targets.</seg>

<seg id="1">North Korea slams US "inaction" on lifting sanctions after nuclear talks</seg>
<seg id="2">North Korea accused the United States of doing nothing to implement issues agreed on at summits between US President Donald Trump and the country's leader, Kim Jong-un, but said it is placing hope in the US president's "wise option and bold decision."</seg>
<seg id="3">A statement from Foreign Ministry adviser Kim Kye Gwan circulated by North Korea's UN mission came days after Mr Trump said, without elaborating, that another summit meeting with Kim "could happen soon."</seg>
<seg id="4">"It draws my keen interest that it is highly topical these days in the US to hold another DPRK-US summit," the adviser said, using the initials of the country's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.</seg>
<seg id="5">But he was critical of US inaction since the summits.</seg>
<seg id="6">While past summits were "historic occasions" for the two leaders "to express their political will to put an end to the hostile relations between the two countries and have peace and stability settled on the Korean peninsula," Kim Kye Gwan said "no practical follow-up was made to implement the issues agreed upon at the summit talks."</seg>
<seg id="7">The Foreign Ministry adviser said North Korea "has made sincere efforts to build trust" and implement the joint Washington-Pyongyang statement issued after the first summit between Kim and Mr Trump in Singapore last year.</seg>
<seg id="8">He pointed to North Korea's repatriation of American detainees "who committed hostile acts" against the country and the return of remains of soldiers killed during the 1950-53 Korean War.</seg>
<seg id="9">"However, the US has done nothing for implementing the joint statement," the North Korean official said.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the contrary, he cited the resumption of US-South Korean military drills "which the US president personally pledged to suspend," and the ratcheting up of US sanctions against the North.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kim Kye Gwan said it is "hard reality" that politicians in Washington are obsessed with "nuclear disarmament first" by North Korea before sanctions can be lifted and the country "can get access to a bright future."</seg>
<seg id="12">The adviser said this makes him doubt whether "a new breakthrough" could take place in US-North Korean relations through another summit.</seg>
<seg id="13">But he left a door open.</seg>
<seg id="14">"I came to know that President Trump is different from his predecessors in political sense and decision while watching his approach to the DPRK, so I would like to place my hope on president Trump's wise option and bold decision," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">In his mid-70s, Kim Kye Gwan is a veteran diplomat who led the North Korean delegation at much of the now-dormant six-nation nuclear disarmament talks held in Beijing in 2003-2008.</seg>
<seg id="16">In his speech to the global gathering on Tuesday, Mr Trump briefly mentioned North Korea, saying the United States has pursued "bold diplomacy on the Korean Peninsula."</seg>
<seg id="17">"I have told Kim Jong-un what I truly believe: that, like Iran, his country is full of tremendous untapped potential, but that to realise that promise, North Korea must denuclearise," the US president said.</seg>
<seg id="18">North Korea entered talks with the United States last year, saying it was willing to negotiate away its advancing nuclear arsenal in exchange for security guarantees and sanctions relief.</seg>
<seg id="19">The North wants a step-by-step disarmament process, in which each of its denuclearisation step is matched by a corresponding US reward.</seg>
<seg id="20">The United States says sanctions on North Korea will remain in place until the country takes significant steps toward denuclearisation.</seg>
<seg id="21">During the Singapore summit, Kim Jong-un promised to work toward complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula without providing any timetable or road map for disarmament steps.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Singapore, Kim and Trump also agreed to establish new bilateral relations and build a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="23">They met again in Vietnam in February for a second summit.</seg>
<seg id="24">But that meeting abruptly fell apart after Mr Trump rejected Kim's request for extensive relief of sanctions in return for dismantling his main nuclear complex, a limited denuclearisation step.</seg>
<seg id="25">The two leaders held a brief, impromptu meeting at the Korean border in late June, and agreed to restart talks.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Prime Minister has attacked the SNP, saying he plans to introduce measures to "compensate for the grave inadequacies" of the Scottish government.</seg>
<seg id="3">Speaking ahead of the Conservative party conference, Boris Johnson said he would accelerate measures to create "a much stronger Scottish economy" whether there is a deal or no-deal Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="4">He also reiterated his strong opposition to a second Scottish independence referendum.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an interview with BBC Scotland, Mr Johnson said: "They have the highest taxes anywhere in the UK.</seg>
<seg id="6">They are not doing a good job on health, they are not doing a good job on education."</seg>
<seg id="7">First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon has supported the possibility of a second independence referendum.</seg>
<seg id="8">'I hope the money that we are now investing is properly spent on those services.</seg>
<seg id="9">And I hope that Scottish Conservatives get the credit they deserve for the hundreds of millions of extra funding that we're putting into Scottish agriculture which was secured, not by Nicola Sturgeon, but by Scottish Conservatives.'</seg>
<seg id="10">Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has already said she wants to have another referendum on leaving the UK in the second half of 2020, but Mr Johnson has previously stated his opposition to a second vote on the issue.</seg>
<seg id="11">He told BBC Scotland on Thursday: "We had an independence referendum in 2014 and we made an explicit promise to the people of Scotland that this was going to be a once-in-a-generation event.</seg>
<seg id="12">The people of Scotland voted very, very substantially to stay part of the UK, which was the right decision as this is the most successful union anywhere in the world.</seg>
<seg id="13">They were promised this was a once-in-a-generation thing and I think we should stick with that."</seg>
<seg id="14">Writing on Twitter on Wednesday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon described Mr Johnson as "untrustworthy, craven, not a shred of concern for the consequences of his words or actions."</seg>
<seg id="15">She tweeted: "The Westminster opposition should unite around a plan to trigger the no confidence process to bring Johnson's government down, ensure the Benn Act is honoured and enable a General Election as quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="16">Doing nothing should not be an option."</seg>

<seg id="2">The Zimbabwean government has given the family of the late former president Robert Mugabe a go ahead to bury him in Zvimba communal lands, Mashonaland West, instead of a so-called mausoleum being constructed at the National Heroes Acre.</seg>
<seg id="3">In an interview, Information Secretary, Nick Mangwana, said the family has a right to designate the burial place of the former Zimbabwean leader, who died of cancer on September 6th in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="4">The family of the late former President R. G. Mugabe has expressed its desire to proceed with his burial in Zvimba.</seg>
<seg id="5">In line with government policy to respect the wishes of families of deceased heroes, government is cooperating with the Mugabe family in their new position.</seg>
<seg id="6">Government will render all the necessary support to give the late former president a fitting burial as led by the family.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reacting to the latest development on Mugabe's burial, Maureen Kademaunga of the Movement for Democratic Change led by Nelson Chamisa, told VOA Zimbabwe Service that the late former president's burial saga will cost the nation huge sums of money as a mausoleum being built in Harare has been abandoned without proper consultations with relevant stakeholders.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Mugabe family had said they don't want anything to do with the heroes acre.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is something they were saying from the day he was declared dead.</seg>
<seg id="10">So, they just went ahead and did that thing.</seg>
<seg id="11">So they flushed money down the drain ... Our members of parliament are going to be demanding accountability.</seg>
<seg id="12">We want to know how much money had gone into that project and how they are going to replace that money.</seg>

<seg id="2">Antonio Caruso can see a lot of resemblances between AFL and fighting one-on-one inside a cage.</seg>
<seg id="3">On face value the sports are polar opposites, but the training and mental dedication needed to succeed run on tight parallel.</seg>
<seg id="4">And a new life in Florida, sparring with the world's fighters in preparation for his ONE Championship MMA debut, has surprising throwbacks to his amateur football days at Salisbury West.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Imagine you're playing in the AFL but you're training with an amateur club, then you go out on a Saturday and play with the AFL boys," he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Of course you can kick and catch the same, but the temper, the pace, it's not the same.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some days I'll walk away, some rounds I've lost badly, but previous to that, back home, I was never getting challenged.</seg>
<seg id="8">The reflection was born on the back of a hard training session run by former UFC welterweight champion Robbie Lawler at Hard Knocks MMA gym - Carusos's home away form home.</seg>
<seg id="9">The undefeated 28-year-old said the grinding work has him primed to take out Mongolian Amarsanaa Tsogookhuu in Jakarta on October 25.</seg>
<seg id="10">"You can be on the mat at any one time with three or four champions, mixing it up with them," he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">That's the biggest change here, there's no easy rounds, there's no easy work.</seg>
<seg id="12">I can't run before a sparring session and then go spar, these guys will run rings around me.</seg>
<seg id="13">But I feed off of it.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tsogookhuu (5W-1L) made his pro debut in 2016 and won the MGL-1 lightweight championship title in October, before making the move to Asia's biggest MMA promotion.</seg>
<seg id="15">But under the guidance of head coach Henri Hooft, Caruso feels like a new man.</seg>
<seg id="16">Henri's so advanced as a coach and he's seen it all, fighters from the best days to their worst days.</seg>
<seg id="17">"You can't buy that type of experience," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">(Tsogookhuu) has grown up different to me, but it terms of skills and ability, he's tough and has what it takes, but it won't be enough.</seg>
<seg id="19">He's going to be strong, but that doesn't hold you too long in this game.</seg>

<seg id="2">Long jumper M Sreeshankar failed to reach the final after a disappointing performance while 400m hurdler MP Jabir made it to the semifinals on the opening day of the World Athletics Championships in Doha on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Another 400m hurdler Dharun Ayyasamy, the national record holder, tumbled after the last hurdle in his heat to fail to qualify for the semifinals.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 20-year-old Sreeshankar could only produce a best jump of 7.62m from his three attempts in the qualification B to finish 22nd overall.</seg>
<seg id="5">His effort was well below his season's best of 8.00m, which he had produced only last month in Patiala.</seg>
<seg id="6">Later in the day, Jabir finished third in the heat number one and 11th overall in men's 400m hurdle with a time of 49.62 seconds to qualify for the semifinals to be held on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="7">He has a season's and personal best of 49.13.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ayyasamy could only clock 50.55 as he lost precious time after hitting the final hurdle.</seg>
<seg id="9">He finished sixth in heat number five and 27th overall to miss out of the semifinals.</seg>
<seg id="10">Ayyasamy, who had recovered from an injury recently, has a personal and season's best of 48.80.</seg>
<seg id="11">The first four in each of the five heats and the next four fastest qualify for the 400m hurdles semifinals.</seg>
<seg id="12">The first Indian to take the field on Friday was Sreeshankar, who has a personal best and national record of 8.20m.</seg>
<seg id="13">He began with a 7.52m before clearing 7.62m.</seg>
<seg id="14">He then fouled his third and final jump to end his campaign in disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The automatic mark for the finals was set at 8.15m but only one jumper could touch it.</seg>
<seg id="16">The 11 other best performers went through to the finals with the least distance making the cut was 7.89m.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sreeshankar's 7.62m effort here was his second worst this season.</seg>
<seg id="18">He had 7.53m in the qualifying round of the National Inter-State Championships in Lucknow last month.</seg>
<seg id="19">This season, he has been consistent around 7.80m with three jumps in the 7.90s, besides the 8.00m in Patiala on August 16.</seg>

<seg id="10">NYT correspondent Peter Baker muses that Karen Pence wields a lot of influence over her husband, who refuses to meet alone with women unless his wife is present.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mike Pence, an Evangelical Christian, infamously said in 2002 that he "never eats alone with a woman other than his wife and that he won't attend events featuring alcohol without her by his side."</seg>
<seg id="12">Critics slammed Mike Pence for the comment when it resurfaced in 2017, saying it suggested he doesn't see women as professional equals and that women who work for him aren't given the same opportunities as men.</seg>

<seg id="2">Meghan Markle is determined to 'fulfil her heart's desires' and not let her own needs 'fade away' now she's a member of the Royal Family - and wants to be a role model for young boys as well as girls.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Duchess of Sussex, 38, reportedly made the remarks during an event for inspiring female entrepreneurs at Woodstock Exchange in Cape Town earlier this week during her tour of South Africa with husband Prince Harry.</seg>
<seg id="4">Woodstock Exchange, the UK-SA Tech Hub, focuses on skills development and access to markets by assisting entrepreneurs, particularly women, to acquire skills, resources and support.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Ladies Who Launch meeting saw the former actress, 38, meet with several women who have set up their own businesses in industries such as technology, conservation and fashion and praise them for 'empowering the next generation' of creative minds.</seg>
<seg id="6">During a conversation with the female tech founders Meghan, who has campaigned vigorously for the empowerment of young women and girls, said she hopes to do the same for young men.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mother-of-two Naadiya Moosajee, a South African engineer, social entrepreneur and co-founder of Women in Engineering, revealed: 'We acknowledged the importance of not just education for girls but being role models for boys - that we are women who are influential and who boys can look up to as well,' People reports.</seg>
<seg id="8">We both have sons, and we were bearing in mind that we are not just role models for girls but boys - and not just our sons, but generally in public too.</seg>
<seg id="9">She added that having Meghan present 'didn't feel hierarchical', as it was 'women gathered together and a talk about the struggles we have, as well as the things we need to do to move forward and grow and change our societies'.</seg>
<seg id="10">Matsi Modise, founder of skills training company Simodisa, said Meghan is determined to continue to champion the issues close to her heart despite being a member of the Fold.</seg>
<seg id="11">'She talked about being a mother and having duties as a duchess and fulfilling what her heart desires - and that it can't just fade away now that you're a duchess,' Modise recalled.</seg>
<seg id="12">That you have to be true to who you are.</seg>
<seg id="13">She said the duchess pushed them to plough ahead with their new ideas and spoke about how they have to keep pushing and going forward, knowing they are doing it for others who will follow.</seg>
<seg id="14">'She wasn't referring to being a royal, but life in general when you have challenges,' Modise added, admitting she felt a bit 'awestruck' by Meghan.</seg>
<seg id="15">'She radiates grace and she is taking this task that she has with such grace,' Modise said.</seg>
<seg id="16">A lot of us have done amazing things as founders, but meeting a royal is quite daunting.</seg>
<seg id="17">She made it easy.</seg>
<seg id="18">She is an easy-going royal.</seg>
<seg id="19">Meghan also revealed she's enjoying the pressures of being a working mother, admitting she finds juggling being a royal and looking after baby Archie 'a lot' but 'all so exciting'.</seg>
<seg id="20">Speaking to mother-of-two Lara Rosmarin, CEO of Cape Innovation and Technology, Meghan said: 'We're only five months in right now.</seg>
<seg id="21">'There are days when it's a lot to juggle but then you meet someone and you have an impact on them and you say "ah-ha," and it's so rewarding.'</seg>

<seg id="1">Immanuel Christian School: Sixth-grade boys accused of pinning down black girl and cutting off her dreadlocks in Virginia</seg>
<seg id="2">A black middle school student from Virginia is accusing three white boys of pinning her down and cutting off her dreadlocks.</seg>
<seg id="3">The incident took place at Immanuel Christian School - where Vice President Mike Pence's wife, Karen Pence, is a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="4">Amari Allen, a 12-year-old student at the private K-12 Christian school, said the boys called her dreadlocks "ugly" and "nappy" before cutting them off on the playground during recess.</seg>
<seg id="5">"They kept laughing and calling me names," Amari told CBS affiliate WUSA-TV, tearing up.</seg>
<seg id="6">They called me 'ugly,' said, 'I shouldn't have been born.'</seg>
<seg id="7">They called me 'an attention-seeker.'</seg>
<seg id="8">According to WUSA, one of the boys allegedly covered Amari's mouth while another held her hands behind her back and a third took a pair of scissors to her dreadlocks.</seg>
<seg id="9">Amari didn't tell her family about the incident until after her grandmother noticed the length of her hair had changed.</seg>
<seg id="10">"They ran off laughing, and I was just sitting there," Amari said.</seg>
<seg id="11">The alleged incident occurred on Monday, but the shy preteen said she didn't tell her family about it until Wednesday, after her grandmother noticed her hair looked different.</seg>
<seg id="12">She feared retaliation if she confessed the truth, she said.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It's very painful," said Cynthia Allen, Amari's grandmother.</seg>
<seg id="14">I want to see them dismissed from the school.</seg>
<seg id="15">I want to see something done.</seg>
<seg id="16">Allen's family pays nearly $12,000 per year for Amari to attend the school, which made headlines earlier this year after Karen Pence took an art teaching job at the famously anti-LGBTQ institution.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We take seriously the emotional and physical well-being of all our students, and have a zero-tolerance policy for any kind of bullying or abuse," Immanuel Christian School said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="18">We are deeply disturbed by the allegations being made, and are in communication with the family of the alleged victim to gather information and provide whatever support we can.</seg>
<seg id="19">We have also reached out to law enforcement to ask them to conduct a thorough investigation, and further inquiries should be directed to the Fairfax County Police.</seg>
<seg id="20">While the school has a zero-tolerance policy for bullying, Amari said the boys had previously tormented her.</seg>
<seg id="21">She said that the boys have taken her lunch and called her names in the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">Amari's family met with school officials Thursday, and the investigation is ongoing.</seg>

<seg id="2">The committee decided against renewing Arthur's contract, which paved the way for Misbah to be named the country's chief selector and new head coach.</seg>
<seg id="3">Arthur said he had supported the participation of both Wasim and Misbah on the committee but was disappointed with the decision after placing his trust in them.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I guess the only disappointment I have out of the whole lot is that there were some people I really trusted who ultimately didn't follow through," said Arthur during the interview.</seg>
<seg id="5">"And it just happened to be that Misbah was on the committee that didn't renew our contracts and becomes this heir-apparent," he added.</seg>
<seg id="6">Arthur refused to speak ill of Misbah in the interview.</seg>
<seg id="7">Misbah will do a good job, Misbah is a good guy and Pakistan cricket made their decision.</seg>
<seg id="8">I was disappointed because I loved every second of that job.</seg>
<seg id="9">The comments caused a stir in Pakistani media, where cricket gossip is widely reported.</seg>
<seg id="10">Speaking to AFP by phone from Perth, said he had the right to speak his mind after faithfully serving the team for three years.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I was dignified in my comments because I love Pakistan, the players I worked with, spent time with for three years and respect Misbah and Wasim," Arthur told AFP.</seg>
<seg id="12">I felt disappointed because I had some unfinished business to do with the Pakistan team and would have loved to continue.</seg>

<seg id="14">Wasim and Misbah both defended their actions following the World Cup.</seg>

<seg id="1">Passenger caught urinating on Sydney train</seg>
<seg id="2">Disgusting video footage has emerged of a passenger urinating on a Sydney train as horrified school students watch just metres away.</seg>
<seg id="3">A video of the incident, which occurred at around 8.30am this morning on a train travelling between Werrington and Kingswood, was posted to Facebook by Sydney woman Jordy Lee.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Share this pig around," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="5">Doing this in front of kids on their way to school this morning.</seg>
<seg id="6">The footage shows a male passenger, believed to be in his late teens, leaning against a pole near the carriage doors and urinating onto the ground.</seg>
<seg id="7">The footage was filmed by two students as a way of exposing the man's vile behaviour, according to the Penrith Press.</seg>
<seg id="8">The kids' mum then posted it to Facebook, telling the publication she was left in disgust by the whole incident.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I am in total shock that this happened in peak hour on a Friday morning in front of children just going to school," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's an absolutely disgusting thing to do; my dog wouldn't even do that.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her children told her the man was laying on the seats asleep when they got on, then during the trip he got up and started urinating on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="12">When he was done he reportedly sat back on a seat and fell asleep again.</seg>
<seg id="13">Facebook users flocked to the post to call out the passenger for his disgusting behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="14">"What an animal!" one person said.</seg>
<seg id="15">That is properly disgusting.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mate take a leak before you leave the house," another wrote.</seg>
<seg id="17">A Sydney Trains spokesperson told news.com.au that passengers should report this type of behaviour immediately.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Sydney Trains encourages customers to remain courteous to others while travelling on our network," they said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Incidents such as this are rare, however we encourage customers who witness behaviour like this to report it to Train Guards or station staff immediately.</seg>

<seg id="2">Stephen Ferris says Jack Carty's selection against Japan is a reward for his consistency of performance over the past year with both Connacht and Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 27-year old Carty only made his international debut in late February, as a late replacement in Ireland's rather unconvincing victory over Italy in the Six Nations.</seg>
<seg id="4">He has appeared eight times since then, impressing on each occasion, including a delightful performance on being introduced in the second half of Ireland's demolition of Scotland on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Carty has been handed his second international start against Japan on Saturday, the first coming in the World Cup warm-up win over Wales in Cardiff late last month.</seg>
<seg id="6">A few years back, there was a host of out-half candidates vying for the tag of understudy to Johnny Sexton, and the Athlone-born out-half has emerged from the pack to challenge Joey Carbery for the role.</seg>
<seg id="7">Speaking on the RTÉ Rugby Podcast, Ferris argues that Carty has been the most "consistent" out-half in the Irish system across 2019 - including Johnny Sexton.</seg>
<seg id="8">I thought he was absolutely superb (against Scotland).</seg>
<seg id="9">He recognised the Scottish defence and what he was up against.</seg>
<seg id="10">He played heads up rugby at times.</seg>
<seg id="11">His kicking game was pretty solid, he looked half decent in defence when he was called upon.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would say Carty has been probably the most consistent out-half within the Irish system for the last year or so.</seg>
<seg id="13">He's been superb.</seg>
<seg id="14">Week in, week out, he's never really let his side down.</seg>
<seg id="15">The likes of Sexton...</seg>
<seg id="16">Johnny has had a couple of bad games over the last year or so.</seg>
<seg id="17">He's been out injured.</seg>
<seg id="18">He's been a little bit more inconsistent.</seg>
<seg id="19">Whereas Carty has been really, really steady.</seg>
<seg id="20">Against a Japanese team that are going to come out firing, they're going to bring huge support, maybe it is that steady hand that you need.</seg>
<seg id="21">Maybe it is that game management.</seg>
<seg id="22">I feel that he won't let Joe down.</seg>
<seg id="23">I'm really excited to see him go out there, starting a game and seeing how he manages the whole situation.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is such a big game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Japan are our biggest threat I feel in the rest of the group.</seg>
<seg id="26">But in saying that, I can't see a Japan team beating us the way the confidence and momentum is with the Irish team at the minute.</seg>

<seg id="2">In 2016, Matthew de Grood, the man who killed five people at a house party in Calgary, was found to be not criminally responsible for his actions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now, in 2019, there is a hearing to determine whether or not he should be allowed more freedoms, such as unsupervised outings.</seg>
<seg id="4">The decision won't come for a few more weeks, so in the meantime we're left to wonder whether or not this is a good idea.</seg>
<seg id="5">There are two sides to this: one citing his violent behaviour in the past, calling to prevent it from happening again, and the other side which believes in the power of change and rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="6">First, let's examine the more pessimistic side.</seg>
<seg id="7">De Grood did stab and kill five people during a psychotic break.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was a violent and unpredictable attack.</seg>
<seg id="9">He suffers from schizophrenia, which is why he was found not criminally responsible, but has since been seeing a psychiatrist and taking his medication.</seg>
<seg id="10">His psychiatrist, Dr. Santoch Rai, has said in front of the review board that "if Matthew de Grood were to commit another offence, it would be severe."</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite his perceived improvement, there is still risk of re-offense.</seg>
<seg id="12">But is this reason enough to remain afraid?</seg>
<seg id="13">Is it enough to keep de Grood locked up?</seg>
<seg id="14">As long as de Grood continues to take his medication, there isn't a huge risk of reoffense, so why are people so concerned?</seg>
<seg id="15">I believe the stigma surrounding people with mental illness, particularly those with schizophrenia, largely influences this fear.</seg>
<seg id="16">Certain mental illnesses have become less stigmatized, such as mood and anxiety disorders.</seg>
<seg id="17">But others, including schizophrenia, remain highly stigmatized.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is in large part due to numerous portrayals of schizophrenics as dangerous people with voices in their heads telling them to kill people.</seg>
<seg id="19">That was the case in this situation, but these instances are rare, and that's perhaps why we remember them so well when they occur.</seg>
<seg id="20">In fact, the majority of schizophrenic individuals are nonviolent, and are more likely to be the victims rather than the perpetrators of crime or violence.</seg>
<seg id="21">In light of this, it seems unreasonable to insist that de Grood be denied certain freedoms when the fear of re-offense is based more on a prejudiced attitude towards people with schizophrenia than actual likelihood.</seg>
<seg id="22">I don't believe de Grood should ever be unsupervised permanently.</seg>
<seg id="23">A parole-like system where he has to check in to make sure he's still taking his medication could work well.</seg>
<seg id="24">Arguing that he or other mentally ill people remain institutionalized unless absolutely necessary is a form of segregation.</seg>
<seg id="25">It perpetuates the idea that mentally ill people, those with schizophrenia in particular, cannot ever mesh with society; thus continuing the stigma and perpetuating the idea that they are dangerous criminals.</seg>
<seg id="26">He was found not criminally responsible by a court of law, so why should he be treated like a prisoner instead of someone who was ill and is now better?</seg>

<seg id="2">Clackmannanshire: Alva Academy has raised more than £300,000 for Macmillan.</seg>
<seg id="3">Macmillan Cancer Support's top fundraising school in the UK is celebrating the charity's 'World's Biggest Coffee Morning'.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pupils and staff at Alva Academy will welcome the Clackmannanshire community to the school for a day for fun, games, tea, coffee and cake.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dozens of fundraising coffee mornings are taking place across Scotland on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Alva - located at the foot of the Ochil Hills within Scotland's smallest council area - has raised more than £300,000 for Macmillan since 2004.</seg>
<seg id="7">Over the years staff and pupils have organised events such as bake sales, bingo teas, sponsored silences and ceilidhs to raise money.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last year, more than 1000 miles were walked, 1000 miles cycled and 101,450ft climbed - earning the school the prestigious Douglas Macmillan Award.</seg>
<seg id="9">This year, pupils have already taken part in the likes of skiathons, swimathons, hill walks, dog walks and bungee jumps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Their epic fundraising will come to a close following the coffee morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">Teacher David Clifford, who previously accepted a UK Government Point of Light award at 10 Downing Street on behalf of the school, said: "Everything has gone swimmingly this year."</seg>
<seg id="12">We have had a record number of sponsored events including a mass skiathon, swimathon, Ben Nevis walk, bungee jumps, dog walk, days of dance, football and a readathon.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have taken musicians to four different care homes to entertain and held a bingo tea.</seg>
<seg id="14">We have had our annual ceilidh - raising over £1000, bake sales, duck races and much, much more.</seg>
<seg id="15">Top team: The epic fundraising is led by the charity committee comprising of David Clifford, Kirsty Clifford and Shiona Finn.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Clifford - who has written a song to soundtrack a Macmillan video which will follow the school's thank you assembly - said there is never any pressure to beat a previous total.</seg>
<seg id="17">Instead, the school believes the most valuable thing the youths can give is their time.</seg>
<seg id="18">He stated: "Yes, it will be nice to raise a huge sum of money - but the money is simply a wonderful by-product of what we do and why."</seg>
<seg id="19">Just seeing our pupils embracing our values of respect, determination and service is enough for us.</seg>

<seg id="2">Regional health authorities are calling on Italy's government to allow them to recruit retired doctors and keep those older than 65 working until they're 70, as a means of tackling their serious shortages of medical practitioners.</seg>
<seg id="3">Short-staffed hospitals across Italy are pushing for the retirement age of the country's physicians to be extended to the age of 70 in their regions.</seg>
<seg id="4">The proposal is part of a 16-point document to be presented to Italy's Ministry of Health in the coming days which aims for there to be a "regulatory amendment on age limits for the retirement of medical personnel."</seg>
<seg id="5">Currently doctors in Italy can retire once they've turned 65 or having worked for 40 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">Struggling regional governments are calling for those "who reach 40 years of service at 66-67 years and would like to continue working" to do so.</seg>
<seg id="7">Italy's ageing medical workforce is somewhat of a sleeping giant.</seg>
<seg id="8">By 2025, 38,000 doctors will have retired (45,000 if you include general practitioners), causing a shortage that will be further aggravated by the fact that Italian universities are not able to train enough graduates to supply hospitals with specialists.</seg>
<seg id="9">The regional health councils' proposal therefore also includes a measure proposing young medical graduates who haven't chosen a specialization yet to be recruited more easily as GPs.</seg>
<seg id="10">Closely tied to this is the idea of regions offering specialist training scholarships which include a fixed contract at the end to young doctors, as well as forging a closer working relationship between local health authorities and universities, all as a means of speeding up the recruitment process in Italy's struggling health sector.</seg>
<seg id="11">Regions such as Veneto have in fact already tried to take matters into their own hands by headhunting retired physicians.</seg>
<seg id="12">Molise in the south has called on army doctors to help out and Tuscany has started recruiting younger doctors.</seg>

<seg id="2">Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, speaking on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday, said the United States has concluded the Syrian government used chemical weapons in an attack earlier this year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Pompeo said U.S. officials had determined Syrian President Bashar Assad's government had used chlorine in the attack on opposition forces in Idlib province on May 19.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The Assad regime is responsible for innumerable atrocities some of which rise to the level of war crimes and crimes against humanity," Pompeo told a news conference.</seg>
<seg id="5">U.S. officials in May said they'd received reports consistent with a chemical attack in northwest Syria but did not offer a definitive conclusion at the time.</seg>
<seg id="6">In April 2018, the U.S., Britain and France launched airstrikes in Syria in retaliation for what they described as a suspected chemical attack that killed more than 40 people earlier that month.</seg>
<seg id="7">"This is different in some sense because it was chlorine... but know that President Trump has been pretty vigorous in protecting the world from the use of chemical weapons," Pompeo said.</seg>
<seg id="8">He added that the U.S. would provide an additional $4.5 million to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to fund investigations into other instances of suspected Syrian chemical-weapons use.</seg>
<seg id="9">Pompeo also called on the Assad government to release thousands of unjustly detained prisoners, including American journalist Austin Tice, who has been missing and presumed held by the government for seven years.</seg>
<seg id="10">He is just one of a number of American citizens held in Syria and we call upon the Syrian regime to release them all.</seg>

<seg id="1">Uber overhauls app in quest to build 'operating system for everyday life'</seg>
<seg id="2">Uber has announced a slew of updates to its app - including consolidating its food delivery and ride-hailing services, and a new feature highlighting local public transportation options - in a bid to create "an operating system for everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="3">Uber announced the more than 25 changes to its platform at a launch event in San Francisco on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Among the tech company's most significant moves will be merging its ride-hailing app and food-delivery app Uber Eats, and offering users alternative travel information including bikes, scooters, public transportation, and even helicopters in some locations.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We recognize that becoming an integral part of people's lives comes with real responsibility," Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said.</seg>
<seg id="6">That's why we are working to make sure every customer is treated like a VIP, every driver and courier feels like a valued partner, and every city feels like we're a good citizen.</seg>
<seg id="7">When riders search for a destination, they will see travel options listed in order of price, including public transit as well as electric bikes and scooters.</seg>
<seg id="8">This means cheaper options such as subway and bus schedules may appear at the top of the list, and riders can request notifications when trains or buses they track are delayed.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new transit feature is live in Denver and London and will soon be operational in San Francisco, Mexico City, and Paris.</seg>
<seg id="10">It might seem unexpected for Uber to be guiding users away from taking a car, but the company has long harbored ambitions to become an all-encompassing transit platform.</seg>
<seg id="11">"To some extent, we're competing against ourselves," Khosrowshahi told the Verge of adding public transit options.</seg>
<seg id="12">But we have the philosophy that if there's a better product out there for the user, and we think an integrated movement solution is better for the user, we should be the ones competing against ourselves versus others doing it.</seg>
<seg id="13">Uber Eats will also open more "digital-only restaurants" - businesses with no brick-and-mortar outlet where customers can only order food from on the app.</seg>
<seg id="14">One digital restaurant comes through a partnership with the celebrity chef Rachael Ray and will be available in 10 cities for 10 weeks exclusively on Uber Eats.</seg>
<seg id="15">Uber's big changes come as the company struggles to turn a profit months after it went public in May.</seg>
<seg id="16">In August, Uber cut 400 jobs as it attempted to rein in excessive spending and losses.</seg>
<seg id="17">In August the company reported its largest-ever quarterly loss: $5bn in three months.</seg>
<seg id="18">Meanwhile, new regulatory hurdles threaten to raise the company's operating costs by changing how drivers are paid.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the two-hour event, Uber did not mention Assembly Bill 5, a new law passed in September that will upend the way gig economy workers in California, including drivers, are remunerated, as well as the benefits they are entitled to.</seg>
<seg id="20">Uber, its competitor Lyft, and other gig economy startups have announced a plan to fight the bill with a 2020 ballot measure.</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition to platform integrations and Uber Eats changes, Uber made a number of safety updates to the app.</seg>
<seg id="22">Riders will now use a four-digit PIN to verify they are entering the correct car.</seg>
<seg id="23">Uber said it is developing an "ultrasound wave" technology so in the future the app can automatically verify riders are in the right car without a PIN number.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the app, riders will now have a "Report Safety Incident" option and the ability to text 911 in case of emergency.</seg>
<seg id="25">The company updated its "real-time ID check" feature introduced in 2016, requiring drivers to take selfies to verify identities.</seg>
<seg id="26">The changes come after Uber was sued for $10m in April by a woman who was sexually assaulted by her driver.</seg>
<seg id="27">A number of women announced last week they were bringing lawsuits against Lyft over drivers sexually assaulting them.</seg>
<seg id="28">The victim in the case against Uber alleges that the company failed to "warn her of the risk its services posed to women."</seg>
<seg id="29">A CNN report last year found at least 103 Uber drivers in the US had been accused of sexually assaulting or abusing their passengers over a period of four years.</seg>
<seg id="30">Uber also announced an expansion of its Uber Rewards program, which allows customers to redeem points when taking an Uber ride, ordering Uber Eats, or spending with partner restaurants.</seg>

<seg id="1">Boris Johnson's tax cuts will cost £26billion a year</seg>
<seg id="2">The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) challenged Boris Johnson's flagship policy</seg>
<seg id="3">Warned giveaway "risks putting the public finances on an unsustainable path"</seg>
<seg id="4">Treasury spokesman said: "Any decisions would be for the Chancellor to take"</seg>
<seg id="5">The Prime Minister's proposed tax cuts will cost up to £26billion a year and mainly benefit wealthier households, the UK's leading economic think-tank warns today.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) challenged Boris Johnson's flagship policy to lift the thresholds for both higher rate income tax and National Insurance.</seg>
<seg id="7">It warned the giveaway "risks putting the public finances on an unsustainable path," given the risk of leaving the EU without a deal.</seg>
<seg id="8">Echoing criticism made by opposition parties, the think-tank also concluded most of the tax cuts would go to those on higher incomes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The intervention will heap pressure on Mr Johnson to water down the tax-cutting commitment he made during the Tory leadership campaign, which he is gambling on to be a big vote winner when a general election is called.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr Johnson pledged to raise the threshold for paying higher rate income tax in England, Wales and Northern Ireland from £50,000 to £80,000.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said he wanted to help the "huge numbers" of middle income households which have been dragged into paying the 40 per cent higher rate of tax.</seg>
<seg id="12">The number of people paying higher rate tax has more than doubled from 1.6million in 1990 to 3.8million.</seg>
<seg id="13">In its report, the IFS said the PM's proposed tax cut would cost the Treasury up to £9billion a year if introduced immediately and would take 2.5million people out of paying 40 per cent higher rate tax.</seg>
<seg id="14">It described it as a "substantial and expensive tax cut from which only those on high incomes would gain."</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Johnson has also outlined plans to raise the point at which National Insurance kicks in, currently set at £8,632.</seg>
<seg id="16">The IFS calculated that every £1,000 rise in the threshold would cost £4billion if they were increased in tandem.</seg>
<seg id="17">Increasing all the thresholds to £12,500 in line with the personal allowance for income tax would cost £17billion a year, it warned.</seg>
<seg id="18">The report said only 3 per cent of gains would go to the poorest 20 per cent of households as so many do not earn enough to pay national insurance, or are unemployed.</seg>
<seg id="19">The IFS stressed the annual bill for Mr Johnson's tax cuts could range between £10billion and £20billion, if the tax cuts are phased in more gradually.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world's largest coffee company said in a statement Friday that it had found glyphosate residues close to the maximum allowed in some deliveries of green coffee beans.</seg>
<seg id="3">Glyphosate is the key ingredient in Monsanto's weedkiller, Roundup.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the United States, juries have awarded huge monetary damages to people who say their cancer was caused by exposure to glyphosate.</seg>
<seg id="5">Bayer, which owns Monsanto, says the herbicide is safe when used properly, as does the US Environmental Protection Agency.</seg>
<seg id="6">Neumann Kaffee Gruppe (NKG), one of the world's largest traders, said glyphosate was one of a number of substances it monitored on the coffee it buys.</seg>
<seg id="7">Nestle buys some of its coffee beans from NKG.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was too early to say what consequences Nestle's tighter controls would have on NKG, a spokesperson said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Nestle's (NSRGF) decision to increase the frequency of checks was unlikely to disrupt global coffee supply chains, a spokesperson said.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This is not a new process, we are just reinforcing controls," the spokesperson told CNN Business.</seg>
<seg id="11">Tests were done before the coffee was shipped from the countries of origin.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nestle would start with suppliers in Indonesia and Brazil, since these countries are among the world's biggest coffee producers.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Our agronomists will continue to work with coffee farmers to help them improve their weed management practices, including the appropriate use of herbicides and adoption of other weeding methods," the Swiss company said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Brands such as Nescafe and Nespresso make up a sizable chunk of Nestle's powdered and liquid beverages business, which generated sales of 21.6 billion Swiss francs ($21.7 billion) in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nestle last year agreed a deal to sell Starbucks' packaged coffees and teas around the world.</seg>
<seg id="16">Does glyphosate cause cancer?</seg>
<seg id="17">Glyphosate is used on more than 100 food crops, according to the EPA.</seg>
<seg id="18">Scientists at an environmental advocacy group with links to the organic food industry say several popular breakfast cereals contain doses of the chemical that are higher than they consider safe for children.</seg>
<seg id="19">Still, the EPA says glyphosate is not a carcinogen and that it poses no public health risks.</seg>
<seg id="20">Ecological risks include damage to pollinators and the problem of weed resistance, the EPA said in a statement in April.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that has not stopped thousands of people from filing lawsuits against Monsanto alleging that exposure to Roundup caused them or their loved ones to develop cancer.</seg>
<seg id="22">Earlier this year, a jury ordered Bayer to pay a California couple $2 billion in damages after they claimed that Roundup, used on their property for more than three decades, had given them both Non-Hodgkin lymphoma within four years of one other.</seg>
<seg id="23">Bayer is contesting the verdict.</seg>
<seg id="24">A 2015 study by the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer found that glyphosate was "probably carcinogenic to humans," based on "limited" evidence of cancer in humans and "sufficient" evidence of cancer in experimental animals.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, a joint panel of the WHO and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization later concluded that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans from exposure through diet.</seg>

<seg id="2">Somalia is "the perfect example of the success of the multilateral system," President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed told the UN General Assembly on Thursday, while acknowledging that the Horn of Africa country still needed international and regional support and cooperation, particularly to deal with threats from Al-Shabab.</seg>
<seg id="3">Somalia's progress towards reconstruction was moving ahead, but Mr. Mohamad said "one cannot remain deaf and blind" to pockets of global discontent and the effects of poverty, inequality and unfair globalization.</seg>
<seg id="4">He noted that Somalia played a leading role in the socio-economic development of the Horn of Africa and expressed confidence that cooperation among countries in the region would only strengthen political stability and social and cultural connectivity.</seg>
<seg id="5">He went on to express his country's pride after the success of the regional elections in some of the Federated States ahead of the 2021 presidential and legislative elections.</seg>
<seg id="6">And while he called Somalia "historic" example of reform, resilience and commitment to progress and reconstruction, he cautioned that despite tangible progress, the country still faced many challenges, first and foremost those related to security, on which "everything depends."</seg>
<seg id="7">"With the help of our international partners, we are striving to rid ourselves of the last pockets of violent extremism and terrorism," he said, stressing that the task would not be easy, especially given the "violence, cowardice and opportunistic guerilla tactics of Al Shabab."</seg>
<seg id="8">But Mr. Mohamed said he is confident that with the help of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and other partners, his country will regain stability, which was in the interest of the region and the world.</seg>
<seg id="9">Turning to one of the key issues before Member States, climate change, he said Somalia which had the longest coastline on the African continent, was already experiencing the effects of rising waters and temperatures.</seg>
<seg id="10">Somalia was also impacted by land degradation, long-term drought and deforestation.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr. Mohamed reiterated his commitment to the Paris Agreement, but also to Security Council resolution 751 (1992), which called on all States to take the necessary measures to prevent the direct and indirect import and export of Somali coal.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It may not save the environment, but it will definitely deprive terrorists of a source of funding," he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">Tyrone selector Gavin Devlin has been hit with a 24-week suspension following his conduct as a supporter at an underage game.</seg>
<seg id="3">Croke Park's Central Hearings Committee (CHC) upheld the suspension proposed by the Central Competitions Control Committee (CCCC) following incidents during an Under-15 inter-county game between Tyrone and Down on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="4">He was accused of 'disruptive conduct not causing the premature termination of a game', by a supporter.</seg>
<seg id="5">Devlin, who works alongside Tyrone boss Mickey Harte, didn't accept the punishment proposed by the CCCC and chose to request a hearing in front of the CHC, who found the alleged infraction proven.</seg>
<seg id="6">Devlin now has the option to go to the GAA's Central Appeals Committee in an attempt to have his punishment overturned.</seg>
<seg id="7">Assuming that the suspension starts from the issuing of the CHC's findings on Thursday, Devlin will be ruled out of all involvement with the Tyrone squad until early March, well into the 2020 Allianz League campaign.</seg>
<seg id="8">Former Tipperary hurler Eoin Brislane has been suspended for a total of 16 weeks arising from an incident in Tipp's Under-15 Arrabawn Hurling Tournament match with Wexford on 31 August.</seg>
<seg id="9">The CCCC had proposed two separate bans on the grounds that Brislane had used abusive language towards a referee and for "any type of assault of a referee" under Rule 7.2 (c) of the official guide.</seg>
<seg id="10">The CHC upheld the first of those, imposing a four-week ban, though found the second alleged infraction unproven.</seg>
<seg id="11">They found, however, that "the evidence presented did disclose a lesser infraction."</seg>
<seg id="12">That infraction was "minor physical interference with a referee" and imposed a 12-week suspension.</seg>
<seg id="13">Like Devlin, Brislane can ask for his case to go before the CAC.</seg>

<seg id="2">Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker thinks interest rates should hold steady as events unfold in what he called a strong economy that also has "clear downside risks."</seg>
<seg id="3">"My own view is that we should hold firm, letting things settle and watching how events play out," he said in prepared remarks Friday to the Shadow Open Market Committee of economists who monitor Fed activity.</seg>
<seg id="4">Harker, a nonvoting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, spoke nine days after his fellow central bankers voted to cut the Fed's benchmark interest rate by a quarter, the second reduction this year.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said he views the economy as strong with inflation on its way to the Fed's 2% goal.</seg>
<seg id="6">Yet he also noted potential problems with "trade and international developments and the uncertainty they breed."</seg>
<seg id="7">Along with his views on rates, Harker also weighed in on last week's tumult in the overnight lending, or repo, market that saw short-term rates spike to 10% and the fed funds rate climb 5 basis points above its target range.</seg>
<seg id="8">While the events shook markets, "they neither reflect - nor direct - the stance of monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id="9">Nor do they have implications for the wider economy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, he added that the Fed should continue to look at its approach to where it is holding its balance sheet and said "organic" expansion should be considered.</seg>

<seg id="2">Lil Wayne is up for about $150,000 in charges for allegedly creating fraudulent companies to book fake concerts and it turns out he didn't even bother to respond to the lawsuit.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to TMZ, a judge has ordered the rapper to cough up $150K for breach of contract and fraud to investor Ramin Natan but it's a default judgment with the judge having ruled for Natan because Wayne didn't show.</seg>
<seg id="4">The suit was apparently filed by Natan against Lil Wayne and hip-hop group Migos back in January, in which the investor claimed they were "Ponzi scheme artists" who created shell companies to get money for shows they never actually planned to perform.</seg>
<seg id="5">The legal docs reportedly show Natan claimed he loaned $500,000 to a guy named Eric Stenger to promote Weezy shows.</seg>
<seg id="6">Natan claimed Stenger collaborated with Wayne from the beginning and lied about being a concert promoter.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said Wayne received the $500,000 investment from him but then never performed and also never gave back the cash.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the legal docs, Lil Wayne was served with the lawsuit but he failed to respond, so the judge issued a default judgment against Weezy.</seg>
<seg id="9">Typically, the courts will give a defendant one last chance to respond.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is the latest in a string of legal troubles for the 36-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="11">Earlier this year he threatened his former record company Moments in Time with legal action because they wouldn't return an old lyric notebook of his, instead they were trying to auction it for £189,600.</seg>

<seg id="2">A doctor in Zimbabwe who was abducted and allegedly tortured for leading a doctors strike left the country late Thursday for what his medical team calls "urgent" treatment in South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="3">Dr. Peter Magombeyi, acting president of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association, had been receiving care in Harare for a week since his release from captivity.</seg>
<seg id="4">Friends and colleagues suspect he was poisoned during his five-day abduction and now has liver damage.</seg>
<seg id="5">His father, Kingstone Magombeyi, had been staying with him at the hospital since his release last Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I am very happy for that step taken by the medical practitioners, am very happy on that one, because there are some areas whereby l feel he needs further medication," Kingstone Magombeyi said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Peter Magombeyi's departure for South Africa only came after the head of the High Court, George Chiweshe, chastised police who had defied a court order and blocked the doctor from leaving.</seg>
<seg id="8">Monica Mutsvangwa, Zimbabwe's Information Minister, maintains police interfered with Magombeyi's departure for safety and health reasons.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The police are keen to apprehend the alleged abductors so as to bring them to justice and protect the public," Mutsvangwa said.</seg>
<seg id="10">They therefore need the court's assistance in delaying Dr. Magombeyi's departure to South Africa, before him giving the vital leads they need to advance their investigations.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is the duty of the police to protect the safety of all its citizens.</seg>
<seg id="12">While Magombeyi has left Zimbabwe for medical treatment, his association says doctors are not calling off their three-week strike.</seg>
<seg id="13">His colleagues say the outspoken doctor was abducted for calling the strike on Sept. 3 to push President Emmerson Mnangagwa's government to raise doctors' salaries, currently equal to less than $200 per month.</seg>
