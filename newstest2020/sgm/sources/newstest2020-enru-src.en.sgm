<seg id="2">A TV reporter has condemned a stranger who pretended to grope her backside then kissed her live on air.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sara Rivest recoiled at the man's attempted embrace while reporting on a bourbon festival in Louisville, Kentucky, on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="4">She said "Ooohkay," then "That was not appropriate, let's go to the story," as she regained her composure live on TV station WAVE.</seg>
<seg id="5">The pest has been named as Eric Goodman, with Goodman now charged with misdemeanor harassment with physical contact.</seg>
<seg id="6">He has been issued a summons to appear in court.</seg>
<seg id="7">After their encounter, Rivest shared a clip on Twitter, writing: "Hey mister, here's your 3 seconds of fame. How about you not touch me? Thanks!!"</seg>
<seg id="8">And Rivest appeared on WAVE's evening news bulletin Monday to condemn the man again.</seg>
<seg id="9">She conceded that people were perfectly entitled to behave foolishly in her shot while she was reporting from a public place.</seg>
<seg id="10">Rivest added: "But when you put your hands on me or anyone else without their approval, that is wrong."</seg>
<seg id="11">She said incidents like the one caught on camera are "a violation and all-too-common occurrence."</seg>
<seg id="12">The reporter said she was annoyed at herself for laughing when the man kissed her, but blamed it on an instantaneous, nervous reaction to the situation.</seg>
<seg id="13">She continued: "I was shocked, but my nervous laughter does not equate to approval of his actions.</seg>
<seg id="14">It was an exertion of power over me, a woman - trying to do her job - who couldn't stop him.</seg>
<seg id="15">This embarrassed me, and it made me feel uncomfortable and powerless."</seg>
<seg id="16">Rivest went on to share a text from her dad calling the pest a "jerk," which added: "If I had been there, I'd have dropped him."</seg>

<seg id="1">Why the Queen made an error of judgement on proroguing Parliament - Joyce McMillan</seg>
<seg id="2">Once, long ago, a committee I sat on had some dealings with people from Buckingham Palace; not the Royal Family itself, but a small group of senior officials.</seg>
<seg id="3">I suppose that even 20 years on, it's a beheading offence to give precise details of what they said on the subject of the Queen's role in the planned official opening of the new Scottish Parliament, on 1 July 1999; but I can say that they were an impressive crew, much more politically savvy about the constitutional nuances of devolution than most UK Government representatives at the time, and much more sharply aware - given their vast experience across the Commonwealth - that political self-determination is one thing, and the role of the monarch as head of state is another.</seg>
<seg id="4">Amid all the sound, fury, and swings of the constitutional wrecking-ball that have accompanied the latest traumatic episode in Britain's Brexit crisis, one question has therefore been nagging at the back of my mind; the question of what exactly happened on the morning of 28 August, when Jacob Rees-Mogg, as Lord President of the Council, presented himself at Balmoral, where the Queen was on her usual late summer holiday, to seek the royal assent to the exceptional five-week prorogation of Parliament proposed by the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is, of course, a mere sub-plot in the wider Brexit drama which reached such an appalling crisis in the Commons on Wednesday night, with the Prime Minister dismissing the unanimous decision of 11 Supreme Court judges as "wrong," inciting warlike attitudes by using terms like "surrender" and "betrayal" in relation to Brexit, and dismissing as "humbug" the fears for their own safety of women MP's - friends and allies of the murdered MP Jo Cox - who are now subjected to a daily barrage of Brexit-related hate mail.</seg>
<seg id="6">Yet it is a sub-plot worthy of a one-act play in its own right; and perhaps not one of those jolly, reassuring ones in which the Queen is portrayed as an infinitely wise and perceptive old lady, who has seen 13 prime ministers come and go, and will doubtless outlast the 14th.</seg>
<seg id="7">For the truth is that on that day, the Queen and her advisers seem to have made an error of judgment, of the kind they have almost entirely avoided, in her 67-year reign to date; and arguably a much more serious one than the intervention in the Scottish independence referendum suggested by David Cameron in his memoir, which, after all, amounted to no more than the Queen suggesting people "think carefully" before casting their votes, a phrase which only a dyed-in-the-wool Unionist would interpret as meaning that they should necessarily vote for the status quo.</seg>
<seg id="8">This time, though, warning bells should have sounded in the royal household as soon as they heard that the new Prime Minister was proposing such a long prorogation in the run-up to the Brexit deadline date; and a couple of quick concerned phone calls from palace to Downing Street should have been enough to persuade the PM to shorten his pre-Queen's Speech prorogation to the usual length of a few days or a week.</seg>
<seg id="9">To the royal household, after all, past custom and practice is 99 per cent of the law.</seg>
<seg id="10">So what went wrong?</seg>
<seg id="11">We will probably never know, or not for decades.</seg>
<seg id="12">It may be that the Queen and her advisers simply felt that they did not want to question a new government trying to implement a referendum result, however narrow.</seg>
<seg id="13">It may be that Johnson and Rees-Mogg genuinely caught the Queen off guard, at a holiday period when many key people were not available.</seg>
<seg id="14">Or it may be, as some republican thinkers would suggest, that the whole idea of the Queen as a wise and moderate sovereign, who always hopes to promote the wellbeing of her subjects, is simply another layer of royalist mythology, disguising an edifice of wealth and inherited privilege which, under stress, will unhesitatingly assist a right-wing government in undermining institutions - Scottish, British or European - that might threaten that traditional power structure.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is 42 years, after all, since punk poet John Lydon of the Sex Pistols first noisily linked the Queen with the idea of a "fascist regime"; and although the history of postwar Europe strongly suggests that there is no inevitable connection between royalty and reactionary politics, it can be argued that the 1970s punk movement at least tried to open up a conversation about monarchy and democracy, one which the UK has since failed to pursue.</seg>
<seg id="16">Whatever the truth about the Queen's role in the prorogation, though, this much is clear; that as the current Brexit crisis is testing Britain's unwritten constitution to its limits, and provoking a dangerous moment of open constitutional warfare among government, parliament and the courts, it has also succeeded in undermining the monarch's conventional stabilising role in that constitution, associating her with a rash act that has now been declared unlawful, by a government that commands no parliamentary majority.</seg>
<seg id="17">The global merchants of democratic instability and breakdown - the Putins and Bannons, with their armies of hate-mongering internet bots - must be delighted by the spectacular progress of their project, over just three years, in one of the world's most stable democracies.</seg>
<seg id="18">And Scotland, which has not been the primary target of this destabilisation, must now soon be given a second chance to consider its position, in relation to a UK so radically changed by Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="19">In 1977, Lydon and the Sex Pistols famously warned that "there is no future for you, in England's dreaming."</seg>
<seg id="20">Yet now, England's fierce dream of a glorious past, filtered through layers of 21st-century lies and delusion, is starting to shape all of our futures on these islands; and we will all have to live in that landscape of dream or nightmare, until we find our own ways - with or without the Queen, and inside or outside the UK - of resisting the lies, rejecting the illusion, and coming together to re-engage with reality of our lives, as citizens of the 21st century.</seg>

<seg id="3">But what do we know about him?</seg>
<seg id="4">How much is Kelvin Flecther being paid for Strictly Come Dancing?</seg>
<seg id="5">The father-of-one is said to have been paid something in the region of £25,000 and £40,000 to take part in the 17th series of Strictly Come Dancing.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Sun previously reported that each celebrity is given a standard £25,000 payment for joining.</seg>
<seg id="7">For those who stay until the end of October the fee rises to £40,000.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, his earnings could increase significantly if he makes it to the quarter-finals as he will pocket £60,000.</seg>
<seg id="9">With Kelvin being a strong competitor there is every possibility he could walk away with £100,000 if he wins the entire competition.</seg>
<seg id="10">Why did Kelvin Fletcher leave Emmerdale?</seg>
<seg id="11">Kelvin first joined Emmerdale at the tender age of six-years-old in 1996.</seg>
<seg id="12">He played the part of Andy Sugden for 20 years, before quitting the role in 2016 for good.</seg>
<seg id="13">During an appearance on This Morning, the actor opened up about his decision to leave the ITV soap.</seg>
<seg id="14">Speaking to host Emmon Holmes and Ruth Langsford, he explained: "Twenty years is a long time.</seg>
<seg id="15">It's been an incredible twenty years.</seg>
<seg id="16">I am so grateful to Emmerdale.</seg>
<seg id="17">Throughout that period I have always had a real sense of fulfillment and purpose."</seg>
<seg id="18">He added: "What started out as a hobby at six years old - I was then able to do something like that every day on a professional platform on one of the country's greatest shows.</seg>
<seg id="19">I have been extremely lucky.</seg>
<seg id="20">Looking back over 20 years it has been a rollercoaster and for me it's give me passion to leave and continue."</seg>

<seg id="2">The north shore housing market is in the grip of a stock shortage, especially in the popular suburb of Wollstonecraft.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to realestate.com.au, there are just 11 properties currently on the market.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only one of them is a house, and by this time tomorrow it will likely be sold.</seg>
<seg id="5">The four-bedroom house at 18 Tryon Ave , is scheduled to go under the hammer at 2pm (Saturday, September 28), and will be open for inspection and registration from 1.15pm.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has a price guide of $2.75 million.</seg>
<seg id="7">David Hill, of Raine&Horne HM Group, said the home was located in the only street on the Wollstonecraft peninsula that has no conservation restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="8">This offers plenty of opportunities for a major renovation or knockdown/rebuild (subject to council approval).</seg>
<seg id="9">"It's very rare for this type of thing to come up," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The property has a lot of potential and we have had a lot of interest.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said almost 100 groups had seen the property in the lead up to tomorrow's auction.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to CoreLogic, there hasn't been a house sale in Tryon Ave since 2015.</seg>
<seg id="13">This property hasn't changed hands since 1987.</seg>
<seg id="14">The four-bedroom, full-brick home offers plenty of space and is directly opposite Badangi Reserve.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is also within walking distance of Wollstonecraft Station, Berry Island Reserve and the harbour foreshores.</seg>

<seg id="2">Number of road accidents caused by drug-driving more than doubled in 5 years</seg>
<seg id="3">DfT said 1,321 crashes were caused by drivers under influence of drugs last year</seg>
<seg id="4">RAC said statistics worrying, accused the Government of complacency</seg>
<seg id="5">The number of road accidents caused by drug-driving has more than doubled in five years.</seg>
<seg id="6">There were 1,321 crashes caused by drivers under the influence of drugs last year, compared to 594 in 2013, the Department for Transport (DfT) said on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Worse, drugs were a factor in 80 road deaths last year - compared to just 31 six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="8">The RAC Foundation said the statistics are 'worrying', and it has accused the Government of complacency over road safety.</seg>
<seg id="9">Motorway deaths also rose despite moves to make them safer, with 107 fatalities last year - up eight per cent on 2017.</seg>
<seg id="10">Motoring groups fear the removal of hard shoulders on so-called 'smart motorways' where stricken drivers have no choice but to stop in 'live' lanes.</seg>
<seg id="11">They have emergency lay-bys every 1.5 miles instead.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is not clear how many of the recorded deaths were on smart motorways, which are to be renamed 'digital roads' and currently account for at least 416 miles of Britain's motorways.</seg>
<seg id="13">That is set to almost double to 788 miles by April 2025 under the Government's road strategy.</seg>
<seg id="14">By contrast, deaths on rural roads were down three per cent last year from the year before.</seg>
<seg id="15">And the DfT statistics suggest that tougher penalties on mobile phone use are working.</seg>
<seg id="16">Although the number of road deaths caused by using handsets rose from 32 in 2016 to 33 in 2017, it fell to 25 last year.</seg>
<seg id="17">New laws against using a mobile phone behind the wheel were introduced in 2017 after a Daily Mail campaign.</seg>
<seg id="18">The number of accidents also decreased, from 478 in 2016 to 431 in 2017 and 423 last year.</seg>
<seg id="19">RAC head of policy Nicholas Lyes said: 'Of particular concern are the rises in fatalities among older age groups and a spike in motorway fatalities.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some worrying trends are emerging here that require immediate investigation, to understand the reasons for these increases and what can be done to reduce them.</seg>
<seg id="21">'In addition, the Government's data suggests an increase in motorway collisions where at least one driver has been under the influence of illegal drugs.'</seg>
<seg id="22">Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: 'We are progressing more than 70 different measures to help improve safety, for everyone from infants in car seats to those with years of driving experience.</seg>
<seg id="23">I have also asked the Department to urgently look at technological interventions to help reduce the number of young drivers killed."</seg>

<seg id="2">African countries are building increasingly strong partnerships for advancing peace and security, as well as inclusive sustainable development across the continent, the Security Council heard on Thursday, during a briefing by the UN Secretary-General's Chef de Cabinet, Maria Luiza Ribeiro Viotti.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ms. Viotti recognized the African Union and Member States' success in achieving important milestones in their pursuit for higher effectiveness, self-reliance and cooperation, and welcomed the work of the African Union Mediation Support Unit and the FemWise Network of African Women in Conflict Prevention and Mediation, which are, she said, "boosting capacity to defuse crises and making such efforts more inclusive."</seg>
<seg id="4">Progress evident at regional and country level</seg>
<seg id="5">Ms. Viotti went on to outline some of the progress being made in certain African countries, such as the peace talks, led by the African Union, in the Central African Republic which led a Political Agreement which is being overseen by the UN; the signing of a Constitutional Declaration in Sudan, which has allowed for the establishment of a civilian-led government, following efforts led by Ethiopia and the African Union (AU), with UN support; and free and fair elections in Madagascar, supported by the Southern Africa Development Community, the African Union, and UN.</seg>
<seg id="6">Cooperation between the UN, African Union and other partners in the area of elections is growing, said Ms. Viotti, citing visits organized by the UN Office for West Africa to several countries, ahead of legislative or presidential elections, over the last two years.</seg>
<seg id="7">The UN and AU, she continued, are cooperating closely to ensure that the voices of women and youth are integral to peace processes, and both organizations have youth envoys and strategies, acting as advocates and agents of change.</seg>
<seg id="8">More effective support needed from international community</seg>
<seg id="9">Despite the many examples of progress, Ms. Viotti declared that the international community needs to do much more to support African efforts.</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, more predictable, flexible and sustainable financing for African Union-led peace support operations is needed; more political will and resources for peacebuilding and sustaining peace efforts; and active support for the AU Initiative on Silencing the Guns.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Building partnerships and harnessing their power requires long-term vision and commitment," Ms. Viotti told the Security Council, adding that the Secretary-General is looking forward to "even greater partnership and collaboration, enabling the African Union to achieve its 2063 vision of equitable, people-centred transformation and lasting peace and security."</seg>

<seg id="2">The Court of Appeal in Belfast has dismissed an application that the UK government's Brexit policy will damage the Northern Ireland peace process.</seg>
<seg id="3">Three applicants appealed against a Belfast High Court judgment that rejected their challenge against the UK government's handling of the Brexit process.</seg>
<seg id="4">One of the applicants was high-profile victims' campaigner Raymond McCord, whose son was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries in 1997.</seg>
<seg id="5">It comes after the UK Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Prime Minister Boris Johnson acted unlawfully in shutting down parliament for five weeks.</seg>
<seg id="6">The three-judge Court of Appeal, led by the region's Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan, gave their judgment on Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="7">The three challenges focused on various aspects of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October.</seg>
<seg id="8">One that argued the Government's Brexit policy will damage the Northern Ireland peace process was previously dismissed by the High Court.</seg>
<seg id="9">During the appeal hearing last week, Mr McCord's barrister Ronan Lavery QC told the court that if a Brexit extension could not be secured by the government in the absence of a deal, then the default position should be halting Brexit - through the revocation of Article 50 - rather than exiting with no deal.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr McCord, who was not at court due to ill health, said he would study the Belfast Court of Appeal judgment with his lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I, along with many other people, believe that it will affect the peace process," he said.</seg>
<seg id="12">I hope I am proven wrong.</seg>
<seg id="13">We did not take this case to alarm people, it is what I believe in.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It would be nice if in the coming years people can come across and say: "Look Raymond, you were wrong."</seg>
<seg id="15">It did not affect the peace process.</seg>
<seg id="16">I don't want it to affect the peace process.</seg>
<seg id="17">I don't want people to go through what my family and members of other families have went through.</seg>
<seg id="18">I respect the judgment of the Appeal Court in every way, I believe the judges sitting there are amongst the best judges in the UK.</seg>
<seg id="19">I have to respect their judgment.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, it is a fear I have that the peace process will be affected."</seg>

<seg id="2">Head judge of Strictly Come Dancing, Shirley Ballas, 59, announced that she will be having her breast implants removed after several cancer diagnoses in her family.</seg>
<seg id="3">Shirley's mother and aunt both have cancer and as such she made the decision to remove her implants to reduce her risk.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), there is a possible association between breast implants and the development of breast-implant associated anapaestic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL), an uncommon cancer of the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="5">The FDA believes that women with breast implants that have textured surfaces have a very low but increased risk of developing BIA-ALCL.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, FDA did note that it doesn't necessarily mean that implant cause it and further research is need to understand the relationship between the condition and breast implants.</seg>
<seg id="7">Shirley had received a health warning following a mammogram and subsequently made the brave decision to remove her implants.</seg>
<seg id="8">Speaking to The Sun, Shirley was told "there's no guarantee that we can ever really see behind the back of the implants," which made her realise it could be difficult for doctors to detect any cancers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Shirley said: "I'm scheduled for the operation on Tuesday, October 29th."</seg>
<seg id="10">My doctor says I have recuperation of a week, but I want to do Strictly on the Saturday night.</seg>
<seg id="11">Joking that "it's not like I have to dance and do the cha cha cha or the samba."</seg>
<seg id="12">I have spoke to the BBC and they have been very, very supportive.</seg>
<seg id="13">They said you have to do what you feel most comfortable for your health.</seg>
<seg id="14">Despite the FDA announcing more research is needed on the subject of implants and its correlation to breast cancer, Shirley has decided not to take any chances and believes it has impacted her health negatively.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are rumours that the scar tissues cause chronic fatigue which I have suffered with even over the last year.</seg>
<seg id="16">Usually I don't get tired and I'm like an Energizer bunny.</seg>
<seg id="17">But if they take out the scar tissue it would involve bigger surgery and perhaps a reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id="18">But I don't want any implants in.</seg>
<seg id="19">I don't want any foreign bodies in my body.</seg>
<seg id="20">Symptoms of breast cancer include a lump in the breast, a change in the size or shape of the breast, a dimpling of the skin or thickening in the breast tissue, an inverted nipple, a rash on the nipple, discharge, or a swelling in the armpit.</seg>
<seg id="21">If you suspect you or anyone you may know might have these signs it's imperative to speak with your GP who will recommend you to a specialist if needs be.</seg>

<seg id="2">President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday said the participation of women in the field of science in the country is far from satisfactory and steps need to be taken to ensure greater involvement of girl students in the area.</seg>
<seg id="3">In his address on the 78th foundation day celebrations of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), he said achievements in the field of science and technology will become more wholesome and desirable if there is a greater participation of girl students and of women in this area.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this context, he said Project Director of Chandrayaan-2 mission M Vanitha and Mission Director Ritu Karidhal have become household names.</seg>
<seg id="5">We have to take the necessary steps to ensure greater participation of girl students and of women in science and technology.</seg>
<seg id="6">"When this happens, our scientific achievements will become even more wholesome and more desirable," the President said.</seg>
<seg id="7">"None of our successes will have any meaning without equal opportunities for our girl-children," he added.</seg>
<seg id="8">Science and Technology Minister Harsh Vardhan, Principal Scientific Advisor K VijayRaghavan and CSIR Director General Shekhar Mande were also present at the event.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Kovind called upon the scientific community to take calculated risk.</seg>
<seg id="10">There, he said, lies the possibility of developing truly transformative technologies and innovations.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said the academic, scientific institutions, industry and entrepreneurs must collaborate to ensure that scientific research can move from labs to industry, agricultural fields, incubation centres and start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mr Vardhan also presented the President a Fuel Cell Prototype developed by CSIR labs.</seg>

<seg id="2">Thousands of central London residents are being "locked out" of the quickest broadband by a legal requirement for landlords to give permission before fibre can be installed.</seg>
<seg id="3">Bosses at Openreach, the firm responsible for linking up homes to fibre networks capable of supporting "ultrafast" broadband, say they face huge obstacles in securing so-called "wayleave" agreements that give them the right to enter apartment or office blocks.</seg>
<seg id="4">The problem is most acute in the City where complex layers of foreign ownership have made it hard to identify who the freeholders are, resulting in years of costly delay.</seg>
<seg id="5">Figures from Openreach suggest it has been unable to gain consent from the owners of 848 high-rise buildings - containing 9,941 residential or business premises - in the City alone.</seg>
<seg id="6">Affected residents have spoken of their frustration at being left with slow internet speeds in the heart of the Square Mile.</seg>
<seg id="7">Civil servant Tim Figures, who lives in an apartment near the Gherkin tower, said he can access only "basic" broadband services despite lobbying for more than a year for fibre to be installed.</seg>
<seg id="8">It means it can take up to an hour to download a single TV episode and uploading files is "incredibly slow."</seg>
<seg id="9">With fibre, downloading an entire HD film takes a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 48-year-old said: "Working from home can cause huge problems if I need to do anything beyond a basic email."</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr Figures said the managing agent of his building had approached the freeholder about access for Openreach but it had refused to sign a wayleave agreement.</seg>
<seg id="12">He added: "It's incredibly frustrating, we're just stuck in this legal limbo."</seg>
<seg id="13">The freeholder doesn't have to pay anything, there is no liability, all they have to do is sign an agreement giving Openreach permission to lay cables.</seg>
<seg id="14">Openreach boss Chris Selly said he wants a change in the law to give the company the same legal rights to enter as gas, electricity and water suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="15">Kim Mears, Openreach's head of strategic infrastructure development, said the firm had been able to access only 44 per cent of City buildings, adding: "It's a real tortuous drawn-out process."</seg>

<seg id="2">Joaquin Phoenix turns in an Oscar worthy performance as a comic-book villain whose power once lay in his ambiguous mythology, but has now been bolstered in Joker by an unflinching deep dive into his origins.</seg>
<seg id="3">Pulling back the curtain on the Joker was a risk, but it's one that pays off hugely here as Phoenix's portrayal of the character, who has been played many ways by many actors to varying degrees of success, is unique and if anything, more terrifying, as this story is so grounded in a quasi-reality and the most real-worldly Gotham we've seen.</seg>
<seg id="4">What transpires on screen is chilling, unnerving, completely compelling, anxiety-inducing, sleep-disturbing, and absolutely brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="5">Joker is a character study that explores how a mentally ill aspiring stand-up comedian, Arthur Fleck, becomes the homicidal clown we're familiar with, and the film deftly walks the tightrope of making him a somewhat sympathetic character without pushing this aspect too far.</seg>
<seg id="6">The balancing act is truly engaging.</seg>
<seg id="7">Phoenix gives the performance of the year here, but DeNiro is also at the top of his game once again and his involvement in the project really solidifies the Scorsese-ian undertones that pepper the film.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is not a comic-book movie and aside from a few hat-tips to Batman lore, it is completely its own beast, and that is precisely why it works so well; there is no format, there is no convention and there are no rules.</seg>
<seg id="9">You might not put on a happy face for a while after the credits roll, but it is so worth the weird dreams that will likely follow.</seg>

<seg id="1">Saudi Arabia To Offer Tourist Visas For First Time, Abolish Abaya Rule</seg>
<seg id="2">Visas in Saudi are currently restricted to expat workers, their dependents and Muslim pilgrims.</seg>
<seg id="3">Saudi Arabia said Friday it will offer tourist visas for the first time, opening up the ultra-conservative kingdom to holidaymakers as part of a push to diversify its economy away from oil.</seg>
<seg id="4">Kickstarting tourism is one of the centrepieces of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 reform programme to prepare the biggest Arab economy for a post-oil era.</seg>
<seg id="5">The announcement comes just two weeks after devastating attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure -- blamed by Washington on Iran -- which roiled global energy markets and raised fears of a wider regional conflict.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Opening Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country," tourism chief Ahmed al-Khateeb said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="7">Visitors will be surprised... by the treasures we have to share -- five UNESCO World Heritage Sites, a vibrant local culture and breathtaking natural beauty.</seg>
<seg id="8">Saudi Arabia will open applications for online tourist visas to citizens of 49 countries on Saturday, Bloomberg News quoted Khateeb as saying.</seg>
<seg id="9">Khateeb said the kingdom will also ease its strict dress code for foreign women, allowing them to go without the body-shrouding abaya robe that is still mandatory public wear for Saudi women.</seg>
<seg id="10">Foreign women, however, will be required to wear "modest clothing," he added, without elaborating.</seg>
<seg id="11">Visas in the desert kingdom, endowed with rich bedouin heritage and archaeological sites, are currently restricted to expat workers, their dependents and Muslim pilgrims travelling to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a rare move, Saudi Arabia last year began issuing temporary visas to visitors to attend sporting and cultural events in a bid to kickstart tourism.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the austere kingdom, which forbids alcohol and has a strict social code, is seen by many as a hard sell for tourists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Prince Mohammed is seeking to change that through a sweeping liberalisation drive that has brought new cinemas, mixed-gender concerts and sporting extravaganzas to Saudi Arabia.</seg>
<seg id="15">International criticism of the kingdom's human rights record, including the gruesome murder last year of critic Jamal Khashoggi and a crackdown on female activists, could further put off foreign visitors, observers say.</seg>
<seg id="16">Fears of a regional conflict after the September 14 attacks on state oil giant Aramco may also dampen the kingdom's appeal to holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id="17">The government, reeling from low oil prices, says it hopes tourism will contribute up to 10 percent of the gross domestic product by 2030, compared to three percent currently.</seg>
<seg id="18">It says by 2030 it aims to attract up to 100 million annual visits by both domestic and foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="19">But the kingdom currently lacks the infrastructure to accomodate visitors in such high numbers, with officials estimating 500,000 new hotel rooms will be required nationwide over the coming decade.</seg>
<seg id="20">The sector is expected to create up to one million tourism jobs, the government says, as it battles high youth unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Saudi Arabia has splurged billions in an attempt to build a tourism industry from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="22">In 2017, the kingdom announced a multi-billion dollar project to turn 50 islands and other pristine sites on the Red Sea into luxury resorts.</seg>
<seg id="23">Last year, construction of Qiddiya "entertainment city" was launched near Riyadh, which would include high-end theme parks, motor sport facilities and a safari area.</seg>
<seg id="24">The country is also developing historic sites such as the centuries-old Mada'in Saleh, home to sandstone tombs of the same civilisation which built the Jordanian city of Petra.</seg>

<seg id="1">An agreement formalizing public access to state-owned lands has been a good deal for the two Idaho agencies involved as well as hunters, anglers and recreationists, state officials said Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="2">The Idaho Department of Lands and Idaho Department of Fish and Game said that both sides are benefiting from the 2018 agreement.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fish and Game through fees it collects from hunters and anglers is paying the Lands Department $580,000 annually, with about a fourth of that in law enforcement patrols.</seg>
<seg id="4">The agreement involves access to about 3,750 square miles (9,700 square kilometers) of Idaho endowment lands.</seg>
<seg id="5">Idaho received endowment lands in 1890 when it became a state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Most of the money is generated through logging.</seg>
<seg id="7">The lands have always been open to the public, but state officials say the agreement has increased awareness that they are accessible to hunters, anglers and others.</seg>
<seg id="8">"And the state has been very open that they're welcome there," said Roger Phillips, spokesman for Fish and Game.</seg>
<seg id="9">Phillips and Bill Haagenson, an administrator at the Lands Department, said it's difficult to quantify how many visitors are heading for state lands following the agreement.</seg>
<seg id="10">But anecdotally, each said, the numbers appear to be growing.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I think we can say that recreation use on endowment lands has been and continues to increase," Haagenson said.</seg>
<seg id="12">As our population grows, we're seeing more recreation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Miscreants or public lands slobs occasionally show up, but state officials say most visitors have been respectful and responsible.</seg>
<seg id="14">About 96 percent of endowment lands are accessible by foot or boat.</seg>
<seg id="15">Maps of accessible endowment lands are available on Fish and Game's website.</seg>
<seg id="16">There are also smartphone apps available that show state, federal and private lands while a person moves across the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="17">That's particularly useful for hunters, said Phillips, who uses an app that turns the screen blue for state land.</seg>
<seg id="18">"If you're standing in that blue patch, you know you're in pretty good shape," he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Because the Idaho Constitution requires state lands to be used to generate money, there was some concern individuals or companies could pay to lease state lands, cutting off public access.</seg>
<seg id="20">Such a request is still possible.</seg>
<seg id="21">A decision on that would be up to the Idaho Land Board, comprised of Republican Gov. Brad Little and four other statewide elected officials, who manage endowment lands and direct the Lands Department.</seg>
<seg id="22">The agreement between the Lands Department and Fish and Game "gives the board another piece of information to consider should an application for use come in," Haagenson said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Idaho endowment lands are somewhat scattered, the state having received 1-mile (2.6-kilometer) square sections when it became a state.</seg>
<seg id="24">Over the years, exchanges or sales left the current configuration with some remaining isolated sections, but many others accumulated into blocks of sections, particularly in northern and central Idaho.</seg>
<seg id="25">"There's a lot of good timberland in central Idaho that provides really good wildlife habitat," Phillips said.</seg>
<seg id="26">A lot of that is intertwined with national forest land.</seg>

<seg id="2">The value of Holiday Inn is Rs 127 crore.</seg>
<seg id="3">Deepak Talwar is currently in judicial custody</seg>
<seg id="4">A special PMLA authority has confirmed the attachment of hotel Holiday Inn, worth over Rs 127 crore, located in the upscale Aerocity area in the national capital in connection with a money laundering case against alleged aviation lobbyist Deepak Talwar, the Enforcement Directorate said on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="5">The attachment order, issued by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on March 28, has been confirmed by the Adjudicating Authority of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) on September 19, the agency said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="6">The agency, with the approval obtained from the authority, will now be able to seize the hotel, a senior official said.</seg>
<seg id="7">The lobbyist was deported from Dubai in January and arrested by the agency in a PMLA case booked against him and others.</seg>
<seg id="8">The proceeds of crime allegedly generated by Deepak Talwar, from kickbacks received in lieu of securing favourable air traffic rights, were integrated in a company Wave Hospitality Private Limited, the agency said.</seg>
<seg id="9">It alleged that this company was "beneficially owned and controlled" by Deepak Talwar in the name of his son, Aditya Talwar.</seg>
<seg id="10">This alleged tainted money was used to construct hotel Holiday Inn, next to the Indira Gandhi International Airport, the ED charged.</seg>
<seg id="11">The posh hotel boasts of some of the most expensive boarding and dining facilities in the Aerocity complex that was constructed few years ago for international and domestic air passengers transiting through Delhi.</seg>
<seg id="12">The agency had earlier said that Deepak Talwar "illegally engaged in liasoning/lobbying with politicians, ministers and other public servants and officials of the Ministry of Civil Aviation for airlines such as Emirates, Air Arabia and Qatar Airways for securing undue benefits for them" during the tenure of the UPA government.</seg>
<seg id="13">"He (Talwar) illegally managed to secure favourable traffic rights for these airlines during 2008-09 at the cost of national carrier, Air India," the agency said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Investigation revealed that in lieu of securing favourable traffic rights, these airlines made payments to the tune of Rs 272 crore to Talwar during 2008-09, it said.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It has been revealed that Talwar created a web of entities owned by him and his family members in India and international offshore havens to launder proceeds of crime of Rs 272 crore received from foreign airlines," ED had said.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Part of these payments were made to an account in Bank of Singapore, belonging to a company Asiafield Limited registered in the British Virgin Islands and beneficially owned by Deepak Talwar," it added.</seg>

<seg id="1">Wells Fargo taps BNY Mellon's Charles Scharf as CEO</seg>
<seg id="2">Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) named banking veteran Charles Scharf as chief executive officer on Friday, the lender's third CEO since a wide-ranging sales scandal erupted three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scharf will take over from interim CEO Allen Parker, who was thrust into the position in March when former CEO Tim Sloan resigned abruptly.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sloan had said increased pressure from politicians and regulators had become a distraction in running the scandal-plagued bank.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scharf will take charge at a time when the bank is under a regulatory microscope and is working at rebuilding its tarnished reputation following the scandal.</seg>
<seg id="6">Internal and regulatory probes since the scandal have uncovered other issues in each of the bank's primary businesses, resulting in billions of dollars in fines, penalties and an unprecedented cap on its balance sheet by the Federal Reserve.</seg>
<seg id="7">Wells Fargo's board has been shuffled many times since the scandal, with more than half of its independent directors joining the board after 2016.</seg>
<seg id="8">Most recently, Scharf was heading Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N).</seg>
<seg id="9">Before joining the custodian bank, he held the top job at Visa Inc (V.N), the world's largest payment network.</seg>
<seg id="10">Separately, BNY Mellon named finance head Thomas Gibbons as its CEO on an interim basis.</seg>
<seg id="11">The bank also said Scharf had forfeited all of his equity and incentive awards which were unvested as of Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="12">KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said he was unsure what to expect from Scharf as Wells Fargo's CEO since his tenure at Bank of New York Mellon lasted only for two years.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Scharf's first task will be appeasing regulators and making the changes necessary to remove the asset cap currently in place," Kleinhanzl said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Scharf, 54, started his career in 1987 at Commercial Credit Corp, a consumer finance company run by Jamie Dimon and Sandy Weill - executives who went on to lead two of America's biggest banks.</seg>
<seg id="15">He was named Dimon's assistant six months into the job at Commercial Credit, according to an alumni magazine for the NYU stern business school.</seg>
<seg id="16">Scharf will start in his new role next month, Wells Fargo said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="17">"He moves from a bank with far less retail business than Wells Fargo, so he will face a steep learning curve," said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.</seg>
<seg id="18">The lender's board had considered keeping Parker as CEO on a permanent basis even after saying they would seek an outsider to fill the role, sources had told Reuters in June.</seg>
<seg id="19">Wells Fargo said Scharf's base salary at the bank would be $2.5 million - nearly the same as Sloan's base pay in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="20">Regulatory filings showed that Scharf's total compensation for 2018 at BNY was $9.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="21">Sloan's total compensation for the year was $18.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="22">Shares of Wells Fargo were up nearly 3.2% at $50.44 in premarket trading.</seg>

<seg id="2">LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) - The parents of 4-year-old Palmdale boy Noah Cuatro who died in July under suspicious circumstances were arrested Thursday, officials confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="3">Jose Cuatro and Ursula Juarez were arrested for the murder of their son, Noah, on September 26, 2019, at approximately 8:00 a.m., the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Dept. announced.</seg>
<seg id="4">The two were booked at Palmdale Sheriff's Station and a search warrant was served at their residence in an attempt to recover any additional evidence related to Noah's murder.</seg>
<seg id="5">Noah had been ordered by a court back in May to be removed from his parents' custody over concerns about abuse.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was never removed from the home and placed in foster care and on the afternoon of July 5, Noah's parents called 911 to report that he was drowning in a pool at an apartment complex in the 1200 block of East Avenue S, the L.A. County Sheriff's Department reports.</seg>
<seg id="7">Noah was rushed by ambulance to a local hospital.</seg>
<seg id="8">He died the following morning, on July 6.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hospital staff found signs of trauma on Noah's body and determined there were issues with his parents' explanation for his cause of death.</seg>
<seg id="10">Noah's three siblings had since been removed from the home and the sheriff's department launched an investigation.</seg>
<seg id="11">DCFS had previously investigated several reports of abuse in Noah's home.</seg>
<seg id="12">Noah's maternal great-grandmother Eva Hernandez told CBSLA that he was in and out of foster care his entire life.</seg>
<seg id="13">"DCFS has blood on its hands," said Hernandez's attorney Brian Claypool.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even though we're talking today about the arrest of his parents, we will be back some point in the future to hold that agency accountable for the death of this little boy.</seg>
<seg id="15">In 2016, according to the Times, Noah was removed from the home and placed in foster care for two years.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was returned to his parents' custody in November 2018.</seg>
<seg id="17">Hernandez said she often cared for her great-grandson.</seg>
<seg id="18">"He begged me, "grandma, let me stay, don't do this to me, don't send me back,"" Hernandez said.</seg>
<seg id="19">It's hard because I remember every word he used to tell me.</seg>
<seg id="20">Noah's parents are being held on $1 million bail each and are due in court Monday, Sept.</seg>

<seg id="1">WeWork's Neumann voted to oust himself as CEO after failed IPO</seg>
<seg id="2">When WeWork's directors voted on Tuesday to oust Adam Neumann as chief executive after a failed attempt to take the office-sharing startup public, Neumann cast his vote against himself, according to three people familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="3">The vote by Neumann, who remains non-executive chairman but gave up majority control of the company he co-founded, was the culmination of a stunning coup to remove him led by his biggest backer, Masayoshi Son, the billionaire CEO of SoftBank Group, the sources said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Neumann's downfall came after WeWork's parent, We Company, spent months preparing for an initial public offering, only to have to postpone its plans last week, as estimates of its value fell by tens of billions of dollars amid investor concerns about its corporate governance under Neumann, 40, and its ability to generate a profit.</seg>
<seg id="5">The falling estimates came as a shock to Son, who had plowed more than $10 billion into WeWork, the last investment at a $47 billion valuation, according to three people familiar with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="6">At that level, WeWork was the world's fourth-most valuable private startup, according to data firm CB Insights.</seg>
<seg id="7">By the time the IPO was pulled, estimates of WeWork's value had come down as low as $10 billion.</seg>
<seg id="8">By last weekend, some WeWork directors started to lay the groundwork for Neumann's departure, according to a source familiar with the seven-member board's deliberations.</seg>
<seg id="9">The notion would have been unthinkable only a few months ago, with the WeWork brand strongly tied to the flamboyant, freewheeling Israel-born entrepreneur who has said that his company's mission was to "elevate the world's consciousness."</seg>
<seg id="10">The substance of the message to Neumann from them: "Listen, this IPO has gotten distracted by you," the source said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Neumann decided to back the management changes because he became convinced they were in the best interest of the company, according to a person close to him.</seg>
<seg id="12">Neumann owns about a quarter of WeWork, sources have previously said, tying much of his wealth to the company.</seg>
<seg id="13">WeWork has not disclosed what percentage of the company he owns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Neumann did not respond to calls and emails requesting an interview.</seg>
<seg id="15">SoftBank and WeWork declined to comment.</seg>

<seg id="2">Warren Gatland has named an unchanged team for Wales' Pool D showdown against Australia, with Alun Wyn Jones set to become the country's most-capped player when he leads his side out in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Wales skipper wins his 130th cap, breaking the previous record held by prop Gethin Jenkins.</seg>
<seg id="4">Gatland has placed his faith in the starting XV that secured a 43-14 victory over Georgia four days ago, this despite the knocks suffered by centre Hadleigh Parkes and hooker Ken Owens.</seg>
<seg id="5">There is one switch among the replacements, with Ospreys centre Owen Watkin taking over from Leigh Halfpenny.</seg>
<seg id="6">Gatland's side features nine survivors from Wales' narrow win against the Wallabies last November.</seg>
<seg id="7">There are also further opportunities for prop Wyn Jones and flanker Aaron Wainwright after they made their Rugby World Cup debuts in the Georgia game.</seg>
<seg id="8">And flanker Aaron Shingler will again provide second-row bench cover for starting locks Jake Ball and Alun Wyn Jones.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sunday's clash at the Tokyo Stadium will likely decide the winner of Pool D, setting up a potential quarter-final against either France or Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="10">Should Australia claim victory - in what would make for their 14th win from the last 15 meetings between these two sides - Gatland's men could find themselves on a collision course for a last-eight encounter with England.</seg>

<seg id="1">World Cup is shop window that will improve team, says Canada captain</seg>
<seg id="2">Canada rugby captain Tyler Ardron is under no illusions of the monumentality of the task facing his side in their next two World Cup fixtures but said it would put his players in the "shop window" and ultimately help improve the team in the long run.</seg>
<seg id="3">The North Americans were beaten 48-7 by Italy in their Pool B opener at Fukuoka Hakatanomori Stadium on Thursday and now face three-times world champions New Zealand on Oct. 2 in Oita before meeting South Africa on Oct. 8 in Kobe.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ardron, one of the few Canadians playing in a top-tier club competition - for New Zealand club Waikato Chiefs in the international Super Rugby competition - recognized his side were unlikely to upset either of the southern hemisphere nations.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We're at the World Cup to play against the best (and)... for this game (against Italy) we were definitely not the favorites and that showed on the scoreboard," Ardron said.</seg>
<seg id="6">(Against New Zealand) we have to go out and put out something that we are proud of.</seg>
<seg id="7">For a lot of guys this is a shop window and hopefully some of them can put on a hell of a performance out there and get a contract.</seg>
<seg id="8">That would be a win for us.</seg>
<seg id="9">Wins on the field may be few and far between for tier-two nations at the tournament, such as Uruguay's victory over Fiji in Kamaishi on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Italians, however, were in no mood to allow a second shock within the space of 24 hours and demonstrated the benefits of having a team comprised of full-time professionals playing regular test matches.</seg>
<seg id="11">Canada coach Kingsley Jones, however, said Thursday's performance had been a major step up for his side, which has struggled internationally for a number of years and was the last to qualify for the tournament.</seg>
<seg id="12">The advent of Major League Rugby (MLR) in North America launched two years ago, however, is an important development in bridging the gap between tier-one and tier-two nations and for the development of players in Canada and the United States, he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">It was a big reality check when I came to Canada just how difficult it was to get the players together.</seg>
<seg id="14">"They all held down day jobs," said Jones.</seg>
<seg id="15">But I think the MLR is a lifeline for Canada and the United States.</seg>
<seg id="16">It's a pathway for players and coaches.</seg>
<seg id="17">Jones said there were 51 Canadians contracted to MLR clubs last season.</seg>
<seg id="18">Less than 18 months ago, more than 40 were working other jobs.</seg>
<seg id="19">"That's a big step in the right direction," he said.</seg>
<seg id="20">MLR still has a way to go.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's still in its infancy but it is certainly a pathway into the top levels.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the long term I'm sure it will get up to speed and be a good competitive competition, so that is critical.</seg>

<seg id="1">Babies exposed to air pollution have greater risk of death</seg>
<seg id="2">Babies living in areas with high levels of air pollution have a greater risk of death than those surrounded by cleaner air, a study has found.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is not the first study to investigate the link between air pollution and infant mortality , but the study drew particular focus on different pollutants and its analysis at different points in babies' lives.</seg>
<seg id="4">Dr Sarah Kotecha , a researcher at Cardiff University, said the results were difficult for pregnant women and their families to do much about.</seg>
<seg id="5">"You live where you live and you can't avoid pollution day in day out," she said, adding that it was down to policymakers to reduce pollution levels and for researchers to unpick how pollutants affect health.</seg>
<seg id="6">"If you can find out some of the mechanisms you can look at potential interventions," she added.</seg>
<seg id="7">A growing body of research has revealed links between different components of air pollution and health issues, including lung problems, heart disease, mental health problems, dementia and low birthweight.</seg>
<seg id="8">The latest study, yet to be peer-reviewed or published, will be presented at the European Respiratory Society international congress in Madrid.</seg>
<seg id="9">Kotecha said the research was based on data for almost 8 million live births in England and Wales between 2001 and 2012.</seg>
<seg id="10">The team divided England and Wales into 35,000 areas, each containing approximately 1,500 residents, and looked at the annual death rates for babies up to one-year-old, together with the average annual levels for three pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="11">These were particulate matter known as PM10, which comes from sources including vehicles and waste incineration, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulphur dioxide (SO2), which is released through burning of fossil fuels in power stations and refineries as well as metal extraction.</seg>
<seg id="12">For each pollutant the team compared the death rate for babies in the worst fifth of polluted areas with those in the best fifth.</seg>
<seg id="13">Once factors such as maternal age, deprivation level for the area and birthweight were taken into account, the team said that babies aged up to one year had a greater chance of dying living in areas with the worst air pollution compared with areas with the cleanest air.</seg>
<seg id="14">The results held across all three pollutants, with the odds of death 7% worse for NO2, 4% worse for PM10 and 19% worse for SO2.</seg>
<seg id="15">Further analysis suggested that of the three pollutants, only SO2 was associated with deaths within a baby's first 28 days.</seg>
<seg id="16">The study was unable to prove whether high levels of air pollution were to blame for the increased risk of death in those areas.</seg>
<seg id="17">It also did not take into account levels of indoor air pollution.</seg>
<seg id="18">Prof Mireille Toledano, an expert in population child health at Imperial College London, said the study confirmed that air pollution is a major public health hazard, adding that current standards are failing to protect people.</seg>
<seg id="19">She said the latest study had a number of limitations.</seg>
<seg id="20">It looked at average pollution levels over relatively large areas while in reality levels can vary greatly over a small distance - meaning the babies' true exposure was not captured.</seg>
<seg id="21">The study also did not take into account fluctuations in air pollution with the weather or over seasons, and did not take into account where the mother spent her pregnancy or factors such as maternal smoking.</seg>
<seg id="22">Toledano said it was also unclear how factors like birthweight were accounted for.</seg>
<seg id="23">"It is showing there is some kind of additional risk from air pollution for infant death but the way that it has been set up is quite a crude analysis," said Toledano.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dr Penny Woods, the chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, said action must be taken to tackle the public health crisis of air pollution - including introducing clean air zones in the most polluted cities.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The evidence linking infant mortality and air pollution is still emerging but Dr Kotecha's study, which suggests babies born in the UK's most polluted areas see a significantly increased risk of death, should be a wake-up call to government," she said.</seg>
<seg id="26">A second study found that exposure to PM10 from traffic during pregnancy and children's early life was linked to a slightly lower lung function of the children at eight years old - although the effect was no longer seen by the time the children were 15.</seg>
<seg id="27">Woods said the study mirrored previous findings, adding that children cannot protect their own lungs.</seg>
<seg id="28">"Both these studies concentrate on the damage done by air pollution to some of the most vulnerable members of our society - the very young," she said.</seg>

<seg id="2">The European Union has included Japan in its Asia "connectivity" plan, signing a landmark deal to coordinate transport, energy and digital projects amid concerns over China's dominance in infrastructure funding.</seg>
<seg id="3">The agreement formally seals Japan's engagement in the new EU-Asia connectivity plan and was signed by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker at the Europa Connectivity Forum in Brussels on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Whether it be a single road or a single port, when the EU and Japan undertake something, we are able to build sustainable, rules-based connectivity from the Indo-Pacific to the Western Balkans and Africa," Abe told reporters ahead of the signing ceremony.</seg>
<seg id="5">EU officials have turned to Japan in an apparent move to evade attracting Chinese financing, fearing what they see as China's dominance in infrastructure building across Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia.</seg>
<seg id="6">Since 2013, China funded the construction of bridges, roads and tunnels across more than 60 countries under its Belt and Road infrastructure initiative, which aims to build a network of land and sea links with Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The sea route that leads to the Mediterranean and the Atlantic must be open," Abe said, emphasizing the deal's signatories" aim to prevent China-financed projects from dominating EU-Asia transport links.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Japan and the EU endeavor to ensure synergies and complementarity between their respective cooperation on connectivity and quality infrastructure with partner third countries and coordinate action, notably in the regions of the Western Balkans, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Indo-Pacific, as well as in Africa," the bilateral document states.</seg>
<seg id="9">The deal is also to ensure "transparent procurement practices," as well as "free, open, fair, non-discriminatory and predictable regional and international trade and investment."</seg>
<seg id="10">It will be backed by a €60 billion ($65.48 billion) EU guarantee fund, development banks and private investors.</seg>
<seg id="11">The signatories promised to pay "utmost attention" to the sides" "fiscal capacity and debt-sustainability."</seg>
<seg id="12">Jean-Claude Juncker promised to help build infrastructure "without mountains of debt" or a reliance "on a single country."</seg>
<seg id="13">Although not all the money distributed under the deal will be spent in Asia, the EU's new agenda makes spending on infrastructure links with Asia official EU policy, which also involves the bloc's common budget.</seg>
<seg id="14">The two-day Europa Connectivity Forum is a multi-nation convention which aims to enforce ties between governments, financial institutions and private sectors, across Europe and beyond.</seg>
<seg id="15">This year's Forum, held under the theme "EU-Asia Connectivity: Building Bridges for a Sustainable Future," is focused on strengthening cooperation between the EU and its partners in the Asia-Pacific region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Muslim Woman Says Company Didn't Hire Her As She Wanted To Pray At Work</seg>
<seg id="2">Shahin Indorewala is suing the firm, claiming that she was discriminated against.</seg>
<seg id="3">Shahin Indorewala had a job working with children with autism, but she wanted to gain more experience in marketing.</seg>
<seg id="4">So she applied to Fast Trak Management, a small company that bills itself as "the number 1 marketing firm in the Northern Virginia Area."</seg>
<seg id="5">Now, Indorewala is suing the company, claiming that she was discriminated against because of her religion when she asked to use break time to pray.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a lawsuit filed in US District Court on Tuesday, Indorewala said she was "humiliated" by Fast Trak's CEO mocking her Muslim beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="7">The CEO, Ramses Gavilondo, disputes her version of events, saying Indorewala decided she did not want the job.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Council on American-Islamic Relations, which brought the lawsuit on Indorewala's behalf, held a brief news conference outside Fast Trak's Falls Church office on Wednesday, when CAIR labeled Fast Trak "a company that disregarded federal law and chose not to hire her because of her faith."</seg>
<seg id="9">In a video of the news conference, Indorewala said that her first interview went well, and that she was asked to return for a second interview.</seg>
<seg id="10">At that interview, Indorewala said, an assistant manager at Fast Trak told her that the company offers a long lunch break.</seg>
<seg id="11">Indorewala asked if she could take a shorter lunch break, so she could take two five-minute breaks during the workday to pray.</seg>
<seg id="12">She promptly ended the interview.</seg>
<seg id="13">She said, 'That's not going to work.</seg>
<seg id="14">We have fixed hours here,' " Indorewala said.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the lawsuit, the assistant manager then allegedly walked with Indorewala to Gavilondo, and said that the job's hours wouldn't work for Indorewala.</seg>
<seg id="16">Indorewala said she then explained to Gavilondo that she prays five times a day.</seg>
<seg id="17">At that point, Indorewala says, Gavilondo pointed to her headscarf and made mocking comments about religion.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Am I really being made fun of for my religion in public in what's supposed to be a professional workplace? . . .</seg>
<seg id="19">Clearly I was being discriminated against because of my religion," Indorewala said at the news conference.</seg>
<seg id="20">That was it.</seg>
<seg id="21">I just kind of quietly left the office.</seg>
<seg id="22">I didn't want to create a scene or anything, but I was pretty hurt and pretty embarrassed.</seg>
<seg id="23">Reached by phone on Thursday, Gavilondo said he didn't reject Indorewala's application; instead, he said, she was the one who decided she did not want the job.</seg>
<seg id="24">Someone came for an interview.</seg>
<seg id="25">They didn't want to work here. . . .</seg>
<seg id="26">"It's like me going to a store to buy Kit-Kats, and then I don't want to eat the Kit-Kats," he said.</seg>
<seg id="27">He said he recalled that Indorewala brought up her Muslim faith, but he did not specifically recall her request for five-minute prayer breaks during the day.</seg>
<seg id="28">And he said he had not made fun of her hijab: "I'm not a fashion expert.</seg>
<seg id="29">People can wear whatever they want."</seg>

<seg id="1">Oil prices head for weekly loss as supply fears wane</seg>
<seg id="2">NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices steadied on Friday but were heading for a weekly loss on a faster-than-expected recovery in Saudi output, while investors also worried about global crude demand amid slowing Chinese economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a volatile session, Brent crude LCOc1 futures lost 32 cents to $62.42 a barrel by 11:21 a.m.</seg>
<seg id="4">EDT (1521 GMT), after dropping to a session low of $60.76 a barrel.</seg>
<seg id="5">U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures rose 3 cents to $56.44 a barrel, after falling to $54.75 a barrel.</seg>
<seg id="6">Brent was on track to fall nearly 3% for the week, its biggest weekly loss since early August, while WTI was set to fall 2.8%.</seg>
<seg id="7">Earlier in the session, futures fell after Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the United States offered to remove all sanctions on Iran in exchange for talks.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, prices pared losses after U.S. President Donald Trump then said he had refused the request by Tehran.</seg>
<seg id="9">"We've really been following headline to headline," said Phil Flynn, an analyst with Price Futures Group in Chicago.</seg>
<seg id="10">Crude futures were also earlier hit by a Wall Street Journal report citing unnamed sources saying that Saudi Arabia had agreed a partial ceasefire in Yemen, said analysts in the Reuters Global Oil Forum.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brent is just above its level before attacks on Saudi facilities on Sept. 14, which initially halved the kingdom's production.</seg>
<seg id="12">Sources told Reuters this week that Saudi Arabia had restored capacity to 11.3 million barrels per day.</seg>
<seg id="13">Saudi Aramco has yet to confirm it is fully back online.</seg>
<seg id="14">"The risk premium is deflating further," said Saxo Bank's Ole Hansen.</seg>
<seg id="15">The International Energy Agency (IEA) said it might cut its estimates for global oil demand for 2019 and 2020 should the global economy weaken further.</seg>
<seg id="16">Key oil freight rates from the Middle East to Asia rocketed as much as 28% on Friday in the global oil shipping market, spooked by U.S. sanctions on units of China's COSCO for alleged involvement in ferrying crude out of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="17">The COSCO vessels account for about 7.5% of the world's fleet of supertankers, Refinitiv data showed.</seg>
<seg id="18">Emerging details connected to the impeachment inquiry into Trump also helped to dent demand sentiment, analysts said.</seg>
<seg id="19">"An impeachment would add to the uncertainty of the U.S. economy," Flynn said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Brexit news: Reckless stuns BBC QT with brilliant point on Remainers' bid to halt EU exit</seg>
<seg id="2">The Member of the National Assembly for South Wales East made the point during Thursday's broadcast from Cardiff.</seg>
<seg id="3">His argument was made in response to whether the tide of opposition would be the same if the referendum had gone in favour of Remain.</seg>
<seg id="4">He said: "In a democracy, where laws are made and properly interpreted of course, we should obey the law.</seg>
<seg id="5">The problem we now have is that people voted to leave the EU were told they were being given the decision, and the Government would implement what they decided.</seg>
<seg id="6">But, Brexit is being blocked by people who don't like Brexit, by people voted Remain and think their views are greater than the majority who voted to leave.</seg>
<seg id="7">We're seeing in parliament the procedures of the House of Commons abused.</seg>
<seg id="8">We have had someone in the chair who has allowed his own personal preference for remain to influence how he assesses and frankly breaks the standing orders.</seg>
<seg id="9">Fiona Bruce interrupted Mr Reckless and said: "John Bercow has always said he doesn't have a preference."</seg>
<seg id="10">To this the audience burst into laughter with Mr Reckless laughing with them.</seg>
<seg id="11">He replied: "If you believed that you'd believe anything."</seg>
<seg id="12">He says the referendum was misguided and therefore he's pleased that the powers are being pushed back to parliament because the 52 percent shouldn't be able to enjoy 100 percent of their victory.</seg>
<seg id="13">He thinks parliament should ensure we stay in the customs union and the EEA.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now, would he be saying this if it was the other way around?</seg>
<seg id="15">Would he be saying we should leave the EU and join the EEA to counter that 48 percent?</seg>
<seg id="16">No, of course he wouldn't.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that election was just a snapchat of public opinion.</seg>
<seg id="18">To this the crowd burst into applause and cheered Mr Reckless.</seg>
<seg id="19">Ms Bruce attempted to shout over the audience to correct Mr Reckless, she said: "He didn't sit as one of the eleven judges though Mark."</seg>
<seg id="20">The former Conservative Party MP countered Ms Bruce's comments and went into detail on Lord Sumption having sat as one of the judges on Gina Miller's previous case.</seg>
<seg id="21">He said: "That was the case where he dismissed the tried and tested rules of statutory interoperation."</seg>
<seg id="22">Ms Miller is the businesswoman and campaigner who filed one of two appeals against the English high court's decision that the prorogation was "purely political" and not a matter for the courts.</seg>
<seg id="23">She was consequently successful in her appeal, along with the previous victory during an appeal when the Supreme Court ruled in favour of giving MPs a say over triggering Article 50 in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="3">"Unfortunately I'm really sick and unable to travel," read the post in part, "I'm heartbroken to be missing this show, but I know that my amazing team, and my friends who are in town for the event, will help me be there in spirit. ..."</seg>
<seg id="4">She ended by urging her social media followers to join her in watching the women's spring and summer 2020 Paris Fashion Week runway show, which is set to be livestreamed on the Balmain website at 2:30 a.m.</seg>
<seg id="5">As part of the collaboration, she had been tapped to serve as the show's artistic director for makeup.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to published reports, the 22-year-old Jenner was also scheduled to celebrate the collaboration with an event at the label's Rue Saint-Honoré boutique.</seg>
<seg id="7">Jenner also was scheduled to be a presenter with Kim Kardashian West and Kendall Jenner at Sunday's 71st Primetime Emmy Awards.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, she was a no-show.</seg>
<seg id="9">Several news outlets have reported that Jenner's illness was severe enough for her to be hospitalized.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, The Times has not been able to independently corroborate this information.</seg>
<seg id="11">An email to Jenner's management team inquiring about the extent and source of the young star's illness went unanswered Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) on Thursday asked the inspector general of the State Department to investigate whether its officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, worked with Rudy Giuliani on any "partisan political activities."</seg>
<seg id="3">Harris' written request to Inspector General Steve Linick comes as President Donald Trump is under intense legal scrutiny for pressuring the president of Ukraine to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden, a political rival he may face in the 2020 presidential election.</seg>
<seg id="4">Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer, was part of the effort to influence Ukrainian officials, according to a summary of a conversation between Trump and the Ukrainian president, and a related whistleblower complaint.</seg>
<seg id="5">"To help ensure that the foreign relations of the United States are carried out in good faith, I request that you investigate these and other circumstances described in the complaint and preserve all relevant records," Harris, another 2020 presidential contender, wrote.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I am particularly concerned that Department officials might have been aware of or aided Mr. Giuliani in violation of law or regulations against engaging in partisan political activities," she continued, urging Linick to determine whether Pompeo or any officials under him enabled Giuliani to advance Trump's political agenda.</seg>
<seg id="7">Her concerns are rooted in details from the whistleblower's report, which states that multiple U.S. officials were aware of Trump's actions, including two ambassadors who spoke directly with Giuliani about the president's request.</seg>

<seg id="2">A new awards scheme has been set up to recognise politicians who show courtesy in their work.</seg>
<seg id="3">It comes after a divisive week in Westminster following the return of Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was marked by threats against MPs and outrage over the language used by the likes of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.</seg>
<seg id="5">To counter the division, the "Civility in Politics" awards were announced on Friday, with the politician of the year to be awarded £3,000 to give to charity.</seg>
<seg id="6">Boris Johnson has been criticised for the tone of language he has used in the Commons chamber.</seg>
<seg id="7">Lord Stewart, announcing the awards, said: "Everyone agrees that politics in the UK is facing a crisis of trust and a crisis of civility.</seg>
<seg id="8">As divisions and bitterness mount in the continuing debates around Brexit, we strongly believe that politics has to respond not by mirroring these trends, but by bucking them.</seg>
<seg id="9">These awards are a small attempt by a group of people in public life - of different and no political persuasions - to shine a spotlight on politicians who argue their case with decency and civility, and are able to engage and work with people across the divides that affect us all."</seg>
<seg id="10">Nominations will open on Saturday, with an award ceremony in March next year.</seg>
<seg id="11">In an exclusive interview with the Standard, former Cabinet minister Amber Rudd today accused Mr Johnson of deploying aggressive language that "does incite violence."</seg>

<seg id="2">And Morrison does not have to say "fake news" to echo the President at times.</seg>
<seg id="3">He complained about the media on Wednesday for running "completely false" and "completely misleading" accounts of his climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="4">So when Morrison needs answers on how to win the next election, he will no doubt consider Trump's formula - and whether it works in November 2020.</seg>
<seg id="5">But political tactics do not transfer so easily across the Pacific.</seg>
<seg id="6">Those around Morrison are not planning a Trumpification of the Prime Minister for the simple reason that the intensely partisan tactics that work in the United States cannot work in a world where elections are won and lost in the centre.</seg>
<seg id="7">Compulsory voting stays the hand of anyone who wants to appeal to the edge and forget the middle.</seg>
<seg id="8">Trump is divisive in Australia and his friendship with Morrison may alienate some Australian voters, which means copying the President is no guarantee of victory.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some of Morrison's critics on the left see a world they fear, or perhaps secretly the almighty battle they want, when they make the Prime Minister out to be like Trump.</seg>
<seg id="10">Imagine Morrison if that were so.</seg>
<seg id="11">He would not only skip the United Nations climate summit.</seg>
<seg id="12">He would ridicule it as a waste of time.</seg>
<seg id="13">The fact that Morrison used his speech to the UN to talk about action on climate shows he does not want to lose voters in the middle who expect their political leaders to take it seriously.</seg>
<seg id="14">And there is a gulf between the two leaders on the right of a superpower to dictate terms in the world.</seg>

<seg id="17">The fact that Morrison used his speech to the UN to talk about action on climate shows he does not want to lose voters in the middle.</seg>
<seg id="18">What that means may require long study, but it is an immediate contrast with the Australian support for negotiated settlements between countries rather than the will of one group of patriots imposed on others.</seg>

<seg id="2">Zvamaida Murwira in NEW YORK, United States</seg>
<seg id="3">Illegal and ruinous sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe by the West have markedly slowed down the country's development, President Mnangagwa has said.</seg>
<seg id="4">He further dismissed the embargo as an attack on the rights of citizens.</seg>
<seg id="5">The President said this here during his address to the 74th Ordinary Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA 74).</seg>
<seg id="6">He applauded Southern Africa for solidly standing by Zimbabwe in calling for the unconditional removal of the two-decades-old embargo.</seg>
<seg id="7">While Zimbabwe had registered significant progress in providing safety nets for vulnerable groups of society, the President said, more could have been achieved had it not been for the illegal sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="8">These achievements are in spite of the continued albatross of the illegal economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Furthermore, sanctions are slowing down our progress, inhibiting our economic recovery and punishing the poorest and most vulnerable," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The President said Zimbabwe was in a transition and was determined to overcome the reality that it had a collapsed economy and currency due to illegal sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="11">Namibian President Hage Geingob weighed in, calling for the unequivocal lifting of sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe so that Harare could pursue its economic development agenda.</seg>
<seg id="12">President Mnangagwa urged the United Nations (UN) to assert its authority and honour its principles by reining in countries that imposed the sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="13">As the United Nations, let us boldly honour the principles of our Charter.</seg>
<seg id="14">The wrongs of the world must be set right.</seg>
<seg id="15">Unfair practices must be challenged; injustice, racism and all forms of oppression of man by man must be opposed and rejected.</seg>
<seg id="16">"My country applauds the South African Development Community, the African Union and all those who stand with us in demanding the immediate and unconditional removal of these illegal sanctions," said President Mnangagwa.</seg>
<seg id="17">Those that imposed these illegal sanctions must heed this call and lift them now.</seg>
<seg id="18">Cooperation is a win-win game.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sanctions are a lose-lose game.</seg>
<seg id="20">Zimbabwe deserves a restart.</seg>
<seg id="21">The West, specifically the US and the European Union (EU), imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe at the turn of the millennium in protest over the irreversible land reform programme that sought to correct land ownership imbalances that had been inherited from the racist colonial regime.</seg>
<seg id="22">Both the US and the EU claim to be champions of democracy and human rights, yet they are stifling economic growth in Zimbabwe through the maintenance of the racist sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="23">Analysts have suggested that the West was using the sanctions as a ploy to effect regime change through making living standards difficult in Zimbabwe so that citizens turn against their Government.</seg>
<seg id="24">The 39th SADC Summit of Heads of State and Government held in Tanzania noted the adverse impact on Zimbabwe's economy and the region at large, of the prolonged economic sanctions, and expressed solidarity.</seg>
<seg id="25">SADC called for the immediate lifting of the sanctions to facilitate socio-economic recovery in the country, and declared October 25th as the date on which SADC member States can collectively voice their disapproval of the sanctions through various activities and platforms until the sanctions are lifted.</seg>

<seg id="1">PM Narendra Modi At UN, Says "Have Anger, Commitment Against Terrorism"</seg>
<seg id="2">Prime Minister Narendra Modi, addressing the UN General Assembly today, stressed that the international community needs to unite against terror and work on consensus on fighting terrorism, which, he said, is among the biggest challenges not for any single country but for the entire world.</seg>
<seg id="3">"For the sake of humanity, the world has to unite against terror," PM Modi said in his address.</seg>
<seg id="4">Without naming Pakistan, PM Modi said there needed to be more anger globally about what terrorism was doing to humanity.</seg>
<seg id="5">We belong to a country that has given the world Buddh (Buddha's message of peace), not 'Yuddh' (war).</seg>
<seg id="6">When we raise our voice against terror, it is with seriousness and anger," said the Prime Minister in a 20-minute speech in Hindi, in which he also spoke about India's fight against global warming and its development initiatives.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was his second address to the General Debate at the UN, five years after his maiden speech as Prime Minister in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The lack of unanimity amongst us on the issue of terrorism dents those very principles that are the basis for the creation of the UN," PM Modi remarked.</seg>
<seg id="9">Swami Vivekananada had given the message of harmony and peace to the Parliament of Religions, and not dissension.</seg>
<seg id="10">The world's biggest democracy still has the same message for the world -- harmony and peace," he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">During his week-long US visit, the Prime Minister has, without once making a direct reference to Pakistan, made it clear that the country is the epicenter of terror and needs to act against terrorists operating from its soil.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the mega "Howdy, Modi!" event last Sunday, sharing a stage with US President Donald Trump, the Prime Minister said: "They have made hatred towards India the centre of their agenda."</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, the US said any easing of tensions between India and Pakistan is contingent on Islamabad taking action against those who engaged in cross-border infiltration.</seg>
<seg id="14">"I think what we would like to see are the conditions whereby India and Pakistan can have a constructive conversation that leads to an improvement of relations between the two nuclear powers," said Alice Wells, US Acting Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="15">And obviously, that is going to hinge off of counterterrorism, off of Pakistan's seriousness of effort in ensuring that groups don't take advantage and engage in cross-border infiltration, that there are serious steps to implement the Financial Action Task Force action plan that Pakistan has committed to, and which includes the prosecution of UN-designated terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="16">"So whether it's Hafiz Saeed who currently is in custody and under prosecution, but also leaders of Jaish-e-Mohammed, like Masood Azhar, who long have been able to exploit their presence on Pakistani soil," she said.</seg>

<seg id="2">Japan has raised its caution level about North Korea's missile capability, saying in a defense report that the country resumed missile tests while taking no concrete denuclearization steps and had succeeded in making miniaturized warheads.</seg>
<seg id="3">The annual defense paper, approved Friday by the Cabinet, underscores Japan's fear of being targeted by its neighbor.</seg>
<seg id="4">Its reaction to the North's recent tests contrasts to the low-key U.S. response.</seg>
<seg id="5">Since the second U.S.-North Korea summit collapsed this year, North Korea has fired 10 short-range missiles and projectiles deemed new and upgraded.</seg>
<seg id="6">The defense paper also highlights that China's threat is expanding into space from the regional seas.</seg>
<seg id="7">Japan is also bolstering its defense role under its alliance with the U.S. and is launching a space unit and measures against cyber and electromagnetic attacks.</seg>

<seg id="1">Brexit news: Britain on brink of 'watershed moment' as Remainers to accept 'they are wrong'</seg>
<seg id="2">Caller Bob insisted MPs seeking to oppose Brexit in Parliament will soon realise they are in the "wrong" position.</seg>
<seg id="3">Members of Parliament have been engaged in a bitter battle with Boris Johnson and his Cabinet in an attempt to make sure Britain does not leave the European Union without an official agreement.</seg>
<seg id="4">Phoning in Mike Graham's show on talkRADIO, Bob said: "I think it's a watershed moment because the Brexit blockers in Parliament are beginning to show their true colours."</seg>
<seg id="5">It's not that they want a deal for Brexit, they just don't want Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="6">They're getting more and more outspoken and frustrated because they are beginning to realise they are fundamentally wrong.</seg>
<seg id="7">Bob continued: "The reason for that, the fundamental reason for that, is that they are defying the people of this country who are sovereign."</seg>
<seg id="8">It all goes back to one fundamental thing, this wonderful thing that we have in this country - that is our Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="9">A lot of people say we don't have a Constitution, well, we do.</seg>
<seg id="10">Boris Johnson on Thursday refused to apologise for describing attempts to block a no-deal break with the EU as the "surrender act."</seg>
<seg id="11">But the Prime Minister acknowledged that he would have to be able to "reach out" to opposition MPs if he was to secure their support for any new deal he negotiated with the EU.</seg>
<seg id="12">Speaking to BBC South, Mr Johnson said: "I need to reach out across the House of Commons."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Barnier told reporters: "We are still ready to work on any new legal and operational proposal from the EU."</seg>
<seg id="14">Following a fiery debate in the Commons, Speaker of the House John Bercow urged MPs to give up negative conduct.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Bercow said: "I think there's a widespread sense across the House and beyond that yesterday the House did itself no credit."</seg>
<seg id="16">There was an atmosphere in the chamber worse than any I've known in my 22 years in the House.</seg>
<seg id="17">On both sides passions were inflamed, angry words uttered, the culture was toxic.</seg>

<seg id="1">GM Reverses Course On Decision To Cut Off Health Care For Striking Workers</seg>
<seg id="2">General Motors has decided to fund health care benefits for thousands of striking workers after the company initially moved to cut them off early in the nationwide work stoppage.</seg>
<seg id="3">The automaker said in a statement Thursday that it was "very concerned about the significant confusion" surrounding employee health insurance and that it had "chosen to work with our providers to keep all benefits fully in place" for workers on strike.</seg>
<seg id="4">The company assured there would be "no disruption" to medical, dental and prescription drug coverage.</seg>
<seg id="5">The move amounts to an about-face by Detroit-based GM, which said last week that the United Auto Workers union would have to fund COBRA benefits until the work stoppage ended.</seg>
<seg id="6">That earlier decision by GM ― which turned into national news ― created a wave of anxiety among employees who feared a lapse in coverage.</seg>
<seg id="7">Labor leaders and politicians hammered the company for what appeared to be a hardball bargaining tactic two days into the strike.</seg>
<seg id="8">The UAW did not let up its criticism even after GM reversed course Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="9">The union's lead negotiator on the GM contract, Vice President Terry Dittes, sent a letter to the company accusing it of "toying with the lives of hundreds of thousands of our UAW families."</seg>
<seg id="10">"There is no doubt that public sentiment sees these actions of GM as a shameful act!"</seg>
<seg id="11">The company declined to say how long it intended to fund the health care benefits if the strike continues for weeks.</seg>
<seg id="12">The stoppage had entered its 11th day on Thursday, with no clear end in sight.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is possible if the strike persists the company could decide again to force the union to pay for benefits out of its strike fund.</seg>
<seg id="14">Dittes said Wednesday that the UAW was waiting on a response from GM on the union's latest proposals and that "the back and forth will continue" until everything is resolved.</seg>
<seg id="15">The union and the company had been far apart on key issues, including the wage scale for newer hires, the company's use of temporary workers, and the share of health care costs borne by employees.</seg>
<seg id="16">The strike involves nearly 50,000 workers at more than 50 GM facilities around the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">The UAW is also negotiating new contracts this year with Ford and Fiat Chrysler, the other members of the Big Three.</seg>
<seg id="18">The union chose to bargain first with GM, extending its previous contracts with the other two automakers.</seg>
<seg id="19">UAW leadership called for a strike at GM starting Sept. 16 after workers" contract there expired.</seg>
<seg id="20">As HuffPost reported in July, the negotiations for a new four-year contract were expected to be the most difficult in more than a decade.</seg>
<seg id="21">Workers are expecting to make significant gains after sacrificing to prop up the company around the time of the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="22">GM, meanwhile, wants to keep labor costs down as auto sales slow.</seg>
<seg id="23">As one GM worker previously told HuffPost, "It's time for them to give back."</seg>

<seg id="1">Saudi FM: Financial pressure is best way to control Iran</seg>
<seg id="2">Saudi Arabia called on the world to apply "utmost pressure with every tool available" to end Iran's aggressive conduct, saying Thursday that the most effective way to control Tehran is to cut off its financial resources.</seg>
<seg id="3">Saudi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Assaf again blamed Iran for the Sept. 14 missile and drone attack on Saudi oil facilities, which jolted global oil prices and temporarily knocked out nearly 6% of daily global crude production.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We know very well who stood behind this aggression," Al-Assaf told the U.N. General Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="5">He called the strikes a flagrant violation of international laws and a threat to international peace and security.</seg>
<seg id="6">We have known that regime for 40 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is good at nothing but masterminding explosions, destruction and assassinations, not only in our region but also throughout the world," Al-Assaf said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Utmost pressure with every tool available should be applied to end the terrorist and aggressive conduct of the Iranian regime.</seg>
<seg id="9">Saudi Arabia insists Iranian weapons were used and has invited U.N. investigators to assess where the strikes were launched.</seg>
<seg id="10">The United States, France, Britain and Germany also blame Iran, which has been under U.S. sanctions since 2018.</seg>
<seg id="11">Iran has repeatedly and vehemently denied any involvement, and its president, Hassan Rouhani, says the Tehran government will not talk until the sanctions are lifted.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Cease this policy of maximum pressure and pursue a policy of dialogue and logic and reason," he stressed at a news conference on the sidelines of the General Assembly on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">U.S. President Donald Trump has deferred, at least for now, any immediate military strike on Iran.</seg>
<seg id="14">But he approved a broader effort to beef up security in Saudi Arabia and the region.</seg>
<seg id="15">He told reporters that showing restraint "shows far more strength" than launching retaliatory strikes now.</seg>
<seg id="16">The U.S. said Thursday it was sending one Patriot missile battery and four ground-based radar systems to Saudi Arabia, in what officials describe as the first steps to help the kingdom protect itself against Iranian attacks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two more Patriot batteries and a THAAD missile defense system will be prepared to go later if needed, and the deployment will involve about 200 troops.</seg>
<seg id="18">Said al-Assaf: "It is necessary for the international community to realize that cutting off sources of finance is the best way to compel the regime to renounce its militias, prevent it from developing ballistic missiles and put an end to its destabilizing activities in the region and the world."</seg>
<seg id="19">He added: "We are dealing with a rogue and terrorist system that continues to threaten international peace and security.</seg>
<seg id="20">It also jeopardizes energy supplies and the world economy; hence, the recent attacks are a real test of the international community's will.</seg>
<seg id="21">Tensions between Iran and the West have risen since Trump withdrew the U.S. from Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with several world powers, saying the agreement was woefully inadequate.</seg>
<seg id="22">The U.S. went on to impose heavy sanctions on Iran, even as other nations that signed the nuclear accord argued for trying to salvage it.</seg>
<seg id="23">After continuing to comply with the agreement for a year, Iran has returned to expanding its nuclear enrichment program.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trump Attacks Whistleblower Sources, Suggests Complaint Is Treason: Reports</seg>
<seg id="2">President Donald Trump on Thursday attacked anyone involved in the whistleblower complaint regarding his dealings with Ukraine as "almost a spy" and suggested their actions to expose his alleged impropriety were "treason," reported The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">The president made the remark as acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the House Intelligence Committee about the complaint, which prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Tuesday to announce the opening of an impeachment inquiry into Trump.</seg>
<seg id="4">The whistleblower, an unnamed U.S. intelligence officer, alleges several White House officials accused Trump of pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.</seg>
<seg id="5">Biden is a front-runner in the Democratic race to challenge Trump's reelection in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="6">The White House then attempted to cover up the exchange, according to the complaint.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Los Angeles Times posted audio of Trump's spy remarks he reportedly made in front of a crowd of staff from the United States Mission to the United Nations in New York City.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Basically, that person never saw the report, never saw the call, and he never saw the call - heard something and decided that he or she or whoever the hell it is - they're almost a spy," Trump said.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Who's the person who gave the whistleblower the information?</seg>
<seg id="10">Because that's close to a spy," the president continued.</seg>
<seg id="11">You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart with spies and treason, right?</seg>
<seg id="12">We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.</seg>
<seg id="13">No one in the U.S. has been convicted of treason ― a crime punishable by death ― in the last 70 years, according to NBC News.</seg>
<seg id="14">The House Intelligence Committee released the declassified complaint Thursday ahead of Maguire's hearing.</seg>
<seg id="15">The complainant alleges Trump's call with Zelensky amounted to an "abuse of his office for personal gain" and that White House officials were directed by White House lawyers to store a transcript of the call in an electronic system used to handle classified information.</seg>
<seg id="16">Maguire, whom Trump appointed to head the U.S. intelligence community last month, testified Thursday that he believed the whistleblower had "acted in good faith" when filing the complaint.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I have every reason to believe they have done everything by the book and followed the law," he told the committee.</seg>
<seg id="18">House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) condemned Trump's attacks on the whistleblower and his or her sources.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The President's suggestion that those involved in the whistleblower complaint should be dealt with as "we used to do" for "spies and treason" is a reprehensible invitation to violence against witnesses in our investigation," Schiff tweeted.</seg>
<seg id="20">All Americans must denounce such witness intimidation.</seg>

<seg id="1">Fife Flyers expect toughest test yet in Belfast Giants double-header</seg>
<seg id="2">Fife Flyers will face their toughest test of the season to date when they take on Belfast Giants in a Challenge Cup double-header this weekend.</seg>
<seg id="3">That's according to head coach Todd Dutiaume who wants his team to rise to the challenge against last season's Elite League champions, with a ferry trip to the Northern Irish capital on Saturday followed by the return match at Fife Ice Arena on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="4">"From what we've seen on tape, Belfast are an incredibly deep, well-rounded, physical and hard-working side," Dutes said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I imagine that will be our toughest challenge to date as a group, and we want to respond well to it.</seg>
<seg id="6">With a win and a defeat each, Flyers and Belfast both have two points after two games in Challenge Cup Group B.</seg>
<seg id="7">The weekend results could go a long way towards claiming a top three finish, and a quarter-final place.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Kirkcaldy side will need to find a way past former netminder Shane Owen, who moved to Belfast in the summer after an impressive season between the pipes in Fife.</seg>
<seg id="9">"We have a tremendous amount of respect not only for Shane but all our former players," Dutiaume said.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was recruited by an opposition team for a reason, and he seems to have settled in well there.</seg>
<seg id="11">I'm sure we'll have an opportunity to shake hands with him after the game, but up until that point it has to be business as usual.</seg>
<seg id="12">Instead of focusing on who we know or don't know, we have to be prepared to go into battle with these guys and grind out two crucial wins in the Challenge Cup.</seg>
<seg id="13">While the cup takes focus this weekend, Flyers have enjoyed a positive start to their league campaign, sitting top of the standings despite a 4-2 defeat in Guildford on Sunday that saw the team endure a 24-hour round bus trip.</seg>
<seg id="14">Depsite their early success, Dutiaume believes there is still room for improvement.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We've had a great start to the season, but we'd still like to be better at retrieving the puck, defensively, in all three areas of the ice," he explained.</seg>
<seg id="16">That's a work in progress.</seg>
<seg id="17">For instance, in the Nottingham game, all six players played a significant part in not only retaining possession but also getting it back when there was a turnover.</seg>
<seg id="18">It's a commitment to stick with the plan, and work hard in all aspects of the game.</seg>
<seg id="19">If the puck goes in people are fast to blame the goaltender or defencemen, but these are the last lines of defence.</seg>
<seg id="20">You need all guys on the ice, at all times, buying into playing on both sides of the puck and this is going to be key to our success.</seg>
<seg id="21">Sitting top of the standings is a good place to be, but if as a group we rest on that then we're all not doing our jobs.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to fight for the right to stay up around top of the table, and it takes a commitment every night.</seg>
<seg id="23">Dutiaume also stressed the importance of keeping five men on the ice after taking nine minor penalties in Guildford on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"We ran into early penalty trouble and that's a big momentum swinger," he said.</seg>
<seg id="25">We need to stay out of the box consistently because when you're on the back foot killing for big portions at the start of a hockey game, regardless if it's evened up later, you can lose that momentum quickly and it's hard to gain it back.</seg>
<seg id="26">All teams will talk about having a great start and making sure they take early steps to get a psychological and physical advantage.</seg>
<seg id="27">Dutiaume is also hoping his team can become more potent on the powerplay, adding: "Our powerplay is successful when we stick with it and stay patient, rather than trying to force passes because a team is killing great against us, and we end up getting ourselves isolated.</seg>
<seg id="28">We have an incredibly offensive bunch so the powerplay is not concerning, we just have to get comfortable with the system and make sure we're not standing around."</seg>

<seg id="3">Thomas Cook - the world's oldest travel firm - folded at the start of this week, prompting the loss of 21,000 jobs worldwide, about 9,000 of them in the UK.</seg>

<seg id="4">Between 18 and 20 December, two "unmanned aerial vehicles" closed the world's busiest runway for 33 hours - cancelling 1,000 flights and disrupting the travel plans of 150,000 travellers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The closure of Gatwick airport cost airlines around £50m in lost revenue and passenger care costs.</seg>
<seg id="6">The policing operation and subsequent investigation have cost £800,000.</seg>
<seg id="7">Assistant chief constable Dave Miller, head of operations command, said: "This was a serious and deliberate criminal act designed to endanger airport operations and the safety of the travelling public."</seg>
<seg id="8">More than 100 "credible witnesses" were interviewed, who were "used to working in a complex airport environment."</seg>
<seg id="9">They included a pilot, airport workers and airport police.</seg>
<seg id="10">Their statements indicate the drones were flown in 12 separate bursts across the three days.</seg>
<seg id="11">The activity ranged from seven to 45 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="12">"On six of these occasions, witnesses clearly saw two drones operating simultaneously," said Sussex Police.</seg>
<seg id="13">The report says there was no evidence to indicate the activity was related to terrorism, nor was it state-sponsored.</seg>
<seg id="14">Earlier this month, a climate-change group called Heathrow Pause attempted to shut down Heathrow airport by flying drones, but in the Gatwick incident, no campaigning group is thought to be responsible.</seg>
<seg id="15">In April, Chris Woodroofe, chief operating officer at Gatwick, told BBC's Panorama: "It was clear that the drone operators had a link into what was going on at the airport."</seg>
<seg id="16">Sussex Police say they have identified, researched and ruled out 96 "people of interest."</seg>
<seg id="17">A couple from Crawley were wrongly arrested in December for the drone attack.</seg>
<seg id="18">Paul Gait and Elaine Kirk were released without charge.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr Miller said: "With support from national experts, we have carried out an exhaustive criminal investigation but, without new information coming to light, there are no further realistic lines of enquiry at this time.</seg>
<seg id="20">Measures now available have strengthened our capability to respond to and investigate a similar incident in the future."</seg>

<seg id="2">The waste management firm Biffa has been fined £350,000 for trying to ship household rubbish to China labelled as wastepaper fit for recycling.</seg>
<seg id="3">Items found in the bales included sanitary towels, nappies, wet wipes and condoms - with the shipping containers reeking of vomit.</seg>
<seg id="4">A search of seven 25-tonne shipping containers bound for China at Felixstowe port in Suffolk found waste items including plastic containers, plastic bags, scrap metal and electrical debris.</seg>
<seg id="5">Other items found during the search included laminate flooring, coat hangers, pet food containers, latex gloves and pieces of china.</seg>
<seg id="6">Environment Agency inspectors also found women's underwear, bags of dog excrement and a 12-inch record by the 90s band Deee-Lite.</seg>
<seg id="7">Biffa Waste Services, the second largest recycling company in the UK, claimed the bales contained 98.5% waste paper, which can be legally transported to China.</seg>
<seg id="8">Shipping heavily contaminated waste to the country has been illegal since 2006 because it is not part of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).</seg>
<seg id="9">Biffa was convicted of two counts of breaching waste transportation laws between May and June 2015 after a three-week trial at Wood Green crown court in north London in June.</seg>
<seg id="10">Jurors heard Biffa, which reported revenues of £683.6m last year, used two brokers to manage the deal to send the waste to sites in Shenzhen and Guangdong on the South China Sea coast.</seg>
<seg id="11">One of the brokers arranged a shipment of 5,863 tonnes of wastepaper between Biffa worth £350,000, while the second arranged the sale of 4,992 tonnes of wastepaper worth £290,000.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, the Environment Agency prevented any of the seven containers from leaving Felixstowe.</seg>
<seg id="13">The company claimed its exports were regularly inspected by the Chinese authorities who had never made complaints, and that its clients were capable of generating significant quantities of paper from the bales it supplied.</seg>
<seg id="14">Handing Biffa a £350,000 fine on Friday, the judge, Simon Auerbach, said: "The principle of this environmental regulation is to the prevent export of our waste processing and disposing of the problem to other parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="15">Exporting to non-OECD countries is the very essence of the offence and the willingness of the Chinese authorities to accept it and their ability to process it are not, in my judgment, the point.</seg>
<seg id="16">Biffa was also ordered to pay £240,000 costs to the Environment Agency and a confiscation order of £9,912, which was the total amount it received for the blocked shipment of waste.</seg>
<seg id="17">Richard Branwell, defending Biffa, highlighted the shortcomings of the UK's waste management system as a whole, pointing out that of all the 8m tonnes of fibre recovered each year, just 3.3m tonnes can be recycled domestically.</seg>
<seg id="18">He said Biffa's business model of exporting waste was vital to helping the government meet its recovery and recycling targets.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sailesh Mehta, prosecuting, said contaminants could be seen poking out of bales that were not broken open by inspectors.</seg>
<seg id="20">Mehta said Biffa had dismissed suggestions that its waste sorting process could be improved to prevent contaminants ending up in bales of waste paper.</seg>
<seg id="21">The company had claimed its processes were already "as good as it gets" when ideas such as employing more pickers or slowing conveyor belts were floated.</seg>
<seg id="22">"If all [these ideas] are impossible, we suggest it is incumbent on the defendant charged with this important duty to start the whole system afresh," he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">THE NEWS that Granit Xhaka is set to be announced as Arsenal's club captain has been met with agony by many Gooners.</seg>
<seg id="3">Reports indicate that Unai Emery entrusted the decision to his squad, having originally picked a five-strong group of leaders to rotate the armband.</seg>
<seg id="4">Xhaka's appointment has divided supporters</seg>
<seg id="5">And on Friday news broke that Xhaka was to be named the official replacement of Laurent Koscielny, who controversially left Arsenal in the summer.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many Gunners fans are ready to get behind the Swiss midfielder but others see him as a liability.</seg>
<seg id="7">The reports happened to pop up on Xhaka's 27th birthday and critics used a club well-wishing post to vent their frustration.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gooner Zaki wrote: "Announce six month holiday as birthday present."</seg>
<seg id="9">Another, Yash, added: "Sell him as a gift."</seg>
<seg id="10">While Ariss remarked: "Xhaka boom Xhaka out of my club."</seg>
<seg id="11">And Aliwa lamented: "Doesn't deserve to wear the armband, he's a total banter in our team."</seg>
<seg id="12">One fan accounted however, rebuffed: "These so called Arsenal fans are the worst.</seg>
<seg id="13">Highly aggressive children who never achieved anything in their life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Fans of rival teams took aim at Arsenal as well, claiming it was further evidence the North London side had lost their way.</seg>
<seg id="15">One Spurs fan commented a mock-up of the Jose Mourinho meme reading: "I prefer not to laugh, if I laugh I am in big trouble."</seg>
<seg id="16">An Everton fan joked: "Just realised I can't laugh at Arsenal for making Xhaka their captain because ours runs off the pitch three times a week and hasn't picked his head up for a cross since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="17">A Chelsea fan added: "We also don't have a captain at Chelsea, but Xhaka at Arsenal!?"</seg>

<seg id="1">Toyota said to be increasing stake in Subaru to more than 20%</seg>
<seg id="2">Toyota Motor plans to raise its stake in Subaru to more than 20% from around 17% now, a deal that would also see the smaller firm invest in Japan's top automaker, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The deal is due to be approved at a Toyota board meeting on Friday, the people said, declining to be identified because the information has not been made public.</seg>
<seg id="4">The investment would come a month after Toyota and another smaller Japanese automaker, Suzuki Motor, said they would take small equity stakes in each other.</seg>
<seg id="5">Such tie-ups highlight how automakers are scrambling to chase scale, manage costs and boost development.</seg>
<seg id="6">Traditional carmakers, especially smaller ones like Subaru and Suzuki, are struggling to meet the fast pace of change in an industry being transformed by the rise of electric vehicles, ride-hailing and autonomous driving.</seg>
<seg id="7">Toyota's investment is likely to cost more than 70 billion yen ($650 million) based on Subaru's stock market value, said the Nikkei business daily, which first reported the news.</seg>
<seg id="8">Subaru is likely to reciprocate with a stake in Toyota that would roughly equal the value of Toyota's additional investment, one of the people told Reuters.</seg>
<seg id="9">Representatives for both Toyota and Subaru said the news was not something that had been announced by their companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Subaru is particularly strong in sport-utility vehicles (SUV) and all-wheel-drive technology.</seg>
<seg id="11">The two automakers in June said they planned to jointly develop an electric sport-utility vehicle on a platform produced together, to split costs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Carmakers around the world have been joining forces to slash development and manufacturing costs of new technology.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ford Motor and Volkswagen have said they will spend billions of dollars to jointly develop electric and self-driving vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="14">Toyota seems to be particularly keen to build scale now by investing in smaller, domestic automakers, rather than forging cross-border tie-ups like some of its rivals.</seg>
<seg id="15">It has been looking to expand scale in next-generation technology and said this year it would offer free access to patents for electric vehicle motors and power control units.</seg>
<seg id="16">Shares of Toyota were down 0.9% while shares of Subaru fell 1.5% on Friday morning.</seg>

<seg id="2">Thunberg's U.N. speech inspires Dutch climate protesters</seg>
<seg id="3">THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Thousands of Dutch children skipped school to join a global climate strike on Friday, blocking traffic and asking their leaders "how dare you?" in a reference to Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg's speech at the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="4">A participant holds a drawing depicting Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg during a protest march to call for action against climate change, in The Hague, Netherlands September 27, 2019.</seg>
<seg id="5">Turnout at the march in The Hague exceeded expectations with organizers estimating the crowd at about 35,000.</seg>
<seg id="6">Police were forced to reroute the march to a location with more space.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thunberg, 16, gave an impassioned address at the United Nations in New York this week, after millions of people worldwide joined a climate strike protest last Friday in the run-up to a U.N. climate summit.</seg>
<seg id="8">"This strike is going to have a lot of effect when people keep showing up, not just today but also in the future and we see different kinds of people from all walks of life," said protester Reinder Rustema.</seg>
<seg id="9">Banging drums and holding pictures of Thunberg, protesters walked through the city center with placards reading: "For the Greta good," "Don't be a fossil fool," and "You will die of old age, we will die of climate change."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I understand their concerns, I believe they are being heard," Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told journalists at a weekly press briefing within earshot of the protests.</seg>
<seg id="11">We have presented very ambitious plans to deal with these problems.</seg>
<seg id="12">But we have to do it in a smart way, which also creates jobs.</seg>
<seg id="13">Thunberg's brief address electrified the start of the summit aimed at mobilizing government and business to break international paralysis over carbon emissions, which hit record highs last year despite decades of warnings from scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">How dare you?" she said, her voice quavering with emotion.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Netherlands, with 17 million inhabitants, generated less than 7 percent of all energy from sustainable sources in 2017, compared to 15 percent in Germany and over half of all energy in Sweden.</seg>
<seg id="16">The government has pledged to halve CO2 emissions from 1990 levels by 2030, but by 2017 had only achieved a 13 percent cut.</seg>

<seg id="1">North Korea slams US "inaction" on lifting sanctions after nuclear talks</seg>
<seg id="2">North Korea accused the United States of doing nothing to implement issues agreed on at summits between US President Donald Trump and the country's leader, Kim Jong-un, but said it is placing hope in the US president's "wise option and bold decision."</seg>
<seg id="3">A statement from Foreign Ministry adviser Kim Kye Gwan circulated by North Korea's UN mission came days after Mr Trump said, without elaborating, that another summit meeting with Kim "could happen soon."</seg>
<seg id="4">"It draws my keen interest that it is highly topical these days in the US to hold another DPRK-US summit," the adviser said, using the initials of the country's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.</seg>
<seg id="5">But he was critical of US inaction since the summits.</seg>
<seg id="6">While past summits were "historic occasions" for the two leaders "to express their political will to put an end to the hostile relations between the two countries and have peace and stability settled on the Korean peninsula," Kim Kye Gwan said "no practical follow-up was made to implement the issues agreed upon at the summit talks."</seg>
<seg id="7">The Foreign Ministry adviser said North Korea "has made sincere efforts to build trust" and implement the joint Washington-Pyongyang statement issued after the first summit between Kim and Mr Trump in Singapore last year.</seg>
<seg id="8">He pointed to North Korea's repatriation of American detainees "who committed hostile acts" against the country and the return of remains of soldiers killed during the 1950-53 Korean War.</seg>
<seg id="9">"However, the US has done nothing for implementing the joint statement," the North Korean official said.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the contrary, he cited the resumption of US-South Korean military drills "which the US president personally pledged to suspend," and the ratcheting up of US sanctions against the North.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kim Kye Gwan said it is "hard reality" that politicians in Washington are obsessed with "nuclear disarmament first" by North Korea before sanctions can be lifted and the country "can get access to a bright future."</seg>
<seg id="12">The adviser said this makes him doubt whether "a new breakthrough" could take place in US-North Korean relations through another summit.</seg>
<seg id="13">But he left a door open.</seg>
<seg id="14">"I came to know that President Trump is different from his predecessors in political sense and decision while watching his approach to the DPRK, so I would like to place my hope on president Trump's wise option and bold decision," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">In his mid-70s, Kim Kye Gwan is a veteran diplomat who led the North Korean delegation at much of the now-dormant six-nation nuclear disarmament talks held in Beijing in 2003-2008.</seg>
<seg id="16">In his speech to the global gathering on Tuesday, Mr Trump briefly mentioned North Korea, saying the United States has pursued "bold diplomacy on the Korean Peninsula."</seg>
<seg id="17">"I have told Kim Jong-un what I truly believe: that, like Iran, his country is full of tremendous untapped potential, but that to realise that promise, North Korea must denuclearise," the US president said.</seg>
<seg id="18">North Korea entered talks with the United States last year, saying it was willing to negotiate away its advancing nuclear arsenal in exchange for security guarantees and sanctions relief.</seg>
<seg id="19">The North wants a step-by-step disarmament process, in which each of its denuclearisation step is matched by a corresponding US reward.</seg>
<seg id="20">The United States says sanctions on North Korea will remain in place until the country takes significant steps toward denuclearisation.</seg>
<seg id="21">During the Singapore summit, Kim Jong-un promised to work toward complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula without providing any timetable or road map for disarmament steps.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Singapore, Kim and Trump also agreed to establish new bilateral relations and build a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="23">They met again in Vietnam in February for a second summit.</seg>
<seg id="24">But that meeting abruptly fell apart after Mr Trump rejected Kim's request for extensive relief of sanctions in return for dismantling his main nuclear complex, a limited denuclearisation step.</seg>
<seg id="25">The two leaders held a brief, impromptu meeting at the Korean border in late June, and agreed to restart talks.</seg>

<seg id="9">And I hope that Scottish Conservatives get the credit they deserve for the hundreds of millions of extra funding that we're putting into Scottish agriculture which was secured, not by Nicola Sturgeon, but by Scottish Conservatives.'</seg>
<seg id="10">Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has already said she wants to have another referendum on leaving the UK in the second half of 2020, but Mr Johnson has previously stated his opposition to a second vote on the issue.</seg>
<seg id="11">He told BBC Scotland on Thursday: "We had an independence referendum in 2014 and we made an explicit promise to the people of Scotland that this was going to be a once-in-a-generation event.</seg>
<seg id="12">The people of Scotland voted very, very substantially to stay part of the UK, which was the right decision as this is the most successful union anywhere in the world.</seg>
<seg id="13">They were promised this was a once-in-a-generation thing and I think we should stick with that."</seg>
<seg id="14">Writing on Twitter on Wednesday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon described Mr Johnson as "untrustworthy, craven, not a shred of concern for the consequences of his words or actions."</seg>
<seg id="15">She tweeted: "The Westminster opposition should unite around a plan to trigger the no confidence process to bring Johnson's government down, ensure the Benn Act is honoured and enable a General Election as quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="16">Doing nothing should not be an option."</seg>
<seg id="17">The Scottish Government has been asked for comment on the interview with Mr Johnson.</seg>

<seg id="2">Jess Phillips has said she feels "jumpy and worried" after a man was arrested outside the Labour MP's office and she received threats aimed at "you and your Remain friends."</seg>
<seg id="3">The Birmingham Yardley MP said her staff had to be confined to her constituency office as a man allegedly kicked the door, tried to smash windows and yelled she was a "fascist."</seg>

<seg id="1">How to navigate the Sydney market this spring</seg>
<seg id="2">House hunters need to have a game plan that they are prepared to obey to combat a turbulent Sydney market that is throwing up plenty of conflicting results.</seg>
<seg id="3">Experts say that in a market that is seeing the Sydney clearance rate hover around 80 per cent and a lack of stock, buyers need to be patient to avoid having FOMO, the fear-of-missing-out.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since the federal election, record low interest rates and the loosening of lending requirements, the Sydney market has seen plenty of mixed results, with many houses selling for hundred thousands of dollars above the reserve, while others are only just selling.</seg>
<seg id="5">The mixed market has seen a small but stable growth in price, with CoreLogic August monthly home value index showing a 1.6 per cent increase in house prices.</seg>
<seg id="6">REA chief economist Nerida Conisbee said Sydney is a tale of two cities at the moment and it is causing volatile results.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The inner city and eastern suburbs are seeing the best conditions, with strong search activity that is now flowing through to pricing, while other parts of Sydney remain stable," she said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ms Conisbee said the price guides and reserves that have been broken by so much is from a combination of factors including limited stock, buyer confidence and real estate agents remaining cautious.</seg>
<seg id="9">"It is taking a while for agents to get up to speed with pricing and the valuation may not be as reflective as the mood on the ground," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, while we are seeing many huge results, the data is still yet to reflect this at the moment, which may be playing a role.</seg>
<seg id="11">Buyer's agent and CEO of Propertybuyer.com.au Rich Harvey agreed that there were pockets of the market that were not being priced to reflect current market conditions.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It is creating false hope for many buyers who think they can have a chance for a property with a $1.3 million guide, when it will really sell for $1.5 million," he said.</seg>
<seg id="13">To have success this spring, buyers need to be resilient and do their homework, Mr Harvey said.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Never go to an auction without knowing how much you can spend, as I've seen many panicked buyers who go unprepared and spend more than what they should," he said.</seg>
<seg id="15">If an auction goes above your budget and you miss out, don't worry as there will be another home out there.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Harvey said buyers should also research recent comparable sales and know how the area is performing to avoid overpaying for a property.</seg>
<seg id="17">Independent auctioneer and Sky News commentator Tom Panos said house hunters should also tread carefully and not get carried away with a lack of stock available.</seg>
<seg id="18">"With a decrease of new listings putting pressure on the market, buyers are getting more emotional and are paying $300,000-$400,000 above reserve as a result," he said.</seg>
<seg id="19">This was the scene a fortnight ago in Strathfield, where a six-bedroom property sold for $900,000 above reserve after an emotional auction saw two registered bidders who both desperately wanted the home refuse to give up, even as it sailed past the reserve.</seg>
<seg id="20">Mr Panos said buyers need to have a walkaway figure and come up with a plan B to avoid only looking and settling for one property.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Having a plan B puts a buyer in the best position to avoid putting all of their eggs in one basket and making irrational decisions," he said.</seg>
<seg id="22">If buyers find their budget isn't working for them after many auction defeats, Mr Panos said they should avoid lowering their expectations.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Don't fall into a trap of going for a home you don't really want as changeover costs are high," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Instead, look at neighbouring suburbs that offer the same amenities for a fraction of the price.</seg>
<seg id="25">With the Sydney market facing a shortage of stock, Mr Panos said house hunters need to be patient.</seg>
<seg id="26">"Buyers need to tread carefully as we are going to have a late spring this year and there will be auctions all the way up to Christmas," he said.</seg>
<seg id="27">Once the school holidays are finished, Mr Panos said there will be a rush of new listings from sellers who are eager to take advantage of a strong market.</seg>
<seg id="28">It will also mean buyers should have more properties to choose from than what there has been so far this spring.</seg>
<seg id="29">It also means that window of opportunity vendors have had with strong auction results these last few months will soften as a result of an increase in stock levels.</seg>
<seg id="30">Currently there are 400 fewer new listings on the market this year compared to the 1805 at the same time last year, according to CoreLogic.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Zimbabwean government has given the family of the late former president Robert Mugabe a go ahead to bury him in Zvimba communal lands, Mashonaland West, instead of a so-called mausoleum being constructed at the National Heroes Acre.</seg>
<seg id="3">In an interview, Information Secretary, Nick Mangwana, said the family has a right to designate the burial place of the former Zimbabwean leader, who died of cancer on September 6th in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="4">The family of the later former President R. G. Mugabe has expressed its desire to proceed with his burial in Zvimba.</seg>
<seg id="5">In line with government policy to respect the wishes of families of deceased heroes, government is cooperating with the Mugabe family in their new position.</seg>
<seg id="6">Government will render all the necessary support to give the late former president a fitting burial as led by the family.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reacting to the latest development on Mugabe's burial, Maureen Kademaunga of the Movement for Democratic Change led by Nelson Chamisa, told VOA Zimbabwe Service that the late former president's burial saga will cost the nation huge sums of money as a mausoleum being built in Harare has been abandoned without proper consultations with relevant stakeholders.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Mugabe family had said they don't want anything to do with the heroes acre.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is something they were saying from the day he was declared dead.</seg>
<seg id="10">So, they just went ahead and did that thing.</seg>
<seg id="11">So they flushed money down the drain ...</seg>
<seg id="12">Our members of parliament are going to be demanding accountability.</seg>
<seg id="13">We want to know how much money had gone into that project and how they are going to replace that money.</seg>
<seg id="14">The late president will be laid to rest Saturday, according to family members.</seg>

<seg id="2">The U.S. Justice Department will open an antitrust investigation of Facebook Inc, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, marking the fourth recent antitrust probe of the social media company.</seg>
<seg id="3">Facebook also faces probes by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), a group of state attorneys general led by New York and the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee.</seg>
<seg id="4">Large tech companies, including Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google, have increasingly been on the defensive in recent years over lapses such as privacy breaches and outsized market influence.</seg>
<seg id="5">Facebook has faced extra scrutiny tied to how it allowed its platforms to be used during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.</seg>
<seg id="6">The company, which owns one-time rivals Instagram and WhatsApp and has 2.4 billion monthly users, recently paid a $5 billion settlement for sharing 87 million users' data with defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.</seg>
<seg id="7">Facebook declined to comment on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">Reuters and others reported in June the two federal agencies had divided up responsibility for the companies being investigated, with the Justice Department taking Google and Apple while the FTC looked at Facebook and Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Justice Department later said it was opening a probe of online platforms.</seg>
<seg id="10">It did not specify which ones, but said it would consider concerns raised about "search, social media and some retail services online."</seg>
<seg id="11">Neither agency has revealed the focus of investigations into Facebook, though the Wall Street Journal has reported that the FTC's probe is focused on the company's acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="12">The world's largest social network has purchased nearly 90 companies since 2003, showed data from S&P Global.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Justice Department's antitrust chief likewise told a tech conference in August that the government is looking at previously approved acquisitions as part of its broad review.</seg>
<seg id="14">This led some industry observers to question whether the two federal investigations would overlap.</seg>
<seg id="15">Lawmakers, in particular Sen. Mike Lee, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel, criticized the appearance of an overlap in a hearing last week.</seg>
<seg id="16">The agencies generally have a practice of meeting to decide who will investigate which matter but the FTC cannot probe certain areas, for example price-fixing.</seg>
<seg id="17">The probe into Facebook by the state attorneys general, announced earlier this month, is being led by New York and also includes Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and the District of Columbia.</seg>
<seg id="18">New York Attorney General Letitia James said that investigation would look into whether Facebook's actions had endangered consumer data, reduced the quality of consumers' choices or increased the price of advertising.</seg>

<seg id="2">Antonio Caruso can see a lot of resemblances between AFL and fighting one-on-one inside a cage.</seg>
<seg id="3">On face value the sports are polar opposites, but the training and mental dedication needed to succeed run on tight parallel.</seg>
<seg id="4">And a new life in Florida, sparring with the world's fighters in preparation for his ONE Championship MMA debut, has surprising throwbacks to his amateur football days at Salisbury West.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Imagine you're playing in the AFL but you're training with an amateur club, then you go out on a Saturday and play with the AFL boys," he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Of course you can kick and catch the same, but the temper, the pace, it's not the same.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some days I'll walk away, some rounds I've lost badly, but previous to that, back home, I was never getting challenged.</seg>
<seg id="8">The reflection was born on the back of a hard training session run by former UFC welterweight champion Robbie Lawler at Hard Knocks MMA gym - Carusos's home away form home.</seg>
<seg id="9">The undefeated 28-year-old said the grinding work has him primed to take out Mongolian Amarsanaa Tsogookhuu in Jakarta on October 25.</seg>
<seg id="10">"You can be on the mat at any one time with three or four champions, mixing it up with them," he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">That's the biggest change here, there's no easy rounds, there's no easy work.</seg>
<seg id="12">I can't run before a sparring session and then go spar, these guys will run rings around me.</seg>
<seg id="13">But I feed off of it.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tsogookhuu (5W-1L) made his pro debut in 2016 and won the MGL-1 lightweight championship title in October, before making the move to Asia's biggest MMA promotion.</seg>
<seg id="15">But under the guidance of head coach Henri Hooft, Caruso feels like a new man.</seg>
<seg id="16">Henri's so advanced as a coach and he's seen it all, fighters from the best days to their worst days.</seg>
<seg id="17">"You can't buy that type of experience," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">(Tsogookhuu) has grown up different to me, but it terms of skills and ability, he's tough and has what it takes, but it won't be enough.</seg>
<seg id="19">He's going to be strong, but that doesn't hold you too long in this game.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the card's main event, ONE welterweight champion Zebaztian Kadestam will defend his title against Kiamrian Abbasov.</seg>

<seg id="2">Long jumper M Sreeshankar failed to reach the final after a disappointing performance while 400m hurdler MP Jabir made it to the semifinals on the opening day of the World Athletics Championships in Doha on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Another 400m hurdler Dharun Ayyasamy, the national record holder, tumbled after the last hurdle in his heat to fail to qualify for the semifinals.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 20-year-old Sreeshankar could only produce a best jump of 7.62m from his three attempts in the qualification B to finish 22nd overall.</seg>
<seg id="5">His effort was well below his season's best of 8.00m, which he had produced only last month in Patiala.</seg>
<seg id="6">Later in the day, Jabir finished third in the heat number one and 11th overall in men's 400m hurdle with a time of 49.62 seconds to qualify for the semifinals to be held on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="7">He has a season's and personal best of 49.13.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ayyasamy could only clock 50.55 as he lost precious time after hitting the final hurdle.</seg>
<seg id="9">He finished sixth in heat number five and 27th overall to miss out of the semifinals.</seg>
<seg id="10">Ayyasamy, who had recovered from an injury recently, has a personal and season's best of 48.80.</seg>
<seg id="11">The first four in each of the five heats and the next four fastest qualify for the 400m hurdles semifinals.</seg>
<seg id="12">The first Indian to take the field on Friday was Sreeshankar, who has a personal best and national record of 8.20m.</seg>
<seg id="13">He began with a 7.52m before clearing 7.62m.</seg>
<seg id="14">He then fouled his third and final jump to end his campaign in disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The automatic mark for the finals was set at 8.15m but only one jumper could touch it.</seg>
<seg id="16">The 11 other best performers went through to the finals with the least distance making the cut was 7.89m.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sreeshankar's 7.62m effort here was his second worst this season.</seg>
<seg id="18">He had 7.53m in the qualifying round of the National Inter-State Championships in Lucknow last month.</seg>
<seg id="19">This season, he has been consistent around 7.80m with three jumps in the 7.90s, besides the 8.00m in Patiala on August 16.</seg>

<seg id="3">Reporter Tom LoBianco, who covered Pence for The Associated Press and Indianapolis Star, reveals in his new book "Piety & Power: Mike Pence and the Taking of the White House" that Karen Pence was very unhappy with the recording.</seg>
<seg id="4">The notorious tape featured Donald Trump in 2005 bragging about grabbing women "by the pussy" without their consent.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Karen ... "was livid" at Trump's prurient comments in the "Access Hollywood" tape," The New York Times wrote in a Friday morning article covering LoBianco's book.</seg>

<seg id="13">She said the duchess pushed them to plough ahead with their new ideas and spoke about how they have to keep pushing and going forward, knowing they are doing it for others who will follow.</seg>
<seg id="14">'She wasn't referring to being a royal, but life in general when you have challenges,' Modise added, admitting she felt a bit 'awestruck' by Meghan.</seg>
<seg id="15">'She radiates grace and she is taking this task that she has with such grace,' Modise said.</seg>
<seg id="16">A lot of us have done amazing things as founders, but meeting a royal is quite daunting.</seg>
<seg id="17">She made it easy.</seg>
<seg id="18">She is an easy-going royal.</seg>
<seg id="19">Meghan also revealed she's enjoying the pressures of being a working mother, admitting she finds juggling being a royal and looking after baby Archie 'a lot' but 'all so exciting'.</seg>
<seg id="20">Speaking to mother-of-two Lara Rosmarin, CEO of Cape Innovation and Technology, Meghan said: 'We're only five months in right now.</seg>

<seg id="1">Immanuel Christian School: Sixth-grade boys accused of pinning down black girl and cutting off her dreadlocks in Virginia</seg>
<seg id="2">A black middle school student from Virginia is accusing three white boys of pinning her down and cutting off her dreadlocks.</seg>
<seg id="3">The incident took place at Immanuel Christian School - where Vice President Mike Pence's wife, Karen Pence, is a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="4">Amari Allen, a 12-year-old student at the private K-12 Christian school, said the boys called her dreadlocks "ugly" and "nappy" before cutting them off on the playground during recess.</seg>
<seg id="5">"They kept laughing and calling me names," Amari told CBS affiliate WUSA-TV, tearing up.</seg>
<seg id="6">They called me 'ugly,' said, 'I shouldn't have been born.'</seg>
<seg id="7">They called me 'an attention-seeker.'</seg>
<seg id="8">According to WUSA, one of the boys allegedly covered Amari's mouth while another held her hands behind her back and a third took a pair of scissors to her dreadlocks.</seg>
<seg id="9">Amari didn't tell her family about the incident until after her grandmother noticed the length of her hair had changed.</seg>
<seg id="10">"They ran off laughing, and I was just sitting there," Amari said.</seg>
<seg id="11">The alleged incident occurred on Monday, but the shy preteen said she didn't tell her family about it until Wednesday, after her grandmother noticed her hair looked different.</seg>
<seg id="12">She feared retaliation if she confessed the truth, she said.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It's very painful," said Cynthia Allen, Amari's grandmother.</seg>
<seg id="14">I want to see them dismissed from the school.</seg>
<seg id="15">I want to see something done.</seg>
<seg id="16">Allen's family pays nearly $12,000 per year for Amari to attend the school, which made headlines earlier this year after Karen Pence took an art teaching job at the famously anti-LGBTQ institution.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We take seriously the emotional and physical well-being of all our students, and have a zero-tolerance policy for any kind of bullying or abuse," Immanuel Christian School said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="18">We are deeply disturbed by the allegations being made, and are in communication with the family of the alleged victim to gather information and provide whatever support we can.</seg>
<seg id="19">We have also reached out to law enforcement to ask them to conduct a thorough investigation, and further inquiries should be directed to the Fairfax County Police.</seg>
<seg id="20">While the school has a zero-tolerance policy for bullying, Amari said the boys had previously tormented her.</seg>
<seg id="21">She said that the boys have taken her lunch and called her names in the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">Amari's family met with school officials Thursday, and the investigation is ongoing.</seg>

<seg id="2">The committee decided against renewing Arthur's contract, which paved the way for Misbah to be named the country's chief selector and new head coach.</seg>
<seg id="3">Arthur said he had supported the participation of both Wasim and Misbah on the committee but was disappointed with the decision after placing his trust in them.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I guess the only disappointment I have out of the whole lot is that there were some people I really trusted who ultimately didn't follow through," said Arthur during the interview.</seg>
<seg id="5">"And it just happened to be that Misbah was on the committee that didn't renew our contracts and becomes this heir-apparent," he added.</seg>

<seg id="7">Misbah will do a good job, Misbah is a good guy and Pakistan cricket made their decision.</seg>
<seg id="8">I was disappointed because I loved every second of that job.</seg>
<seg id="9">The comments caused a stir in Pakistani media, where cricket gossip is widely reported.</seg>
<seg id="10">Speaking to AFP by phone from Perth, said he had the right to speak his mind after faithfully serving the team for three years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Passenger caught urinating on Sydney train</seg>
<seg id="2">Disgusting video footage has emerged of a passenger urinating on a Sydney train as horrified school students watch just metres away.</seg>
<seg id="3">A video of the incident, which occurred at around 8.30am this morning on a train travelling between Werrington and Kingswood, was posted to Facebook by Sydney woman Jordy Lee.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Share this pig around," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="5">Doing this in front of kids on their way to school this morning.</seg>
<seg id="6">The footage shows a male passenger, believed to be in his late teens, leaning against a pole near the carriage doors and urinating onto the ground.</seg>
<seg id="7">The footage was filmed by two students as a way of exposing the man's vile behaviour, according to the Penrith Press.</seg>
<seg id="8">The kids' mum then posted it to Facebook, telling the publication she was left in disgust by the whole incident.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I am in total shock that this happened in peak hour on a Friday morning in front of children just going to school," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's an absolutely disgusting thing to do; my dog wouldn't even do that.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her children told her the man was laying on the seats asleep when they got on, then during the trip he got up and started urinating on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="12">When he was done he reportedly sat back on a seat and fell asleep again.</seg>
<seg id="13">Facebook users flocked to the post to call out the passenger for his disgusting behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="14">"What an animal!" one person said.</seg>
<seg id="15">That is properly disgusting.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mate take a leak before you leave the house," another wrote.</seg>

<seg id="1">Carty is most consistent Irish out-half in 2019</seg>
<seg id="2">Stephen Ferris says Jack Carty's selection against Japan is a reward for his consistency of performance over the past year with both Connacht and Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 27-year old Carty only made his international debut in late February, as a late replacement in Ireland's rather unconvincing victory over Italy in the Six Nations.</seg>
<seg id="4">He has appeared eight times since then, impressing on each occasion, including a delightful performance on being introduced in the second half of Ireland's demolition of Scotland on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Carty has been handed his second international start against Japan on Saturday, the first coming in the World Cup warm-up win over Wales in Cardiff late last month.</seg>
<seg id="6">A few years back, there was a host of out-half candidates vying for the tag of understudy to Johnny Sexton, and the Athlone-born out-half has emerged from the pack to challenge Joey Carbery for the role.</seg>
<seg id="7">Speaking on the RTÉ Rugby Podcast, Ferris argues that Carty has been the most "consistent" out-half in the Irish system across 2019 - including Johnny Sexton.</seg>
<seg id="8">I thought he was absolutely superb (against Scotland).</seg>
<seg id="9">He recognised the Scottish defence and what he was up against.</seg>
<seg id="10">He played heads up rugby at times.</seg>
<seg id="11">His kicking game was pretty solid, he looked half decent in defence when he was called upon.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would say Carty has been probably the most consistent out-half within the Irish system for the last year or so.</seg>
<seg id="13">He's been superb.</seg>
<seg id="14">Week in, week out, he's never really let his side down.</seg>
<seg id="15">The likes of Sexton...</seg>
<seg id="16">Johnny has had a couple of bad games over the last year or so.</seg>
<seg id="17">He's been out injured.</seg>
<seg id="18">He's been a little bit more inconsistent.</seg>
<seg id="19">Whereas Carty has been really, really steady.</seg>
<seg id="20">Against a Japanese team that are going to come out firing, they're going to bring huge support, maybe it is that steady hand that you need.</seg>
<seg id="21">Maybe it is that game management.</seg>
<seg id="22">I feel that he won't let Joe down.</seg>
<seg id="23">I'm really excited to see him go out there, starting a game and seeing how he manages the whole situation.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is such a big game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Japan are our biggest threat I feel in the rest of the group.</seg>
<seg id="26">But in saying that, I can't see a Japan team beating us the way the confidence and momentum is with the Irish team at the minute.</seg>

<seg id="1">Matt de Grood shouldn't be punished because of schizophrenia stigma</seg>
<seg id="2">In 2016, Matthew de Grood, the man who killed five people at a house party in Calgary, was found to be not criminally responsible for his actions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now, in 2019, there is a hearing to determine whether or not he should be allowed more freedoms, such as unsupervised outings.</seg>
<seg id="4">The decision won't come for a few more weeks, so in the meantime we're left to wonder whether or not this is a good idea.</seg>
<seg id="5">There are two sides to this: one citing his violent behaviour in the past, calling to prevent it from happening again, and the other side which believes in the power of change and rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="6">First, let's examine the more pessimistic side.</seg>
<seg id="7">De Grood did stab and kill five people during a psychotic break.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was a violent and unpredictable attack.</seg>
<seg id="9">He suffers from schizophrenia, which is why he was found not criminally responsible, but has since been seeing a psychiatrist and taking his medication.</seg>
<seg id="10">His psychiatrist, Dr. Santoch Rai, has said in front of the review board that "if Matthew de Grood were to commit another offence, it would be severe."</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite his perceived improvement, there is still risk of re-offense.</seg>
<seg id="12">But is this reason enough to remain afraid?</seg>
<seg id="13">Is it enough to keep de Grood locked up?</seg>
<seg id="14">As long as de Grood continues to take his medication, there isn't a huge risk of reoffense, so why are people so concerned?</seg>
<seg id="15">I believe the stigma surrounding people with mental illness, particularly those with schizophrenia, largely influences this fear.</seg>
<seg id="16">Certain mental illnesses have become less stigmatized, such as mood and anxiety disorders.</seg>
<seg id="17">But others, including schizophrenia, remain highly stigmatized.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is in large part due to numerous portrayals of schizophrenics as dangerous people with voices in their heads telling them to kill people.</seg>
<seg id="19">That was the case in this situation, but these instances are rare, and that's perhaps why we remember them so well when they occur.</seg>
<seg id="20">In fact, the majority of schizophrenic individuals are nonviolent, and are more likely to be the victims rather than the perpetrators of crime or violence.</seg>
<seg id="21">In light of this, it seems unreasonable to insist that de Grood be denied certain freedoms when the fear of re-offense is based more on a prejudiced attitude towards people with schizophrenia than actual likelihood.</seg>
<seg id="22">I don't believe de Grood should ever be unsupervised permanently.</seg>
<seg id="23">A parole-like system where he has to check in to make sure he's still taking his medication could work well.</seg>
<seg id="24">Arguing that he or other mentally ill people remain institutionalized unless absolutely necessary is a form of segregation.</seg>
<seg id="25">It perpetuates the idea that mentally ill people, those with schizophrenia in particular, cannot ever mesh with society; thus continuing the stigma and perpetuating the idea that they are dangerous criminals.</seg>
<seg id="26">He was found not criminally responsible by a court of law, so why should he be treated like a prisoner instead of someone who was ill and is now better?</seg>

<seg id="1">Banks facing 'enormous' challenges - Commerzbank boss</seg>
<seg id="2">The challenges facing banks are "enormous," Commerzbank chief executive Martin Zielke said today, after the German lender said it no longer expected a rise in underlying revenues this year.</seg>
<seg id="3">The bank's downgrade was announced late last night.</seg>
<seg id="4">It came as the bank's supervisory board approved plans announced last week to cut thousands of staff and close a fifth of branches following a failed merger with bigger rival Deutsche Bank.</seg>
<seg id="5">Commerzbank, part owned by the German government after a bailout, has been struggling for years with a legacy of bad debts, high costs and fines, and tough trading conditions have hampered its recovery efforts.</seg>
<seg id="6">Negative interest rates, increasing regulation, a weaker economy and tough competition.</seg>
<seg id="7">The challenges facing banks are enormous," Zielke said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Outgoing finance chief Stephan Engels added the latest loosening of policy by the European Central Bank "will not make our lives easier," and that a programme designed to cushion the blow for banks would not fully compensate.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some investors said the bank's overhaul did not go far enough.</seg>
<seg id="10">Commerzbank, which was ejected from Germany's blue-chip DAX index last year, has already been reducing staff and trying to cut back-office work to restore profitability.</seg>
<seg id="11">It embarked on merger talks with Deutsche Bank earlier this year, hoping to make more savings, but the discussions fell apart.</seg>
<seg id="12">The bank CEO said the overhaul would allow Commerzbank to stand on its own, but left the door open to future deals, saying the lender should be an "active player" in banking consolidation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Over the course of 2019, the market environment has continued to deteriorate further.</seg>
<seg id="14">This has been particularly evident in the corporate clients business," the bank said, explaining the downgrade in its revenue expectations.</seg>
<seg id="15">The tough market backdrop comes amid management change at the bank.</seg>
<seg id="16">It said that board member Bettina Orlopp would succeed Engels as chief financial officer, while Sabine Schmittroth would become board member for human resources.</seg>
<seg id="17">The supervisory board also approved plans to sell a stake in the bank's Polish subsidiary mBank and absorb its Comdirect online brokerage unit.</seg>
<seg id="18">The German lender flagged the strategic overhaul last week.</seg>
<seg id="19">The measures were approved by the board during a two-day meeting.</seg>
<seg id="20">Among the plans, the bank will cut 4,300 jobs in some places but add 2,000 jobs in "strategic areas," so the group headcount will fall in total by about 2,300 full-time positions, equivalent to about 5.7% of its workforce.</seg>
<seg id="21">The mBank sale will further reduce staff levels.</seg>
<seg id="22">Headcount will fall to 29,300, a spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="23">The company now employs about 40,700 people.</seg>
<seg id="24">Commerzbank said the strategy would involve investment of €1.6 billion, with €750m going into new technology and the rest earmarked for restructuring.</seg>
<seg id="25">The restructuring plan is negative for the German lender's credit rating, ratings agency Moody's has said.</seg>
<seg id="26">The agency said plans to sell mBank would "further limit the bank's growth potential given that mBank meaningfully contributed to the group's revenue and profits, and its growth."</seg>

<seg id="1">At Wells Fargo, a Jamie Dimon protege finally takes over a big US bank</seg>
<seg id="2">Three decades before Charlie Scharf was named CEO of Wells Fargo, he got his start by mailing his resume to an up-and-coming banker named Jamie Dimon.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scharf was a senior at Johns Hopkins University when Dimon hired him at Baltimore lender Commercial Credit.</seg>
<seg id="4">That move proved pivotal for Scharf: He quickly became Dimon's right hand man and followed him for the next 25 years in a series of roles at institutions that reshaped the U.S. banking landscape.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I was younger than almost everybody else by 20 years," Scharf, 54, told the alumni magazine of NYU Stern's business school.</seg>
<seg id="6">That helped me mature in business faster.</seg>
<seg id="7">Now, Scharf becomes the first of Dimon's proteges to take over a direct competitor to J.P. Morgan Chase, the U.S. financial services giant and the world's most valuable bank by market capitalization.</seg>
<seg id="8">J.P. Morgan has been called a training school for CEOs as Dimon's deputies have gone on to lead vendors including First Data or European banks such as Barclays or Standard Chartered.</seg>
<seg id="9">Scharf himself was part of that trend, leaving J.P. Morgan in 2012 to become CEO of credit-card network Visa.</seg>
<seg id="10">He reportedly tired of commuting from New York to San Francisco for that job, and became CEO of custodian firm Bank of New York Mellon in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="11">Investors cheered the news that Wells Fargo's six-month search had concluded: Wells Fargo shares climbed 4% Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Scharf now has the biggest challenge of his career: As head of Wells Fargo starting next month, he will be tasked with restoring credibility with customers, employees and regulators after the bank's fake accounts scandal claimed his predecessor, Tim Sloan, and Sloan's predecessor, John Stumpf.</seg>
<seg id="13">During his tenure, Sloan had replaced managers, revamped sales practices and launched an apologetic ad campaign, but he was blamed for moving too slowly as other abuses came to light.</seg>
<seg id="14">Wells Fargo became hobbled under a rare Federal Reserve restriction that capped its asset growth, and critics including Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Maxine Waters piled on.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Just to reiterate the obvious: We know we have a series of regulatory issues that we need to complete the work on," Scharf said Friday during a conference call.</seg>
<seg id="16">That is really the first priority, and we're going to make sure we don't miss a beat on that.</seg>
<seg id="17">He gave few other clues as to his approach but added that, like when he joined Visa and Bank of New York Mellon, he was eager to meet his organization.</seg>
<seg id="18">"In my experience, good business is all about stepping back, asking questions, and accumulating the expertise to make the best decisions, whether those are business decisions or people decisions," he said in the NYU Stern profile.</seg>
<seg id="19">Ultimately, Scharf may decide to appoint his own direct reports in key roles like chief financial officer, as is typical when a new CEO is named.</seg>
<seg id="20">To add to his challenges, Scharf, a low-key executive who enjoys woodworking in his spare time, will be going head to head with Dimon and Bank of America's Brian Moynihan as the U.S. megabanks tussle over deposits amid the larger push to digitize financial services and fend off technology giants.</seg>
<seg id="21">Dimon, the mentor turned rival, seemed pleased that his former protege had made it to the big leagues.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Charlie is an excellent choice," Dimon said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has great experience, and high character.</seg>
<seg id="24">He is a first class leader.</seg>

<seg id="2">Regional health authorities are calling on Italy's government to allow them to recruit retired doctors and keep those older than 65 working until they're 70, as a means of tackling their serious shortages of medical practitioners.</seg>
<seg id="3">Short-staffed hospitals across Italy are pushing for the retirement age of the country's physicians to be extended to the age of 70 in their regions.</seg>
<seg id="4">The proposal is part of a 16-point document to be presented to Italy's Ministry of Health in the coming days which aims for there to be a "regulatory amendment on age limits for the retirement of medical personnel."</seg>
<seg id="5">Currently doctors in Italy can retire once they've turned 65 or having worked for 40 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">Struggling regional governments are calling for those "who reach 40 years of service at 66-67 years and would like to continue working" to do so.</seg>
<seg id="7">Italy's ageing medical workforce is somewhat of a sleeping giant.</seg>
<seg id="8">By 2025, 38,000 doctors will have retired (45,000 if you include general practitioners), causing a shortage that will be further aggravated by the fact that Italian universities are not able to train enough graduates to supply hospitals with specialists.</seg>
<seg id="9">The regional health councils' proposal therefore also includes a measure proposing young medical graduates who haven't chosen a specialization yet to be recruited more easily as GPs.</seg>
<seg id="10">Closely tied to this is the idea of regions offering specialist training scholarships which include a fixed contract at the end to young doctors, as well as forging a closer working relationship between local health authorities and universities, all as a means of speeding up the recruitment process in Italy's struggling health sector.</seg>
<seg id="11">Regions such as Veneto have in fact already tried to take matters into their own hands by headhunting retired physicians.</seg>
<seg id="12">Molise in the south has called on army doctors to help out and Tuscany has started recruiting younger doctors.</seg>

<seg id="2">Police have issued a renewed appeal in their search for missing man Tony Parsons (65), from Tillcoultry, who was last seen two years ago this weekend.</seg>
<seg id="3">Mr Parsons travelled to Fort William by train from his home on Friday, September 29, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="4">He cycled south along the A82 and was last seen at 11.30pm that night outside the Bridge of Orchy Hotel, from where he apparently continued south towards Tyndrum.</seg>
<seg id="5">Extensive searches of the area were later carried out, involving mountain rescue, air support, dog teams and civilian volunteers - all to no avail.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chief Inspector Drew Sinclair, Clackmannanshire area commander, said: "Our thoughts very much remain with Tony's family, who have had to endure two years of not knowing where he is or what may have happened to him.</seg>
<seg id="7">We are determined to provide them with answers and we want to ensure people remain aware that he is missing in case they may have information which could help.</seg>
<seg id="8">Neither Tony nor his bicycle have been seen since leaving Bridge of Orchy two years ago.</seg>

<seg id="2">Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, speaking on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday, said the United States has concluded the Syrian government used chemical weapons in an attack earlier this year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Pompeo said U.S. officials had determined Syrian President Bashar Assad's government had used chlorine in the attack on opposition forces in Idlib province on May 19.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The Assad regime is responsible for innumerable atrocities some of which rise to the level of war crimes and crimes against humanity," Pompeo told a news conference.</seg>
<seg id="5">U.S. officials in May said they'd received reports consistent with a chemical attack in northwest Syria but did not offer a definitive conclusion at the time.</seg>
<seg id="6">In April 2018, the U.S., Britain and France launched airstrikes in Syria in retaliation for what they described as a suspected chemical attack that killed more than 40 people earlier that month.</seg>
<seg id="7">"This is different in some sense because it was chlorine... but know that President Trump has been pretty vigorous in protecting the world from the use of chemical weapons," Pompeo said.</seg>
<seg id="8">He added that the U.S. would provide an additional $4.5 million to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to fund investigations into other instances of suspected Syrian chemical-weapons use.</seg>
<seg id="9">Pompeo also called on the Assad government to release thousands of unjustly detained prisoners, including American journalist Austin Tice, who has been missing and presumed held by the government for seven years.</seg>
<seg id="10">He is just one of a number of American citizens held in Syria and we call upon the Syrian regime to release them all.</seg>

<seg id="2">LONG BEACH (CBSLA) - It's been one year since a 20-year-old from Long Beach was fatally shot, but the victim's family isn't giving up hope that the shooter will be caught.</seg>
<seg id="3">"I wish I could trade places with you son, I wish I could trade places with you," Guy Alford, the victim's father, said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Alford came back to the scene of the crime exactly one year after his son, Guy Alford III, was gunned down at a Jack In The Box near 52nd and Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said he wanted to call attention to his son's unsolved murder.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Somebody knows something, they need to say something," he said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Security video, which has never been released, showed Alford stopped in the drive-thru when a second car pulled up behind him.</seg>
<seg id="8">Three suspects were then seen getting out of that car.</seg>
<seg id="9">One of them walked up to the driver's side, and shot Alford.</seg>
<seg id="10">The four people in Alford's car jumped out and ran.</seg>
<seg id="11">The suspects were then seen getting back into their car and driving away.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Wherever this coward is, he will get caught," Alford said.</seg>
<seg id="13">This grieving father said he has no idea who would want to hurt his son, and he said he still didn't know who was in the car with him when he was shot.</seg>
<seg id="14">"They upped and ran out of my son's car like that, where did you run to," Alford said.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Did you go back and try to help him or what?"</seg>
<seg id="16">Nobody said nothing.</seg>
<seg id="17">Alford said his son was a star football player at Alemany High School, then a stand-out safety on the Long Beach City College football team.</seg>
<seg id="18">Alford said his son was working toward playing for a Division 1 school and had dreams of becoming a nurse.</seg>
<seg id="19">"He was working three jobs," Michael Harvey, a friend, said.</seg>
<seg id="20">As somebody who's 21, he was a year younger than me, anybody with that type of hustle and work ethic, you tend to look up to.</seg>
<seg id="21">As the investigation into the fatal shooting continues, Alford said he wasn't giving up either.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I can assure you, this one is going to get solved," he said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Alford is personally offering a $2,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and conviction.</seg>
<seg id="24">Anyone with information about this crime is urged to call Long Beach police.</seg>

<seg id="8">iHandy describes itself as "one of the world's largest mobile application developers" and claims to have 180 million active monthly users in over 200 countries.</seg>
<seg id="9">iHandy created a popular range of emoji apps that have also been removed from the Google Play Store.</seg>

<seg id="2">Sudanese victims of war crimes Thursday filed a criminal complaint against French bank BNP Paribas for alleged complicity in human rights abuses committed by Sudan's regime.</seg>
<seg id="3">BNP Paribas has been targeted before over its dealings with Sudan.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2015, a U.S. judge sentenced the bank to five years of probation and fined it nearly $9 billion after it pleaded guilty to violating United States sanctions against not only Sudan, but also Iran and Cuba.</seg>
<seg id="5">This case is different: Rights activists say it's the first effort to hold the bank criminally responsible for alleged complicity in crimes against humanity, genocide and torture in Sudan between 2002-2008.</seg>
<seg id="6">It says BNP was essentially acting as the de-facto central bank for the regime of former president Omar al-Bashir during that period, by allowing it access to financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="7">"These crimes do not occur in a vacuum and no funds," said Cynthia Tai, executive director of U.S.-based nonprofit Project Expedite Justice, one of the rights groups supporting the Sudanese victims in the case.</seg>
<seg id="8">"They occur because people can buy weapons, they can buy trucks and because people can buy the tools they need to commit these grave violations," she added.</seg>
<seg id="9">The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants against Bashir on war crimes and genocide charges in Sudan's Darfur region but has been unable to prosecute him in The Hague.</seg>
<seg id="10">The ousted leader is on trial in his home country on corruption charges.</seg>
<seg id="11">"We can take them to court, and I think that will be a first step," said Abdalhaleim Hassan, one of the Sudanese filing the complaint.</seg>
<seg id="12">He says the government-backed Janjaweed militia attacked his village in Darfur numerous times, killing people including relatives.</seg>
<seg id="13">Later, as a student rights activist, he says he was imprisoned and tortured.</seg>
<seg id="14">He now lives in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="15">My journey to the justice will be long.</seg>
<seg id="16">Not only the bank, but to bring the real criminals to the court," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">BNP could not be reached for comment Thursday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="18">But a spokesperson told the AFP news agency that it was not aware a criminal probe had been opened and did not comment on judicial processes.</seg>
<seg id="19">This is not the first effort to hold French businesses responsible for rights abuses committed overseas.</seg>
<seg id="20">Authorities here are looking into whether Lafarge cement manufacturer paid the Islamic State group to keep its factories running in areas it controlled in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="21">Anjali Sualy is a lawyer for the Paris-based International Federation for Human Rights, which is also supporting the Sudanese victims.</seg>
<seg id="22">"We hope that by taking the step that we have today, we've put these companies on notice that they need to be aware that these types of business deals are risky," Sualy said.</seg>
<seg id="23">French investigating magistrates must now determine whether the Sudanese complaint is admissible and whether to open an investigation.</seg>

<seg id="2">Uber has announced a slew of updates to its app - including consolidating its food delivery and ride-hailing services, and a new feature highlighting local public transportation options - in a bid to create "an operating system for everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="3">Uber announced the more than 25 changes to its platform at a launch event in San Francisco on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Among the tech company's most significant moves will be merging its ride-hailing app and food-delivery app Uber Eats, and offering users alternative travel information including bikes, scooters, public transportation, and even helicopters in some locations.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We recognize that becoming an integral part of people's lives comes with real responsibility," Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said.</seg>
<seg id="6">That's why we are working to make sure every customer is treated like a VIP, every driver and courier feels like a valued partner, and every city feels like we're a good citizen.</seg>
<seg id="7">When riders search for a destination, they will see travel options listed in order of price, including public transit as well as electric bikes and scooters.</seg>
<seg id="8">This means cheaper options such as subway and bus schedules may appear at the top of the list, and riders can request notifications when trains or buses they track are delayed.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new transit feature is live in Denver and London and will soon be operational in San Francisco, Mexico City, and Paris.</seg>
<seg id="10">It might seem unexpected for Uber to be guiding users away from taking a car, but the company has long harbored ambitions to become an all-encompassing transit platform.</seg>
<seg id="11">"To some extent, we're competing against ourselves," Khosrowshahi told the Verge of adding public transit options.</seg>
<seg id="12">But we have the philosophy that if there's a better product out there for the user, and we think an integrated movement solution is better for the user, we should be the ones competing against ourselves versus others doing it.</seg>
<seg id="13">Uber Eats will also open more "digital-only restaurants" - businesses with no brick-and-mortar outlet where customers can only order food from on the app.</seg>
<seg id="14">One digital restaurant comes through a partnership with the celebrity chef Rachael Ray and will be available in 10 cities for 10 weeks exclusively on Uber Eats.</seg>
<seg id="15">Uber's big changes come as the company struggles to turn a profit months after it went public in May.</seg>
<seg id="16">In August, Uber cut 400 jobs as it attempted to rein in excessive spending and losses.</seg>
<seg id="17">In August the company reported its largest-ever quarterly loss: $5bn in three months.</seg>
<seg id="18">Meanwhile, new regulatory hurdles threaten to raise the company's operating costs by changing how drivers are paid.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the two-hour event, Uber did not mention Assembly Bill 5, a new law passed in September that will upend the way gig economy workers in California, including drivers, are remunerated, as well as the benefits they are entitled to.</seg>
<seg id="20">Uber, its competitor Lyft, and other gig economy startups have announced a plan to fight the bill with a 2020 ballot measure.</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition to platform integrations and Uber Eats changes, Uber made a number of safety updates to the app.</seg>
<seg id="22">Riders will now use a four-digit PIN to verify they are entering the correct car.</seg>
<seg id="23">Uber said it is developing an "ultrasound wave" technology so in the future the app can automatically verify riders are in the right car without a PIN number.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the app, riders will now have a "Report Safety Incident" option and the ability to text 911 in case of emergency.</seg>
<seg id="25">The company updated its "real-time ID check" feature introduced in 2016, requiring drivers to take selfies to verify identities.</seg>
<seg id="26">The changes come after Uber was sued for $10m in April by a woman who was sexually assaulted by her driver.</seg>
<seg id="27">A number of women announced last week they were bringing lawsuits against Lyft over drivers sexually assaulting them.</seg>
<seg id="28">The victim in the case against Uber alleges that the company failed to "warn her of the risk its services posed to women."</seg>
<seg id="29">A CNN report last year found at least 103 Uber drivers in the US had been accused of sexually assaulting or abusing their passengers over a period of four years.</seg>
<seg id="30">Uber also announced an expansion of its Uber Rewards program, which allows customers to redeem points when taking an Uber ride, ordering Uber Eats, or spending with partner restaurants.</seg>

<seg id="2">Language campaigners have welcomed a decision by council leaders in Cardiff to support a plan to give Welsh-only names to new streets in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="3">Cardiff council's cabinet is hoping the move will eventually mean there are as many Welsh street names as English ones in the city and bolster the language.</seg>
<seg id="4">The council will also make sure existing signs on city centre streets will be in Welsh and English when they are upgraded.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, existing street names in residential communities and suburbs of Cardiff will retain their current names.</seg>
<seg id="6">Cardiff is not regarded as a traditional stronghold for the language, but the number of Welsh speakers in the capital has more than doubled over the past 40 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">There are 17 primary schools and three secondary schools in the city educating 8,500 pupils in Welsh.</seg>
<seg id="8">The policy, due to be put before the full council for final approval next month, says new streets should be given a Welsh name "consistent with the local heritage and history of the area."</seg>
<seg id="9">It says the names of specific individuals may be used where there is a historical or legacy link.</seg>
<seg id="10">More than 60% of people who took part in a consultation agreed with the proposal to work towards parity between Welsh street names and English ones, with the majority feeling the policy would have a positive effect on the Welsh language.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Welsh Language Commissioner, Aled Roberts, said: "I congratulate Cardiff council on their new street naming policy."</seg>
<seg id="12">Place names can say a lot about an area's history and heritage; and this policy in the capital shows the council, and indeed, the country's commitment to promote the Welsh language.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mabli Siriol from the Welsh language campaign group Cymdeithas yr Iaith said: "We welcome the council's intention to name every new street in Welsh only."</seg>
<seg id="14">It would give a boost to the status and use of the language in the city.</seg>
<seg id="15">After all, the Welsh language belongs to everyone in Cardiff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Caro Wild, the cabinet member for strategic planning and transport, said: "Ensuring that the names of new streets in the city reflect local heritage and the Welsh language will assist our vision of developing Cardiff as a truly bilingual capital city.</seg>
<seg id="17">Adopting this policy will also see us joining other enlightened capitals around the world, like Wellington in New Zealand, who are embracing their own heritage by promoting the Māori language until it has parity with English.</seg>
<seg id="18">It's very encouraging that the majority of people who took part in the consultation are in favour of these proposals."</seg>
<seg id="19">The Welsh language is intrinsically linked with the history of Cardiff over the centuries.</seg>
<seg id="20">By working towards parity between Welsh and English street names as the city continues to grow, we will ensure that Welsh history, culture and language remains an important part of the city's identity.</seg>

<seg id="2">Shamata is the highest settlement area, in terms of altitude, in Nyandarua County and can be ideal for training for budding long distance runners, but only if sports infrastructure is developed.</seg>
<seg id="3">At about 2,800 metres above sea level, the lack of properly developed sports facilities has left a lot of talent to waste away in this rural set-up.</seg>
<seg id="4">Shamata is home to Ruth Waithera, the pioneer 400 metres runner who is first Kenya woman to reach an Olympic sprints final, a feat she achieved at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, USA.</seg>
<seg id="5">She finished eighth in 51.56 seconds in a race won by American Valerie Brisco-Hooks in an Olympic record 48.83.</seg>
<seg id="6">Shamata is in the Ndaragwa Constituency, whose MP, Jeremiah Kioni, once threatened to push for the area to be annexed to the neighbouring Laikipia County.</seg>
<seg id="7">Residents of Ndaragwa, being in the extreme north of Nyandarua, seek most services either in Nyahururu town (Laikipia County) or Nyeri town in Nyeri County because reaching the County headquarters in Ol Kalou is expensive.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ndaragwa lacks a properly developed public stadium.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Nyandarua County Government has only fenced off various grounds in the constituency which are said to have been set aside for playing fields when the area was being turned into settlement schemes.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of these fields is at Shamata township.</seg>
<seg id="11">Shamata Ward MCA, Reuben Gitau says the land "will be developed into ultramodern sports facility."</seg>
<seg id="12">"The stadium will have two pitches, track, handball, volleyball court and a place for indoor games," the MCA said.</seg>
<seg id="13">A Sh4 million dais that is being constructed by the county government has encroached too much onto the existing football pitch.</seg>
<seg id="14">Part of the dais has interfered with goal area thus becoming dangerous to players since the field is still being used.</seg>
<seg id="15">The MCA explains that the whole stadium will be redesigned to change the current pitch from its present north-south direction to the unconventional east-west one.</seg>
<seg id="16">Gitau could not immediately give the exact acreage of the fenced stadium ground but insisted it will accommodate a running track, two pitches and ball courts and indoor games facility.</seg>
<seg id="17">Officials in the county headquarters could not say if a design for the stadium existed or if money for its development has been budgeted for.</seg>
<seg id="18">Youth, Sports and the Arts executive, Murani Ngugi put the acreage of the fenced area at about five acres.</seg>
<seg id="19">If the facility will have two pitches, then it will be the second in the region after the legendary Nyahururu Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="20">Reports that Shamata will have a modern stadium has been received well by local youth who have been yearning for a place to develop their sporting talents.</seg>
<seg id="21">The captain of Shamata FC, James Ndiritu, speaking after his team beat Leshau Pondo FC 4-0 in the final of Ndaragwa Constituency inter-wards tournament, said the youth are eagerly waiting completion of the stadium, hoping it's not hot air.</seg>
<seg id="22">He said youth in the area have been lacking a place to engage in sports.</seg>
<seg id="23">But it remains to see if the politician's statement will be supplemented by action.</seg>

<seg id="2">Slim and with a tight-trimmed beard, Yemeni Kung Fu champion Hilal al-Haj dreamed of finding athletic glory in Europe, but a risky sea journey to get there ended in tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 25-year-old athlete drowned in the Mediterranean after being swept away as he attempted to swim from Morocco to the Spanish enclave of Melilla last week.</seg>
<seg id="4">His family in Yemen's rebel-held capital Sanaa was expected on Friday to bury the 2011 Yemen Kung Fu champion, who had also racked up a series of medals from Asian and Arab championships.</seg>
<seg id="5">"He was looking for a country that would appreciate his talent and recognise his value as a human being and athlete," his older brother Saeed said.</seg>
<seg id="6">"He loved life, he detested war," he told AFP by phone.</seg>
<seg id="7">Saeed saw his brother just hours before he headed to Morocco, where on September 16 he attempted the dangerous swim to the Spanish enclave.</seg>
<seg id="8">The athlete was proud of his heritage, his brother said, but competing in a country pushed to the brink of famine by a years-long war between the government and rebels had brought challenges.</seg>
<seg id="9">Yemen was rife with "contempt" and "injustice," Saeed said, adding his brother was treated unfairly by the Huthi rebels who took over the capital in 2014 despite taking no side in Yemen's conflict.</seg>
<seg id="10">After returning to Sanaa from a championship in Azerbaijan, where Haj won third place representing Yemen, he expected to be celebrated by rebels.</seg>
<seg id="11">The answer was painful.</seg>
<seg id="12">"They told him that no one had asked of him to raise the flag of Yemen," Saeed said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Years of war have made leaving and entering Yemen nearly impossible, but Haj faced even greater difficulties when attempting to cross over the heavily fortified land barrier surrounding Melilla, on the northern coast of Morocco.</seg>
<seg id="14">After two months of failed attempts, he decided to swim for it, his brother said.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It was a short distance.</seg>
<seg id="16">People before him have tried and succeeded," he told AFP.</seg>
<seg id="17">My brother was athletic, it seemed like it would be easy, but tragedy struck and he was swept away by a powerful wave.</seg>
<seg id="18">A friend accompanying Haj on the swim who managed to make it safely to the Spanish enclave said the journey was "extremely difficult."</seg>
<seg id="19">"The waves were so high," the friend, who asked to remain anonymous, told AFP.</seg>
<seg id="20">When (Haj) screamed, I thought it was because he was tired.</seg>
<seg id="21">I didn't know he was drowning.</seg>
<seg id="22">Haj's body was recovered and flown into Yemen's southern city of Aden on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was expected to be carried on to the capital in an ambulance, Saeed said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Sanaa airport has been under blockade since 2017 by a Saudi-led military coalition backing the government against the Iran-aligned Huthis.</seg>
<seg id="25">Haj's father and younger brother are expected to arrive from Saudi Arabia to attend the funeral.</seg>
<seg id="26">"He always said that we can't reach our sports goals by staying in Yemen," Haj's friend Jamal el-Sabri told AFP.</seg>
<seg id="27">The failure of the sports institutions, corruption and nepotism destroy sports and talent.</seg>
<seg id="28">The more time passes, life is becoming more difficult and our ambitions are dying.</seg>

<seg id="1">Boris Johnson's tax cuts will cost £26billion a year</seg>
<seg id="2">The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) challenged Boris Johnson's flagship policy</seg>
<seg id="3">Warned giveaway "risks putting the public finances on an unsustainable path"</seg>
<seg id="4">Treasury spokesman said: "Any decisions would be for the Chancellor to take"</seg>
<seg id="5">The Prime Minister's proposed tax cuts will cost up to £26billion a year and mainly benefit wealthier households, the UK's leading economic think-tank warns today.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) challenged Boris Johnson's flagship policy to lift the thresholds for both higher rate income tax and National Insurance.</seg>
<seg id="7">It warned the giveaway "risks putting the public finances on an unsustainable path," given the risk of leaving the EU without a deal.</seg>
<seg id="8">Echoing criticism made by opposition parties, the think-tank also concluded most of the tax cuts would go to those on higher incomes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The intervention will heap pressure on Mr Johnson to water down the tax-cutting commitment he made during the Tory leadership campaign, which he is gambling on to be a big vote winner when a general election is called.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr Johnson pledged to raise the threshold for paying higher rate income tax in England, Wales and Northern Ireland from £50,000 to £80,000.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said he wanted to help the "huge numbers" of middle income households which have been dragged into paying the 40 per cent higher rate of tax.</seg>
<seg id="12">The number of people paying higher rate tax has more than doubled from 1.6million in 1990 to 3.8million.</seg>
<seg id="13">In its report, the IFS said the PM's proposed tax cut would cost the Treasury up to £9billion a year if introduced immediately and would take 2.5million people out of paying 40 per cent higher rate tax.</seg>
<seg id="14">It described it as a "substantial and expensive tax cut from which only those on high incomes would gain."</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Johnson has also outlined plans to raise the point at which National Insurance kicks in, currently set at £8,632.</seg>
<seg id="16">The IFS calculated that every £1,000 rise in the threshold would cost £4billion if they were increased in tandem.</seg>
<seg id="17">Increasing all the thresholds to £12,500 in line with the personal allowance for income tax would cost £17billion a year, it warned.</seg>
<seg id="18">The report said only 3 per cent of gains would go to the poorest 20 per cent of households as so many do not earn enough to pay national insurance, or are unemployed.</seg>
<seg id="19">The IFS stressed the annual bill for Mr Johnson's tax cuts could range between £10billion and £20billion, if the tax cuts are phased in more gradually.</seg>

<seg id="1">Twitter Suspends Chinese Accounts Targeting Hong Kong Protests</seg>
<seg id="2">Twitter said Monday it has suspended more than 200,000 accounts that it believes were part of a Chinese government influence campaign targeting the protest movement in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="3">The company also said it will ban ads from state-backed media companies, expanding a prohibition it first applied in 2017 to two Russian entities.</seg>
<seg id="4">Both measures are part of what a senior company official portrayed in an interview as a broader effort to curb malicious political activity on a popular platform that has been criticized for enabling election interference around the world and for accepting money for ads that amount to propaganda by state-run media organizations.</seg>
<seg id="5">The accounts were suspended for violating the social networking platform's terms of service and "because we think this is not how people can come to Twitter to get informed," the official said in an interview with The Associated Press.</seg>
<seg id="6">The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of security concerns, said the Chinese activity was reported to the FBI, which investigated Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election through social media.</seg>
<seg id="7">After being notified by Twitter and conducting its own investigation, Facebook said Monday that it has also removed seven pages, three groups and five accounts, including some portraying protesters as cockroaches and terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="8">Facebook, which is more widely used in Hong Kong, does not release the data on such state-backed influence operations.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company also does not ban ads from state-owned media companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">"We continue to look at our policies as they relate to state-owned media," a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement to the AP.</seg>
<seg id="11">We're also taking a closer look at ads that have been raised to us to determine if they violate our policies.</seg>
<seg id="12">Though Twitter is banned in China, it is available in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous region.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Chinese language account, @HKpoliticalnew, and the English account, @ctcc507, pushed tweets depicting protesters as violent criminals in a campaign aimed at influencing public opinion around the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">One of those accounts was tied to a suspended Facebook account that went by the same moniker: HKpoliticalnew.</seg>
<seg id="15">An additional 936 core accounts Twitter believes originated from within China attempted to sow political discord in Hong Kong by undermining the protest movement's legitimacy and political positions.</seg>
<seg id="16">About 200,000 more automated Twitter accounts amplified the messages, engaging with the core accounts in the network.</seg>
<seg id="17">Few tweeted more than once, the official said, mostly because Twitter quickly caught many of them.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Twitter official said the investigation remains ongoing and there could be further disclosures.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Twitter campaign reflects the fact that the Chinese government has studied the role of social media in mass movements and fears the Hong Kong protests could spark wider unrest, said James Lewis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</seg>
<seg id="20">"This is standard Chinese practice domestically, and we know that after 2016 they studied what the Russians did in the U.S. carefully," Lewis said.</seg>
<seg id="21">So it sounds like this is the first time they're deploying their new toy.</seg>
<seg id="22">Twitter has sought to more aggressively monitor its network for malicious political activity since the 2016 presidential election and to be more transparent about its investigations, publicly releasing such data about state-backed influence operations since October so others can evaluate it, the official said.</seg>
<seg id="23">"We're not only telling the public this happened, we're also putting the data out there so people can study it for themselves," the official said.</seg>
<seg id="24">As for state-backed media organizations, they are still allowed to use Twitter, but are no longer allowed to pay for ads, which show up regardless of whether you have elected to follow the group's tweet.</seg>
<seg id="25">Twitter declined to provide a list of what it considers state-backed media organizations, but a representative said it may consider doing so in the future.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2017, Twitter specifically announced it would ban Russia-based RT and Sputnik from advertising on its platform.</seg>

<seg id="2">Located around 200 kilometers from the UAE's capital Abu Dhabi, on the eastern coast of Sir Bani Yas Island, lies the country's oldest Christian site.</seg>
<seg id="3">Originally discovered in 1992, the archeological treasure has recently opened to the public.</seg>
<seg id="4">Named Church and Monastery of Sir Bani Yas, the site is believed to date back around 1,400 years.</seg>
<seg id="5">Its excavation has revealed a complex history of the people who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I think it's a misconception that there is no archaeology here," says Peter Magee, an archaeologist at the Abu Dhabi Department of Culture and Tourism.</seg>
<seg id="7">There are other sites that remain un-excavated.</seg>
<seg id="8">The archaeology here goes back 8,000 years.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the early nineties, the rocky infrastructure was thought to have no religious association.</seg>
<seg id="10">After further investigation, however, Christian crosses were unearthed, as was the architectural framework of a church and monastery.</seg>
<seg id="11">The floorplan of the house of prayer revealed dormitories, a kitchen, cells and burial sites.</seg>
<seg id="12">Decades later, a 2014 excavation team revealed further structures in the west, southwest, and northern area of the site.</seg>
<seg id="13">Architects also found items which implied that monks living in the monastery kept cattle and made good use of the sea for food.</seg>
<seg id="14">While other objects suggested they traded with their Muslim neighbours in the Arabian Gulf in the 7th and 8th century.</seg>
<seg id="15">Today, a decorative frieze, which is believed to have framed the doorway of the holy site, is on display at Abu Dhabi's Louvre Museum.</seg>
<seg id="16">"At least for 100 years, there was a Christian community here and Christians and Muslims were living very peacefully side by side," says Magee, adding that the monastery is one of the few historic Christian sites in the Gulf.</seg>
<seg id="17">Other similar plots in the region include Saudi Arabia's Eastern province of Jubail and two churches on Kuwait's Failaka Island.</seg>

<seg id="2">The brother of Algeria's deposed president Abdelaziz Bouteflika and three associates have been jailed for 15 years for plotting against the state, following an expedited trial.</seg>
<seg id="3">Said Bouteflika was considered by many as the true power behind his brother after he suffered a stroke in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to local news citing Miloud Brahimi, one of the defence lawyers, six people were convicted overnight in the closed-door trial in Blida.</seg>
<seg id="5">Two remain abroad, thought to be in Spain.</seg>
<seg id="6">Those currently in Algeria include Said Bouteflika along with Louisa Hanoune, the chief of the Lawyers for Workers's Party, and two intelligence chiefs, General Mohamed Mediene - who headed the secret service for 25 years - and General Athmane Tartag, a former ex-spy chief.</seg>
<seg id="7">The remaining two, sentenced in absentia to 20 years, include former businessman Farid Benhamdine and former defence minister Khalid Nezzar.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's the highest-profile conviction among Algeria's political and business elite since Bouteflika's ouster in April.</seg>
<seg id="9">All four were convicted of "undermining the authority of the army" and "conspiring against the state," in a verdict delivered away from the media.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the lawyers told AP the trial was chaotic, with Bouteflika refusing to answer the judge's questions and walking out.</seg>
<seg id="11">General Tartag had refused to leave his cell.</seg>
<seg id="12">The defence counsel have vowed to appeal and express indignation at the speed of the trial and its lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="13">One of Mediene's lawyers said he was "surprised by the severity of the verdict," while another lawyer said the trial was "political" and "an attack on democracy."</seg>
<seg id="14">Army chief Ahmed Gaid Salah, has used these allegations of a conspiracy plot by the six against him, to push for new elections to be held on 12 December.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world's largest coffee company said in a statement Friday that it had found glyphosate residues close to the maximum allowed in some deliveries of green coffee beans.</seg>
<seg id="3">Glyphosate is the key ingredient in Monsanto's weedkiller, Roundup.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the United States, juries have awarded huge monetary damages to people who say their cancer was caused by exposure to glyphosate.</seg>
<seg id="5">Bayer, which owns Monsanto, says the herbicide is safe when used properly, as does the US Environmental Protection Agency.</seg>
<seg id="6">Neumann Kaffee Gruppe (NKG), one of the world's largest traders, said glyphosate was one of a number of substances it monitored on the coffee it buys.</seg>
<seg id="7">Nestle buys some of its coffee beans from NKG.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was too early to say what consequences Nestle's tighter controls would have on NKG, a spokesperson said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Nestle's (NSRGF) decision to increase the frequency of checks was unlikely to disrupt global coffee supply chains, a spokesperson said.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This is not a new process, we are just reinforcing controls," the spokesperson told CNN Business.</seg>
<seg id="11">Tests were done before the coffee was shipped from the countries of origin.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nestle would start with suppliers in Indonesia and Brazil, since these countries are among the world's biggest coffee producers.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Our agronomists will continue to work with coffee farmers to help them improve their weed management practices, including the appropriate use of herbicides and adoption of other weeding methods," the Swiss company said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Brands such as Nescafe and Nespresso make up a sizable chunk of Nestle's powdered and liquid beverages business, which generated sales of 21.6 billion Swiss francs ($21.7 billion) in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nestle last year agreed a deal to sell Starbucks' packaged coffees and teas around the world.</seg>
<seg id="16">Does glyphosate cause cancer?</seg>
<seg id="17">Glyphosate is used on more than 100 food crops, according to the EPA.</seg>
<seg id="18">Scientists at an environmental advocacy group with links to the organic food industry say several popular breakfast cereals contain doses of the chemical that are higher than they consider safe for children.</seg>
<seg id="19">Still, the EPA says glyphosate is not a carcinogen and that it poses no public health risks.</seg>
<seg id="20">Ecological risks include damage to pollinators and the problem of weed resistance, the EPA said in a statement in April.</seg>

<seg id="22">Earlier this year, a jury ordered Bayer to pay a California couple $2 billion in damages after they claimed that Roundup, used on their property for more than three decades, had given them both Non-Hodgkin lymphoma within four years of one other.</seg>

<seg id="24">A 2015 study by the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer found that glyphosate was "probably carcinogenic to humans," based on "limited" evidence of cancer in humans and "sufficient" evidence of cancer in experimental animals.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, a joint panel of the WHO and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization later concluded that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic risk to humans from exposure through diet.</seg>

<seg id="2">Somalia is "the perfect example of the success of the multilateral system," President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed told the UN General Assembly on Thursday, while acknowledging that the Horn of Africa country still needed international and regional support and cooperation, particularly to deal with threats from Al-Shabab.</seg>
<seg id="3">Somalia's progress towards reconstruction was moving ahead, but Mr. Mohamad said "one cannot remain deaf and blind" to pockets of global discontent and the effects of poverty, inequality and unfair globalization.</seg>
<seg id="4">He noted that Somalia played a leading role in the socio-economic development of the Horn of Africa and expressed confidence that cooperation among countries in the region would only strengthen political stability and social and cultural connectivity.</seg>
<seg id="5">He went on to express his country's pride after the success of the regional elections in some of the Federated States ahead of the 2021 presidential and legislative elections.</seg>
<seg id="6">And while he called Somalia "historic" example of reform, resilience and commitment to progress and reconstruction, he cautioned that despite tangible progress, the country still faced many challenges, first and foremost those related to security, on which "everything depends."</seg>
<seg id="7">"With the help of our international partners, we are striving to rid ourselves of the last pockets of violent extremism and terrorism," he said, stressing that the task would not be easy, especially given the "violence, cowardice and opportunistic guerilla tactics of Al Shabab."</seg>
<seg id="8">But Mr. Mohamed said he is confident that with the help of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and other partners, his country will regain stability, which was in the interest of the region and the world.</seg>
<seg id="9">Turning to one of the key issues before Member States, climate change, he said Somalia which had the longest coastline on the African continent, was already experiencing the effects of rising waters and temperatures.</seg>
<seg id="10">Somalia was also impacted by land degradation, long-term drought and deforestation.</seg>
<seg id="11">Mr. Mohamed reiterated his commitment to the Paris Agreement, but also to Security Council resolution 751 (1992), which called on all States to take the necessary measures to prevent the direct and indirect import and export of Somali coal.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It may not save the environment, but it will definitely deprive terrorists of a source of funding," he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">A feature on Japan Airlines' seat-booking system warning travellers of where young children are seated has caused a storm online.</seg>
<seg id="3">The facility, offered as part of the airline's "Smile Support" travel service for those with infants, is not new, but still lit up the internet after a Twitter user praised it.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Thank you, @JAL_Official_jp for warnings me about where babies plan to scream and yell during a 13 hour trip.</seg>
<seg id="5">This really ought to be mandatory across the board," venture capitalist Rahat Ahmed tweeted.</seg>
<seg id="6">A somewhat bemused JAL spokeswoman confirmed the feature, while also pointing out it was not a novel offering.</seg>
<seg id="7">At least one other Japanese airline does the same: All Nippon Airways (ANA), where a spokeswoman confirmed its seat maps have shown where children are sitting "for a while."</seg>
<seg id="8">JAL's maps indicate where infants under two are sitting, with a child icon to let "other passengers know."</seg>
<seg id="9">The revelation caused an internet firestorm, with supporters and naysayers battling it out.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Answered prayers," airline specialist site The Points Guy titled a post on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="11">"But how long before we get upcharged for seats away from said babies?" one user asked.</seg>
<seg id="12">Another called the map an unnecessary offering.</seg>
<seg id="13">Why not just have noise-cancelling headphones?!</seg>
<seg id="14">And some pointed out that babies aren't the only troublesome travellers.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Can we use the same software to avoid people who eat noisily instead?" one Twitter user asked.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Will airlines also have maps for obnoxious passengers that drink too much, remove their shoes, hog the armrest or recline in my lap?" added another.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ahmed reported Friday that he had arrived in New York after his JAL flight.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Ironically chose to sat next to several babies on my two flights: Some great, some loud.</seg>
<seg id="19">It happens.</seg>

<seg id="2">GPS-fitted drones capable of lifting up to 10 kg of weight flew in from Pakistan seven to eight times to airdrop several cache of arms, ammunition and fake currency, which were seized in Punjab's Tarn Taran district, the ongoing probe by the Punjab police has revealed.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Army and BSF officials said the troops and observation posts have been asked to maintain the highest possible vigilance along with the International Border and Line of Control (LOC) in Jammu, Samba, Kathua, Rajouri, Poonch and Baramulla, Kupwara districts of the state.</seg>
<seg id="4">Doval tells security forces to put anti infiltration grid on high alert</seg>
<seg id="5">It is a new modus operandi of Pakistan to smuggle arms, ammunition and explosives in India for triggering terror.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We have activated our forces to keep a hawk's eye on movement of drones along the IB," BSF officials said.</seg>
<seg id="7">BSF troops guarding over 180 kms of IB with Pakistan have strengthened their observation posts and "listening posts" to keep a close watch against any intrusion by drones.</seg>
<seg id="8">The BSF is also patrolling riverine areas along the IB and has deployed water patrol teams in the Chenab river to foil terrorists' design to infiltrate into India from Pakistan, they said.</seg>
<seg id="9">They have been told to shoot down any drone intruding into the Indian airspace, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Army has also intensified patrolling in mountainous valleys and riverine areas along the LoC in Kupwara, Baramulla, Poonch and Rajouri districts to check intrusions of drones from Pakistan and infiltration by terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="11">The troops along the LoC are on the highest degree of alertness in the wake of Pakistan's plans to stage infiltration and use drones to smuggle weapons, Army officials said.</seg>
<seg id="12">A top Army commander on Wednesday said Indian armed forces are capable of identifying such devices and any military drone venturing into Indian territory from Pakistan will be "shot down."</seg>

<seg id="2">Tyrone selector Gavin Devlin has been hit with a 24-week suspension following his conduct as a supporter at an underage game.</seg>
<seg id="3">Croke Park's Central Hearings Committee (CHC) upheld the suspension proposed by the Central Competitions Control Committee (CCCC) following incidents during an Under-15 inter-county game between Tyrone and Down on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="4">He was accused of 'disruptive conduct not causing the premature termination of a game', by a supporter.</seg>
<seg id="5">Devlin, who works alongside Tyrone boss Mickey Harte, didn't accept the punishment proposed by the CCCC and chose to request a hearing in front of the CHC, who found the alleged infraction proven.</seg>
<seg id="6">Devlin now has the option to go to the GAA's Central Appeals Committee in an attempt to have his punishment overturned.</seg>
<seg id="7">Assuming that the suspension starts from the issuing of the CHC's findings on Thursday, Devlin will be ruled out of all involvement with the Tyrone squad until early March, well into the 2020 Allianz League campaign.</seg>
<seg id="8">Former Tipperary hurler Eoin Brislane has been suspended for a total of 16 weeks arising from an incident in Tipp's Under-15 Arrabawn Hurling Tournament match with Wexford on 31 August.</seg>
<seg id="9">The CCCC had proposed two separate bans on the grounds that Brislane had used abusive language towards a referee and for "any type of assault of a referee" under Rule 7.2 (c) of the official guide.</seg>
<seg id="10">The CHC upheld the first of those, imposing a four-week ban, though found the second alleged infraction unproven.</seg>
<seg id="11">They found, however, that "the evidence presented did disclose a lesser infraction."</seg>
<seg id="12">That infraction was "minor physical interference with a referee" and imposed a 12-week suspension.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Federal High Court, Abuja Division, has issued a warning that it would order the imprisonment of the Director-General of the State Security Service (SSS), Yusuf Bichi</seg>
<seg id="3">The court gave the warning on Thursday in response to the failure of the SSS to release the detained publisher of Sahara Reporters, Omoyele Sowore.</seg>
<seg id="4">The court's warning was also based on an application by Mr Sowore's lawyers led by senior advocate Femi Falana.</seg>
<seg id="5">A copy of the court order dated September 26 said the SSS must release Mr Sowore as directed by the court or it would be guilty of contempt and liable to be committed to prison.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Take notice that unless you obey the order of the Federal High Court, Abuja Division delivered on September 24 which ordered you to release the applicant, you will be guilty of contempt of court and will be liable to be committed to prison," the document read.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Federal High Court had ordered the immediate release of Mr Sowore from prison on Tuesday after ruling that there was no longer a valid reason to continue detaining the respondent.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Sowore, who was arrested on August 3 for planning a protest popularised with the hashtag #RevolutionNow, is facing trial on seven counts for alleged treasonable felony, fraud and cyberstalking.</seg>
<seg id="9">The SSS also accused Mr Sowore of disseminating an interview wherein he made utterances termed by the prosecution as "insulting, causing hatred and enmity" to the person of President Muhammadu Buhari.</seg>
<seg id="10">The charge sheet also included an allegation that Mr Sowore and another defendant, Olawale Bakare, planned the protest to overthrow the incumbent government.</seg>
<seg id="11">The SSS had obtained two separate orders for Mr Sowore's detention till September 21.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the expiration of those orders, the SSS informed the court of an application earlier seeking further detention of Mr Sowore for 20 days.</seg>
<seg id="13">It also notified the court that the recent application had been overtaken by events based on the provisions of the law, since the SSS had filed an information before the court suggesting that investigations had been concluded regarding allegations against Mr Sowore.</seg>
<seg id="14">Despite that declaration by the SSS lawyer, G. A. Agbadua, the prosecution still hinted the court of its desire to continue detaining Mr Sowore.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr Agbadua argued that the allegations against Mr Sowore attracted capital punishment and that bail in such circumstances where highly restricted.</seg>
<seg id="16">That claim was, however, refuted by Mr Sowore's lawyer, Femi Falana, who told the court that Mr Agbadua was misleading the court with his claim that allegations against Mr Sowore attracted capital punishment.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Sowore met all the bail conditions on Wednesday, as certified by the court, and the SSS was promptly notified.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, in an interview with PREMIUM TIMES Thursday, a lawyer from Mr Falana's Chambers, Marshal Abubakar, said they were still expecting to hear from the SSS after leaving the office of the security agency on Wednesday night without the detained publisher.</seg>
<seg id="19">He said the SSS officials explained that they were awaiting a directive for Mr Sowore's release from Mr Bichi.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why you should buy Herman Miller and Steelcase's stocks</seg>
<seg id="2">U.S. businesses may be showing some signs of weakness, but that shouldn't scare you away from buying the stock of two office furniture companies, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Not only are Herman Miller and Steelcase are defying conventional wisdom, but they also have room to continue rising, the "Mad Money" host contended.</seg>
<seg id="4">Herman Miller, a Zeeland, Michigan-based maker of high-end office furniture, has seen its stock rise 52% for the year, Cramer noted.</seg>
<seg id="5">It closed at $45.98 on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Steelcase, which is based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and is a leading supplier of products for the office environment, is up 24%, Cramer said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Its stock was at $18.40 at Thursday's close.</seg>
<seg id="8">Cramer said there are two main reasons why the companies are having success, despite recession fears and the U.S.-China trade war.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first is the tight labor market.</seg>
<seg id="10">Currently, the U.S. jobless rate is 3.7%.</seg>
<seg id="11">Compared with other business expenditures, "fancy office furniture is tied much more, much more, tightly to the labor market," Cramer explained.</seg>
<seg id="12">"A tight labor market means workers have more leverage, and when workers have more leverage, they get the nice office chairs with lumbar support," Cramer said, alluding to Herman Miller's Aeron chairs.</seg>
<seg id="13">The second factor, Cramer said, is better execution and falling commodity prices, which has allowed the furniture makers to be hurt less by tariffs.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both companies do a lot of sourcing from China, Cramer said.</seg>
<seg id="15">"In fact, in a perverse way, the tariffs might be helping, because they're contributing to the worldwide slowdown that's driving down commodity prices, giving Herman Miller and Steelcase lower raw costs," Cramer said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Perhaps the thing Cramer likes most about the two companies?</seg>
<seg id="17">They are still "absurdly cheap, selling for about 12 times next year's earning estimates," Cramer said.</seg>
<seg id="18">"In a market that's increasingly wary of high-flying stocks with nosebleed valuations, these two value plays could be just what the doctor ordered," Cramer said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Last week, both Herman Miller and Steelcase beat earnings expectations.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, Herman Miller reported 7.4% sales growth compared with the same quarter last year, while Steelcase's revenue was up 14% in that same time frame.</seg>
<seg id="21">That caught Wall Street's attention, but Cramer said he thinks the two companies are still worth buying.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Even after last week's explosive rallies, I bet they can go higher still," he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker thinks interest rates should hold steady as events unfold in what he called a strong economy that also has "clear downside risks."</seg>
<seg id="3">"My own view is that we should hold firm, letting things settle and watching how events play out," he said in prepared remarks Friday to the Shadow Open Market Committee of economists who monitor Fed activity.</seg>
<seg id="4">Harker, a nonvoting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, spoke nine days after his fellow central bankers voted to cut the Fed's benchmark interest rate by a quarter, the second reduction this year.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said he views the economy as strong with inflation on its way to the Fed's 2% goal.</seg>
<seg id="6">Yet he also noted potential problems with "trade and international developments and the uncertainty they breed."</seg>
<seg id="7">Along with his views on rates, Harker also weighed in on last week's tumult in the overnight lending, or repo, market that saw short-term rates spike to 10% and the fed funds rate climb 5 basis points above its target range.</seg>
<seg id="8">While the events shook markets, "they neither reflect - nor direct - the stance of monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id="9">Nor do they have implications for the wider economy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, he added that the Fed should continue to look at its approach to where it is holding its balance sheet and said "organic" expansion should be considered.</seg>

<seg id="2">Lil Wayne is up for about $150,000 in charges for allegedly creating fraudulent companies to book fake concerts and it turns out he didn't even bother to respond to the lawsuit.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to TMZ, a judge has ordered the rapper to cough up $150K for breach of contract and fraud to investor Ramin Natan but it's a default judgment with the judge having ruled for Natan because Wayne didn't show.</seg>
<seg id="4">The suit was apparently filed by Natan against Lil Wayne and hip-hop group Migos back in January, in which the investor claimed they were "Ponzi scheme artists" who created shell companies to get money for shows they never actually planned to perform.</seg>
<seg id="5">The legal docs reportedly show Natan claimed he loaned $500,000 to a guy named Eric Stenger to promote Weezy shows.</seg>
<seg id="6">Natan claimed Stenger collaborated with Wayne from the beginning and lied about being a concert promoter.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said Wayne received the $500,000 investment from him but then never performed and also never gave back the cash.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the legal docs, Lil Wayne was served with the lawsuit but he failed to respond, so the judge issued a default judgment against Weezy.</seg>
<seg id="9">Typically, the courts will give a defendant one last chance to respond.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is the latest in a string of legal troubles for the 36-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="11">Earlier this year he threatened his former record company Moments in Time with legal action because they wouldn't return an old lyric notebook of his, instead they were trying to auction it for £189,600.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also filed a £15.2 million lawsuit against former attorney Ronald Sweeney for allegedly tricking him out of the same amount while he represented the musician for 13 years.</seg>

<seg id="7">Eric Schaeffer, director of the Environmental Integrity Project and a former top enforcement official at EPA, said the agency's current focus on homeless encampments is misdirected when it "has done so little to enforce illegal discharges from much larger sources across the US."</seg>

<seg id="2">A doctor in Zimbabwe who was abducted and allegedly tortured for leading a doctors strike left the country late Thursday for what his medical team calls "urgent" treatment in South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="3">Dr. Peter Magombeyi, acting president of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association, had been receiving care in Harare for a week since his release from captivity.</seg>
<seg id="4">Friends and colleagues suspect he was poisoned during his five-day abduction and now has liver damage.</seg>
<seg id="5">His father, Kingstone Magombeyi, had been staying with him at the hospital since his release last Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I am very happy for that step taken by the medical practitioners, am very happy on that one, because there are some areas whereby l feel he needs further medication," Kingstone Magombeyi said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Peter Magombeyi's departure for South Africa only came after the head of the High Court, George Chiweshe, chastised police who had defied a court order and blocked the doctor from leaving.</seg>
<seg id="8">Monica Mutsvangwa, Zimbabwe's Information Minister, maintains police interfered with Magombeyi's departure for safety and health reasons.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The police are keen to apprehend the alleged abductors so as to bring them to justice and protect the public," Mutsvangwa said.</seg>
<seg id="10">They therefore need the court's assistance in delaying Dr. Magombeyi's departure to South Africa, before him giving the vital leads they need to advance their investigations.</seg>

<seg id="1">With land out of bounds, Pak terrorists plan to infiltrate through the skies and seas</seg>
<seg id="2">New Delhi, Sep 27: Almost all top terror groups in Pakistan have activated their modules, training camps just to name a few.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, over the past couple of weeks, the Indian intelligence has been picking up information about the opening up of the aquatic training centres of both the Lashkar-e-Tayiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was back in January that the Intelligence had first signalled that Pakistan is urging its terror groups to go ahead with Operation Samudari.</seg>
<seg id="5">Officials tell OneIndia that terror groups would look to use various techniques as the land is becoming difficult to access owing to the huge security build-up.</seg>
<seg id="6">The incident in which Pakistan used drones to send in arms and ammunition is one such example of how the tactics are changing.</seg>
<seg id="7">While the Balakot camp was reactivated by the Jaish-e-Mohammad, the Lashkar-e-Tayiba to has activated two of its maritime camps at Mirpur and Sialkot.</seg>
<seg id="8">Officials say that as the latest information available, Pakistan based terrorist camps continue to train cadres for underwater strikes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The intention would also be to infiltrate terrorists through the waters, IB officials further note.</seg>
<seg id="10">Several intelligence reports available with OneIndia state that the naval wing of these groups is handled by the Musa Company, which is the special services group of the Pakistan Army.</seg>
<seg id="11">The naval wing of these terrorist groups is not often used by terror groups.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is part of the surprise element, the reports state.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since 2004, it had become mandatory for every Lashkar-e-Tayiba recruit to undergo a certain amount of maritime training.</seg>
<seg id="14">This apart, the terrorists also take part in classes on elementary flying.</seg>
<seg id="15">As part of the training programme, the first class is held in Thakot and then at Murdike.</seg>
<seg id="16">The training programme comes to a close at Karachi and each of these sessions is conducted by officers of the Musa company.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the days to come the sea route would be the most preferred for terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is impossible to man the entire sea and hence in this regard, intelligence and coordination become the key.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition to this, there is also a dire need to introduce hi-tech technology to aid the Intelligence Bureau.</seg>
<seg id="20">The reason why Intelligence, technology and coordination becomes crucial is that 90 per cent of the world trade is sea-based and it is impossible to man each and every vessel on the sea.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smaller ones, in particular, pose the maximum danger.</seg>
