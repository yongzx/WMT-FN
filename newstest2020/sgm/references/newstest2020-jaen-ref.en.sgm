<seg id="1">Driving in high heels is dangerous!</seg>
<seg id="2">Many accidents occurring when young people press the wrong pedal (Auto Messe Web) - Yahoo!News</seg>
<seg id="3">Actions that violate the road traffic act</seg>
<seg id="4">Although reports of car accidents caused by errors like pressing the wrong pedal are increasingly garnering attention, it is a big mistake to think that this is only a problem caused by elderly drivers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Looking at the number of accidents caused by pressing the wrong pedal by age group (2015 National Police Agency data), the group with most occurrences was the under 24s at 1080, which exceeds the 1032 cases caused by over 75s.</seg>
<seg id="6">It cannot be said that erroneous pedal presses are more common in older people, and so it is important to urge younger people to be careful in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="7">Do you choose to make your feet look good?</seg>
<seg id="8">Or do you choose safety?</seg>
<seg id="9">Although this data does not include the gender ratio or the cause, unlike the elderly, where accidents are likely to be caused mainly by physical decline that affects driving ability and reflexes, with the younger generation it is more likely to be careless mistakes because of being distracted by music or conversation, or clothes than tend to be the cause of erroneous pedal presses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Amongst women in particular, there are people who tend to choose footwear such as high heels, pumps, sandals and mules depending on their outfit, and drive as they are.</seg>
<seg id="11">Of course there are those who are aware that they are not appropriate for driving in but find it a pain to change their shoes, but the majority drive without any bad intent but don't give any thought to the possibility that it may lead to danger.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, driving in high heels or in sandals is actually in violation of the road traffic act.</seg>
<seg id="13">One such law is article 70, about safe driving obligation, which states drivers must "work the vehicle's steering wheel, brakes, and other equipment in a consistent manner," and "must drive in a manner that poses no hazard to others".</seg>
<seg id="14">Another is article 71, on rules set by the public safety commission that must be observed by drivers, which stipulates that drivers must follow the rules set out by the public safety commission of each prefecture, for instance in article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefecture road traffic act bylaws, which states, "it is forbidden to drive a vehicle (excluding light vehicles) in wooden geta sandals, slippers slip-ons, high heels or any other footwear that might impede operation of said vehicle, or wear footwear in a way that might impede operation of the vehicle."</seg>
<seg id="15">The same is true in all prefectures, even if high heels are not explicitly stated, driving in "footwear that may impede operation of the vehicle" is considered a violation.</seg>
<seg id="16">So, why is driving in high heels dangerous?</seg>
<seg id="17">It is clear when you think about the basics of safe pedal operation.</seg>
<seg id="18">In order to use the pedals safely, one must first place one's heel firmly on the floor, with the foot perpendicular to the brake pedal, pivoting the end of one's foot to the right when one wants to press the gas pedal.</seg>
<seg id="19">Regardless of the behaviour of the car, it is imperative at this time that one's heel remains firm so that it does not wobble.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, with high heels, the surface area of the part of the heel that makes contact with the floor is small, causing constant wobble, and the height of the heel means that the whole foot is at an angle, and so the surface area of the end of the foot that makes contact with the pedal is also small, making it hard to press the pedal firmly or make minute adjustments.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is considered to be dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another consideration is the fact that most cars have carpeted floors and high heels can easily get caught in the material, and there have been instances where someone has needed to brake suddenly but their heel gets caught and they're not able to press the pedal firmly enough, or even slip off when it gets caught and become jammed at the back of the pedal so that it can't be pressed.</seg>
<seg id="23">There have also been cases where the heel has got caught on the other side of the pedal after pressing down and lifting off, and so the gas pedal wasn't able to be returned to the idle position.</seg>

<seg id="2">The torch signalling the 100th national athletics championships was lit on the easternmost tip of the Liancourt Rocks (Dokdo, Japanese name: Takeshima).</seg>

<seg id="2">The slump in the housing market combined with more consumers losing interest in tiled roofs after repeated damage from earthquakes were a contributing factor</seg>
<seg id="3">Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB company code: 530173983, capital: 99.2 million yen, address: 881-8 Otani, Awaji-shi, Hyogo-ken, CEO: Fukuhara Kozo, employees: 44) filed for semi-voluntary bankruptcy at Kobe District Court on August 30th.</seg>
<seg id="4">The application was filed by attorney Yoshida Daichi (Yoshida Daichi Law Firm, 1-10-8 Nishi-Tenma, Kita-ku, Osaka-shi, Osaka-fu, telephone: 06-6365-6038) and one other person.</seg>
<seg id="5">The company is a tile manufacturer that was founded in June 1895, and reorganised as a corporation in April 1961.</seg>
<seg id="6">Initially named Kinki Yogyo Co., Ltd. it started business as a manufacturer of ibushi tiles, a local industry of Awajishima, located in Seidan-cho, Mihara-gun (present-day Minami-Awaji).</seg>
<seg id="7">In October 1986, the company merged with Kyowa Ceramics Co., Ltd. and took over the business of Kinki Sangyo Co., Ltd., changing to its current trade name and moving its head office to the current location in the process.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kinki Ceramics went on to open sales offices in Fukuyama, Hiroshima, Oita and Miyazaki, taking on its current company structure, and while ibushi tiles were once their main product, changing customer needs meant that were manufacturing 70% western, flat tiles and only 30% of their output was Japanese tiles like ibushi tiles.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company had built a broad customer base primarily in West Japan, including major house builders, building material trading companies and roofing companies, posting annual sales of 3 billion 116 million yen in December 2004.</seg>
<seg id="10">They had been well known as a top tile manufacturer in Awajishima.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, after this, demand slowed due to the downturn in the housing market following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, as well as consumers becoming less eager to have tiled roofs after repeated damage from earthquakes such as the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami and the Kumamoto earthquake, and so, by December 2018, sales had fallen to 1 billion 345 million yen.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the profit front, not only did a sudden jump in fuel prices wipe profit margins, high interest-bearing debts associated with capital investment and inventory costs led to the company being constantly in the red, and they found themselves pretty cash-strapped.</seg>
<seg id="13">As a result, Kinki Ceramics had been trying to rebuild its business by requesting financial institutions to ease the terms of loan repayments, but with no sign that business conditions would recover, cash gradually became tighter and tighter.</seg>
<seg id="14">It got to the point where the company could no longer be shored up, so they abandoned hope of continuing business and took the recent action.</seg>
<seg id="15">The amount of debt is currently being looked into, but it is expected to be about 2 billion yen.</seg>

<seg id="6">Though extraordinarily gifted technically, Assulin was abandoned by the luck he needed to succeed, so he ended up signing a 2-year contract with the Romanian team Poli Iași, who play in Liga I.</seg>
<seg id="7">The team, whose colours are blue and white, are currently fifth in the league.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gai Assulin made his professional debut with Barça in the 2009/10 season when he was just 18 and a half, playing against Cultural Leonesa in the Copa del Rey.</seg>

<seg id="1">Darvish reflects on the season: "It's on a whole other level than anything that's come before" (Tokyo Sports Web) - Yahoo!News</seg>
<seg id="2">Published in St. Louis, Missouri on the 27th (28th local Japan time)</seg>
<seg id="3">With the chance to play in the playoffs now quashed, Cubs' pitcher Darvish Yu (33) has finished pitching for this season, and he said in a recent interview regarding his current state of mind, "I've been doing nothing for the last two days or so. Just watching baseball (from the bench) without any objectives is boring."</seg>
<seg id="4">Darvish started in 31 games this season, with six wins, eight losses and an ERA of 3.98, with 178 2/3 innings pitched and 229 strikeouts.</seg>
<seg id="5">He exhibited a stable pitching form particularly in the second half of games, using superb control and overwhelming throws to make light work of batters on the opposing teams.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Right now, without a doubt, I'm on a whole other level compared to anything before. I didn't expect to feel that way at 33. In the spring, I thought, 'I wonder if this is how it will end for me', so I can barely believe that I was able to come and move to a better position," which just goes to show that it was also a fulfilling season.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was around the beginning of June that Darvish finally began to feel the effect.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The things I was able to do increased each day, I was able to do an additional thing each day," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">There was a fair amount of trial and error, but by testing out hypotheses Darvish had made one after the after, he was able to significantly improve his situation, and his results improved accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="10">He also asserts the fact that was able to "throw for the whole year without going on the injured list" was linked to him regaining confidence.</seg>
<seg id="11">Darvish, who has the right to opt out and break from his contract after this season is over, noted, "I'll have to start thinking about it. I also need to talk it over with my agent and family," though he conceded, "Basically I've got nothing against this team, and I'm enjoying myself."</seg>
<seg id="12">Although he has not reached a final conclusion, it seems his feelings are firm.</seg>

<seg id="2">Measures continue to be taken within Hakodate City at apartment complexes where water cut-offs occurred when the area suffered area-wide power outages (blackouts) in the wake of the Iburi Eastern Earthquake in September of last year.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the City Enterprise Bureau Water and Sewage Department, in the one year following the earthquake seven apartment complexes have been fitted with "water taps" that can provide water even during a power outage.</seg>
<seg id="4">The bureau is calling for measures to account for the roughly 400 apartment buildings and non-government residential complexes within the city that are over 4-stories tall and access water via "water tank type" systems that could potentially suffer water cut-offs during power outages.</seg>
<seg id="5">Water supply systems for residential buildings can be divided broadly into two types: "water tank type" which stores water in a tank either on the roof or underground, and "direct type" which connects each unit with water directly from the city water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="6">With water tank type systems, if function of the electric pumps which direct water from the tank to each unit is halted due to a power outage, water cannot be accessed and a water outage occurs, even if there is no damage to water pipes.</seg>

<seg id="3">The opening night speech for Ninkyo Gakuen, a big screen adaptation from Konno Bin's popular "Ninkyo" series of novels, took place on September 27th at TOHO Cinemas Shinjuku, and Nishijima Hidetoshi, Nishida Toshiyuki, Ito Atsushi, Nakao Akira and director Kimura Hisashi all took to the stage.</seg>
<seg id="4">Konno, who penned the original, was there as a special guest and he gushed, "I love this movie! Himura (played by Nishijima) is just so cool in whatever scene, whatever cut, he's in. I'm so jealous," and the cast members looked delighted to hear his enthusiasm for the film version.</seg>

<seg id="7">The film is a thrilling story in which the boss of the Akimoto-gumi yakuza, a man who can't help but contribute to society, accepts the task of saving a high school on the verge of collapse, and solving the various problems with the yakuzas' unique sense of moral obligation and humanity.</seg>
<seg id="8">Nishida plays the strong yet likeable boss, while Nishijima plays his faithful number two, Himura, who is always being exploited by the boss.</seg>
<seg id="9">Speaking about the premiere, Nishijima said, "I had been dreading this day," with a face filled with emotion.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The whole cast was a very close-knit team, not just on set, but even after filming, we often met and talked about all kinds of things," he said of the strong bond between cast members.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ito chipped in, "We held review meetings, but no reviewing occurred, they were just drinking parties," and added, laughing, "But the fact that we were able to make that time ended up being of great benefit on set. Teamwork improved and motivation increased. Even after the film was a wrap, we've carried on regularly, and I have a lot of fond memories," which just goes to show what a precious time it was that they spent together.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the conversation turned to drinking parties, Nishijima let slip a surprising truth.</seg>
<seg id="13">He confessed that, "Whenever I reviewed with these guys, I always ended up drinking too much. There were many occasions where I only remember about half of what was going on."</seg>
<seg id="14">Nishida interjected, "Your drunkenness is not noticeable to others, you looked sober, but you're telling me you were drunk? That's a great way to be become inebriated," he said with admiration, inviting laughter from the audience.</seg>
<seg id="15">The filmed forged a great sense of team, and Nishida expressed his desire thusly, "It may become a series if it gets reviews. I'd like to enlist your help to turn it into a series," and Ito added that they'd all be keen to "make it into a series", while Nakao remarked, "When I saw the film, I was annoyed because Nishida sings. If it becomes a series, I'd like to sing next time," while director Kimura stated, "As far as I'm concerned it's already been decided that there will be a sequel," before the cast members were showered with applause.</seg>

<seg id="3">With prefectural cooperative leaders in attendance, a council of the Prefectural Fisheries Cooperative (Fisheries Cooperative Association Union) was held on the 27th at the Chuodai Iino Fishery Hall and Chairman Nozaki Tetsu stated: "I think that, as the Prefectural Fisheries Cooperation, we need to move in a direction towards full-scale operation. I want to gather the respective representatives and open a discussion."</seg>
<seg id="4">At the council meeting, Fukushima's coastal marble rockfish, masu salmon and spotbelly rockfish, which have had their limited-shipment designation lifted, were approved to be officially added to the fish species viable for test-fishing operations.</seg>
<seg id="5">There are two remaining target marine species: venus clam and common skete.</seg>
<seg id="6">After the conclusion of the meeting, Chairman Nozaki met with reporters and emphasized that the period for starting full-scale operations is undecided.</seg>

My position opposing draining into the ocean remains unchanged," rejecting statements made by Former Environment Minister Harada Yoshiaki and Osaka City Mayor Matsui Ichiro.</seg>
<seg id="8">Regarding the talks about full-scale operations, head of the Iwaki City Fisheries Association (Fisheries Business Association Union), Egawa Akira pointed out that "we need to listen to opinions from below," respecting the will of the association members.</seg>

<seg id="1">Only a thin line between beauty and ugliness?</seg>
<seg id="2">what is the image of a "snake" that overlaps with the beautiful girls in the work of Umezu Kazuo? (Magmix) - Yahoo!News</seg>
<seg id="3">Do mysterious beauty and dark, brooding expressions share something in common?</seg>
<seg id="4">Umezu Kazuo's Beautiful Girls Collection (Genkosha) was released in August 2019, and this book focuses on beautiful girls drawn by Umezu, who is perhaps best known as the leading author of horror manga, and has released many works into the world since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="5">Pick up a copy of this latest book, and you once again appreciate the correlation between beauty and fear in Umezu's work.</seg>
<seg id="6">Images: Is it the sense of darkness that make them so fascinating?</seg>
<seg id="7">Beautiful girls from Umezu Kazuo's work (5 images)</seg>
<seg id="8">There's a line in the preface to the Beautiful Girls Collection that says "The beauty of these women stands out in stark contrast to the fear and ugliness in the story's development and shocking scenes", but when a beautiful face becomes distorted, taking on an expression of hatred and malice... perhaps it is this contrast that makes the horror all the more frightening.</seg>
<seg id="9">Snakes are a heavily featured keyword in Umezu's works, but a snake can be perceived as a "creepy creature" or something beautiful, depending on the person viewing it, so there are various interpretations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Some people in the world like reptiles, while others simply can't stand them.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the same way, a snake is an animal where beauty and ugliness are two sides of the same coin, depending on the emotions of the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Furthermore, these creatures have been worshipped as highly spiritual creatures since ancient times, and it is said that a house where a "white snake" has settled will have good luck.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stories that take snakes as their subject are "The Snake Girl" and "Spotted Girl" from the 1965 "Mummy is Scary!" series.</seg>
<seg id="14">Generally it is a beautiful woman with a dark secret that becomes a "snake woman".</seg>
<seg id="15">If you were to put in modern parlance, you might call that kind of woman a "cool beauty"... I feel that this is a common feature of the beautiful ladies that appear in Umezu's stories.</seg>
<seg id="16">Among them, Orochi, the main character of "Orochi", a story serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday from 1969 onwards, is a beautiful female character who can be said to be representative of Umezu's work, but the fact that she goes into a deep sleep for 100 years at a time to maintain eternal life and eternal youth, and that she possesses other mysterious powers, somehow reminds one of a snake.</seg>

<seg id="6">With the declining birthrate and aging of the population areas are becoming desolate and shopping streets are declining.</seg>
<seg id="7">There are no places where people can meet.</seg>
<seg id="8">So "we needed a lively spot where people could interact in the area."</seg>
<seg id="9">Although they are called children's diner, they are "places of multi-generational exchange" where the elderly can participate as well.</seg>
<seg id="10">They not only eliminate the eating of meals alone, but also provide support for those raising children and promote health for the elderly.</seg>
<seg id="11">Breaking the chain of porverty and rejuvenate the area.</seg>
<seg id="12">The important thing is "to not make any child feel turned away"</seg>
<seg id="13">Variety of locations ranging from those that provide meals once a month to those that provide meals daily.</seg>
<seg id="14">The scale varies from a few people to a few hundred people, and the wide diversity of venues ranges from private homes to temples.</seg>
<seg id="15">A mood is growing that people who want to do it, can do it.</seg>
<seg id="16">This ease of getting started is an attractive draw.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, it is difficult to maintain staff and operational fees.</seg>
<seg id="18">Raised also is the issue of safe management structure</seg>
<seg id="19">Nonetheless, "by interacting with many people your views on values change." "A connection with society becomes a security net in times of misfortune" Yuasa said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Like a ray of hope in a closed society.</seg>

<seg id="2">In October, Nike will be releasing eight new models of its Air Force 1 sneakers, a shoe that has gained popularity as the brand's signature shoe ever since it first went on the market in 1982.</seg>
<seg id="3">Three of the eight models are for women, about which Nike's senior creative director of women's footwear, Georgina James says, "Women are diverse, and so they seek something unique, something different to everyone else", and just as this would suggest, she has taken the experience gained from the One Re-Imagined collection (launched in 2018) that redesigned the sneaker from a female perspective and leveraged it in this latest update.</seg>
<seg id="4">In photos: Eight new Air Force 1 models, including a Gore-Tex Model and a model made in collaboration with the NBA, released</seg>
<seg id="5">The Air Force 1 NBA Pack, made in collaboration with the NBA come in two varieties: low-cut and high-cut.</seg>
<seg id="6">The low-cut style comes in the NBA colours of red, yellow, black and navy, whereas the high-cut style are available in the uniform colours of three teams, including the LA Lakers.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition to the NBA logo featured on the heel and tongue of the shoes, satin fabric is used at the rear of the upper, and this is also the first time the Nike Swoosh has featured a bicoloured design.</seg>
<seg id="8">The shoes will be released on October 1st, priced at 13,200 yen, tax included.</seg>
<seg id="9">As its name suggests, the Air Force 1 Swoosh Pack design features the word "swoosh" as well as logos all over.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is interesting to note that the tongue of the shoe, that would usually bear the brand logo, has also been changed to the word "SWOOSH".</seg>
<seg id="11">The Air Force 1 Shadow draws inspiration from shadows, and so every detail from the side Swoosh onwards is doubled up to evoke a shadow-like effect.</seg>
<seg id="12">The outsoles are thicker than the originals, giving the shoes more height, yet are made light by hollowing out the centre, which will surely appeal to women.</seg>
<seg id="13">The shoes will be released on October 3rd, priced at 13,200 yen, tax included.</seg>

<seg id="2">"The Iranian Ababil drone that was used in this latest attack has been improved dramatically in recent years after a crashed US military drone was analysed.</seg>
<seg id="3">It can be manufactured at low cost and has a cruising range of about 1,000km.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also has the advantage of being difficult to detect on radar because it flies close to the ground." (Yokota Toru, press photographer)</seg>
<seg id="5">On September 14th, the oil facilities of Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, were bombed by ten military drones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Immediately afterwards, the Yemeni rebel group, the Houthi movement, issued a statement claiming that they were behind the attack.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Behind the Houthis is undoubtedly Iran, led by President Rouhani. In a situation where it is unable to export its own crude oil, Iran cannot bear to see its enemy Saudi Arabia profiting from crude oil. Iran is trying to send a message to the world that if the oil embargoes placed on it continue, it will retaliate in equal measure." (Sugawara Izuru, international political analyst)</seg>
<seg id="8">The bombing has cut oil production in Saudi Arabia by half, and caused oil prices to soar 15%.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some say that if the situation continues, there will be another oil crisis.</seg>
<seg id="10">"With Trump pledging to withdraw the US military from the Middle East, it will be best to avoid military intervention at all costs, at least until after next year's election. Knowing this, Iran will likely continue to run drone bombing raids hidden behind the Houthis. However, the US won't remain silent forever. It is very likely that Trump will decide to attack Iran in the future." (Sugawara)</seg>

<seg id="1">The reason a super unique YouTuber became a full-time company employee.</seg>
<seg id="2">Asking the company president who hired them (bizSPA!</seg>
<seg id="3">Published 9/27 (Friday) 8:47</seg>
<seg id="4">YouTubers currently boast immense popularity among young people.</seg>
<seg id="5">Cases of companies hiring them for use in advertising the company's products are not rare these days, but there is one company that has started an unusual system of "YouTuber employment" in which they employ them as full-time company employees.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is Direct Marketing Mix Inc. ("DmMiX"), a company that operates mainly in CRM (customer relationship management).</seg>
<seg id="7">What exactly does it mean to "employ a YouTuber"?</seg>
<seg id="8">We spoke with Kobayashi Yuki, DmMiX CEO and also representative of the subsidiary company Staff First, which actually employs YouTubers.</seg>
<seg id="9">By employing YouTubers we want to encourage young people</seg>
<seg id="10">-- First of all, how does "YouTuber employment" work?</seg>
<seg id="11">Kobayashi Yuki (hereafter "Kobayashi"): These days the job of "YouTuber" is the dream of many young people.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is even in the top of elementary school students' ranking of desired future occupations, and there will be more and more aspiring young people going forward.</seg>
<seg id="13">Up until now we have employed young people chasing dreams of being musicians or comedians, and supported them.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the same way, we employ young people chasing their dream to be YouTubers and support them, and that is "YouTuber employment."</seg>
<seg id="15">-- When we say "YouTuber," the impression is of an individual who posts videos on their own, so why did you think to "employ" them?</seg>
<seg id="16">Kobayashi: Though many young people aspire to the occupation of YouTuber, the reality is that most YouTubers can't make revenue the way they hoped.</seg>
<seg id="17">There are many creators who create and post videos while also doing part time work, and creators whose families won't recognize them as YouTubers.</seg>
<seg id="18">With this project we provide employed creators with a salary and an environment where they can create contents.</seg>
<seg id="19">The cons of being a YouTuber as an occupation is that it is initially inevitably unstable, so I think that with the support of our company we can encourage their endeavors.</seg>

<seg id="1">"I hope South Korea returns to GSOMIA" says the deputy assistant US secretary of state (Sankei Newspaper) - Yahoo!News</seg>
<seg id="2">Mark Knapper, deputy assistant secretary for Korea and Japan at the US Department of State, speaking in an individual interview with the Sankei Newspaper at the US ambassador's residence in Tokyo on the 27th said of the General Security of Military Information Agreement between Korea and Japan (GSOMIA) which is due to expire on November 23rd, "I hope that Korea reconsiders their decision to abolish the agreement and return instead."</seg>
<seg id="3">It is unprecedented for a senior US official to refer to something like reconsidering the decision to abolish the GSOMIA.</seg>
<seg id="4">The GSOMIA is concluded between Japan and Korea, Japan and the US, and Korea and the US and serves as a foundation for sharing intelligence such as information on missile launches.</seg>
<seg id="5">Back in August, Korea announced that it would abolish its agreement with Japan, and once it expires, the framework that assures military intelligence will be shared between the two countries will collapse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Knapper asserted that, "Without the GSOMIA, it won't be possible to respond effectively to a crisis."</seg>
<seg id="7">"There is still time until it expires," he said, strongly urging Korea to return to the agreement.</seg>
<seg id="8">The secretary also recognized the threat after China and Russia conducted a joint flight training exercise over the Sea of Japan in July, a "first in history", and appealed that, "The US, Korea and Japan share values such as democracy and human rights, and it is imperative that we operate together in an alliance."</seg>
<seg id="9">He pointed out that the recent souring in Japan-Korea relations would "hurt the US national interest".</seg>
<seg id="10">Although clarifying that he had "no intention of acting as a mediator", he hoped to "play a positive role so that Japan and Korea can bridge the gap".</seg>

<seg id="2">The Nuclear Regulation Authority revealed on the 28th that over 336 accidents and breakdowns have been reported at nuclear power related facilities nationwide up until 2018 since 2000, the year after the Nuclear Criticality Accident in Tokai town, Ibaraki Prefecture, caused the first fatality due to exposure in the history of nuclear power in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 30th marks the passing of 20 years since the Tokai Nuclear Accident rang an alarm over the nuclear industry's myth of safety.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although in the report, 90% of the incidents were listed as either level 0 (Unimportant for safety) by severity measurements determined by the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale (INES) or were not subject to evaluation, there needs to be a constant heightening of safety awareness, by taking into account the lessons learned from the Tokai Accident and the 2011 Tokyo Electric Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster.</seg>

<seg id="2">Artist and member of the Echizen City Region Revitalization Cooperation Volunteers, Koichi Muneta (64) will use a picture book to encourage town development and has started an online crowd-funding campaign to collect donations with the aim of publishing the original picture book which draws inspiration from legends from within the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="3">"The compassion of the people of Fukui is based in their deep faith and I want to convey that through the picture book" said Muneta, a Hokkaido native who started volunteering with the group in April of this year.</seg>
<seg id="4">Donate Here - Expressing the heart of Fukui</seg>
<seg id="5">While working as an artist focusing on contemporary art with mathematical motifs, since reaching his 60s Muneta also became active with the volunteer group.</seg>
<seg id="6">Muneta started work with Echizen City last April after involvement in town development in Nagano, Kumamoto and Tochigi .</seg>
<seg id="7">As the same city that produced Kako Satoshi and Iwasaki Chihiro, the city aims to utilize picture books to promote development.</seg>
<seg id="8">Living in the city "I was surprised when I first understood the depth of the compassion of those around me," Muneta said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Muneta was drawn to the Awara City legend, "The Daughter-in-law's Demon Mask."</seg>
<seg id="10">In the story, when her mother-in-law is unable to remove a demon mask, a kind daughter-in-law is not frightened by the mask and without worrying repeats Buddhist chants to help her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="11">"To forget hatred and give compassion and kindness in return. I felt the origins of the deep piety and kindness of the people of Fukui," Muneta said.</seg>
<seg id="12">After gleaning this hint Muneta started collecting research for his original picture book soon after arriving including visits to Yoshizaki-Gobo temple in Awara City and has completed "The Demon Couple," a story which features a gentle demon couple and a young boy.</seg>
<seg id="13">Starting in June, Muneta put his professional skills to work painting ten warm watercolor scenes that will make up the material for the book.</seg>
<seg id="14">Furthermore, the cover of the picture book is projected to be made from washi paper, utilizing a living traditional craft of Echizen City, Echizen Washi.</seg>
<seg id="15">This will give parents and children an opportunity to enjoy the feel of washi paper while reading together.</seg>
<seg id="16">For the publishing of 600 units, the donation goal is 850 thousand yen.</seg>
<seg id="17">The deadline is October 25th.</seg>
<seg id="18">Muneta stated that "The heart of Fukui was nurtured under a history of Buddhist culture and is something to be proud of nationwide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Through the picture book I want to convey to children the meaning of the compassion and true kindness that continues to be passed down."</seg>
<seg id="20">Fukui Prefecture has authorized eleven region revitalization projects contended for among volunteer groups and businesses within the prefecture, and this will be one of the ventures supported through the use of the Hometown Tax.</seg>
<seg id="21">Fukui Shimbun is providing an information outlet and Fukui Bank is assisting with management support.</seg>
<seg id="22">Donations can be made via the crowd-funding site "Readyfor."</seg>

<seg id="2">Bic Camera Okayama Ekimae store where sales of large home appliances are strong before the tax increase</seg>
<seg id="3">On the 28th, the last weekend before the sales tax increases from 8% to 10%, families crammed in last-minute shopping sprees at electronic stores and supermarkets in Okayama prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="4">In efforts to increase sales, a hardware store set up a special bulk sale event and a suit store started selling winter clothing ahead of schedule.</seg>
<seg id="5">Bic Camera Okayama Ekimae store (Ekimaecho, Kita-ku, Okayama City) has a special sale for a limited time until the 30th.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Even if it's only 2%, you can't overlook the difference when you are buying an expensive item," said an Okayama businessman, 37, who was in the store to buy a refrigerator.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the store, sales of large home appliances such as TVs, washing machines and refrigerators have been booming since the beginning of September, and sales will be about twice that of the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="8">”The rush demand is more than expected. In the second half of the month, more customers are buying big-ticket items," said a spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="9">Haruyama Shoji (Omotemachi, Okayama city), a suit store, has a sale entitled, "The biggest liquidation sale before tax increase".</seg>
<seg id="10">Coats have been on sale since early September, one month earlier than usual, and sales are 10% higher compared to the same month last year.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Though the ceremony is still a long way off, I would rather buy before the tax increase," said a businessman, 19, from Asakuchi city, who was in Kurashiki store (Hakuraku-cho, Kurashiki city) to buy suit for coming of age ceremony.</seg>
<seg id="12">In this tax increase, most food and drink purchases are exempt because of the reduced tax rate system, therefore hardware stores and supermarkets mainly promote on everyday items and alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="13">Time Takaya store (Kaneki, Naka-ku, Okayama city), a hardware store, has a special section with bulk detergent and tissue paper near the entrance.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sales of everyday items grew 1.6 times compared to the same month last year, "We restock them many times a day, otherwise they would run out," said Shimizu Seiya, the store manager.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Because it's something you buy anyway, I would rather take this opportunity to buy," said a government worker from Okayama city, 63, who was in the store buying paper towels in bulk.</seg>
<seg id="16">Tenmaya Happy Town Okaminami store (Chikko Shinmachi, Minami-ku, Okayama city) has carts loaded with detergent, toilet paper, and disposable diapers at the event hall.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The expense will be nearly the same after receiving cashless payment points, so I don't have to buy everyday items in a hurry," said a businessman from Okayama city, 35.</seg>

<seg id="2">Jürgen Klopp, who won the coveted title of Best Manager, looked back on his career in an interview and also commented on the current situation.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of the many things that he said, one comment that was surprising to the public was regarding the Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, his biggest rival in the contest for the Premier League title.</seg>
<seg id="4">Neymar's friend Alves speaks: "His happiness remains in Barcelona..."</seg>
<seg id="5">After the awards ceremony, the German manager said, "I couldn't have imagined something so great. I am very happy, and proud to have won this award. The last couple of days have been simply incredible for me. It's all down to my players that I was able to win this award. My team is the most important thing."</seg>
<seg id="6">Regarding Guardiola, Klopp divulged, "I highly respect him," continuing, "What can I say about him? He has won many titles. The style in which his team plays is extraordinary. He's the best manager I've ever played against, and it was an honour to be nominated with him and vie for the award."</seg>
<seg id="7">He also mentioned Pochettino and Tottenham.</seg>
<seg id="8">"His last year was unbelievably spectacular. In many cases, you don't remain in people's memories unless you win the title. But he's been slowly building his team, and they played with great style."</seg>
<seg id="9">Asked about his best moment of 2019, Klopp answered without hesitation, "When we turned it round against Barcelona in the Champions League. Many pundits, including myself, would not have bet on us for even one centimetre. Behind three nil against a team that has Messi and Suárez...It's like a death sentence. We were afforded a small chance and managed to pull it off. I couldn't believe it. Looking back on it, I think you could say that we took command of the Champions League in that match. I'm sure that match will be remembered by everyone."</seg>
<seg id="10">Finishing off with a more personal question, Klopp answered, "When I celebrated winning the Bundesliga, I woke up on a bench, and I didn't even know where I was. Nothing like that happened this time. I don't like getting drunk because I'm a man who has struggled with the obsession of self-control. The celebrations on winning the Champions League were very modest. I remember everything. For instance, if everyone was lined up in front of me right now, I might be able to discern all the people I saw from the bus."</seg>

<seg id="3">"Yui Sakura Shrimp Project" from the marine industry cluster committee, an academia-industry-government collaboration between Shizuoka city and others, has recently succeeded in photographing sakura shrimp born during this spring-summer spawning season on the 290-meter-deep ocean floor in Suruga Bay.</seg>
<seg id="4">The images of the growth process are valuable, and officials hope they will help elucidate the mysteries of sakura shrimp.</seg>
<seg id="5">The images were taken about 1.5 km off the coast of Kambara district, Shimizu-ku, Shizuoka city, near ocean floor.</seg>
<seg id="6">About 300 shrimp were confirmed in a 17 minute span.</seg>
<seg id="7">The conventional knowledge that Sakura shrimp spend the day in the deep ocean and "form a troupe in some degree on the ocean floor" was confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="8">While the adult is about 40 mm, the shrimp photographed were about 23 mm long.</seg>
<seg id="9">The spawning season was calculated by comparing the seasonal data of landed Sakura shrimp.</seg>
<seg id="10">The project will ask its committee members, Fujitsu Software Technologies and Shizuoka College of Industrial Science and Technology to conduct a detailed analysis.</seg>

<seg id="1">[First half of the Olympic badminton race] World champion Momota Kento and Chou Tien-chen in good shape with a one step lead!</seg>
<seg id="2"><Men's Singles> (Bado x Supi!</seg>
<seg id="3">The Japanese representative won six medals at the 25th World Championships (Switzerland, Basel), the big event for badminton that took place in August, and after completing a training camp in the start of September they will participate in the China OP (Changzhou / Super 1000) which begins on the 17th.</seg>
<seg id="4">Here, while looking back at May to August which started the first half of the Olympic race for a spot in the Tokyo Olympics, we look forward to the men's' singles in the upcoming mid-way games (September through December). (Text/Badminton Magazine editorial department)</seg>
<seg id="5">The Olympic race for badminton started in May, and with the end of the World Championship, four of the high-level tournaments for top athletes (Super 500 and above) have been completed.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the first half, the two athletes who were able to stay in promising condition were Momota Kento, who won 2 of the 4 tournaments, and Chou Tien-chen from Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Momota won the World Championship, and Chou Tien-chen the Indonesia OP (S1000), both tournaments where athletes can earn a high number of "World Ranking Points" which are directly connected to the Olympic race.</seg>
<seg id="8">Besides that, Momota is also won the Japan OP (S750).</seg>
<seg id="9">The four tournaments he has been participating in since May are the Sudirman Cup team games (May, China), the Indonesia OP (July, resulting in the best 16), the Japan OP (July), and the World Championship (August).</seg>
<seg id="10">Though this number is small compared to other top athletes, it is a schedule that puts less strain on his body.</seg>
<seg id="11">In August, it was just the single World Championship tournament, so compared to consecutive tournaments surely the fatigue was not so large.</seg>
<seg id="12">Good results are expected at the mid-way games which are the series of consecutive top-level tournaments held after September.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ace of Taiwan, strong in consecutive matches.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also look out for the young Thai!</seg>
<seg id="15">Chou Tien-chen who similarly won at the top-level tournaments Indonesia OP and Thai OP (S500), has already appeared in 7 tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="16">He took a magnificent win in his homeland at the Taipei OP (S300) at the start of September.</seg>
<seg id="17">Already strong physically, he is also an athlete that does not struggle with consecutive matches.</seg>
<seg id="18">Even with consecutive tournaments, there is no problem in his performance in the matches.</seg>
<seg id="19">Conversely, since he was able to gain high points in the games of the first half his schedule likely becomes more flexible.</seg>
<seg id="20">Until last year Chou Tien-chen gave an impression of lacking in explosive power, but since this year there has been an increased sense of stability in his plays and he has been able to maintain solid good performance.</seg>
<seg id="21">For the first place world ranking holder Momota, this will be a trickier opponent than those up until now.</seg>
<seg id="22">Other athletes besides these two that showed results in the first-half games were the young Thai ace, Kantaphon, and India's B. Sai Praneeth.</seg>
<seg id="23">And Anders Andersen, fighting alone as the sole European athlete, making three athletes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although Kantaphon will not advance in the top-level tournament, he has been in the top four in two tournaments this season, and has the power to win against the top ranking players and advance.</seg>
<seg id="25">He still has some rough spots, but the twenty year-old (will turn twenty-one on the 18th) who has grown able to rally equally with top athletes could be said to be a force hiding a large potential to jump into the Olympic race.</seg>
<seg id="26">Also, B. Sai Praneeth has stepped out of India, which has many strong singles players.</seg>
<seg id="27">Sameer Verma, Prannoy H.S., and Srikanth Kidambi who is lagging due to an injury, are likely to catch up, and we should turn our attention to the Indian athletes in from mid-games forward.</seg>

<seg id="2">Mobile phone companies have released new rate plans coinciding with the enforcement of the Telecommunications Business Law revised this October.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, they generally remained high.</seg>
<seg id="4">Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga Yoshihide remarked last summer that "there is margin for a 40% reduction," and despite heightened expectations that rates would fall, no price competition occurred.</seg>
<seg id="5">The major factor being, with the delay of Rakuten's full-scale entry into the market, that the three major companies continue to have a stronghold on the market.</seg>
<seg id="6">For consumers, it is desirable to have easy-to-use rate structures that arise from fair competition.</seg>
<seg id="7">We want to see an effort from the mobile phone companies.</seg>
<seg id="8">The revised law prohibits set discounts for device fees and communications charges.</seg>
<seg id="9">The reason being that, to compensate for device fees being sold cheaply, communications charges were being set comparatively high.</seg>
<seg id="10">Softbank and KDDI (au) announced plans for half-price on devices.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, devices from both companies were outfitted with "SIM locks" that made them unable to use other companies' networks for 100 days.</seg>
<seg id="12">NTT Docomo will reduce the cost down to a maximum of one third on devices exclusively for customers who use their network.</seg>
<seg id="13">It appears that all three companies are continuing to "cage in" to prevent transfers to other companies.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications pointed to a policy that would mandate immediate release of SIM locks.</seg>
<seg id="15">Companies must also respond promptly.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rakuten's postponement was due to the preparation of base stations and communication networks not proceeding as planned.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a disappointment as it had been expected to be a catalyst for low price competition.</seg>
<seg id="18">Perhaps predictions had been optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="19">The launch time and rate for full-scale service have not yet been disclosed.</seg>
<seg id="20">As companies that play a role in social infrastructure, we hope they will be responsible in addressing their operation of business.</seg>
<seg id="21">The current fee revision was spurred by Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga's remarks.</seg>
<seg id="22">Secretary Suga expressed dissatisfaction regarding the three companies' new rates stating: "I believe competition will start from here. I in no way think it is fine staying the way it is."</seg>
<seg id="23">However "government-prompted price cuts" will distort the market and it is difficult to think that it will promote healthy competition.</seg>
<seg id="24">Companies should engage in customer-oriented competition before being told by the government.</seg>
<seg id="25">Each company's fee structure is very complex, and it is not easy to compare them.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Customer Affairs Agency advised caution as there are cases where customers end up covering more than the half price even though the devices are advertised as "up to half-price off."</seg>
<seg id="27">Companies must provide thorough and easy-to-understand explanations to avoid misleading customers.</seg>

<seg id="3">During the Rugby World Cup in Japan on the 26th, America, the last of the 20 nations to play, lost to England 7-45.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although they were defeated, it was the rough play from flanker John Quill in the second half that is being talked about.</seg>
<seg id="5">He shouldered an opponent in the face, which earnt him an instant sending off.</seg>
<seg id="6">Actual footage of the incident was shared by overseas media outlets, and a former England player complained that is was a "sneaky and disrespectful play" and that it "couldn't even be called a tackle".</seg>

<seg id="8">A red card, and players on both teams get into a scuffle...The actual moment of the tackle that risked danger to the face made by Quill</seg>
<seg id="9">Unfortunately, hot fighting spirit caused him to cross the line.</seg>
<seg id="10">It occurred in the 29th minute of the second half, with the score at 0-38.</seg>
<seg id="11">England captain Farrell was deep in the opponents' half when he caught a pass from a player on his team that made him lose his balance a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was at this moment that Quill went in for a tackle.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, he did not go for the waist and below, but raised his upper body and smashed into the upper body of Farrell.</seg>
<seg id="14">As a result, the two players' heads connected, as in a headbutt.</seg>
<seg id="15">Farrell was sent flying and fell to the ground.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another English player looked like he might lunge at Quill as he violently protested the clearly unjustified play.</seg>
<seg id="17">Player from both sides quickly crowded around, and it looked like the situation might take a turn for the worse.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, on consulting the television match official (who reviews the video footage), Quill was given a red card and sent off.</seg>
<seg id="19">He left the pitch with an ashamed look on his face, but there was booing from some corners of the audience who expect fair play.</seg>
<seg id="20">In New Zealand, a rugby powerhouse, local media outlet Stuff led with the headline "Rugby World Cup 2019: USA player sent off for cheap shot as England cruise to victory".</seg>
<seg id="21">They reported that "Quill was sent off for a nasty shoulder charge to the face of England star Farrell", and "that sparked a scuffle between almost all players from both sides".</seg>
<seg id="22">The article featured comments from commentator and former England player, Ugo Monye.</seg>
<seg id="23">"It's a disgrace, it's cheap. That's not even a tackle. It's a cheap shot."</seg>
<seg id="24">With one man down, the US managed to claw back one try in the 81st minute, avoiding a shutout.</seg>

<seg id="1">On September 26th the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare announced for the first time the names of 424 hospitals that have been deemed "of poor medical practice" out of 1455 public hospitals including Japanese Red Cross, and other government-run hospitals nationwide.</seg>
<seg id="2">In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry inspected the medical practice of 14 public and government-run hospitals and targeted the following four facilities: National Hospital Organization Awara Hospital in Awara City, Sakai Municipal Mikuni Hospital, Oda Hospital in Echizen Town and Wakasa Takahama Hospital in Takahama Town.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Standards strange" four hospitals targeted for reorganization</seg>
<seg id="4">The ministry took this unusual response citing a necessity to prompt hospitals in competing regions to organize and consolidate in order to curb medical expenses that are expanding with the aging of the population.</seg>
<seg id="5">The idea is that requests for full-scale examinations of the reorganization and consolidation of the targeted hospitals be made in October, with conclusions provided by September of next year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Though there will be no legal enforcement, opposition is expected from local leaders and residents uneasy about facing closures of nearby hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="7">Publicly announced the same day.</seg>
<seg id="8">Targeted hospitals made up 29.1% of the total, and many were hospitals that had a comparatively low number of beds.</seg>
<seg id="9">In order, Nigata (53.7%), Hokkaido (48.6%), Miyagi (47.5%), Yamaguchi (46.7%) and Okayama (43.3%) had the highest percentages by prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="10">By target numbers Hokkaido had the highest with 54, while Okinawa was the only with zero.</seg>
<seg id="11">Of public and government-run hospitals, the Ministry surveyed 1455 hospitals capable of handling "highly acute stage" for severely ill patients and "acute stage" for general surgery based on 2017 data.</seg>
<seg id="12">The necessity to publicly announce a hospital's name was determined by the performance review of its medical practice in nine categories such as cancer and emergency care along with whether a competing hospital was located "within 20 minutes by car."</seg>
<seg id="13">Targeted hospitals will be asked to consider actions such as abolishing or moving parts of some departments to other hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="14">In 2025 medical expenses will sharply rise as all baby boomers reach ages over 75.</seg>
<seg id="15">For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has set a goal to reduce the number of hospital beds nationwide from 1,246,000 (2018) to 1,191,000.</seg>
<seg id="16">At present, while there is a large number of beds accommodating "highly acute" and "acute" phases that require heavy concentration of nurses and medical fees, there is a shortage of beds accommodating high needs rehabilitation among the elderly.</seg>
<seg id="17">In response to the aging population it is not only necessary to simply reduce the number of beds, but also to increase accommodations for rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="18">Regarding hospital reorganization and consolidation, a "community medical care initiative" will be formed in each prefecture to determine the number of beds, etc. that will be necessary in 2025.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dividing the country into 339 regions, local governments and medical personnel are negotiating, but the debate has stalled as many local residents and leaders maintain a cautious attitude.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare hopes the publication of the names of hospitals with poor performance will reinvigorate the debate.</seg>

<seg id="2">On the 27th, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced a proposed reform to the to the guidelines on preventing epidemics, making it possible to vaccinate pigs that are currently not allowed, in an effort to prevent further spread of swine fever.</seg>
<seg id="3">The plan is to target nine prefectures where the infection of pigs and wild boars has been confirmed, such as Gifu and Aichi Prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="4">The movement of live, vaccinated pigs and fertilized eggs is restricted within the area, but the distribution of meat and processed products outside the area is permitted.</seg>
<seg id="5">After gathering public opinion on the matter, it is hoped to get the reform put through as early as October.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, by using vaccines and allowing the distribution of meat outside affected areas, Japan may no longer be seen as a "free country" as certified by international institutions, which may have a negative impact on the export of pork.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the outbreak last September, Japan's status as a free country has been suspended.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the proposed reform, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has set out "areas where vaccination is recommended" based on expert opinion, which are areas where there is high risk of wild boar infecting pigs.</seg>
<seg id="9">The target prefectures will develop their own vaccination program that determines the range of vaccination, vaccination period, number of animals to be vaccinated and how to proceed with vaccinations, then once it has been checked by the ministry, use of the program will be permitted at the discretion of each prefectural governor.</seg>
<seg id="10">The other seven prefectures that have been recommended for vaccinations are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga.</seg>
<seg id="11">Once the guidelines have been revised, the situation will be assessed and the regions will be finalized.</seg>
<seg id="12">In principle, the movement of live, vaccinated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, carcasses and excrement is restricted within the area.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meat and processed products are not subject to such restrictions due to the cost of restricting distribution and because of the impact it would have on farmers, so in effect, distribution outside the area is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thus food waste must be thoroughly disposed of to prevent the spread of the virus.</seg>
<seg id="15">Efforts will be made to ensure that vaccinated pigs are safe, and to prevent financial damage caused by misinformation.</seg>
<seg id="16">The proposed guideline reform was compiled at a meeting of experts that was held on the same day, and approved at an assembly of the Epidemic Prevention Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="17">The next step will be to hold public opinion enquiries in each prefecture until October 7th, after which the new epidemic prevention guidelines will come into effect.</seg>

<seg id="1">Free agent Honda Keisuke approaches Man U publicly!</seg>
<seg id="2">"Please make me an offer. Money's not an issue" (Football Channel) - Yahoo!News</seg>
<seg id="3">Published Saturday, September 28th at 2:57</seg>
<seg id="4">Honda Keisuke left Australian A-League side Melbourne Victory only last season, but now the currently free agent midfielder formerly on the Japanese national team has taken a surprising action.</seg>
<seg id="5">Video: Honda Keisuke was actually in the match?</seg>
<seg id="6">The astonishing truth is revealed</seg>
<seg id="7">Late at night on the 27th (Japan time) Honda updated his Twitter with the following message: "Please make me an offer. Money's not an issue, but I need to play with a great team and great teammates", approaching a certain club publicly.</seg>
<seg id="8">And the club to whom he sent this "reverse offer" was none other than Manchester United, one of the most highly esteemed teams in the world.</seg>
<seg id="9">So why did Honda make this spectacular request to one of the Premier League's most powerful clubs?</seg>
<seg id="10">The answer lies in an article published by the Australian version of FOX Sports on the 24th.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the article entitled "Five Free Forwards Manchester United Could Sign Amid Injury Crisis", it lists five players who are free agents and currently available to sign.</seg>
<seg id="12">Honda was named, along with players such as Hatem Ben Arfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfried Bony.</seg>
<seg id="13">United is currently in a state of emergency after a spate of injuries to their players, including midfielder Paul Drogba, defender Luke Shaw, defender Eric Bailly, forward Anthony Martial and forward Marcus Rashford.</seg>
<seg id="14">The "Red Devils", who are managed by Ole Gunnar Solskjær, have had a difficult start to the league with only two wins and 22 losses, and are facing issues in the quality of their frontline.</seg>
<seg id="15">Thus Australian media named Honda as a fresh and capable candidate who could shore up their ranks.</seg>
<seg id="16">The article notes that, "Not strictly a striker by trade, creative wide-man Honda's signing could fill the hole currently being timidly filled by Andreas Pereira."</seg>
<seg id="17">It goes on to say that his nine goals scored in 18 games with Melbourne Victory was a "solid record", but points out that "Honda, 33, has to step away from his pastime of managing the Cambodian national team to earn full attention."</seg>
<seg id="18">Will Honda's approach bear any fruit?</seg>
<seg id="19">It will be interesting to see if United make a move for the veteran who has declared it his aim to take part in next year's Tokyo Olympics.</seg>

<seg id="3">The Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce and Industry announced on the 26th that it has completed the installation of 500 units of portable translation devices to member enterprises such as stores in Hamamatsu city.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since it is said to be the first of its kind in the country that the Chamber of Commerce distributes a great number of Pocketalk in one region, it will allow people to pay close attention to the project's success in meeting inbound tourists' demands.</seg>
<seg id="5">Currently, the lending locations include 236 restaurants, 113 retail stores, 17 accommodation facilities, and 134 others.</seg>
<seg id="6">Naka-ku, Hamamatsu city accounts for 60%.</seg>
<seg id="7">It also started displaying the lending locations on the map app, "Google Maps," and the locations of "stores providing foreign language support" can be found on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="8">It can be accessed from the website of Lake Hamana Sightseeing Area.</seg>
<seg id="9">The free lending of Pocketalk, which supports 74 languages, was started in April following the declaration of ”Hamamatsu, Japan's best inbound tourism support city" made by nine organizations in the city.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Chamber of Commerce purchased 500 units and lends them for two years to small and medium-sized establishments that meet the requirements of hospitality certification and cashless payment implementation.</seg>

<seg id="1">For someone skilled at the driver off the deck, is teeing up on the first hit unnecessary for Ikemura Tomoyo?</seg>
<seg id="2">Caddy's shot of the day</seg>
<seg id="3">A driver shot doesn't necessarily have to be hit off the tee.</seg>
<seg id="4">On something like the second shot of a par five hole, when you want to gain some distance, there's also the technique known as the "driver off the deck", where you strike the ball where it is on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="5">Modern drivers have large heads, so they do come with the risk of sending the ball flying off in the wrong direction, but there is a player who practices this technique frequently on the teeing ground.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's Ikemura Tomoyo, tipped to win his first tour victory.</seg>
<seg id="7">In his 7th year of professional golf, the 24-year-old has a diminutive stature at 1.66m, but he is currently seventh in terms of driving distance (hitting an average of 304.02 yards).</seg>
<seg id="8">While long shots are his forte, one of the issues was the precision of the fairway wood.</seg>
<seg id="9">Then one day in early spring, he was enlightened: "Since the spoon (three wood) shot wasn't working, I thought I would try the driver off the deck."</seg>
<seg id="10">From the practice round, he would plop the ball down on the grass in the teeing area, and casually swing a driver at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">At times when a big carry is required, the ball is often teed up, but Ikemura employs the driver off the deck for holes where both sides are narrow.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It can be used for holes where the line of sight is downhill."</seg>
<seg id="13">The trajectory tracker records a carry of 270-280 yards.</seg>
<seg id="14">"So a three wood is not required. The caddy also said that a driver off the deck is safer than a three wood.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the Japan Golf Tour Championship in June, the only wood in Ikemura's caddy bag is the driver.</seg>
<seg id="16">His second longest club is a utility iron with a loft of 17°.</seg>
<seg id="17">This tactic has astonished his fellow tourmates, but has also caused rousing cheers from the spectators who witness it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Apparently, the trick is to "swing the club level".</seg>
<seg id="19">"Whether performing a down blow or an upper, it doesn't fly true. A cut shot will send it to the right. Originally, I was merely using the driver off the deck to correct the swing of the driver shot (when teeing up). This practice also gives it a gentler attack angle (the angle of incidence of the club)."</seg>
<seg id="20">The ball is not gripped by the head of the club, incurring the risk of slicing it, but it "eliminates the left side (it doesn't curve to the left)."</seg>
<seg id="21">It sounds easy when you say it...But one can't help but be impressed by this pro technique.</seg>

<seg id="7">After hitting the bogey on the fourth I had a whole 5 par remaining so I played wanting to take it back and then the chip in eagle came in the 6th.</seg>
<seg id="8">I got the birdie on the 7th and there was a chance, but I regret that in the end I couldn't make it in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="9">-- What did you get out of this tournament?</seg>
<seg id="10">Recently my condition (of my shot) hasn't been good so it was good that I could keep solidly to the fairway even on a course where it was narrow.</seg>
<seg id="11">It was a course where the rough was into-the-grain and against-the-grain randomly and one where the way of hitting and distance changes, so this was something I had not had much (experience) of before so I learned quite a lot.</seg>
<seg id="12">-- What was the difference to regular tournaments?</seg>
<seg id="13">(Smartphones and other) camera photography was allowed.</seg>
<seg id="14">It didn't bother me at all, but there were a lot of people in the gallery taking videos.</seg>
<seg id="15">There wasn't much else different besides that, but because it was a joint sponsored tournament with few Japanese athletes, I approached the match with the sentiment "I can't lose to the overseas players!"</seg>
<seg id="16">The second half will start, but I can't aim for the top prize if I don't win one or more so I want to get one more win, and the ZOZO Championship is also coming up so to qualify I also want to do my best to get in the top ranks in the tournaments leading up to it.</seg>

<seg id="1">How to prevent dementia and keep it at a merely "forgetful" stage?</seg>
<seg id="2">Interview and story by Watanabe Yo</seg>
<seg id="3">Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are attempting to research and develop a drug for dementia, something that remains an elusive goal.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, it's becoming clearer that dementia and lifestyle are related, and it has been discovered that it is possible to keep it at bay so that it does not advance past a merely forgetful level, and the symptoms are negligible.</seg>
<seg id="5">I spoke to Professor Otsuki Shunsuke at the Kinki University Hospital Stroke Centre to find out more.</seg>
<seg id="6">Dementia never fully goes away</seg>
<seg id="7">A cure or prevention for dementia has been long-awaited, but what is the current state of progress?</seg>
<seg id="8">Otsuki: As we age, it's possible for anyone to suffer from dementia, though there are varying degrees of severity, from mild to quite serious indeed.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, it is thought that it will still take more than twenty years before a novel dementia drug is developed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Donepezil, the drug commonly used in Japan, is already not covered by insurance, so we can't hope for it to be a miraculous cure.</seg>
<seg id="11">Meanwhile, people can now live longer lives thanks to fewer deaths from infectious diseases and accidents, and deaths from cancer are also decreasing thanks to the startling progress that has been made in anti-cancer treatments.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because of that, the fact is that cases of dementia are on the rise.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's not a problem that can be solved by the individual and their family alone, it's also necessary for society as a whole to create an environment so that they can live safely in the community.</seg>
<seg id="14">How to keep dementia at a "forgetful" level</seg>
<seg id="15">Are there any kinds of people who are more prone to dementia, or who are less likely to get it?</seg>
<seg id="16">Otsuki: Even if dementia is not completely avoidable, it is possible to suppress the symptoms to the extent that it is nothing more than forgetfulness.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dementia is considered a lifestyle-related disease and there are certain trends among people who are more prone.</seg>
<seg id="18">Firstly, overweight people are far more likely to get dementia.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dementia is treated as a lifestyle-related disease.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is a combination of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="21">Finances are also a factor.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, in some parts of the US, food stamps are given out to the poorer members of society, and the foods that you can receive with food stamps are things with a long shelf life such as frozen hamburgers, pizza and chicken.</seg>
<seg id="23">They can be used by people who live in an environment where they cannot cook in the first place, because they don't have gas or electricity.</seg>
<seg id="24">This results in a diet that is low in vegetables and protein, leading to an unbalanced lifestyle that is high in fat and sugar.</seg>
<seg id="25">Eventually, they end up poor but obese, with nothing to do but tune out in front of the TV, and they become physically impaired.</seg>
<seg id="26">I believe a similar situation could exist in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="27">Also, people who don't have anything to think about, or who don't work, tend to be more prone to dementia.</seg>
<seg id="28">In other words, it's important to not become obese and to read books and consider things regularly to stave off dementia.</seg>

<seg id="2">A new, improved prototype of the F-PACE, Jaguar's first crossover SUV, was caught on camera for the first time in Southern Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The F-PACE originates from the C-X17, a 4-seater concept SUV that was unveiled in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="4">A 5-seater version was subsequently revealed in 2014, before officially debuting as the F-PACE at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show.</seg>
<seg id="5">The first, and current, generation model went on sale a year later in 2016, and this will be the first facelift that it has received since then.</seg>
<seg id="6">The photographed prototype is covered with dense camouflage, but some of the new design is visible.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition to more compact headlights with a sleek design, the side air intakes have also been modified to more sporty oval shapes.</seg>
<seg id="8">The grill was completely disguised, but no doubt that it too will have been redesigned.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the rear of the car, parts of the new taillights are visible, with elongated reverse lights placed above.</seg>
<seg id="10">It also seems that the design of the current model, that sees the lights sweep round to the sides, has been modified to be more compact.</seg>
<seg id="11">The inside of the car is expected to be kitted out with Jaguar's "Pivi Pro" touchscreen infotainment system, as well as a new digital cluster, HVAC control screen and a refreshed steering wheel and gear selector.</seg>
<seg id="12">The powertrain options are likely to be a 2.0l straight-four turbo diesel engine or a 3.0l straight-six Ingenium hybrid engine.</seg>
<seg id="13">We're sure to see the world premiere of this car before the end of 2020.</seg>
