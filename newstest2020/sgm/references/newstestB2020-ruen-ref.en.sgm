<seg id="1">TikTok hides objectionable videos from users</seg>
<seg id="2">According to TikTok’s data, its number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are younger than 18.</seg>
<seg id="3">Imagine China / Reuters</seg>
<seg id="4">The Chinese social network TikTok censors videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence, or the banned religious group Falun Gong, the Guardian reports.</seg>
<seg id="5">The documents at the outlet’s disposal reveal that the owner of TikTok (the company ByteDance) is using the app to promote China’s foreign policy goals abroad.</seg>
<seg id="6">The majority of the violations pertaining to Chinese policy falls under “incitement of hatred.”</seg>
<seg id="7">In each case, TikTok puts the objectionable publications in a context complying with the general rules, so the social network's actions won’t look like censorship.</seg>
<seg id="8">For example, the ban on criticizing China’s socialist system falls under the general ban on “criticizing or attacking the policies and social rules of any country, such as constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc.”.</seg>
<seg id="9">The ban on mentioning the incident on Tiananmen Square or the genocide in Cambodia falls under the “falsification of the history of China or other countries.”</seg>
<seg id="10">The document also provides a list of twenty names of “foreign leaders or state figures” that are banned, including the North Korean leaders Kim Jong-il, Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, American presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Geun-hye, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</seg>
<seg id="11">Banned material is divided into two categories, the document says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Publications from the first category are deleted by the social network’s administrators and may result in the user being blocked.</seg>
<seg id="13">Less severe violations belong to the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their reach is limited by TikTok’s algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="14">ByteDance representatives told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer used: “We use a localized approach for moderation now, and we engage independent local specialists”.</seg>
<seg id="15">Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on publications, says Production Center co-founder Rustem Bogdanov.</seg>
<seg id="16">Production Center is one Russian media company that officially cooperates with TikTok.</seg>
<seg id="17">All of Production Center’s bloggers’ advertising materials are coordinated with representatives of the social network, but user materials can be published without coordination, says Bogdanov.</seg>
<seg id="18">To the question of whether it’s possible to talk about politics or Putin on TikTok, Bogdanov answers positively and says he has seen such posts.</seg>
<seg id="19">The founder of the Our Digital agency Roman Zaripov agrees with Bogdanov: “The basic rules for TikTok users are enumerated in the user agreement: you cannot post shocking content, discriminatory statements, and so on.”</seg>
<seg id="20">But these rules can be applied to any content the moderators don’t like, notes Zaripov.</seg>
<seg id="21">Zaripov’s agency is another of TikTok’s Russian partners.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to TikTok’s data, its number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are younger than 18.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the user agreement, only people older than 13 can use TikTok.</seg>
<seg id="24">The social network’s administrators check their age with the help of artificial intelligence: Neuronet analyzes their faces and determines how old the person looks, says Bogdanov.</seg>
<seg id="25">If Neuronet decides the user is younger, his account could be deleted, he adds.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to RBK, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow at the WeWork co-working space.</seg>

<seg id="5">Otherwise, they are refusing to take him back.</seg>
<seg id="6">Neymar and his astute father, who is also the Brazilian’s agent, masterminded an interesting deal: according to the agreement with “Barca”, which the payer signed in 2016, he was supposed to get 40 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, literally a year later, the forward ended up at PSG for a record 222 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="8">Nevertheless, he received 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the remaining 18.</seg>
<seg id="9">Moreover, the Brazilian’s lawyers are insisting that the club also owes him interest for late payments.</seg>

<seg id="11">The Blue-Crimson are insisting that the bonus was based on the fulfillment of the entire contract—from 2016 to 2022.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thus, the club believes the player was only entitled to a quarter of the 40 million euros and is demanding the return of a prorated part of the first payment.</seg>

<seg id="2">Not only the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation, but also non-governmental pension funds can pay pensions.</seg>
<seg id="3">The NPF is a group of private companies, reports Volgogradskaya Pravda.ru.</seg>
<seg id="4">They work like a deposit: you make inpayments and the fund invests them and returns the money to you with interest over time.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you are interested in this method, first study the information about the NPF on the site of the Bank of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="6">All of the funds work under the same rules established by federal law.</seg>
<seg id="7">Pension points can be bought by law.</seg>
<seg id="8">The number of deficient points depends on how many years of experience you are lacking to accrue a pension.</seg>
<seg id="9">This method suits those who worked unofficially.</seg>
<seg id="10">Moreover, you can make a contribution for a relative, for example, a housewife.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is recommended for those who think about their pension at the beginning of their career.</seg>
<seg id="12">Civil service employees, doctors, teachers, agricultural workers, and people who worked a certain number of years in the regions of the Far North receive increased pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="13">In order not to miss out on anything as you reach pensioner age, take care of this in advance.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian MVD proposes punishment for insulting police on the internet</seg>
<seg id="2">The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs has prepared amendments to the law "On Police" to protect law enforcement officers from the distribution of information on the internet that is slanderous or harms their dignity.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Friday a proposal for public discussion of the draft legislation appeared on the federal portal of normative legal acts, while the draft document itself has not yet been published.</seg>
<seg id="4">The explanatory memorandum for the document notes that it is being developed in connection with the need to defend the dignity and honor of police from "the distribution in information-communication networks, including in the internet, of information that is slanderous or defamatory".</seg>
<seg id="5">How exactly it proposes to protect police from slander is not specified.</seg>
<seg id="6">The document's explanation says that the amendment provisions will be applied "by individual means", already provided for by the law on blocking posts that insult the authorities, and the law on fines for such posts.</seg>
<seg id="7">Both laws came into force in March of this year.</seg>
<seg id="8">The final text of the draft legislation will be published after a public discussion and independent anticorruption evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to the explanatory memorandum, amendments to the law "On Police" should come into force in January 2020.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 18 March President Vladimir Putin signed the law on punishment for "blatant disrespect for the state" online.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to this document, the Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media warns an information source about a violation and gives it 24 hours to remove it.</seg>
<seg id="12">For a first violation it provides for a fine from 30 to 300 thousand rubles, and up to 15 days' administrative arrest for a repeat violation.</seg>
<seg id="13">On 12 April the Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media applied this regulation to the mass media for the first time, blocking the Yaroslavl publication 76.ru.</seg>
<seg id="14">Soon afterwards the Novgorod region's Chudov regional court fined a local resident 30 thousand rubles for placing on the internet "two posts with indecent information that insults human dignity and public morals and expresses blatant disrespect for the Russian state and authorities".</seg>

<seg id="4">Phytoestrogens have been researched fairly well and produce a positive effect on the body.</seg>

<seg id="2">Oil slicks of unknown origin were found on 99 beaches of north-east Brazil.</seg>
<seg id="3">Patches of pollution were spread over two thousand kilometers of coastline.</seg>
<seg id="4">Messages about the first-found oil spills started arriving on 2 September.</seg>
<seg id="5">But with each day right up to Thursday their number, as well as the territorial spread, continued to grow.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Brazilian Institute of the Environment conducted a chemical analysis of retrieved samples.</seg>

<seg id="9">"It is thick oil.</seg>
<seg id="10">It might have been dumped from one of the ships after its tanks were cleaned.</seg>
<seg id="11">Many continue to do this.</seg>
<seg id="12">And most likely it got into the ocean current," the coordinator of the Union of Oil Workers in the States of Pernambuco and Paraiba Rogerio Almeida told the Brazilian news portal G1.</seg>

<seg id="2">Federation Council speaker Valentina Matviyenko believes that Russians do not have enough savings for the draft legislation on a guaranteed pension product to fully come into force.</seg>
<seg id="3">Boosting pensions with personal savings is quite a widespread practice around the world.</seg>
<seg id="4">Whether the timing is right to implement it here is another matter.</seg>
<seg id="5">"In my view, at present a significant part of the population's income leaves nothing to set aside for increasing their pension in the future," said V. Matviyenko.</seg>
<seg id="6">Russians, in the speaker's opinion, cannot understand the mechanisms of pension formation and accrual, because "constant changes in this area have completely confused them".</seg>
<seg id="7">This statement does not mean that I am against perfecting the pension system, correcting its legislation.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Russia is a social state, and we are obliged to do everything to improve citizens' pension amount and social security.</seg>
<seg id="9">But steps in this direction must be well thought out, responsible, taking domestic conditions into account," V. Matviyenko told RIA Novosti.</seg>
<seg id="10">The head of the Federation Council emphasized that if this initiative (draft legislation on a guaranteed pension product) is to be developed, several fundamental principles must be considered, including voluntariness, tax preferences for citizens and employers, and firm guarantees and state responsibility for ensuring the security of pension savings.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Russian Finance Ministry on 6 September announced that draft legislation on a guaranteed pension product (GPP) had been sent for approval.</seg>
<seg id="12">Its main elements include exclusively voluntary participation of citizens in the savings system, state-guaranteed security of citizens' long-term pension savings, registration of citizens' savings accounts by a central administrator, tax benefits for business and tax deductions for citizens.</seg>

<seg id="4">News about their favorite superhero leaving the Marvel Cinematic Universe angered many devoted fans</seg>
<seg id="5">One of the most famous comic heroes – Spider-Man – is remaining in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</seg>
<seg id="6">The companies Disney and Sony Pictures reached an agreement on rights to use him in films of the franchise.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was announced in a Sony press release that says part three of "Spider-Man" with Tom Holland will be released on screens on 16 July 2021.</seg>
<seg id="8">Earlier it was reported that Disney and Sony Pictures could not reach a consensus on revenue sharing, due to which "Spider-Man" was leaving the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sony holds rights to the superhero.</seg>
<seg id="10">It leased them out for Disney's Marvel films.</seg>
<seg id="11">As a result Sony received revenues from box office takings, and Disney – from souvenirs and toys.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was reported that at some point this situation stopped suiting Disney, and the company wanted to reconsider the agreement.</seg>
<seg id="13">Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige announced that he is thrilled.</seg>
<seg id="14">"All of us at Marvel Studios are very excited that we get to keep working on it.</seg>
<seg id="15">“Spider-Man is a powerful icon.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hero whose story crosses all ages and audiences around the globe," says his press release.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the same time Feige recalled that Sony is also creating its own cinematic universe, built around Spider-Man.</seg>
<seg id="18">"He happens to be the only hero with the superpower to cross cinematic universes.</seg>
<seg id="19">So as Sony continues to develop their own Spidey-verse you never know what surprises the future might hold,” he noted.</seg>
<seg id="20">Commenting on the news, Tom Holland, who has played Spider-Man in five films, conspicuously placed on his Instagram account a fragment from the film "Wolf of Wall Street" in which hero Leonardo di Caprio shouts "I’m not leaving!"</seg>
<seg id="21">Information about disagreements between the companies appeared in August.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to mass media reports, Disney wanted to receive half of the box-office takings from films about Spider-Man on condition that both companies pay half the film production costs.</seg>
<seg id="23">But this did not suit Sony.</seg>
<seg id="24">News about their favorite superhero's possible departure from the Marvel Cinematic Universe provoked anger among many devoted fans.</seg>
<seg id="25">Details of the new conditions have not yet been disclosed.</seg>
<seg id="26">As CNBC reports, Sony has refused to comment on the agreement, but stated: "We have had a great collaboration over the last four years, and our mutual desire to continue was equal to that of the many fans [of Spider-Man].</seg>
<seg id="27">We are delighted to be moving forward together.”</seg>
<seg id="28">The film "Avengers: Endgame", bringing together Spider-Man, Thor, Hulk and other Marvel superheroes, became the highest-grossing film in the history of world cinematography, knocking "Avatar" out of first place.</seg>

<seg id="2">A group of scholars from Canada representing McGill University have discovered that more than ten billion particles of microplastic fall into a cup in five minutes when brewing a tea bag.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sawdust particles can also be added to packaged drinks, said Nation News food safety expert Elizaveta Tikhonova.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the agronomist, the consumer can’t get reliable information on the contents of packaged tea—the manufacturer can add ingredients that won’t be identified on the package.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sawdust isn’t thrown away at the end of the season, so it could end up in the tea.</seg>
<seg id="6">“Moreover, the packets don’t always include tea plants”, Tikhonova said.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to her, it’s better to give up consuming such drinks in favor of loose-leaf tea, which is sold in specialty stores.</seg>
<seg id="8">She also emphasized that the danger of packaged tea is not only in the contents, but also in the way it’s produced—microparticles are heated to high temperatures, which can cause them to start emitting harmful substances.</seg>

<seg id="5">In their letters, the regions told the senators about the problems of SMB development and sent suggestions for improving the existing legislation.</seg>
<seg id="6">“To date, communication between the regions is not sufficiently established, and therefore question of the absence of information on regional programs of business development in the country as a whole was raised by the business community in all the regions that the senators visited,” Andrei Kutepov stated.</seg>
<seg id="7">The addendum to the letter sent to the Government presented a set of positive developments in the regions on the legalization of self-employment and summary data from the regions with proposals and problematics (available to the editors).</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition to the ministries’ profiles, the summary data from the regions was also sent to the directors of the regional executive bodies.</seg>
<seg id="9">The exchange of information on positively implemented developments in the regions could give an impetus to the development of entrepreneurship as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="10">The first step to such an exchange will be to distribute information held by the Committee for Economic Policy”, the senator told Parliamentskaya Gazeta.</seg>
<seg id="11">Useful experience</seg>
<seg id="12">Today, many regions of the country have adopted and successfully operated programs of support for small and medium-sized businesses.</seg>
<seg id="13">For example, there is a business support center functioning in the Vologda Oblast, which, besides financial support measures, supports businessmen in carrying out the certification of finished products.</seg>
<seg id="14">A business support system has been developed in the Ivanovo Oblast that envisages the implementation of the principle of the one-stop shop through multifunctional centers.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the Krasnodar region, new agricultural consumer cooperatives are provided with grants from the regional budget.</seg>
<seg id="16">There is a cluster development center functioning in the Oryol Oblast.</seg>
<seg id="17">Within the framework of the federal “Acceleration of Small and Medium-sized Businesses” project, the Amur Oblast provides for the possibility of subsidizing business incubators created on the basis of active non-state coworking centers, with funds from the federal budget.</seg>
<seg id="18">And special support measures for youth entrepreneurship are being taken in a number of other regions.</seg>
<seg id="19">The self-employed continue to come out of the shadows</seg>
<seg id="20">According to the regional authorities, a number of changes should be made to existing legislation to more effectively support small and medium-sized businesses.</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, the Arkhangelsk Oblast proposed replacing the term “self-employment” with “entrepreneurial activity”, as this “best corresponds to the content of the state service for promoting the self-employment of unemployed citizens”.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Ivanovo Oblast believes it’s necessary to introduce amendments providing for the expansion of the list of the types of businesses provided by self-employed citizens, including work on finishing and repairing residential spaces and suburban buildings, and conducting physical training classes.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Bryansk Oblast considers it important to strengthen control over unprincipled producers of dairy products with the help of the Mercury veterinary system.</seg>
<seg id="24">And in the Kostroma and Magadan Oblasts, they advocate for consolidating the concept of “social entrepreneurship” and the directions of social entrepreneurship support within the legal framework.</seg>
<seg id="25">All of the proposals from the regions will be taken into consideration when preparing state programs of support for small and medium-sized businesses, and the most important ones will be developed in the form of specific bills.</seg>
<seg id="26">“All of the proposals from the regions will be taken into consideration when preparing state programs of support for small and medium-sized businesses, and the most important ones will be developed in the form of specific bills,” assured Andrei Kutepov.</seg>

<seg id="6">Choosing seats in the cabin while booking tickets, passengers will be able to see the image of a child’s head on the seats that will be occupied by children aged eight days to two years.</seg>

<seg id="8">Internet users who use the airline’s services were delighted with the development.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some of them thanked the airline, noting that other airlines should take the same steps.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the users complained that he flew from New York to Doha three weeks ago and there were three crying children sitting next to him.</seg>
<seg id="11">Another commenter suggested introducing “adults-only flights”, expressing the willingness to pay extra for such a trip.</seg>
<seg id="12">Many tourists noted that now they will always try to choose Japan Airlines for their travels, because they see nothing pleasant about flying near children in an enclosed space.</seg>
<seg id="13">Earlier, a woman traveling with a breast-feeding infant tried to placate her fellow travelers on a flight from Seoul to San Francisco.</seg>

<seg id="2">Actor Pavel Ustinov joined the "Freedom for all" series of one-person pickets taking place on Friday at the presidential administration building on Staraya ploshchad in Moscow, an Interfax correspondent reports.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Sanctions" shipments to Russia fell to 1% of previous level</seg>
<seg id="2">The Russian government calculated that shipments of agricultural products and foodstuffs to Russia from countries that fell under the Russian food import ban had fallen since 2013 to less than 1% of their previous level.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a report sent to Russian president Vladimir Putin, 31 thousand tons of products were shipped from sanctioned countries in the first half of 2019, compared with 3 million 442.2 thousand tons in the same period of 2013, Interfax reports.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the same time the value of the imported products fell to $226.5 million from $4 billion 975.5 million respectively.</seg>
<seg id="5">This refers to shipments of products that did not fall under the embargo.</seg>
<seg id="6">As the paper indicates, reduced volumes of products prohibited for import were compensated on account of an import increase from countries of the CIS, Africa, South-East Asia, Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="7">To recap, at the end of August the government extended until 31 December 2020 the validity period of rules on the destruction of agricultural products, primary produce and foodstuffs prohibited for import to Russia within the framework of counter sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="8">The document, published on the official portal of legislative information, notes that the validity period of the rules was extended for one more year – from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.</seg>
<seg id="9">Initially the decree on the destruction of sanctioned goods was applied to products from the USA, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later, from 13 August 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Lichtenstein "joined" the list, and from 1 January 2016 – Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="11">The decree signed by Putin about the destruction of "sanctioned" products (products falling under the import ban, which Moscow introduced in response to the West's anti-Russian sanctions) illegally imported into the country came into force in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">In turn, the government permitted "sanctioned" foodstuffs to be destroyed by any legal means.</seg>
<seg id="13">To the extent that the West's sanctions are maintained, Russia also extended its counter measures.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the same time the said measure does not apply to foodstuffs that citizens import for personal consumption.</seg>
<seg id="15">The ban does not apply to the import of products for personal use of up to 5 kilograms.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, the head of the Russian Presidential Council for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights Mikhail Fedotov earlier described the destruction of foodstuffs as "simply immoral", and this, in his words, has a negative effect on people's development.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, at the beginning of June the Federal Service for the Oversight of Consumer Protection and Welfare proposed banning the destruction of foodstuffs.</seg>
<seg id="18">After that the presidential council for human rights gave a similar recommendation to the government.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Russian deputy prime minister Alexei Gordeyev said that destroying foodstuffs is wrong, and that it is necessary to think how to use them for their intended purpose, having evaluated their quality.</seg>

<seg id="2">This is reported by TASS with reference to the press service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).</seg>
<seg id="3">As ESO reports, construction began this week on the dome of the building, where the E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope), the most expensive and ambitious terrestrial astronomical project thus far, will be placed.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to ESO estimates, the total cost will exceed a billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bulk of this money will be spent on preparing equipment and building the observatory building.</seg>
<seg id="6">The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record-large window, which will have a diameter of about 39 meters.</seg>
<seg id="7">It will be assembled from 798 1.4-meter hexagonal segments.</seg>
<seg id="8">This huge mirror and two auxiliary reflecting surfaces with diameters of 4.2 and 3.75 meters will help the E-ELT get the first detailed photographs of planets outside the solar system and stars in other galaxies, and also search for Earth analogs.</seg>
<seg id="9">Additionally, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the surroundings of Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way.</seg>
<seg id="10">Although the construction of the dome has just begun, the mirrors, scientific instruments, and other components of the observatory were already developed by scientists, engineers, and other specialists three years ago—from the time the first plans for building the E-ELT were announced.</seg>
<seg id="11">The German firm SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc received the contract for producing the main mirror, whose total cost was about 400 million euros.</seg>
