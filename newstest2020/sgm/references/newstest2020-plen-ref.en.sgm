<seg id="1">Father Józef Witko: I saw Jesus wearing a white robe</seg>
<seg id="2">He is charismatic.</seg>
<seg id="3">Large crowds come to his masses for deliverance and healing.</seg>
<seg id="4">He was a teenager when unexplainable things started to happen in his life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nowadays, through the agency of the Franciscan monk, others witness this.</seg>
<seg id="6">The crowds go to masses for deliverance and healing celebrated by father Witko.</seg>
<seg id="7">On one occasion he was visited by the parents of a 7-month-old child who had a 7,5 mm hole in the heart.</seg>
<seg id="8">The child was to be operated on.</seg>
<seg id="9">Father Józef Witko prayed over him.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the same day, the boy was taken to hospital for a procedure.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bewildered doctors stated: "The procedure is not necessary, the defect is just 1,5 mm."</seg>
<seg id="12">The parents cried with happiness.</seg>
<seg id="13">Following the next Franciscan’s prayer, the hole had completely disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="14">The priest began to experience unusual acts of the Creator when he was a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="15">Souls in Purgatory had been coming to him in his dreams, asking for help.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I was woken up at night and I hurried to pray for the departed and those who were dying at that moment," he recollects.</seg>
<seg id="17">He experienced the presence of an evil spirit.</seg>
<seg id="18">He also had a vision revealing what happens to a man who had committed a mortal sin.</seg>
<seg id="19">"My body started to change.</seg>
<seg id="20">I lost all human features and started to transform into an animal," he says.</seg>
<seg id="21">An unseen force lifted him, and he could not make a sound.</seg>
<seg id="22">He felt that he was lost.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then, God delivered him the rescue.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Immersed in the waters symbolising baptism I was delivered, and I returned to a human form...", he says.</seg>
<seg id="25">He has never spoken to anyone about these unusual experiences.</seg>
<seg id="26">A vocation was maturing in him.</seg>
<seg id="27">He was 16 years old when he joined the Franciscans.</seg>
<seg id="28">In his sermons, he didn’t just want to speak about Jesus.</seg>
<seg id="29">He wanted people to experience a living God.</seg>
<seg id="30">Members of the charismatic Renewal in the Holy Spirit Movement community</seg>
<seg id="31">Many people who are hoping to get rid of illness take part in the masses for healing celebrated by Father Witko.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, the priest emphasises that their main goal is not physical healing but the spiritual one.</seg>

<seg id="1">First defeat of Kolping FRAC Jarosław</seg>
<seg id="2">Today (26th September this year) in the afternoon the Kolping FRAC team was deservedly defeated at home by the current champion of Poland, Bogoria Grodzisk.</seg>
<seg id="3">The team from Jarosław in such personal line-up as presented against the team from Grodzisk, have a faint chance to defeat any league dominators.</seg>
<seg id="4">It has been clearly shown by the duel with Darton Bogoria.</seg>
<seg id="5">The team still misses the proclaimed team leader, Chen Jingqi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Maybe if he were on the line-up, the team from Jarosław would win for the third time in a row in the new season.</seg>
<seg id="7">The young Asian Qiyao Han may not be able to compare with such aces as Greek Panagiotis Gionis or Czech Pavel Sirucek.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now even with the most prospective Poles, i.e. Marek Badowski.</seg>
<seg id="9">The competitor from Hellada was the biggest star of the duel at the MOSiR hall at ul. Sikorskiego in Jarosław.</seg>
<seg id="10">Both in the clash with Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei he showed a class by himself.</seg>
<seg id="11">After three matches Kolping FRAC has a lead of 1:1.</seg>
<seg id="12">Kou Lei easily outplayed Marek Badowski, while Daniel Górak after a 5-set exciting fight – Pavel Sirucek.</seg>
<seg id="13">Afterwards it was even worse.</seg>
<seg id="14">Gionis did not give any chance to Lei..</seg>
<seg id="15">One could have hoped for a two-point win, but Qiyao Han was beaten by Badowski.</seg>

<seg id="1">There won’t be additional medical tests for seniors.</seg>
<seg id="2">Why?</seg>
<seg id="3">As per Rafał Trzaskowski’s announcements, Warsaw was supposed to introduce a programme of free preventive tests for seniors in their 70s and 80s.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the idea will not be implemented, because it has not gained acceptance of the Ministry of Health and its subordinate body: Agency for Health Technology Protection and Tarification.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a justification the agency explained that the target group had been improperly selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The above-mentioned actions can even result in overdetection of individual disease entities, which may contribute to aggravating the problems in access to NFZ public healthcare services and negatively affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort related to false positive test outcomes" they wrote.</seg>
<seg id="7">The mayor of the capital city does not understand the decision.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The money is ours, we have money allocated for this.</seg>
<seg id="9">But the government is afraid that people after the tests will be going to see doctors, which sounds absurd, because the aim is to lead to the situation, where prevention could be performed quicker.</seg>
<seg id="10">All specialists know that it helps, if it comes to relieving the healthcare system as it helps detect disease quicker and in a reliable approach towards health.</seg>
<seg id="11">The government position here is very strange, which I do not understand" concluded Rafał Trzaskowski.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It’s hard for me to imagine that experts say: Let’s not get checked, because it will extend queues to doctors, and if such experts advise the government, it’s no wonder that health service is in such a condition" added the PO politician.</seg>

<seg id="1">Palestine responds to Israel: We will break off any previous arrangements</seg>
<seg id="2">Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced at the Thursday session of the UN General Assembly that he would break off any agreements made with Israel should its future government try to follow up on Banjamin Netanyahu’s intent of annexing occupied Palestinian lands.</seg>
<seg id="3">"If the future government of Israel attempts to execute this plan, we will have to cancel all agreements signed (with Israel) and we will withdraw from all of the undertaken obligations," he announced.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We will reject the entire plan completely," Abbas threatened emphatically.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It is our duty to defend all our rights by all means possible, no matter what the consequences, by committing ourselves to the application of international law and fight against terrorism," announced the president of the Palestinian National Authority, who made similar declarations already in July.</seg>
<seg id="6">After the elections of September 17, Netanyahu, the former prime minister of Israel, was again entrusted with the task of forming a government.</seg>
<seg id="7">A week before the elections he said that, if chosen, he would announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and would join all Jewish settlements in the entire West Bank to Israel.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, led by Yasser Arafat at that time, signed a number of peace agreements under the patronage of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="9">During the UN General Assembly session, 84-year old Abbas also promised to hold general elections on Palestinian soil.</seg>
<seg id="10">The last one took place in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="11">"After I return to my country, I will call a local election in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem and all those opposed will have to answer to God and the international community for their actions," the Palestinian president solemnly declared.</seg>
<seg id="12">In his speech, Abbas also defended the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer at the UN, to exercise the rights of "full members of the UN and all its bodies and institutions."</seg>
<seg id="13">The Palestinian leader concluded his speech by appealing to the international community to "force Israel to fully respect the decisions made by the United Nations."</seg>
<seg id="14">Israeli ambassador Danny Danon briefly responded to Abbas’ speech, stating that the Palestinian leader "prefers to use the UN forum to focus on the efforts of the Palestinian Authority aimed against Israel rather than to oppose calls for terrorism made at the Authority under his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="15">However, as noted by press agencies, Danon did not refer to the annexation of the occupied Palestinian territories promised by Netanyahu.</seg>

<seg id="1">PLN 105 million for Video Game Companies from the National Centre for Research and Development</seg>
<seg id="2">The subsidy of close to PLN 105 million will go to the gaming companies creating innovative solutions.</seg>
<seg id="3">The National Centre for Research and Development announced the results of the 3rd edition of GameINN programme.</seg>
<seg id="4">Among close to 30 projects supported by the NCBR, there were e.g. the developed platform for live action role-playing games based on the AR game engine creating the real-world map with the application enabling the users to send data, the test and training platform for verifying practical hands-on skills and professional development using VR and AR technologies, an innovative game stimulating management of real-life manufacturing processes using an innovative game model based on the interaction of the virtual world with the real one, with the 4.0 industry concept, as the NCBR release submitted to PAP on Friday reads.</seg>
<seg id="5">The GameINN sector programme is aimed at improving the competitiveness of the Polish sector of video game producers on the global market in the time horizon by 2023.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to NCBR, the Polish video game sector is growing 10 percent a year now.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the government statistics, the value of the Polish video game market by 2016 was PLN 1.85 billion while the prognosis for 2019 is 2.23 billion.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The dedicated GameINN research agenda and the support for entrepreneurs within this sector programme amounting to as much as PLN 300 million are an important stimulus for further dynamic growth of the Polish gamedev", the release reads.</seg>
<seg id="9">The video game sector is a perfect example of efficient use of the potential we have in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The incentives introduced by the government for the entrepreneurs promoting innovation, including reliefs for B+R, competence-development programmes, IP box or support programmes implemented by NCBR facilitate the innovative activity of companies and enable them to compete more effectively on the highly competitive market", says the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the release.</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of the Ministry of Science stresses the money for innovation does not go solely to the innovators in the form of project subsidies but also stays in their pockets, as the B+R relief was used by three fourths entrepreneurs more in 2018 than the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The value of the deducted costs concerning the B+R activity was PLN 1.7 billion which gave more than PLN 300 million savings for companies benefiting from that relief.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is equivalent to the support provided by NCBR in three editions of GameINN", the Deputy Prime Minister stresses.</seg>
<seg id="14">Director of the NCBR, Wojciech Kamieniecki reminds the subsidies of the total value of more than PLN 211.2 million were granted to 78 innovative projects in two previous competitions.</seg>
<seg id="15">The immense interest in the 3rd competition and the variety of the submitted applications prove the video game sector has ideas and competence to develop and improve its competitive advantage.</seg>
<seg id="16">"What is particularly great is the fact that the selected projects, just like during the previous editions, comprise projects concerning solutions used not only for entertainment, but also related to the 4.0 industry", he adds.</seg>
<seg id="17">During the third GameINN competition, the entities which could apply for the subsidy of up to PLN 20 million comprised entrepreneurs, consortiums of entrepreneurs and consortiums of entrepreneurs with scientific units.</seg>
<seg id="18">The NCBR received 87 applications for the total subsidy amount of ca. 317 million PLN.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the time of the competition announcement, its budget was 100 million PLN but was increased thanks to which 27 projects were granted close to PLN 105 million subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="20">The detailed information on the results of the 3rd GameINN edition is available at ncbr.gov.pl.</seg>
<seg id="21">The sector GameINN programme is carried out within the Operational Programme Intelligent Development.</seg>
<seg id="22">NCBR launched the programme in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs associated in Porozumienie Polskie Gry, composed of such companies as e.g. CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team or 11 bit studios.</seg>

<seg id="1">Lamine Diaby-Fadiga admitted stealing Kasper Dolberg’s watch</seg>
<seg id="2">The event took place on 16th September.</seg>
<seg id="3">Dolberg who had got from Ajax Amsterdam to Nice late August, found out after the training that his watch had got lost from the locker room.</seg>
<seg id="4">Not just an ordinary one, because it was worth 70 thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="5">The furious Dane did not appear at the training the following day explaining his absence by stomach problems.</seg>
<seg id="6">The case was mysterious from the very start.</seg>
<seg id="7">Football players are provided with private safes, and the club premises are monitored.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to AFP Diaby-Fadiga eventually owned up to the theft.</seg>
<seg id="9">The 18-year old has already apologised Doberg, remaining team members and coach Patric Vieira.</seg>
<seg id="10">He also promised to give back the money for the watch to the Dune.</seg>
<seg id="11">Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising young generation football players from France.</seg>
<seg id="12">To Nice he got at the age of thirteen to make a debut in the first team three years later.</seg>
<seg id="13">This season he played in seven matches.</seg>
<seg id="14">Recently he has signed a professional contract, but – according to "L'Equipe" newspaper report –the club will probably terminate it with immediate effect.</seg>
<seg id="15">By now it has begun disciplinary proceedings against the player.</seg>

<seg id="4">It is very important, especially at the moment, when autumn infections occur.</seg>

<seg id="8">When washing them, we should rub not only the palm and back of the hand but also fingertips (joined or each one individually) – rub them in circular motions against the second hand palm; the spaces between fingers (interlace hands, rub fingers against each other); thumbs – embrace each thumb with the second hand and rub it right and left for a moment.</seg>

<seg id="1">President of Iran says he refused the proposal of talks with the US, Donald Trump denies</seg>
<seg id="2">Tehran did not decide to enter into negotiations with the US during the UN General Assembly in New York even though the Americans offered to lift sanctions, said the president of Iran, Hasan Rowhani on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">US President Donald Trump said that it was Iran that requested to lift sanctions which was denied.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Iran president Hasan Rowhani the Americans suggested lifting all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for entering the negotiations about the new international agreement.</seg>
<seg id="5">It would refer to both the Iran nuclear program as well as the ballistic missile building program.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rowhani: Iran will not enter into negotiations under the tremendous pressure.</seg>
<seg id="7">President of Iran said he refused to enter into the negotiations because of the "toxic atmosphere".</seg>
<seg id="8">He said he met with US diplomats because he was talked into it by France, Germany and Great Britain.</seg>
<seg id="9">As he noted, Iran would engage in talks under the "tremendous pressure".</seg>
<seg id="10">"Even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in the 5+1 format, nobody can predict what the final outcome will be", said Rowhani.</seg>
<seg id="11">A day ago the Iran leader said he did not exclude the possibility of talks with the US and blamed the European parties of the nuclear agreement of being in favour of the American sanctions against Iran.</seg>
<seg id="12">He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran after the US decided to leave the nuclear agreement "are a preliminary condition that does not allow" to enter into a dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="13">If we are able to abandon this preliminary condition and if the US lift the sanctions and get rid of the tremendous pressure, then we can of course talk with the USA, he declared.</seg>
<seg id="14">He added that he did not exclude the possibility of meeting the US President Donald Trump even though he refused to talk with him this week during the UN General Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="15">Trump: "Iran asked, I said no".</seg>
<seg id="16">Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that it was him who refused the request from Iran.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them so that we can meet.</seg>
<seg id="18">Of course, I said no", tweeted the US President.</seg>
<seg id="19">Tension in terms of the nuclear agreement</seg>
<seg id="20">France, Germany and Great Britain are trying to alleviate the tensions between Washington and Tehran in order to save the agreement with Iran from 2015 they signed, at least to some extent.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to it in exchange for lifting the economic sanctions Iran would need to resign from the nuclear programme and let its nuclear sector be controlled by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).</seg>
<seg id="22">Since the USA left the agreement in May 2015 the other parties have often highlighted they wanted the agreement to remain in force.</seg>
<seg id="23">As for now all in vain.</seg>
<seg id="24">Washington has been putting a maximum pressure on Iran and the sanctions include full embargo on the Iran petroleum as well.</seg>
<seg id="25">Tehran declared that if they are not allowed to export it, it will restrict their obligations arising from the agreement every 60 days.</seg>

<seg id="1">A judge at the Voivevodship Administrative Court in Warsaw, and husband of the hater Emilia, who – based on her words and print screens from WhatsApp – took part in stalking the judges, was reinstated to rule by the Supreme Administrative Court on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="2">Reason: disciplinary proceeding against him was not initiated, so there is no base to uphold the President of the Voivevodship Administrative Court Wojciech Mazur’s ruling to exclude him from his duties.</seg>
<seg id="3">Judge Jerzy Chromicki, disciplinary spokesman for the Supreme Administrative Court, initiated an investigation procedure against Szmydt at the end of August, but till now it hasn’t turned into a proceeding against him.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is despite the fact that the Supreme Administrative Court, which in such situations acts as the disciplinary court, has to address the decision of the Voivevodship Administrative Court’s President within one month of its issuance.</seg>
<seg id="5">In such a situation, the judge, who publically spoke about his wife's mental problems in order to discredit her, was removed from the National Council of the Judiciary office due to the suspicion of his participation in the group of haters, will come back to ruling and pronounce sentences in the name of the Republic of Poland.</seg>
<seg id="6">Judge Szmydt denies his participation in the group of haters.</seg>
<seg id="7">He states that there is no evidence for this except for the forged print screens and accusations of his wife from whom he is divorcing.</seg>
<seg id="8">The rest of the judges associated with the "Caste" claim exactly the same everyone is innocent, there is no evidence.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is very probable that they will get it all their own way.</seg>
<seg id="10">The public prosecutor’s office didn’t lift a finger to secure evidence from their electronic storage media, it also didn’t say a word about Emilia Szmydt’s telephone content, which was seized in June as a part of another case.</seg>
<seg id="11">The police didn’t lift a finger to secure the devices of persons who were pointed out by Judge Waldemar Żurek as the stalkers in his February’s report.</seg>
<seg id="12">If there is no evidence – there is no Szmydt case, nor case of "Caste".</seg>
<seg id="13">There is no case of the Supreme Audit Office’s executive – Marian Banaś – over renting a tenement building to pimps and failing to disclose his incomes.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Central Anticorruption Bureau is checking his financial disclosures.</seg>
<seg id="15">It will be checked when it will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Deputies’ Ethics Committee will not handle the Banaś case because the Sejm is suspended (on the other hand the State Control Committee somehow convened to make a bizarre decision to dismiss Banaś’s deputies and appoint his lawyer, although the law does not provide for such an unlikely combination).</seg>
<seg id="17">The whole story reminds me of a film novella, probably an American one, when a wife comes home and finds her husband with his lover in bed.</seg>
<seg id="18">She is so astounded and devastated that she can’t say a word.</seg>
<seg id="19">While she stands speechless in a doorway, the lover quickly jumps out of bed, gets dressed and leaves.</seg>
<seg id="20">The husband makes the bed.</seg>
<seg id="21">When the wife regains her voice she shouts "what is it?</seg>
<seg id="22">Who’s that woman?".</seg>
<seg id="23">The husband calmly asks "what woman, darling?".</seg>
<seg id="24">It is just that the case of "Caste" or Banaś is a parody of the state.</seg>
<seg id="25">And it is not funny at all.</seg>

<seg id="7">"Only my closest family and politics is what keeps me alive" said Kornel Morawiecki in an interview he gave to Super Express journalists two weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="8">In January Super Express informed that 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki got to the Military Hospital in Wrocław for tests.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I noticed strange, alarming symptoms and went to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="10">It turned out that I had jaundice.</seg>
<seg id="11">But the worst was yet to come.</seg>
<seg id="12">When I underwent computed tomography scan I was diagnosed to have a pancreatic cancer..." said prime minister’s father.</seg>
<seg id="13">A few days later in the hospital of Ministry of Internal Affairs and Administration Kornel Morawiecki underwent serious surgery.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to Morawiecki, president Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain, priest Zbigniew Krasa.</seg>
<seg id="15">The surgery took about three hours and was successful.</seg>
<seg id="16">" I know that lots of people prayed for me, which I appreciate very much</seg>
<seg id="17">Fortunately I rather don’t have any metastases.</seg>
<seg id="18">I don’t know yet if I need to undergo chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="19">I am giving myself into the hands of specialist doctors who are rather optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the time being after the serious surgery I have to come back to some sort of "usable condition".</seg>
<seg id="21">I hope that all will be well" pointed out Kornel Moawiecki in January in a talk with "SE".</seg>
<seg id="22">"If I had undergone the tests too late, the situation now would be critical and I would have to shuffle off this mortal coil..." he added.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Jump Power in Oława.</seg>
<seg id="2">The title of the account of the amateur sports competition held at the hippodrome at Oleandry Street in Oława on Sunday afternoon on 15 September can be considered misleading.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is a long way to the true power but this is how one type of horse competition is named...</seg>
<seg id="4">The jump power competition consists in the jockey and the horse overcoming higher and higher obstacles which are as much as over two meters high during the most prestigious international competitions.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is worth adding here the long-term and still not broken world record, set in 1949 by Albert Larraguibela from Chile on his horse named "Huaso", is 247 cm.</seg>
<seg id="6">Obviously, nobody jumped that high in Oława but the result of the best local horsewomen of 135 cm is also not the worst...</seg>
<seg id="7">The competition organised by tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other activists of JKS "W siodle" were the show accompanying "Tęczowe zawody jeździeckie" we discuss in greater detail on page 22 of this issue, held there a bit earlier.</seg>
<seg id="8">The competition was joined by eight horsewomen who practice in the horse riding club in Oława.</seg>
<seg id="9">Four of them competed on ponies and four on large horses.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the first group, the best result was achieved by Nikola Szołdra on crazy "Sprinter".</seg>
<seg id="11">This small, but highly dynamic horse started from overcoming obstacles set at 40 cm and finished only at the vertical with the upper beam at 125 above the ground.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, it did not give up easily and was excluded from further participation by the jury only after it refused to overcome it thrice.</seg>
<seg id="13">The second place in pony jumps was taken by Amelia Pawlak on "Fama" and the third by Lena Boruń on "Harmider".</seg>
<seg id="14">The youngest tournament participant, Inga Aksman, who galloped and jumped over obstacles on a small mare called "Carmen", fought ambitiously.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even more emotions accompanied the horsewomen and spectators during the competition with large horses.</seg>
<seg id="16">Paulina Szewczyk on "Deklaracja" and Anastazja Abramenko on "Lotka" experienced falls which seemed dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="17">Luckily, neither the horsewomen nor the horses experienced anything else than minor contusions so they continued to compete.</seg>
<seg id="18">Weronika Łuczkiewicz had a lot of problems bringing her young mare "Wineta" to the course.</seg>
<seg id="19">What was required was the trainer’s assistance or another horse which was followed by slightly crazy "Wineta".</seg>
<seg id="20">After it overcame an obstacle, it left the course galloping at full speed so it was dangerous in the stalls and in the horse relaxation hall at times. "Everything is in hand!", Jan Sienkiewicz reassured the spectators, especially the youngest, who were a bit frightened with that.</seg>
<seg id="21">Marta Masalska on beautiful "Whisky" did great from the very start of the large horse competition.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Whisky", a stately mare, and her experienced rider, were the first to jump over 135 cm at the second go at the final stage and that was the best competition result at the time.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a while, however, also Paulina Szewczyk on "Deklaracja", Weronika Łuczkiewicz on "Wineta" and Anastazja Abramenko on "Lotka" achieved that height.</seg>
<seg id="24">This meant all competitors came together for the decoration and collection of prizes in the form of horse riding equipment and eventually, together with the pony riding girls, they had an eye-catchy victory lap to the march by Radecky, ending those interesting and thrilling competition.</seg>

<seg id="2">KWW Patriotyczna Rewolucja Maxa Kolonko is a name of an election campaign committee used by #R Revolution Mariusza Maxa Kolonki political formation that was supposed to enter the October parliamentary election.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rewolucja addressed his offer especially to the young right-wing electorate.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before election Kolonko announced cooperation with Marek Jakubik or Paweł Kukiz, no such coalition was established and KWW Patriotyczna Rewolucja Maxa Kolonko did not manage to collect a sufficient number of signatures to set an electoral roll in any constituency in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now Kolonko has informed on Twitter that he finished cooperation with KWW Patriotyczna Rewolucja Maxa Kolonko.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I will be expecting KWW to remove my surname from its name.</seg>
<seg id="7">Please do not link me with the above-mentioned entity", added and announced to provide more information soon.</seg>
<seg id="8">For the time being it is not known whether the journalist would continue his actions, or if it is the end of the #R Rewolucja formation.</seg>
<seg id="9">On 4th July, the American Independence Day, the journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko residing in USA informed about establishing a new political formation – #R Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="10">In recent years Kolonko has become famous for running a Max TV channel on YouTube, where he comments events in Poland and worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="11">"We are fed up with politicians, fed up with their proud tricks, fed up with all their amateur rules.</seg>
<seg id="12">It’s time for People to take over the rule in the state and rule for the benefit of People", Kolonko kept saying then.</seg>
<seg id="13">The party programme includes matters related to the courts (judges should be elected in general election), tax changes (equalising tax free allowance for all people), war reparations (in the form of military assistance for NATO’S Eastern flank countries, with paying special attention to Poland), having a referendum on the possession of firearms, limiting the number of members of parliament or introducing a single-member constituencies.</seg>
<seg id="14">A few days after announcing the establishment of a the new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko started talks with Marek Jakubik.</seg>
<seg id="15">Late July Kolonko posted on his social media profile information suggesting that #R is going to join forces with Kukiz'15 movement.</seg>

<seg id="2">"The FX rate for euro will stay near the ceiling of PLN 4.35 in the months to come which will be accompanied by poor economic situation on global markets",Michael Bolliger from UBS Wealth Management announces.</seg>
<seg id="3">"The expected continued solid economic growth rate and stable monetary policy support the stabilisation of PLN rates at the current level", says the specialist in the interview with Bankier.pl.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to him, despite a clear inflation pressure, the Monetary Policy Council is not going to increase the rates when the majority of central banks relaxes their policy.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Even though PLN is valued correctly, as the euro rates should stay near the ceiling of PLN 4.35 in the months to come, the Polish bonds are rather unattractive in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="6">The bonds from the emerging markets offer much better yields than the Polish securities", Michael Bolliger, head of assets’ allocation to emerging markets in UBS Wealth Management, estimates.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the specialist, the major hazard for the Polish economy is the deteriorated economic situation globally.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Although global slowdown is likely to deepen, there should not be any serious crisis, but only the reduced dynamics of GDP slightly below zero", Michael Bolliger declares.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The investors should underestimate the global shares which may suffer from the absence of any perspectives of solving the trade conflict between the U.S. and China as well as other geopolitical risk factors, including the impeachment of Donald Trump and Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="10">Europe should display relatively the weakest behaviour among share markets", as stems from the latest letter to investor by the General Manager of UBS Wealth Management, Mark Haefele.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Shares from euro zone countries should behave worse than the American ones as they are more susceptible in the conditions of increased uncertainty around the global trade and fears of slowdown", says the document.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to Michael Bolliger, after the boom on the bond markets of the safest countries pushed the yields of the German 10-year bonds even to minus 0.74 per cent, the reduced yield is still likely to deepen.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, in a longer time horizon, the fall should not affect the yield of long-term securities but only of the short-term ones thanks to the relaxed monetary policy of banks.</seg>
<seg id="14">Fed has the largest scope for reducing the rates which should lead to weakening the American currency in the horizon of the next years.</seg>
<seg id="15">A long-term balance point for euro rates is the ceiling of USD 1.29 which would mean a 19-per cent potential of strengthening the common currency when compared to USD.</seg>
<seg id="16">We expect further reductions of Fed rates which will result in reduced differences in the monetary policy worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The current accounts and budget deficits may prevent keeping the strong USD in the long term", says Michael Bolliger.</seg>

<seg id="2">A confidential report by German Federal Ministry of Defence</seg>
<seg id="3">Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehr has recorded the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 weapon parts and 19,445 rounds of ammunition, according to a confidential report prepared at the German Federal Ministry of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="4">This information was revealed by the press controlled by the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND) media group.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to a document from the parliamentary office of Secretary of State at the Ministry of Defence, Peter Tauber (CDU), so far two weapons, one weapon part and 3,474 pieces of ammunition have been traced.</seg>
<seg id="6">The military equipment still missing includes six MG3 general-purpose machine guns, 11 G3 assault rifles, four G36 lightweight assault rifles, six flare pistols and two P8 guns.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, 30 MG3 machine gun barrels are missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">Vice-chairman of the Left Party, Martina Renner, expressed her concern about the situation.</seg>
<seg id="9">As she told RND journalists, the number of missing weapons and ammunition rounds is "appalling".</seg>
<seg id="10">All the more so because the conducted investigations led to retrieving only a small part of the missing equipment.</seg>
<seg id="11">Martina Renner summarised the effects of these actions as a "miserable result".</seg>
<seg id="12">She also criticised the fact that the report does not indicate whether it contains any of the weapons found during the investigation conducted against Bundeswehr Lieutenant Franco A. In December 2017, the federal prosecutor’s office in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence bringing threat to national security and violating the provisions of the act on regulating access to firearms.</seg>
<seg id="13">The officer was accused of planning the assassinations of leading German politicians out of far-right and racist reasons.</seg>
<seg id="14">His "blacklist" of targets, which the prosecutor’s office got its hands on, included the then Minister of Justice Heiko Maas of SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green Party and Anetta Kahane, defender of human rights and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung foundation in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="15">Franco A. illegally came into possession of four pieces of firearm, over 1,000 pieces of ammunition and over 50 explosives.</seg>

<seg id="2">How to avoid them?</seg>
<seg id="3">There is a solution.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Japan Airlines carrier has recently begun to use the function developed for persons for whom travelling with a crying child is a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="5">On the website the airlines provide the opportunity to check the arrangement of seats on the plane.</seg>
<seg id="6">If a minor up to two years of age travels on a specific flight, the "baby icon" appears on a specific seat, reserved by parents or guardians.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thus a person taking advantage of carrier’s services has an opportunity to choose a seat far away from the one occupied by the baby.</seg>
<seg id="8">BBC reports that the lines have already informed about the imperfections of that solution.</seg>
<seg id="9">The "baby icon" will not appear when the ticket has been booked by a third party or the plane is changed at the last moment.</seg>
<seg id="10">As one could expect, the idea has divided the Internet users.</seg>
<seg id="11">Part of the Twitter users indicates that the problem of travelling with crying babies could be solved by using noise-cancelling headphones.</seg>
<seg id="12">They are children, we also used to be them.</seg>
<seg id="13">"We have to learn tolerance, because we will soon need a map of passengers breathing with mouth, salivating or drunkards", wrote user G Sundar.</seg>
<seg id="14">Another Internet user noticed that he used to be disturbed by crying babies, but he changed his mind when he became parent himself.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is also no shortage of supporters of the solution introduced by Japan Airlines.</seg>

<seg id="2">More than 25 thousand foreign tourists will not come for holiday to Majorca in October as a result of the bankruptcy announced by Thomas Cook Travel Agency on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="3">As informed by the representative of the autonomous government of the Balearic Islands on Friday, Marc Pons, the group of 25 thousand of holiday-makers who will not be able to have their holidays on Majorca in October includes also the ones who were to travel with companies connected with Thomas Cook indirectly, e.g. Neckermann.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pons explained that 80 percent of expected holiday-makers who had to resign from their holidays on Majorca next month because of the British company bankruptcy are the nationals of Germany and Scandinavian countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, according to Pons, the losses for the local economy will be smaller as Thomas Cook did not send tourist to one of the Balearic Islands in November–April.</seg>
<seg id="6">He disclosed the government of the Balearic Islands has already started negotiations with international operators concerning "entering the market of Majorca" following the bankruptcy of the British tour operator.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the estimates of Diario de Mallorca daily, more than 1,000 people are going to lose their job because of the tourist crisis in Majorca in October.</seg>
<seg id="8">About 800 of them are the dismissed employees of Thomas Cook agency in Palma.</seg>
<seg id="9">The other people are going to lose their job mainly in the hotel sector.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Monday, when Thomas Cook announced its bankruptcy, many hotel owners in Majorca requested their visitors to pay an extra charge for the room.</seg>
<seg id="11">This situation was experienced e.g. by several dozens tourists from Poland.</seg>
<seg id="12">The government of the Balearic Islands estimates that by Thursday several dozens hotels in Majorca suspended their operations at least till the end of October in relation to the announcement of the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook and companies cooperating with it.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Friday edition of Diario de Ibiza daily indicates that most hotels in Ibiza which cooperated with Thomas Cook group do not intend to close their facilities in the week to come.</seg>
<seg id="14">The daily reminds the British bankrupt cooperated with 42 hotels on this Balearic Island.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Wednesday, the autonomous authorities of the Balearic Islands announced they were going to ask the Spanish government to provide a subsidy of EUR 100 million to the region to cover the losses caused by the bankruptcy announced by Thomas Cook Travel Agency.</seg>
<seg id="16">They disclosed the most harmed tourists in this archipelago, ca. 36 thousand people, stay on Majorca.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the data of the Balearic Islands government, Thomas Cook is EUR 5 million in arrears with respect to the local tour operators for the performance of agreements in the period of July to September 2019.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Effects of the Clean Air programme are negligible, and coal stoves will smoke this winter as if nothing happened," we read on the cover of today’s Rzeczpospolita.</seg>
<seg id="3">"To date, 82k applications worth PLN 2 billion have been submitted under the Clean Air programme, of which 48k received positive decisions.</seg>
<seg id="4">The approved applications amount to over PLN 915 million in total," Rz reports, citing data from the Ministry of Environment spokesperson.</seg>

<seg id="3">The U.S. Congress has given consent to selling 32 cutting-edge F-35 planes to Poland.</seg>
<seg id="4">"This is one of the last steps before concluding a contract, however it does not finish our efforts" wrote Mariusz Błaszczak on Twitter.</seg>

<seg id="7">The Polish Air Force will be provided eventually with 32 F-35 Lightning II fighters produced by Lockheed Martin corporation.</seg>
<seg id="8">In mid-September the Department of State gave consent to selling them to Poland.</seg>
<seg id="9">The statement emphasised that the investment would support national security and the foreign policy of the United States by improving the safety of a NATO ally being an important player to provide political stability in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to information provided by the Department of State, Poland is supposed to pay 6.5 billion dollars for the combat aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is not the final price though.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Department of State stressed that the contract would also include the delivery of spare and repair parts, training equipment, providing engineering, logistic and HR services, as well as related logistics, programme support components and staff training.</seg>
<seg id="13">Lockheed Martin F-35 fighters</seg>
<seg id="14">The F-35 Lightning II fighter manufactured by the Lockheed Martin corporation is a single-seat, single-engine, multi-role fifth generation combat aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="15">The plane can be used to provide close support missions, bombing and typically air fighting tasks.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thanks to the use of stealth technology the fighter is undetectable to short-range radars.</seg>
<seg id="17">Recently Belgium has bought the F-35 fighters as part of the contract worth 4.55 billion dollars.</seg>

<seg id="12">Typical gender characteristics are no longer emphasised – the gender dolls no longer have full lips, long eyelashes, slim waists or, in Ken’s case, broad shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="13">The company believes that children do not like it when gender norms are imposed on their dolls, while some parents and feminists are convinced that dolls made with a specific gender in mind hamper the ambitions of girls and reinforce traditional stereotypes.</seg>
<seg id="14">"The new dolls will give all children the sense of freedom," Mattel argues.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Barbie doll, first launched in 1959 in a swimsuit and high heels, has often been criticised in the past for promoting "unhealthy female stereotypes", such as unnatural body proportions.</seg>

<seg id="2">Zandberg, asked in Radio ZET how many candidates of his party can get to the Sejm from the leftist parties (KW SLD, whose lists comprise the candidates from SLD, Wiosna and Lewica Razem, with a common logo of the "Left Wing"), replied this depended on the election committee’s result.</seg>
<seg id="3">"I believe the Left Wing result will be very good as we feel people hope for the fact that the Left Wing is not only right, but also powerful", he emphasized.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Zandberg, this means the Left Wing may have 60–80 MPs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"This may mean the Razem group or club has more than ten MPs.</seg>
<seg id="6">But this depends on Polish women and men.</seg>
<seg id="7">I am not going to guess and say how it is going to happen", he said.</seg>
<seg id="8">When asked if Lewica Razem was going to have a separate group, Zandberg said: "We agreed we are different and are not going to pretend this difference does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="9">I think Poles rewarded that difference as we showed we can agree a common programme despite of those differences".</seg>
<seg id="10">Asked if the major beneficiary of the common start is the SLD Leader, Włodzimierz Czarzasty, Zandberg replied he believed the major beneficiaries were the Center-left and Leftist electors.</seg>
<seg id="11">In response to the comment that SLD would get the whole grant, he said "the political party’s objective is to represent its electors".</seg>
<seg id="12">Zandberg admitted he was going to vote for himself during the Sejm elections.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the case of the Senate elections, he emphasized he was not sure.</seg>

<seg id="15">"However, I will tell very honestly and clearly that if I were in the Senate district no. 44, I would take an election certificate and vote in another district", the politician stressed.</seg>

<seg id="2">On Friday, tens of thousands of people from across Senegal gathered in the capital city for the inauguration of a huge mosque, considered to be the largest in West Africa.</seg>
<seg id="3">Muslims arrived by bus, car or on foot in the district of Bopp, home to the new mosque, capable of hosting 30,000 worshippers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The facility has been built by the Mouride Brotherhood, part of the Sufi strand of Islam that dominates in Senegal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Work on the mosque began ten years ago on a swampy six-hectare area of land donated by the government.</seg>
<seg id="6">The mosque’s name of Massalikul Jinan ("The Paths to Paradise") comes from the title of a poem by Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the 19th-century founder of the brotherhood, who is revered by followers as a saint.</seg>
<seg id="7">The mosque has a Carrara marble exterior and five minarets.</seg>
<seg id="8">The tallest is 78 meters high.</seg>
<seg id="9">The mosque has a capacity of 15 thousand worshippers inside, and another 15 thousand on the exterior esplanade.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the lavishly finished interiors one can marvel over a gold-plated dome, giant chandeliers and decorations hand made by Moroccan workers.</seg>
<seg id="11">The builders say the mosque is the biggest in West Africa, although the edifice cannot be compared to mosques in other regions.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Morocco, the Hassan II mosque in Casablanca can accommodate 105,000 worshippers.</seg>
<seg id="13">The construction of the mosque, which cost more than 30 million euros was funded by private donations.</seg>
<seg id="14">The government, in addition to providing the land, contributed lighting, sanitary facilities, and roadworks worth 10.5 million euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Coach Smyła: Our problem is not Śląsk, only ourselves</seg>
<seg id="2">Korona’s players will try to stop a bad streak of eight winless league matches on Friday, during a meeting with the Ekstraklasa’s second placed team – Śląsk.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Our problem is not the players from Wrocław, only ourselves, we have to work on the way we play," emphasised Mirosław Smyła, coach of the Kielce team.</seg>
<seg id="4">The last, and so far only victory in the league that Korona’s players recorded in the first round came when they defeated an expansion team Raków Częstochowa 1–0.</seg>
<seg id="5">Later on, the Kielce team recorded two ties and six losses, and on Tuesday they lost their match with Zagłębie Lubin 0–1 in the round of 32 of the Polish Cup.</seg>
<seg id="6">"It makes me optimistic that in the last seconds of the cup match, the players fought for a goal, they wanted to draw.</seg>
<seg id="7">Their fall on the turf after the last whistle was not due to an emotional crisis, it just showed their anger as they were so close," said Smyła.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he pointed out, Śląsk has very strong wingers, that is why he will remind the team to play with width on the field.</seg>
<seg id="9">"We are aware of the quality of our opponent, but we also look at how we want to play," the coach added.</seg>
<seg id="10">For Friday’s match, Korona’s team for sure won’t see Ognjen Gnjatic who is banned for too many yellow cards, nor Jakub Żubrowski, and Michael Gardawski who are injured.</seg>
<seg id="11">It was encouraging that a few players were willing to play during the cup match.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We have a headache, recently it had seemed like we wouldn’t have it, but we have it now," Smyła stated.</seg>
<seg id="13">Korona's defender, Daniel Dziwniel, pointed out that whilst Śląsk would not be an easy rival against which to halt their streak of eight winless league matches in a row, however, in the Ekstraklasa, anyone can beat anyone.</seg>
<seg id="14">"We are a good team.</seg>
<seg id="15">In recent weeks, we may have not shown it on the field, but that time will come when we will start winning, and we believe that it will be on Friday," the player said.</seg>
<seg id="16">After nine rounds of the Ekstraklasa, Korona has five points and is in 15th place.</seg>
<seg id="17">Śląsk has 12 more points and ranks second.</seg>
<seg id="18">The match will start at 8:30 p.m. on Friday in Kielce.</seg>

<seg id="1">These trees could totally disappear from Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">"42% of European tree species are considered threatened," warns the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in "The European Red List of Trees" published on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Chestnut, and mountain-ash trees are at the top of the list.</seg>
<seg id="4">IUCN, an organisation seated in Gland in Switzerland, has published the list of endangered European trees species for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was drawn up by experts, whose research established that of the 454 tree species in Europe (as well as elsewhere in the world), 42% have "a high risk of extinction".</seg>
<seg id="6">According to The Red List, the reasons for this are the rapid expansion of urban agglomerations and global climate change.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, the most endangered trees and shrubs are those found only or mainly on our continent.</seg>
<seg id="8">When it comes to the typical European forest, according to the IUCN experts, 58% of species are endangered, and 15%, i.e. 66 tree and shrub species are at risk of extinction.</seg>
<seg id="9">The main reasons for deforestation stated in The Red List are over-exploitation, accelerated urbanisation and hyper intensified forest clearing, but also forest fires and changes in the European ecosystem.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the report’s authors, the existence of many European varieties of shrubs, moss, and lichen are under a high degree of threat.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The impact of human-led activities is resulting in population decline and a heightened risk of extinction across Europe of important species that are undervalued and form the backbone of Europe’s ecosystems and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, Director of IUCN’s European Regional Office, summarising the report.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grzegorz Schetyna: I will not promise 600+</seg>
<seg id="2">"Today PiS is trying to bribe Poles by offering them a free-for-all on credit that will have to repaid by future generations," says Grzegorz Schetyna in an interview for Rzeczpospolita.</seg>
<seg id="3">In his opinion, "all of PiS politics is fakery".</seg>
<seg id="4">At the same time, the politician promises that "what is given will not be taken away."</seg>
<seg id="5">In his interview with Jacek Nizinkiewicz, Schetyna assures that he knows how to defeat the Law and Justice party.</seg>
<seg id="6">The key is to mobilise the electorate at the ballots.</seg>
<seg id="7">He believes that the opposition has more potential in this respect than Kaczyński’s party.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today, the number of aware people who want to live in a normal country outgrows the number of supporters of PiS which, as a party, has betrayed the values it preaches, such as modesty, humility and transparency," argues Schetyna.</seg>
<seg id="9">The leader of the Civic Coalition and chairman of the Civic Platform also highlighted the basic points of the KO election programme.</seg>
<seg id="10">"First of all, nothing which is given will be taken away, but we need to set a clear course for the future, because PiS is focused only on the present; there is no plan for Poland, which is obvious taken the drastically low investments," he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Secondly, it is about "setting the Poles’ energy in motion, helping and investing in those who work hard and those who are entrepreneurial."</seg>
<seg id="12">Schetyna explains that one of the projects in the KO programme will put PLN 614 more into the hands of Poles earning the least money and also a few hundred more into those of the higher earners as well.</seg>
<seg id="13">The politician also noted that he did not want to compete for who hands out the most.</seg>
<seg id="14">He said he would do everything in his power, but he will not promise 600+.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I will never agree to the Greek variant, where those in power went to war with the opposition bidding who would hand out more money, which eventually led to the financial collapse of the country," he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="16">In his interview for Rz Schetyna also said that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate him and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We would expose their hypocrisy and propaganda," he argued.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Pride comes before a fall.</seg>
<seg id="19">Kaczyński is just as much a statesman as Banaś is a crystal-clear person," he added.</seg>
<seg id="20">The PO leader also said that he is yet to decide whether or not he will run for the presidency of Platforma.</seg>

<seg id="3">According to experts, human activity has contributed to their deaths.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Andean condors were probably poisoned by agents for killing predators such as pumas, foxes, and wild dogs.</seg>
<seg id="5">The animals could have eaten a toxic carcass.</seg>
<seg id="6">All but one of the dead condors were adult individuals.</seg>
<seg id="7">"This is a big loss for the environment as it takes 10 to 15 years for a condor to become fertile and ready to breed.</seg>

<seg id="2">Works have been initiated to award the head of the state with a precious chain.</seg>
<seg id="3">The idea was approved by Andrzej Duda’s office, we read in Rzeczpospolita.</seg>
<seg id="4">As explained by the daily, it is a chain of the Order of the White Eagle, a royal insignia officially referred to as the jewel of the Republic of Poland in the interwar period.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was last used probably by President Ignacy Mościcki.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rz reports that such chain might be placed on Andrzej Duda’s shoulders soon.</seg>
<seg id="7">On Wednesday, the Senate Committee for Human Rights, Rule of Law and Petitions passed the motion to start work on amending the Orders and Decorations Act in order to restore it.</seg>
<seg id="8">The daily reports this is not the first attempt at restoring this chain to the head of the state.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Senate voted on such an amendment already in 1992, but it fell through due to one vote.</seg>
<seg id="10">This time the works are lightning fast.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the beginning of August, senators spent a few minutes on this issue concluding that they would ask the opinion of the President’s office.</seg>
<seg id="12">It came in mid September.</seg>

<seg id="2">The police action will be organized e.g. at the crossroad of al. Cieplińskiego and al. Piłsudskiego.</seg>
<seg id="3">The project can be attributed to the recent complaints of the city authorities about the drivers who cannot properly behave at a crossroad.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Friday, 27th of September policemen will launch preventive measurements under the name "Przejezdne skrzyżowania" in Rzeszów.</seg>
<seg id="5">They aim to eliminate traffic problems: entering the crossroad without being able to exit it, disregarding light signals or road signs.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We often think we are alone at the crossroad and the truth is we make life harder for other drivers", said Marek Ustrobiński, vice-president of Rzeszów a few days ago.</seg>

<seg id="9">This issue was somehow taken over by Rzeszów police officers who are starting the action "Przejezdne skrzyżowania" today.</seg>
<seg id="10">What is it about?</seg>
<seg id="11">The aim of those measurements is to eliminate impeding the traffic flow at crossroads by the drivers who enter them without the possibility to continue driving.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is a frequent offence leading to larger traffic problems and traffic jams.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who do it can get a fine of PLN 300 and 2 penalty points.</seg>
<seg id="14">Police officers will also pay attention to disregarding traffic lights or road signs and inappropriate parking near the crossroads.</seg>
<seg id="15">They are also going to focus on missing traffic flow, late start at the traffic lights, slow ride at the crossroads and too large distances between the vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="16">At which crossroads will those measures be taken?</seg>

<seg id="2">The Senate passed the act on disclosure of assets belonging to the families of key state officials and on the flights of key state officials without any amendments.</seg>
<seg id="3">52 senators voted in favour of the amendment of the act on assets belonging to family members of state officials, with 14 voting against and three abstaining from voting.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thus, the senators decided to reject the 12 amendments submitted by PO senator Sławomir Rybicki during Wednesday’s debate.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to him, the amendments were supposed to "civilise" the law and limit the scope of information given in statements of financial assets by an official's own children, their spouse’s children and adopted children to cases in which children are members of the same household as the person obligated to submit such statement.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Act on the transparency of assets belonging to family members of key state officials, whose bill was drafted in the prime minister’s office, was passed by the Sejm on September 11.</seg>
<seg id="7">The provisions assume that the prime minister, ministers, MPs, MEPs, senators, presidents of the Constitutional Tribunal, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as persons in charge of other state institutions will be obliged to include information on the personal assets of their spouses, children and members of the same household in their assets declaration.</seg>

<seg id="11">55 senators voted in favour of the act in its unamended form; 12 senators were against and four abstained.</seg>
<seg id="12">Under the act, each presidential flight will be considered as "conducted as part of an official mission".</seg>
<seg id="13">The president's family members and other guests invited by the president will be able to accompany them on flights.</seg>
<seg id="14">Meanwhile, in the case of the prime minister and speakers of the Sejm and Senate only a flight "undertaken for the purpose of fulfilling duties related to their held positions" will be considered an official mission.</seg>
<seg id="15">The act also specifies the list of persons who may accompany key state officials during a flight.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the regulations, members of delegations, i.e. invited MPs, senators, representatives of public authorities and experts, persons providing technical, medical or organisational support, as well as journalists, may be on board the plane.</seg>
<seg id="17">Under the act, in case of doubts related to the flights of the speakers of the Sejm and Senate, the head of the prime minister’s chancellery will ask for suitable clarification.</seg>
<seg id="18">If such doubts are not clarified within the prescribed time limit, the head of the prime minister’s chancellery will be obligated to notify the heads of the Sejm or Senate chancelleries of the impossibility of organising such a flight.</seg>

<seg id="2">On Friday, the Polish volleyball team had their first training session in Paris, where on Saturday they will play in the bronze medal match.</seg>
<seg id="3">The path to the title was blocked for Vital Heynen’s charges owing to their 1-3 defeat on Thursday against the Slovenians in Ljubljana.</seg>
<seg id="4">There have been a lot of media reports about their troubles travelling to this clash.</seg>
<seg id="5">This time, there were no such problems – on Friday morning they used a charter and went with the Slovenians to Paris and a few hours later they took training in the famous Bercy Arena.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to onlookers, the World Champions’ coach appeared flustered.</seg>
<seg id="7">As Heynen’s assistant Michał Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main purpose of training was not just about practising volleyball techniques.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We went to the arena but it was mostly about providing time for the team.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was about spending that time together rather than training.</seg>
<seg id="10">To talk and think about how we will rebuild it all as a team," he reported.</seg>
<seg id="11">He confirmed that the semi-final defeat was a hard lesson for both players and coaching staff.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We were brutally brought down to earth.</seg>
<seg id="13">We’re disappointed, there’s no doubt about it.</seg>
<seg id="14">We still believed we would go back to that match.</seg>
<seg id="15">We discussed the match amongst the staff, and the coach talked a lot with the players.</seg>
<seg id="16">I would suggest that the two main reasons for our defeat were the ineffectiveness of the attack line and coping with situational balls much poorer than usual.</seg>
<seg id="17">In this respect, the Slovenians were much better than us," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">In his view, the White and Reds had not been under stress due to being up against the tournament co-host, in front of a large, noisy support.</seg>
<seg id="19">He admitted that the smooth path to the semi-finals could have allowed the World Champions’ to let their guard down.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Probably, if we had been defeated in a similar way in the group phase, we would have learnt that lesson quicker, and later on we would have played differently in the later stages of the tournament.</seg>
<seg id="21">But these are what-ifs," he reserved.</seg>
<seg id="22">Gogol hopes that anger due to Thursday’s defeat will morph into aggression during the Bronze medal match.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I hope we will show our true colours then.</seg>
<seg id="24">The stakes are high.</seg>
<seg id="25">The last time we won the medal during the European Championship was back in 2011," he recalled.</seg>
<seg id="26">Paris is the fifth city, and France the third country visited by the Poles during this championship.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the group phase they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, then went to Apeldoorn for the first two meetings of the group phase, before moving on to Ljubljana for the semi-final.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Australian tennis player was given a 16-week ban – suspended for six months – and a fine of 25,000 dollars for the use of reprehensible words, gestures and deeds during the last ATP tournament.</seg>
<seg id="3">ATP World Tour members have lost patience for Kyrgios, but they will give him a chance to improve.</seg>
<seg id="4">The summary of transgressions given against one of the most controversial professional tennis players of recent years reads menacingly – a 16-week ban and a substantial fine, with both having been suspended for six months – a probation period during which the recalcitrant athlete can improve his behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nick Kyrgios is just 24 years old but he has been courting controversy for a very long time, beating a tennis world record by having had to pay the highest single financial penalty in the history of the sport for breaking rules of conduct both on and off the court.</seg>
<seg id="6">Loud swearing, strange gestures, unsportsmanlike conduct, insulting a judge and the audience, breaking two rackets during a defeat against Karen Khachanov – all rule breaches for which he paid 113,000 dollars following August’s ATP Masters 1000 tournaments in Cincinnati.</seg>
<seg id="7">Despite an early exit at the 2019 US Open, he still had time to state publicly that ATP members "are corrupt", which offended the organisation so much that they implemented a weeks-long disciplinary investigation into Kyrgios, which later issued a suspension and another fine.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, after hearing from the accused and being provided with the context around the statement, the words were forgiven.</seg>
<seg id="9">In a statement, tennis officials claimed that the investigation showed that Kyrgios’ behaviour in the past 12 months was in many cases highly questionable and was in almost constant violation of the rules; he continuously vulgarly insulted people associated with tournaments and spectators, hence the high penalty.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately postponed execution of the sentence, ordering him to meet several conditions during the following six months: during the ATP Tour, and ATP Challenge Tour tournaments Kyrgios may no longer in any way violate the professional tennis players’ code of conduct, particularly he may not swear, destroy rackets, quarrel with judges or the audience, or otherwise behave obscenely or vulgarly.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was also advised to seek "continuous support" from mental coaches during tournaments but also to consult in the off-season with experts specialising in solving the problems of athletes who can’t cope with their behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nick Kyrgios’s first comment (in the social media) on the verdict was as follows: "Hi everybody, I can still play.</seg>
<seg id="13">I just have to control my behaviour, that's all".</seg>
<seg id="14">In practice, the Australian will have at least a two-week break, because during The Laver Cup he exacerbated a shoulder injury which forced him to withdraw from ties in Beijing (from 30 September to 6 October) and in Shanghai (from 6 to 13 October).</seg>
<seg id="15">Kyrgios is in 27th place in the ATP rankings.</seg>
<seg id="16">This year, he won two tournaments: in Washington and Acapulco, earning more than 1.3 M dollars, so even after paying fines, he will have a lot left.</seg>

<seg id="1">Central Statistical Office: level of life in Poland constantly rising</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the report on the household budget that was published by the Central Statistical Office on Friday, as many as 44 percent of households regard their financial situation as good or rather good.</seg>
<seg id="3">A year ago it was 37,2 percent, in 2016 33,5 percent and earlier, from 2009 onwards, when the statistical office first conducted a survey on the subjective evaluation of the situation in the households it was never higher than 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="4">Last year 8,1 percent of households regarded their financial situation as bad or rather bad, in comparison to 11,2 percent a year before and more than 20 percent in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is freelancers who have the best financial situation.</seg>
<seg id="6">More than 70 percent of survey participants perceive it as good or rather good.</seg>
<seg id="7">As opposed to that only 18 percent of pensioners responded in this manner.</seg>
<seg id="8">The subjective evaluation of the financial situation is merely influenced by the number of children.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is lone parents who are living in harsh conditions, 32 percent of them perceive their financial situation as good or rather good.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among the pairs with children this number is, depending on the number of kids, between 55 and 60 percent, in case of households without children it amounts to 48,8 percent.</seg>
<seg id="11">The effect of the 500+ programme is merely reflected in those statistics.</seg>
<seg id="12">Before it was started (in 2016) it was lonely parents and large families (with the minimum of three children) who perceived their financial situation as the worst.</seg>
<seg id="13">Improving the subjective evaluation of the financial situation of Poles can be attributed to the quick growth of incomes, chiefly from work.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is, however, not everything, because the number of households that perceive their situation as good is growing faster than real incomes.</seg>
<seg id="15">What is more, on the level of voivodeships there is no exact correlation between the level of income and the evaluation of the financial situation in households.</seg>
<seg id="16">The citizens of the Opole voivodeship are the most satisfied, 48,9 percent of the survey recipients think their situation is good or rather good.</seg>
<seg id="17">The citizens of the Lubuskie voivodeship (47,7 percent) are next, followed by the Silesian voivodeship (47,6 percent), Masovia voivodeship (47,3 percent) and the Western Pomerania voivodeship (47,1 percent).</seg>
<seg id="18">In the Opole voivodeship the disposable income (after paying taxes and contributions) amounted last year to nearly 94 percent of the average country income, and in the Lubuskie voivodeship to 98 percent.</seg>
<seg id="19">The citizens of the Masovia voivodeship (120 percent of the average country income) and the Silesia voivodeship (104 percent) were the ones with the highest income.</seg>
<seg id="20">In 2018 the average disposable income per person amounted to 1693 PLN.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the real context (after considering the price change) it grew by 4,3 percent as compared to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="22">In comparison to the earlier years it was quite a low result.</seg>
<seg id="23">In 2016 the income per person grew by 7 percent and one year later by 6,3 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24">Even though the growth of incomes is slowing down, it is also the growth of spendings that is decelerating.</seg>
<seg id="25">Last year they amounted to 1187 zł per capita, so they decreased by 0,7 percent in a real context.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is the first such a case from 2013.</seg>
<seg id="27">In 2017 the spendings per person grew realistically by 1,9 per cent and in 2016 by 4,3 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="28">As the surveys on the household budget suggest, an average household is currently spending 70,1 percent of their disposable incomes. In 2014 this contribution was more than 80 percent and until 2006 more than 90 percent.</seg>

<seg id="1">Niesiołowski critically about the Pope.</seg>
<seg id="2">John Paul II didn't do anything</seg>
<seg id="3">In a talk with Piotr Lekszycki Stefan Niesiołowski emphasised that in 1981 John Paul II was a huge authority for opposition activists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Any sentence of his was actually accepted".</seg>
<seg id="5">Later criticism of some of his actions was to appear.</seg>
<seg id="6">"For me the fact that John Paul II was unable to get rid of the harmful Rydzyk’s activity seriously overshadowed his pontificate.</seg>
<seg id="7">After all, this redemptorist – a pest devastating the Church and Poland – developed his media in full swing already when the Polish Pope was alive," he kept explaining.</seg>
<seg id="8">The former PO politician admitted: "there were some murmurs of discontent, the pope said something, he did not receive Rydzyk once, but was in authority and could have just thrown him out of the Church or sent him to a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor.</seg>
<seg id="9">Unfortunately, John Paul II did not do that, his successors likewise" explained Niesiołowski.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Besides, there came the disastrous case of paedophilia and the Church operations or their lack, actually.</seg>
<seg id="11">I looked ahead a bit, but I wanted to attract attention to the whole profile of his life.</seg>
<seg id="12">About the scale of paedophilia in the Church we have found out relatively recently.</seg>
<seg id="13">A question is: how is it possible that John Paul II, being head of the Church, did not know about those disgusting practices" says Niesiołowski in his talk with a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the opinion of former PO politician the Church is a PiS ally.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It should be admitted that in the Solidarity era the Church was our most important ally.</seg>
<seg id="16">All celebrations began with a holy mass, crosses were everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now the crosses are PiS related, they have become a symbol of dictatorship – the sign of PiS regime.</seg>
<seg id="18">I repeat: one of the most unpleasant surprises is the fact that such people as Rydzyk keeps a firm grip of the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing about it and the Church is a PiS ally.</seg>
<seg id="19">This is a black chapter of Polish Church to be paid for dearly" kept convincing Niesiołowski.</seg>
<seg id="20">I hope that Pope Francis will chase out Jędraszewski, Rydzyk and a few other of the sort", he summed up.</seg>

<seg id="2">Gryf disqualified</seg>
<seg id="3">There was a close shave away from tragedy during the Cup of Poland clash between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechia Gdańsk when a flare launched by Wejherowo fans passed millilitres away from the opposite team goal keeper, Zlatan Alomerovic.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the incident the match was interrupted for 20 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="5">The PZPN (Polish Football Association) commission gave Gryf a severe penalty excluding it from next year’s matches.</seg>
<seg id="6">The club will not be allowed to take part in the Polish Cup in the 2020/2021 season.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, fans will not be allowed to enter their own stadium in the next match.</seg>
<seg id="8">They will also be disallowed to make group trips to league matches until 31st December.</seg>
<seg id="9">Fights at the Widzew Łódź stadium were triggered by Śląsk Wrocław fans.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, in this case the PZPNs verdict was milder, because Śląsk forewarned that similar events might occur and notified relevant organs about the problems.</seg>
<seg id="11">In spite of this, the forces did not prevent from throwing flares to the sector of fans from Łódź, burning chairs and attacking the sector of home fans.</seg>
<seg id="12">This match was interrupted for eight hours, while during the intervention police forces had to use a water cannon.</seg>
<seg id="13">PZPN punished Śląsk a single stadium ban for the next Polish Cup match and banned to organise match trips in this and next Polish Cup edition.</seg>

<seg id="5">E. g. "Lwów" will appear near "L'viv".</seg>
<seg id="6">In our voivodeship the changes will be implemented on 94 road signs near the motorway A4 and national roads: DK19, DK94.</seg>
<seg id="7">The concept is about making everything easier, more legible and smoother.</seg>
<seg id="8">The new guidelines can be attributed to the amendment of the act on the specific technical requirements for road signs and signals as well as the traffic safety devices issued by the Minister of Infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="9">"We should remember that the city names in the neighbouring countries often have their Polish equivalents.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thanks to the change in law we prepared they will finally appear on the road signs near our roads.</seg>

<seg id="1">Gowin: "We need to excite the Polish small trade"</seg>
<seg id="2">"Efficient taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, we need to think if the state has any instruments enabling to excite the Polish trade", said the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, leader of the Agreement party, Jarosław Gowin.</seg>
<seg id="3">During the discussion in "Sygnały dnia" in the Programme One radio channel, Gowin said the trade was possessed by international chains which impose such low margins on the Polish manufacturers that the Polish companies cannot develop, as a matter of fact.</seg>
<seg id="4">In response to the comment that this problem is very difficult to combat, the Deputy Prime Minister reminded the Law and Justice government tried to cope with it at the beginning of its term, but "it was opposed by the EC".</seg>
<seg id="5">"We won in the Court of Justice and I hope that when the United Right wins the next elections and forms a government, we will come back to that topic", he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He stressed also that the "efficient taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the Polish problem, i.e. of the small trade".</seg>
<seg id="7">"It will be necessary to think it over, if the government, the state has any instruments to excite the Polish trade", said Gowin.</seg>
<seg id="8">In May, the EU government decided the European Commission made a mistake declaring the "supermarket tax" was prohibited state aid.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Supermarket Tax Act assumed introduction of two sales tax rates: 0.8 per cent for revenue from PLN 17 million to PLN 170 million a month and 1.4 per cent for revenue above PLN 170 million a month.</seg>
<seg id="10">The tax was to be in force from September 2016.</seg>
<seg id="11">In September 2016, the EC initiated proceedings concerning the violation of the EU law by Poland.</seg>
<seg id="12">Brussels claimed then the tax structure may favour smaller shops which may be considered state aid.</seg>
<seg id="13">Next, it decided the levy was implemented illegally.</seg>
<seg id="14">It also issued an order to suspend the tax application until its analysis is finished by the officers in Brussels.</seg>
<seg id="15">Poland did not agree with that stance, but the tax collection was suspended.</seg>
<seg id="16">The May decision of the EU Court opened up the way to the repeated introduction of the tax, but did not end the case.</seg>
<seg id="17">On 24 July, the Commission filed an appeal in the Court of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="18">On Thursday, the CJEU press service told PAP the case is at the written stage now when both the European Commission and the Polish government present their arguments in writing.</seg>
<seg id="19">For the time being, it is not known when the oral procedure is to start, meaning the hearing of the parties and a possible trial.</seg>
<seg id="20">Up to more than ten months are required to make an appeal against the announced decision.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Such proceedings take one year on average", an informer in the Court of Justice in Luxembourg told PAP.</seg>

<seg id="1">How to dress a baby for a baptism?</seg>
<seg id="2">Here are some practical tips.</seg>
<seg id="3">Baptism is an exceptionally important celebration in the life of the toddler and its parents.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is very often the first occasion at which the whole family gathers around the baby to celebrate her/him.</seg>
<seg id="5">No wonder that the new mom and dad want their child to look perfect on this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Before you make a final decision about what your child will wear make up your mind if it would be comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="7">Shops are full of elegant costumes that will stop your baby from feeling comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="8">What should you consider?</seg>
<seg id="9">The first criterion of choosing the baptism dress is the child's age.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was not until recently that toddlers who were just several weeks old were baptized in white sets, lying in the same cradles or huge pillows.</seg>
<seg id="11">Nowadays it is often older children who get baptized: they may be several months, one year old or even older.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is quite obvious that such a big child would need another baptism costume.</seg>
<seg id="13">If your child is baptized at the age of 3–4 months, she/he will probably stay in a baby carriage or on the hands of its parents or godparents.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is best to choose comfortable, cotton sleepers or costumes.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even though these clothes are often considered to be rather casual, you just need to find some festive variants, for example with frills or lacing.</seg>
<seg id="16">An ideal solution for a boy is a bodysuit with an imprinted bow-tie and braces.</seg>
<seg id="17">In case of older children you can allow yourself for more fantasy.</seg>
<seg id="18">A girl will look beautiful in a simple, tulle dress.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many parents of girls would like their kids to wear richly ornamented, frilly baptism dresses, combined with coats, bands and caps.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unfortunately, many manufacturers use artificial, non-breathing materials that does not prove comfortable for the child.</seg>
<seg id="21">Trying to find an appropriate costume is worth visiting the Asanti for Kids shop, offering cotton-based, elegant costumes.</seg>
<seg id="22">Delicate, tulle skirts, satin dresses, lances, appliques and cute sets will make your daughter look beautiful and feel comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="23">An ideal outfit for a young gentleman: cotton suit.</seg>
<seg id="24">It was not until recently that the parents of boys preferred the suits resembling the "adult models".</seg>
<seg id="25">Polyester jackets and trousers, stiff collars or caps often made young elegant boys show their dissatisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="26">Quite luckily, now they were replaced by comfortable cotton costumes.</seg>
<seg id="27">You just need to have a look at the sets available at Asanti for Kids, namely soft, tracksuit shorts and a blouse with a front vest-like pattern.</seg>
<seg id="28">Those costumes look very elegant and at the same time do not constrain the movements of the toddler who is discovering the world.</seg>

<seg id="1">The voting about the adjournment of session for the duration of the conference held by the Conservative Party.</seg>
<seg id="2">British Members of Parliament voted against a three days adjournment of House of Commons session for the duration of the annual programme conference held by the Conservative Party, which was requested by the government.</seg>
<seg id="3">289 members were in favour of this idea, whereas 306 voted against it.</seg>
<seg id="4">Normally, House of Commons stops its sessions for the duration of party conferences so that members of parliament do not have to resign from the participation in them and in the sessions.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, the opposition parties decided that the Parliament should not stop the session in such a key time, namely in the last weeks before Brexit that is scheduled for 31st October.</seg>
<seg id="6">The government motion to make a pause in the session was supported by 289 Members of Parliament, whereas 306 were against it.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two opposition parties already held their conferences</seg>
<seg id="8">The fact that the request for a break was refused can be perceived as a political revenge of the opposition aimed at the Prime Minister Boris Johnson because of his decision to suspend the parliament for five weeks (on Friday the Supreme Court found it unlawful and considered as null and void) as well as because of the fact that after the judge decision he is not eager to apologize for it.</seg>
<seg id="9">After this decision the House of Commons resumed its sessions on Wednesday, the most important event of the day was Johnson's speech and a heated debate afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Johnson blamed the opposition of blocking Brexit and avoiding earlier elections.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It is high time to proceed with Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="12">We need to do it to respect the results of referendum.</seg>
<seg id="13">Brexit must come so that we can deal with our citizen priorities, with health care and costs of living.</seg>
<seg id="14">Brexit must come so that we can unite this country", said Johnson.</seg>
<seg id="15">The conference of the Conservative Party is to begin in Manchester on the coming Sunday and last until Wednesday, 2nd October.</seg>
<seg id="16">The conferences of the two main opposition parties, the Labour Party and Liberal Democrats, were already held.</seg>
<seg id="17">One of the justification for such a long parliament suspension given by Johnson were party conferences.</seg>

<seg id="2">"President Andrzej Duda believes that the anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are the reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders," foreign media report.</seg>
<seg id="3">The president’s spokesperson firmly demented these reports.</seg>
<seg id="4">"It is simply not true," Błażej Spychalski wrote on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="5">Israeli media, including Haaretz and Jerusalem Post, cite the Jewish Insider in writing that, during his meeting at the Polish embassy in New York, Andrzej Duda stated that Israel is responsible for the latest anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="6">The president said that the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders is to be blamed for the increase of the number of anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="7">He was referring to the words of Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs Israel Katz who stated back in February that "Poles suckled anti-Semitism with their mothers’ milk".</seg>
<seg id="8">Andrzej Duda said it is a pity that Israel Katz did not apologise for the embarrassing words of his politicians.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also mentioned the act of aggression against Polish ambassador in Israel, Marek Magierowski.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was attacked in May by an aggressor who shouted: "Pole, Pole".</seg>
<seg id="11">"Not only is the quote inaccurate.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is simply not true," Błażej Spychalski wrote on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="13">He stressed that Duda "never said Israel was responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland."</seg>
<seg id="14">Spychalski said the portal "made this up."</seg>
<seg id="15">According to "Jl" sources, during the meeting a dispute occurred as well between Holocaust survivor Edward Mosberg, awarded with the Commander’s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland, and rabbi Shmuley Boteach.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mosberg allegedly agreed with President Duda’s words by saying that Jews from Israel "like Katz" are responsible for the rise of anti-Semitism.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the portal’s sources, Boteach allegedly interrupted Mosberg’s statement.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who is Banaś and what is his guilt?</seg>
<seg id="2">The tenement house rented by pimps let the journalist discover some negligences in the financial statements by Marian Banaś.</seg>
<seg id="3">Here is the summary of another affair that was a major shock for the ruling party.</seg>
<seg id="4">The journalists of "Superwizjer" TVN revealed that Marian Banaś, head of the Supreme Audit Office has not been mentioning the 400 metres tenement house in Krakow's district Podgórze in his financial statement during the recent years.</seg>
<seg id="5">What is more, the subtenant is said to have run a brothel there (to rent rooms per hours).</seg>
<seg id="6">The building itself was allegedly a security for the repayment of the credit from 2016 onwards.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was Bertold Kittel who noticed the irregularities in the programme "Superwizjer".</seg>
<seg id="8">The journalist revealed that the tenement house of Banaś was rented by those linked with the criminal world to use it as a spot for "erotic meetings".</seg>
<seg id="9">The customers were probably the men using prostitutes.</seg>
<seg id="10">Banaś's response to the allegations was vague and unclear.</seg>
<seg id="11">What is interesting, the tenement house rented by pimps let the journalist discover some negligences in the financial statements by Marian Banaś.</seg>
<seg id="12">The tenement house itself was described quite vaguely and the income from its rental was lowered.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The fortune of Marian Banaś and his wife may be between PLN 6 and 8 million.</seg>
<seg id="14">The couple benefits from two houses, three flats as well as savings[...]", says Money.pl.</seg>
<seg id="15">As analysed by the portal, the tenement house of Banaś itself was worth about PLN 3 million.</seg>
<seg id="16">Central Anticorruption Bureau has been currently investigating the property statement of Marian Banaś for the years 2015–2019.</seg>
<seg id="17">Banaś said he would suspend his work at SAO until it is finished. "I will file a motion to be granted unpaid holidays to the Marshall", he assured.</seg>
<seg id="18">Opposition demands explanation</seg>
<seg id="19">"There is no information that the CBA extended its investigation or accelerated checking the property statements issued by Marian Banaś.</seg>
<seg id="20">That is why we are forced to act instead of the country bodies and file a :notification on suspicion of committing a crime, said PO-KO member of Parliament, Mariusz Witczak.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If an ordinary Pole estimated the rental incomes of their real estates at such an extremely low level, they would be controlled 10 times, they would have a surcharge and face financial penalty proceedings, he added.</seg>
<seg id="22">He raised to fall</seg>
<seg id="23">Marian Banaś is the new head of Supreme Audit Office.</seg>
<seg id="24">He was appointed to this position on 30th August 2019, for a 6 years term of office.</seg>
<seg id="25">He was chosen to be the candidate of Prawo i Sprawiedliwość and accepted for this position thanks to the votes of this party.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the past Banaś worked at SAO in the years 1992–2005, collaborating with Lech Kaczyński.</seg>
<seg id="27">During the first term of office by PiS (2005–2008) Banaś was the head of Customs Service as well as held the position of under-secretary of state at the Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="28">In 2015 he was chosen to be the head of Customs Service again and in 2017 he became in charge of the National Tax Administration.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Rzeczpospolita": Ignoring Policeman’s Command will be Penalized</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the daily, neglecting the order of specific conduct given by a policeman is to be a new offence type, likely to result in a fine, detention or restriction of personal liberty.</seg>
<seg id="3">The introduction of such a change is requested by the Police trade union activists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The idea was brought to the Sejm Petition Committee.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It is serious as more than one half a million minor offence cases reach Polish court every year now", we read.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rzeczpospolita found out the petition written by the Independent Trade Union of Policemen concerning the amendment of the Petty Offence Code is likely to succeed.</seg>
<seg id="7">The petition authors propose a new wording of Article 54a of the Petty Offence Code.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is to read: "Whoever does not comply with the request or order of a public officer given within and pursuant to the Act provisions shall be subject to the penalty of detention, fine or restriction of personal liberty".</seg>
<seg id="9">"Paragraph 3 of that provision mentions an identical penalty for the people who, not complying with the orders, prevent or hamper performance of an official duty", the daily says.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski told Rzeczpospolita that although he agrees with the core message of the proposed provision, he is afraid that if it is implemented, it can be used for political manifestations.</seg>
<seg id="11">"This would not be good for liberation demonstration and instead of soothing the situation, it would inflame it", he adds.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the statistics quoted by the daily, 86 percent of citizens had a positive opinion about the Police interventions in 2018, and the services intervene 1.5 million times in the city each time.</seg>

<seg id="2">Although the British Travel Agency, Thomas Cook, went bankrupt, its Belgian branch office Neckermann still operates.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the company has problems.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to VRT television, Brussels Airlines announced they would cancel 105 flights in October because of their problems connected with Thomas Cook bankruptcy.</seg>
<seg id="5">Also, Neckermann dismissed 75 employees.</seg>
<seg id="6">All the trips booked in Belgium with this agency will be cancelled but the tourists will be able to get their money back.</seg>
<seg id="7">The court in Ghent announced also bankruptcy of three Belgian daughter companies, i.e. Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.</seg>
<seg id="8">At present there are ca. 12 thousand Belgians staying abroad on trips bought in Thomas Cook.</seg>
<seg id="9">Another 40 thousand were to go with the agency by the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Monday, the spokeswomen for Thomas Cook Belgium, Leen Segers, said the company is "fully operable" now although the British parent company announced its bankruptcy which caused anxiety of employees and customers.</seg>
<seg id="11">Then, the branch office reassured the customers who bought their trips in it would go for holiday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thomas Cook, the oldest and one of the largest travel agencies worldwide, announced its bankruptcy at night from Sunday to Monday.</seg>
<seg id="13">The direct cause of bankruptcy was the Sunday crash of the last-chance negotiations with creditors and prospective investors.</seg>
<seg id="14">The creditors demanded that the company should acquire extra 200 million pounds, besides the rescue plan agreed in August worth 900 million pounds, as security for winter season when the turnovers of travel agencies are usually lower.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, the company problems had been accumulating for several years resulting in a debt of 1.6 billion pounds.</seg>

<seg id="2">Free accommodation in exchange for feedback – such an extraordinary offer awaits travellers in the German city Görlitz.</seg>
<seg id="3">The action is aimed at combating the decreasing number of citizens.</seg>
<seg id="4">Görlitz is Germany's most eastern city.</seg>
<seg id="5">Beautiful pastel old city attracts 140 thousand tourists annually.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, as "The Guardian" reports, the city has been facing major problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Görlitz has the lowest salaries in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">The city is also facing a constant decrease of citizen number.</seg>
<seg id="9">After the Berlin wall fell in 1989 most of them emigrated to the west of the country, which is why the city population decreased by 25 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">In 2013 it amounted to 54 thousand people.</seg>
<seg id="11">In their attempt to combat depopulation the clerks came across an idea of offering free monthly accommodation in the city.</seg>
<seg id="12">As for now, they have received 150 applications.</seg>
<seg id="13">Two thirds of them were filed by the inhabitants of big cities.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is also the citizens of Hungary, Czech Republic, United States and Great Britain who are interested in the programme.</seg>
<seg id="15">"When we filed our application, we thought the programme was meant to talk the people into moving to Görlitz", said one of the project participants.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Now we feel it doesn't matter if we stay here after four weeks or not", he added.</seg>
<seg id="17">There are seven thousand free flats in the city and the unemployment rate is three times as high as the average in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="18">Even though the city authorities hope some would stay there forever, the main goal of the programme is to collect the opinion of the participants.</seg>
<seg id="19">The information from surveys and questionnaires are aimed to revitalize smaller German cities.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We want to find out more about what people need and if they decide to move, what is the reason for it", said Robert Knippschild who is in charge of the programme.</seg>
<seg id="21">Other cities have already tried to attract new citizens, offering them free accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first one to do so was Detroit that launched a program of financing young aspiring specialists for living and working in the city for one year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Nowadays such solutions are a commonplace in many destinations, from the Greek island Antikythera to Candela in Italy or in the US city Tulsa (Oklahoma).</seg>
