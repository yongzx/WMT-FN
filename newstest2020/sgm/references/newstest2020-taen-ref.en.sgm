<seg id="6">With the permission denied, a complaint was given to the District Collector and Tirupur District Police commissioner.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a discussion that followed, a protest was announced by the Secular Progressive alliance again on September 17.</seg>
<seg id="8">Since the police department denied permission for this also, a protest “Condemning the violent approach of Hindu Munnani and urging speedy action from the police” was conducted defying the ban.</seg>
<seg id="9">K.Selvaraj, DMK secretary of Tirupur North district headed the agitation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Executives from all parties including CPI(M) state committee member K.Kamaraj, S.Muthukannan, CPI (M) secretary, Tirupur district, M.Ravi, CPI secretary, Tirupur district, Ramasamy of Congress party, and Sampath from the MDMK, all took part in the agitation.</seg>

<seg id="12">During this time, the Secular Progressive Alliance parties said; Hindu Munnani activists attacked a knitwear company in Tirupur on the 5th of last month and indulged in violence.</seg>
<seg id="13">Condemning this event, we have asked for proper permission to conduct a protest democratically, but the police department denied it. Regarding this, we made a complaint to the Collector, and Police Commissioner. The police denied us permission, considering the importance of the demands we are conducting, to protest democratically in a non-violent way defying the ban.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also the police department has arrested only a few people in connection with the attack on the knitwear company.</seg>
<seg id="15">They urged the police to take speedy action to arrest Hindu Munnani agitators in connection with this incident.</seg>
<seg id="16">Since more than 500 people particularly women, participated together in the agitation, and raised their voice against violence, the police retreated without arresting those who defied the ban.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the agitation, voices were raised against the attack on the knitwear company by Hindu Munnai and against various forms of communal violence unleashed by Hindu Munnani.</seg>
<seg id="18">That the protest was conducted democratically, and with control by the Secular Progressive Alliance, creating awareness against violence among the people of Tirupur, is not an overstatement!</seg>

<seg id="1">“If I do it, people also will come forward to do this!” says Ram Singh regarding this initiative, “People were fed up with the hardships of purchasing large amounts of vegetables, traffic jams and environmental pollution.</seg>

<seg id="9">In this scenario Damang is contesting in the Sikkim by-election.</seg>
<seg id="10">Damang is ruling in Sikkim with the support of BJP.</seg>

<seg id="1">There were revolutionary movements before and after Bagat Singh.</seg>
<seg id="2">But it is not just an appreciation that Bagat Singh and his comrades have given a new evolution and a clear ideology to revolutionary movements and through that to Indian politics.</seg>
<seg id="3">Today we can sense a feeling among people that revolutionists are blindfolded and don’t care for the lives of the people.</seg>
<seg id="4">The period of Bagat Singh shows us their humanity and clear thoughts and capacity.</seg>
<seg id="5">The name of Bagat Singh became popular in India after the incident of bombing assembly in April 1929.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in Tamilnadu he became popular among the public after some time in 1930.</seg>
<seg id="7">But within a year of introduction his fame spread so quickly even in the nook and corners of Tamilnadu.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is something amazing in history, none of the North Indian born leaders including Gandhi gained fame in a very short time in Tamilnadu.</seg>
<seg id="9">Periyar is the reason behind this.</seg>
<seg id="10">An editorial titled Bagat Singh was published in Kudiyarasu weekly just after a week of killing of Bagat Singh.</seg>
<seg id="11">The editorial appreciated many characters of Bagat Sngh and also put forth few ideas about the political situation during that period.</seg>
<seg id="12">Excerpts of that editorial:-</seg>
<seg id="13">“If Bagat Singh was determined that his objectives and the path chosen by him to achieve them is correct, we are sure that he was supposed to act accordingly and if he had not acted so, then we can not call him as a great personality.</seg>
<seg id="14">So we can now call him as a real man.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is our strong opinion that India is really in need of the policies of Bagat Singh.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bagat Singh would not have gained such fame if he was not executed.</seg>
<seg id="17">Also we would further say that if Bagat Singh had not been executed that would have aided the principles of Gandhi further.</seg>
<seg id="18">Bagat Singh, who would have burnt to ashes after dying due to a disease uselessly got a chance to die usefully showing a path of real equality and peace not only to the people of India but also to the people of the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="19">We appreciate Bagat Singh generously that this immortality not easily endowed on everyone.</seg>

<seg id="3">In the rule of central BJP the concept of federal governance is being questioned, accused Sitaram Yechuri in a conference held in Pudhuchery.</seg>

<seg id="6">In his lecture in the seminar he said the campaign of BJP mentioning One Nation, One culture, one election, and one education system has questioned the plurality of India.</seg>
<seg id="7">If you reject the anti-democratic stand of the government you may be branded anti-Indian and arrested.</seg>
<seg id="8">An amendment for law has been made.</seg>
<seg id="9">He accused that human rights violations are taking place to the extent of calling you as a terrorist for criticizing BJP or posting in social media and being sent to prison and also said that there is an economic crisis in the country.</seg>
<seg id="10">Because the buying power of the people is very low.</seg>
<seg id="11">But the government has donated 2 lakh crores to rich owners.</seg>

<seg id="9">The central government is going to reduce the fund that is being given to Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai, Karagpur, Rourkee and Guwahati IIT institutions.</seg>
<seg id="10">In order to face the deficit, the central government has increased the fees that are being collected from the students.</seg>
<seg id="11">Also it is said that these institutions are advised to take developmental works with the aid of the construction activities taken up by these technical education institutions and also it has been advised to obtain loans and to get financial aid from corporate companies.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since coming to power, BJP has been doing its level best to block the education that is being given to common men, in the budget for the year 2015 it reduced the fund for primary education, and subsequently it has been drastically reducing the fund for education in each budget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Following this, as a way of providing more facilities to private education institutions, it has been continuously granting permission for big shots to start education institutions.</seg>
<seg id="14">In this scenario, without giving any importance to Government education institutions in the new education policy, it has introduced various rules making the education institutions to function using the fund provided by private institutions.</seg>
<seg id="15">Through these steps it is involved in making only rich people be able to get education from primary level to higher education and making India an illiterate country in the future taking India back to many centuries.</seg>

<seg id="1">How many check dams were constructed in the 8 year ADMK rule, DMK has questioned the Chief Minister Edappadi Palanisamy.</seg>
<seg id="2">In a statement released by the party`s treasurer Duraimurugan regarding this, he has criticized that the Chief Minister is blabbering without any knowledge about the Public works department.</seg>
<seg id="3">In his statement the DMK President Duraimurugan has stated, the water released in Cauvery is reaching the sea without uselessly due to the negligence and ineffective administration.</seg>
<seg id="4">As a leader of the opponent party in the legislative assembly, our leader M.K.Stalin has voiced his concern with responsibility that the ADMK government has no proper plans to save the water of Cauvery on its way.</seg>
<seg id="5">Edappadi Palanisamy, thinking of answering this question asked, “Has the DMK party, who is criticizing us, built at least one check dam during their rule?”</seg>
<seg id="6">“What I want to tell him is, during the rule of our party we have constructed a check dam across Cauvery at Mayanur.</seg>
<seg id="7">Can a Chief Minister, who has Public works department also with him, give wrong details without even knowing this detail.?</seg>
<seg id="8">That check dam built in Mayanur has improved the ground water level in that area.</seg>
<seg id="9">So Agriculture prospered.</seg>
<seg id="10">So you can see that thousands of people belonging to farmer community from that area who are the beneficiaries even today are grateful to DMK forever.</seg>
<seg id="11">The check dam was built in Mayanur according to the need that arisen during at that time.</seg>
<seg id="12">There was no need to build more check dams then.</seg>
<seg id="13">Had there been any need, the then Chief Minister would have given permission immediately, allotted money and initiated the works.</seg>
<seg id="14">So Edappadi is in no way qualified to criticize the party in caring about Cauvery.</seg>
<seg id="15">I am asking; during the past eight year ADMK rule, how many check dams have you built across Cauvery?</seg>
<seg id="16">Another question; During DMK ruling periods, we have constructed more than 40 check dams in Tamilnadu.</seg>
<seg id="17">Can you refer to at least one dam as built during the previous ADMK regimes?</seg>
<seg id="18">Don’t lie.</seg>
<seg id="19">If you have any answer to the accusation of the Opponent leader, show us with evidences about the places of construction or about the proposed plans.</seg>
<seg id="20">Leaving all these details and putting forth an unreal accusation that no check dams were built across Cauvery during the DMK regime may be fine for Edappadi personally but neither good nor a civilized act for the post that is being held by him, and it is my duty to remind him about this, said Duraimurugan.</seg>

<seg id="2">The White House has confirmed the information released about Donald Trump’s telephone request to conduct an investigation of the former Vice-President Joe Biden, a probable presidential candidate of the Democratic party.</seg>
<seg id="3">An impeachment resolution is being proposed against Trump by Democrats in the House of Representatives, citing such an action to initiate an inquiry against an American leader by pressuring another country is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regarding this, upon the order of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, 6 committees have been formed and an investigation is being initiated.</seg>
<seg id="5">Trump contacted the Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky via phone on July 25. During that conversation Trump asked him to conduct an investigation.</seg>
<seg id="6">Yesterday, the White House officially released a report regarding the conversation between the presidents of the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hence it is accepted that such a conversation is true.</seg>
<seg id="8">Meanwhile, during his interaction with the reporters after leaving a United Nations meeting, Trump said this was a friendly request.</seg>
<seg id="9">There was no pressure on the Ukrainian President.</seg>
<seg id="10">But one notable issue in this is the sudden stopping of aid worth around 400 million dollars that is being given to Ukraine by the American government.</seg>
<seg id="11">That aid was later allocated.</seg>
<seg id="12">The cadres of the Democratic Party see a connection between this and the conversation between Trump and the Ukrainian president.</seg>

<seg id="3">The 5th phase of archaeological excavation is proving to be a turning point in the historical analysis of ancient Tamil Nadu.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prosperity of Keezhadi dates from 6 BC to 1 AD.</seg>
<seg id="5">The evidence obtained in this study now shows urbanisation in the banks of the river Vaigai.</seg>
<seg id="6">The scientific estimation in the Keezhadi excavation has dated the Tamil-Brami back a further 100 years. This study has revealed that the Tamil society was a literate community in 6 BC.</seg>
<seg id="7">Also the samples of 70 pieces of bone that were excavated in this study were sent for scientific analysis to Deccan College, the Masters and Research institution.</seg>
<seg id="8">These pieces of bone on classification during analysis were identified as oxen, buffalo, goat, wild boar, antelope and peacock.</seg>
<seg id="9">This study shows that animals such as cow, buffalo, and goat were used in agriculture, and the scars found in the bone samples of antelope, goat and wild boar shows that these animals were used for eating.</seg>
<seg id="10">The results of this analysis show that the ancient community which was primarily engaged in agriculture, also engaged in livestock farming.</seg>
<seg id="11">The samples of roofing made of brick and limestone, and the coating of sheath wells, were being sent for analysis to Velur Technical University.</seg>
<seg id="12">During the study, minerals such as silica sand, limestone, iron, aluminium and magnesium were found in each of these.</seg>

<seg id="1">Is BJP indulging in caste politics to gain a foothold in Tamil Nadu?</seg>
<seg id="2">Being unable to make its Lotus blossom in Tamil Nadu after so many unsuccessful attempts, it is said that BJP is finally indulging in caste politics.</seg>
<seg id="3">During the first tenure of Modi as Prime Minister, Lotus was in a position to be searched in Tamil Nadu.</seg>
<seg id="4">Twice during the just-concluded MP election, Amit Shah said sternly “I won’t care about what you may do. Lotus must blossom in Tamil Nadu.”</seg>
<seg id="5">But it lost in all 5 constituencies it had contested.</seg>
<seg id="6">Although the whole nation supported BJP, there is still an anti-BJP wave in Tamil Nadu.</seg>
<seg id="7">Triple talaq, the Kashmir problem, enforcing Hindi, and one nation one language problems were above all these.</seg>
<seg id="8">All these problems have added to the woes of the party.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hence it is said that BJP high command is very angry with the Tamil Nadu BJP executives, and there is a problem with even the state president not being nominated.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, BJP is planning to gain a stronghold in Tamil Nadu at any cost, before the upcoming elections.</seg>
<seg id="11">From direct field reports, it seems that the BJP high command has almost reached a decision.</seg>
<seg id="12">Accordingly there is a thought among the people of Nadar, Vanniyar and Devendra kula velalar communities, that these people are not given required importance by both ADMK and DMK.</seg>
<seg id="13">So they are upset with the Dravidian parties, it is said.</seg>
<seg id="14">BJP has cleverly started playing this card.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is said that it has decided to honour each community by granting a post.</seg>
<seg id="16">The appointment of Tamilisai Soundararajan as the Telengana Governor is such a move.</seg>
<seg id="17">Similarly, it is said that the BJP government is giving importance to nadars in higher posts in ISRO.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is true that this action of BJP to honour each community will make the people of that community feel proud and happy.</seg>
<seg id="19">Also, this caste politics will reward BJP with what it cannot achieve by other means.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, with Tamil Nadu already being spoiled by caste politics, it is not known if these activities of BJP will further fan the flames.</seg>
<seg id="21">Incase the caste feelings are fanned further, BJP will lose even the smallest gains it has made so far!</seg>
