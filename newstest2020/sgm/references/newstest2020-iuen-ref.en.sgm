<seg id="66">>>House commenced at 13:33</seg>
<seg id="67">Speaker (Hon. Joe Enook): Mr. Quassa, can you say the opening prayer, please.</seg>
<seg id="68">Speaker: Good afternoon, Premier and members. Nunavummiut who are listening to the radio broadcast and watching the televised proceedings, welcome to your Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="69">We will proceed directly to the orders of the day.</seg>
<seg id="70">Premier of Nunavut, Premier Quassa.</seg>
<seg id="71">Minister’s Statement 046 – 5(1): Nunavut’s 2018 Indspire Recipient (Quassa)</seg>
<seg id="72">Hon. Paul Quassa: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="73">Good day, my fellow residents of Igloolik, my colleagues, and all Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="74">Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity today to recognize and congratulate along with my colleagues Dr. Donna May Kimmaliardjuk, recipient of the 2018 Youth – Inuit Indspire Award in Winnipeg.</seg>
<seg id="75">Donna is the very first Inuk doctor.</seg>
<seg id="76">Dr. Kimmaliardjuk was born in Chesterfield Inlet and is the first ever Inuk heart surgeon.</seg>
<seg id="77">She is currently in her fourth year of a six-year residency program at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute.</seg>
<seg id="78">Mr. Speaker, Dr. Kimmaliardjuk was accepted in 2014 as one of only 10 cardiac surgery residents across all of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="79">In 2016 she joined the National Aboriginal Council on HIV/AIDS as the Inuit representative.</seg>
<seg id="80">There, she provides the council with a crucial perspective combining her medical expertise with Inuit culture.</seg>
<seg id="81">Mr. Speaker, the Indspire Awards represent the highest honour the indigenous community presents to its people.</seg>
<seg id="82">The Inspire Awards celebrated their 25th anniversary in 2018 and have so far honoured 350 First Nations, Inuit and Métis individuals who demonstrate outstanding achievement.</seg>
<seg id="83">The awards show is a celebration of culture that highlights the diversity of indigenous peoples in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="84">This year the Indspire Awards take place on March 23 in Winnipeg.</seg>
<seg id="85">Mr. Speaker, I ask my fellow members to please join me in offering our congratulations to Dr. Kimmaliardjuk, as she prepares to accept this honour.</seg>
<seg id="86">Through her hard work and dedication, she is bridging the gap for Inuit accessing medical services, and she’s leading the way for the next generation of Nunavut youth.</seg>
<seg id="87">I know I speak for us all when I say how proud we are of Dr. Kimmaliardjuk’s accomplishments and how much we look forward to seeing where this incredible journey takes her.</seg>
<seg id="88">Minister of Justice, Minister Ehaloak.</seg>
<seg id="89">Minister’s Statement 047 – 5(1): Rankin Inlet Healing Facility Sewing Program (Ehaloak)</seg>
<seg id="90">Hon. Jeannie Ehaloak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today to talk about a new cultural program for male inmates at the Rankin Inlet Healing Facility.</seg>
<seg id="91">Inmates participating in the program learn how to work with sealskin, leather, and other materials and have made winter coats, sealskin mitts, sealskin pants, sealskin hats, bullet bags, and thermos [bags].</seg>
<seg id="92">The program is currently run by Rosemary Angugasak Sandy, a well-respected elder and a highly renowned seamstress all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="93">She recently travelled to Norway to teach individuals how to work with and prepare sealskins.</seg>
<seg id="94">She was an instructor at the Nunavut Arctic College’s Fur Production Program and also helped to facilitate the Miqqut Project with the Nunavut Literacy Council.</seg>
<seg id="95">With Rosemary’s help and guidance, inmates learn culturally relevant skills in a healthy, safe environment rooted in Inuit language, traditional practices, and healing.</seg>
<seg id="96">The sewing program will work with and support the facility’s land program where inmates learn to hunt wildlife and how to properly prepare the skins and the meat.</seg>
<seg id="97">These harvested skins will then be used as part of the sewing program.</seg>
<seg id="98">Programs like these can help inmates reintegrate back into their community after they have completed their sentence, encouraging them to continue these traditional activities rather than engage in criminal behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="99">I recently visited the Rankin Inlet Healing Facility and was encouraged to see the positive impact of these cultural programs, particularly those supported by dedicated community elders like Rosemary Sandy.</seg>
<seg id="100">Minister of Family Services, Minister Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="101">Minister’s Statement 048 – 5(1): Red Seal-endorsed Certification in Truck and Transport Mechanic (Savikataaq)</seg>
<seg id="102">Hon. Joe Savikataaq: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I say “good day” to the people of Arviat. Daughter, please don’t be late to school.</seg>
<seg id="103">Mr. Speaker, I’ll say my statement on the Red Seal-endorsed certification in truck and transport mechanic.</seg>
<seg id="104">In September 2016 the heavy equipment technician trade, with all three sub-trades, became a designated trade in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="105">This enabled Nunavut to offer apprenticeships in these trades and sub-trades, as well as issue certificates of qualification, more generally known as a journeyperson’s ticket.</seg>
<seg id="106">In November of 2017 Nunavut received authorization to offer Red Seal-endorsed certification in truck and transport mechanic, one of the sub-trades of heavy equipment technician.</seg>
<seg id="107">A journeyman who passes an interprovincial Red Seal examination has demonstrated exceptional knowledge in their trade and can work anywhere in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="108">Mr. Speaker, I am happy that we have been able to create the opportunity for Nunavummiut to earn cross-country recognition of having achieved excellence in this new Red Seal trade in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="109">Minister of Education, Minister Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="110">Minister’s Statement 049 – 5(1): New Funding for Early Learning and Child Care Facilities (Joanasie)</seg>
<seg id="111">Hon. David Joanasie: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon, my colleagues, people of Cape Dorset, Kimmirut, and Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="112">Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I announce today that the Department of Education is providing a top-up O&M program contribution funding to eligible licensed child care facilities.</seg>
<seg id="113">Mr. Speaker, this increase is a result of the three-year action plan that my staff developed for the Early Learning and Child Care Bilateral Agreement which was signed in September 2017 with the Government of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="114">Mr. Speaker, this current fiscal year will see all eligible licensed child care facilities receive an increase of a minimum of $1,918.80 to a maximum of $45,494.80 depending on the number, type, and location of the spaces and facility.</seg>
<seg id="115">As long as facilities do not raise their parental fees, they will also be eligible for similar funding for the next fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="116">Mr. Speaker, this funding will not only assist licensed child care facilities with their operating costs; it will also assist families by keeping the parental fees from increasing.</seg>
<seg id="117">Mr. Speaker, we are pleased that we are able to provide this funding to help out the child care facilities and the families.</seg>
<seg id="118">We believe that this funding will have a positive impact by stabilizing both the funding and parental fees.</seg>
<seg id="119">Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="120">Minister’s Statement 050 – 5(1): Nunavut Mining Symposium (Sheutiapik)</seg>
<seg id="121">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik: Good day, Nunavummiut and my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="122">Mr. Speaker, the mining industry represents a key pillar of Nunavut’s economic development.</seg>
<seg id="123">Our department is committed to supporting the mining industry and ensuring that Nunavummiut are able to benefit from this activity.</seg>
<seg id="124">Mr. Speaker, soon people from across Canada will be in Iqaluit for the 21st Annual Nunavut Mining Symposium from April 9 to 12, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="125">This symposium is a terrific opportunity for people to find out the latest in Nunavut’s mineral exploration and mining industry and to ensure that our communities are aware and involved in mining and exploration in our territory.</seg>
<seg id="126">We anticipate that this year’s mining symposium will continue to be one of the best attended conferences in Nunavut and we anticipate over 400 people to take part.</seg>
<seg id="127">Mr. Speaker, I look forward to welcoming the mining industry, Inuit organizations, prospectors, community members, and all other stakeholders to this important forum.</seg>
<seg id="128">Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I would like to encourage all members of the public to come and take part during the public portion of the symposium on April 11.</seg>
<seg id="129">This is not only an opportunity to get some excellent swag, but also about the impacts of mining and exploration and give stakeholders your feedback.</seg>
<seg id="130">Members’ Statements. Member for Hudson Bay, Mr. Rumbolt.</seg>
<seg id="131">Member’s Statement 096 – 5(1): Happy Fifth Birthday to Grandson (Rumbolt)</seg>
<seg id="132">Five years ago today the Speaker of this House at the time rose in the House to congratulate me on becoming a grandfather. Today I get the privilege of wishing my grandson a happy fifth birthday.</seg>
<seg id="133">Happy birthday, Jayden.</seg>
<seg id="134">Member for Netsilik, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="135">Member’s Statement 097 – 5(1): Kitikmeot Youth Empowerment (Qirngnuq)</seg>
<seg id="136">Mr. Qirngnuq: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="137">The statement I will be making today applies to our youth and their future. It can assist with plans they may wish to undertake for a future career.</seg>
<seg id="138">I rise today to share some good news with my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="139">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to inform the House that Inuit youth from across the Kitikmeot region will gather in Cambridge Bay next week for the 2018 Kitikmeot Youth Empowerment event.</seg>
<seg id="140">Mr. Speaker, this gathering provides an opportunity for Kitikmeot youth to come together to discuss a number of priority areas of concern for youth.</seg>
<seg id="141">These include:</seg>
<seg id="142">Mental health;</seg>
<seg id="143">Youth centres;</seg>
<seg id="144">Substance abuse;</seg>
<seg id="145">The importance of learning about Inuit history, residential schools, and reconciliation; and</seg>
<seg id="146">The preservation, protection, and promotion of Inuit language and culture.</seg>
<seg id="147">Mr. Speaker, this year’s participants from Taloyoak are:</seg>

<seg id="159">Mr. Speaker, I ask all members to join me in wishing the participants a very successful gathering.</seg>
<seg id="160">Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, Mr. Lightstone.</seg>
<seg id="161">Member’s Statement 098 – 5(1): Cannabis Legislation (Lightstone)</seg>
<seg id="162">Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="163">Today I rise to convey concerns that I have received from a number of my constituents concerning the government’s pending legislation of cannabis.</seg>
<seg id="164">I would like to read from a letter I just recently received. It states, “My family and I currently live in a public housing unit in an attached apartment row housing unit in Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="165">For the last couple of years, we have had to deal with my neighbour smoking cigarettes and cannabis in their apartment. The problem is the smell comes right into our apartment, and it smells as if someone who had been smoking in our unit and it’s very strong.”</seg>
<seg id="166">It goes on and it gives a bit more detail, but most importantly it states that “I’m concerned about the health impacts smoking in units can have on my children and everyone else’s, but my priority are my kids and other kids that are in the same situation.”</seg>
<seg id="167">Mr. Speaker, like many residents of Iqaluit, my family and I live in a multi-unit dwelling.</seg>
<seg id="168">Mr. Speaker, an issue that affects residents of such buildings is second-hand smoke.</seg>
<seg id="169">Mr. Speaker, second-hand tobacco smoke has long been acknowledged to be a significant health risk, which is why governments across the country have acted in recent years to regulate and restrict the places in which tobacco can be smoked.</seg>
<seg id="170">As the father of a young baby myself, I don’t want any children unnecessarily exposed to such health risks as second-hand tobacco smoke and/or second-hand cannabis smoke.</seg>
<seg id="171">As my colleague from Pangnirtung pointed out in her questions last week to the Minister of Health, there are a number of health risks associated with the consumption of cannabis.</seg>
<seg id="172">From talking with my constituents in recent months, I know that many of them have the same concerns.</seg>
<seg id="173">Mr. Speaker, I recognize that issues like this are a balancing act.</seg>
<seg id="174">The federal government’s legalization of recreational cannabis is, in all likelihood, going to be passed by Parliament within the next few months.</seg>
<seg id="175">I would like to request unanimous consent to conclude my statement.</seg>
<seg id="176">The member is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statement. Are there any nays?</seg>
<seg id="177">Mr. Lightstone, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="178">Thank you, members.</seg>
<seg id="179">Under this legislation, adults will be permitted to possess and consume cannabis. However, it will be up to the government and legislature to establish the detailed rules concerning such issues as where cannabis can be smoked in our communities.</seg>
<seg id="180">Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet pointed out last week that the Government of Nunavut’s own public consultation materials clearly acknowledge the need to address the issue of rules concerning cannabis cultivation and consumption in rental units and public housing, as well as condominiums.</seg>
<seg id="181">Mr. Speaker, it’s my belief that the legislation which is introduced in this House needs to clearly address this issue, and I am looking forward to working with my colleagues to strike the best possible balance.</seg>
<seg id="182">Before we proceed, you probably realized that MLA Akoak is not here today. He is not feeling well and will be absent today.</seg>
<seg id="183">Mr. Akoak, if you are listening, we hope you get well soon.</seg>
<seg id="184">Member for Baker Lake, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="185">Member’s Statement 099 – 5(1): Increasing Education Opportunities in Baker Lake (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="186">Mr. Mikkungwak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="187">Hello to Baker Lake and all of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="188">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage our government to do more to expand educational opportunities in the community of Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="189">Mr. Speaker, the community of Baker Lake is growing fast. It will be important to step in and provide opportunities for residents to learn more skills and find more ways to contribute to the community and society.</seg>
<seg id="190">Mr. Speaker, the Piqqusilirivvik facility operates a satellite program in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="191">This program could be greatly expanded to provide greater awareness and experience in Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit.</seg>
<seg id="192">Mr. Speaker, the concept of establishing a university in Nunavut has been suggested and Agnico Eagle Mines have expressed their willingness to support this initiative if it should move forward.</seg>
<seg id="193">What better place to move it forward than in central Nunavut which is also the geographic centre of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="194">Mr. Speaker, one of my colleagues mentioned the other day how important it is for us to jump at opportunities and seize them before they pass by.</seg>
<seg id="195">The wheels of government turn slowly, but that doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t encourage, push, and promote opportunities that are there before us.</seg>
<seg id="196">Mr. Speaker, this is the beginning of our term as Nunavut’s Fifth Assembly and I for one would like to see us take great strides forward.</seg>
<seg id="197">Expanding educational opportunities in communities such as Baker Lake would be a good step in the right direction.</seg>
<seg id="198">Member for Kugluktuk, Ms. Kamingoak.</seg>
<seg id="199">Member’s Statement 100 – 5(1): Concerns with Larga Boarding Home (Kamingoak)</seg>
<seg id="200">Ms. Kamingoak: Koana, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="201">Good afternoon to my colleagues, Kuglukturmiut, and Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="202">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage our government to have greater oversight of the day-to-day operations at our medical boarding homes.</seg>
<seg id="203">Mr. Speaker, my constituents have brought a number of issues to my attention which I feel should have been addressed some time ago.</seg>
<seg id="204">Problems with food services in particular have been noted repeatedly with meals being served on disposable plates and cutlery because the dishwasher has been broken for months.</seg>
<seg id="205">Mr. Speaker, it is important that our government ensures that the services which are being paid for on behalf of Nunavut residents are actually being provided.</seg>
<seg id="206">I do appreciate that the boarding homes are dealing with many clients on an ongoing basis. However, it is important that those clients are comfortable and well looked after.</seg>
<seg id="207">Mr. Speaker, it is not clear whether the boarding home aspect of medical travel will be covered under the minister’s ongoing review of medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="208">I look forward to seeing the results of the review and I hope to see recommendations which will result in an improvement in the level of services and conditions at our medical boarding homes.</seg>
<seg id="209">Member for Aivilik, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="210">Member’s Statement 101 – 5(1): Congratulations to Rosalie Ijjangiaq (Netser)</seg>
<seg id="211">Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today to congratulate Rosalie Ijjangiaq of Naujaat.</seg>
<seg id="212">Ms. Ijjangiaq is a high school student at Tuugaalik School in Naujaat. Earlier this year Ms. Ijjangiaq was awarded the Horatio Alger Canadian Scholarship.</seg>
<seg id="213">Mr. Speaker, Horatio Alger scholarships are awarded to high school students who have overcome significant adversity while demonstrating strong academics and a commitment to pursuing post-secondary education.</seg>
<seg id="214">Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize Ms. Ijjangiaq for her perseverance and commitment to furthering her education.</seg>
<seg id="215">Our youth face many challenges and obstacles when working to achieve a post-secondary education.</seg>
<seg id="216">Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Rosalie Ijjangiaq on her great accomplishment. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>

<seg id="219">Ms. Nakashuk: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="220">Good afternoon, my colleagues, my relatives, and the people of Pangnirtung.</seg>
<seg id="221">I rise this afternoon to express my pride to a constituent of mine who lives in Pangnirtung who was recognized by Dennis Patterson.</seg>
<seg id="222">He has been assisting the search and rescue for 18 years. Poasie Mike has been working with the local search and rescue group for 18 years. I rise to express my pride in him.</seg>

<seg id="227">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to make some observations and recommendations concerning the government’s budget process.</seg>
<seg id="228">Mr. Speaker, for those of us who are new to this place, the past two weeks has been both an experience and an education.</seg>
<seg id="229">Mr. Speaker, as the Chairperson of the Regular Members’ Caucus of the Legislative Assembly, I want to say “ma’na, koana, qujannamiik” to all of my colleagues for the way we have been working together since the new Assembly started.</seg>
<seg id="230">Mr. Speaker, I believe that we sent a strong message on Friday that the Legislative Assembly will not be taken for granted and that the government needs to respect both the letter and the spirit of its own procurement rules, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="231">Mr. Main: Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Iqaluit-Tasiluk moved an important motion on Friday, and it is one that we will be following up on when the House reconvenes in a few weeks from now for the spring sitting.</seg>
<seg id="232">Mr. Speaker, although our non-partisan, consensus style of government is not perfect, it does have a number of strengths.</seg>
<seg id="233">For example, as I noted last week concerning the capital budget for Nunavut Arctic College, the government did listen to a number of our concerns regarding the college’s budget and made some actual changes to it.</seg>
<seg id="234">I hope to see a lot more of that approach in the weeks and years ahead, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="235">Mr. Speaker, over the past few weeks, members have been putting ministers to the test on a daily basis.</seg>
<seg id="236">I think it’s fair to say that a major theme that has emerged is the need for more work in measuring and evaluating the actual outcomes and results of the government’s spending in a number of areas.</seg>
<seg id="237">It is not enough to count the number of dollars that have gone out the door.</seg>
<seg id="238">I would like to seek consent to conclude my statement, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="239">The member is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statement. Are there any nays?</seg>
<seg id="240">Mr. Main, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="241">Mr. Main: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="242">Mr. Speaker, I was speaking about measuring outcomes and results.</seg>
<seg id="243">Mr. Speaker, this information needs to be publicly tabled in the Legislative Assembly so that we, the elected representatives, can make informed, evidence-based decisions about whether or not any given item of spending should be increased, decreased, kept the same, or maybe even eliminated altogether in favour of doing other things with our limited dollars and resources.</seg>
<seg id="244">Mr. Speaker, I’ll briefly point to some examples.</seg>
<seg id="245">I think that it’s pretty safe to say that we can all agree that the cost to the government of administering its fuel tax rebate program for harvesters far outweighs the actual benefits that actual hunters are receiving.</seg>
<seg id="246">That’s why the Department of Environment, which administers the government’s main suite of hunter support programs, has to take a good look at how those programs can be modified to accomplish the core goal of helping hunters with the cost of fuel.</seg>
<seg id="247">Mr. Speaker, I’ll also again take the example of the government’s grants and contributions spending to illustrate and explain this point.</seg>
<seg id="248">We know that the government has spent millions of dollars to promote economic development and diversification.</seg>
<seg id="249">We know that a significant proportion of this funding has gone to for-profit, private businesses.</seg>
<seg id="250">We know the amounts and we know who received the money.</seg>
<seg id="251">What we don’t know is what any of this spending actually accomplished.</seg>
<seg id="252">We don’t know how many jobs for Inuit and other Nunavummiut were created or sustained by this spending and we often don’t know what the money was actually spent on.</seg>
<seg id="253">Mr. Speaker, as you know, I could go on for a long time in this vein, but I’m going to stop there.</seg>
<seg id="254">I’ll just add as a final point that I’m looking forward to the main estimates in our upcoming budget session, and I’m very much looking forward to continuing our work with all of my colleagues to strengthen our budget process for the ultimate benefit of all of our communities and constituents.</seg>
<seg id="255">Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="256">Member’s Statement 104 – 5(1): Two More Elders Sent Out for Care (Towtongie)</seg>
<seg id="257">Ms. Towtongie: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="258">On behalf of the people of Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, I rise today in recalling that one of our oldest elder residents, Annie Tatty, is travelling to Ottawa by plane today.</seg>
<seg id="259">As well, one of our oldest elders named Amaruq, as I rise to make my statement, is being sent off to Gjoa Haven due to the fact that there is no elders facility in Rankin Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="260">I want to be heard as a representative for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="261">When I was elected in November and I saw the budget, I asked the Minister of Health where the plan is for an elders facility in Rankin Inlet or in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="262">I was told by the Minister of Health that all Members of the Legislative Assembly care and are concerned for our elders.</seg>
<seg id="263">We were advised that during the Pond Inlet meeting, the issue would be brought up in detail.</seg>
<seg id="264">I am still waiting.</seg>
<seg id="265">Last week I rose in the House during the capital estimates review when I didn’t see the funding allocated towards an elders facility, specifically for the construction of the facility.</seg>
<seg id="266">I was informed that I was not supposed to speak about that matter and that I had to cease my questions.</seg>
<seg id="267">Nonetheless, I was appreciative when our Chair, Mr. Rumbolt, permitted me to continue to voice what I felt was necessary regarding the elders facility and to fight for that.</seg>
<seg id="268">Today I rise as an elected representative, feeling inadequate as I am not satisfied with our current reality.</seg>
<seg id="269">The current practice of sending elders to southern facilities, to an alien landscape where the elders have no familiarity with is inappropriate.</seg>
<seg id="270">In our campaigns we all made promises to try to be proper legislators and to have a functioning government, and we advised our elders that we want to extend our deep respect to them. Here we send our elders out of the territory of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="271">Member for Amittuq, Mr. Kaernerk.</seg>
<seg id="272">Member’s Statement 105 – 5(1): Recognition of Hall Beach and Igloolik’s Volunteer Search and Rescue (Kaernerk)</seg>
<seg id="273">Mr. Kaernerk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. For a moment there, I thought I was forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="274">I rise today to again express my pride in my fellow residents.</seg>
<seg id="275">The Hall Beach search and rescue team is very dedicated, especially when searching for any individual thought to be in dire straits or when a search is called for.</seg>
<seg id="276">They use their own equipment to conduct these searches.</seg>
<seg id="277">I rise today to express my appreciation and to share my pride in the members of the Hall Beach SAR team. The chairperson is Kyle Issigaitok, the vice-chairperson is George Innuksuk, and the search coordinator is Martha Gibbons. When they are out on the land searching and a shelter is required, Daniel Qaunaq sets up a shelter for them.</seg>
<seg id="278">The team’s elder, who I will continue to acknowledge when I can, is Abraham Oolalak.</seg>
<seg id="279">He is the elder of the SAR team and, as I stated previously, he is always the first searcher setting out on a search when required, yet he is an elder in comparison to my youthfulness.</seg>
<seg id="280">Again, I urge the youth to continue to assist our elders, as they have sage advice and wisdom.</seg>
<seg id="281">Although we may not note the assistance of preparing for the future, they provide encouragement and I am able to be here today.</seg>
<seg id="282">I regret my own impatience in my earlier days, as I should have taken their advice to heart.</seg>
<seg id="283">In order for the youth to not experience my situation, when you are going hunting, please ensure you have the proper gear and equipment to face any situation.</seg>
<seg id="284">Mr. Kaernerk: Another matter is the recognition of the Igloolik search and rescue team. Members of the Igloolik SAR team met with their Hall Beach counterparts in our town in preparation for the upcoming spring season. It is becoming milder and the weather is becoming nicer, so please ensure your gear and equipment is adequate for what you might be faced with.</seg>
<seg id="285">With that being the case, I urge all hunters to take their SPOT devices or a GPS, as well as asking your elders for advice about the best travel routes for the destination you are planning to go to and which areas have the wildlife you are hunting.</seg>
<seg id="286">Those are the types of questions you should ask.</seg>
<seg id="287">To return to my reason for rising today, I want to reiterate the fact that the Hall Beach SAR team has one snowmobile and they have continued to request more equipment from the Department of CG&S, yet they have never received a response.</seg>
<seg id="288">I encourage this government to provide more assistance to the essential SAR teams in our communities.</seg>
<seg id="289">That’s all.</seg>
<seg id="290">Last on my list is the Member for South Baffin, Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="291">Member’s Statement 106 – 5(1): Kinngait Performing Arts Club (Joanasie)</seg>
<seg id="292">Hon. David Joanasie: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="293">They will be listening to memorable songs, singing the Mamaqtuq song, and this event will be held at the Sam Pudlat School in Cape Dorset. Anyone is welcome if they’re interested in music. They will be holding the music workshop.</seg>
<seg id="294">I would like to acknowledge the Jerry Cans as they are very good songwriters, and also would like to thank the National Arts Centre along with the hamlet council of Cape Dorset.</seg>
<seg id="295">There are none.</seg>
<seg id="296">Member for Quttiktuq, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="297">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="298">I would like to acknowledge four people who are visiting.</seg>
<seg id="299">The first one is Parks Canada Field Unit Superintendent for Nunavut Jenna Boon and the staff who always takes care of me and our children, my wife, Carol Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="300">I would like to thank each and every one of you. A person coming from the northernmost community is my sister, Naomi Kuukaa Kuluguqtuq. We’re grateful that she’s here.</seg>
<seg id="301">In addition, she is a member of our staff who is following her child here for school and lives with us as a foster daughter. She’s always talking my daughter into going to school with her and I very much appreciate that. Let’s give a warm welcome to Jaiden Natanine.</seg>
<seg id="302">I want to start with a short preamble here.</seg>
<seg id="303">When I was still a young boy, as I used to be young once too…</seg>
<seg id="304">…I caught my first silver jar seal pup when I was quite young and it was my very first seal which I shot in a lake.</seg>
<seg id="305">I doubt many people have ever caught their first silver jar seal pup in a lake, and it was on the tiny island of Siuraq.</seg>
<seg id="306">This couple provided much-needed assistance and they were taking on the role of parents for me, as they were like my mother and father.</seg>
<seg id="307">I would like to say “thank you” to them for being able to come here.</seg>
<seg id="308">Mr. Otak and your wife, welcome to your Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="309">Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="310">Ms. Towtongie: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="311">My parents lived in Wager Bay and my mother, although it is now within the park boundaries, gave every sibling copies of pictures from the place, so I acknowledge you. From the oldest sibling to the youngest person, we are very thankful.</seg>
<seg id="312">As well, on occasion where I have travelled to Igloolik, I used to billet, as my Inuk name is Qaatani, with Theresa Otak, who presented me with a small tea pot, and Louie Otak, I am thankful that your food is quite delicious and I will billet with you again someday down the road.</seg>
<seg id="313">Thank you so much.</seg>
<seg id="314">Welcome to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="315">Member for Kugluktuk, Ms. Kamingoak.</seg>
<seg id="316">Ms. Kamingoak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="317">I would like to recognize Naomi Kuukaa Kuluguqtuq and Carol Akeeagok, who are family members.</seg>
<seg id="318">Naomi came all the way from Grise Fiord. Mr. Speaker, it’s not every day I get family in the House.</seg>
<seg id="319">Please feel welcome in your Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="320">Member for Pangnirtung, Ms. Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="321">Ms. Nakashuk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I, too, wish to acknowledge and express my pride and to voice my gratitude to my husband, who is in the gallery, Andrew Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="322">Please welcome him to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="323">Mr. Nakashuk, welcome to our Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="324">Recognition of Visitors in the Gallery. I have no more names on my list.</seg>
<seg id="325">Let’s proceed with the orders of the day.</seg>
<seg id="326">We will begin with the Member for Iqaluit-Tasiluk, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="327">Question 123 – 5(1): Private Security Legislation (Hickes)</seg>
<seg id="328">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="329">My questions today are for the Minister of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="330">A couple of my colleagues over the past week and a half have brought up the issue of security guards, training, and standardization.</seg>
<seg id="331">My first question to the minister is if she is looking at bringing forward private security legislation during this term.</seg>
<seg id="332">Minister of Justice, Minister Ehaloak.</seg>
<seg id="333">Hon. Jeannie Ehaloak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Hickes, for the question.</seg>
<seg id="334">As of today the Government of Nunavut does not have a Private Securities Act.</seg>
<seg id="335">My department is aware of all the companies that are starting to provide security within our communities, such as the health centres.</seg>
<seg id="336">We are currently researching and developing a policy to create a Nunavut Private Securities Act.</seg>
<seg id="337">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="338">As the minister mentioned, we are one of the last jurisdictions in Canada to not have private security legislation. When we’re looking at the private security industry, we want to make sure that they’re competent and accountable. We want to make sure that they can deliver services professionally.</seg>
<seg id="339">Almost every other jurisdiction in Canada has brought forward legislation on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="340">My next question would be: if they are analyzing the policy on private security legislation, will there be a legislative proposal coming forward to this House?</seg>
<seg id="341">Minister Ehaloak.</seg>
<seg id="342">Hon. Jeannie Ehaloak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Hickes, yes, we can work towards developing a policy or legislation for a Private Securities Act.</seg>
<seg id="343">Your final supplementary, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="344">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="345">I thank the minister for that commitment.</seg>
<seg id="346">Mr. Speaker, in the interim I just want to confirm, as Justice has oversight on law enforcement and in some respects security personnel are law enforcement officers, do they work with Community and Government Services in coordination of contract standards for any Government of Nunavut contract services for security?</seg>
<seg id="347">Hon. Jeannie Ehaloak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Any legislation or policies that are prepared within the Department of Justice or within any other department, when they’re writing policies, we make sure that my department is involved right from the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="348">I don’t have that information with me right now, but I can look into it and get back to you.</seg>
<seg id="349">Question 124 – 5(1): Status of Site Remediation in Baker Lake (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="350">Mr. Mikkungwak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="351">My questions are for the Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="352">I want to follow up on the questions that I asked the minister last week concerning the cleanup of the contaminated site in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="353">In one of her responses to me, the minister indicated that a “final report was prepared and given to the QEC.”</seg>
<seg id="354">Would the minister commit to providing a copy of this report to both the Municipal Council of Baker Lake and me as the community’s MLA?</seg>
<seg id="355">Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation, Minister Ehaloak.</seg>
<seg id="356">Hon. Jeannie Ehaloak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I can commit yes, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="357">Your first supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="358">I thank the minister for her commitment.</seg>
<seg id="359">In one of her responses to me, the minister indicated that the Qulliq Energy Corporation is “willing to work with the Municipality of Baker Lake to remediate the rest of the site.” Mr. Speaker, I will be pleased to convey this good news to the municipality when I return to the community next week. I will encourage municipal officials to contact their Qulliq Energy Corporation counterparts to arrange a meeting.</seg>
<seg id="360">Mr. Speaker, this shouldn’t be too difficult given that the Qulliq Energy Corporation’s headquarters is located in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="361">The minister indicated that the Qulliq Energy Corporation has already spent $1.68 million to date on this cleanup.</seg>
<seg id="362">Can she clarify what the cost would be to remediate the rest of the site?</seg>
<seg id="363">Minister Ehaloak.</seg>
<seg id="364">Hon. Jeannie Ehaloak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To remediate the whole site itself, it would cost approximately $10 million. The QEC does not have those kinds of funds, but like I said in my previous statement, the contaminated site was prior to the creation of Nunavut and the Government of Canada is responsible for those sites to be remediated.</seg>
<seg id="365">Again, like I said, we are willing to work with the Municipality of Baker Lake to remediate the existing contaminated area.</seg>
<seg id="366">Your final supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="367">As I noted in my questions last week, the question of whether the federal government or the territorial government should be responsible for these cleanup costs remains unresolved.</seg>
<seg id="368">Mr. Speaker, I support the Qulliq Energy Corporation’s long-standing position that the contamination is attributable to events that took place when the site was under federal jurisdiction.</seg>
<seg id="369">Will the Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation commit to working with the Minister of Justice to explore and clarify the legal options that may be open to us in this regard?</seg>
<seg id="370">Hon. Jeannie Ehaloak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Yes, I can commit as Minister of the QEC and Minister of Justice that we will work together to resolve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="371">Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, Mr. Lightstone.</seg>
<seg id="372">Question 125 – 5(1): Educational Leave Policy (Lightstone)</seg>
<seg id="373">My questions are for the Minister responsible for the Public Service Act.</seg>
<seg id="374">Prior year’s Public Service Annual Report included information on how many employees were taking advantage of the government’s generous Education Leave Policy.</seg>
<seg id="375">Unfortunately the 2016-17 Public Service Annual Report did not include that information.</seg>
<seg id="376">Would the minister be willing to provide the Assembly with that information?</seg>
<seg id="377">Minister of Finance, Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="378">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="379">It seems the member would like the annual reports to include the information and the information should be contained in the next report. These annual reports are released annually.</seg>
<seg id="380">With respect to the information that the member stated was missing, I will look into the report to see if it is available.</seg>
<seg id="381">Your first supplementary, Mr. Lightstone.</seg>
<seg id="382">Once again I would just like to ask if the minister would be willing to provide the Assembly with the information on the number of employees that took advantage of the Education Leave Policy in the prior fiscal year, 2016-17.</seg>
<seg id="383">Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="384">Speaker: Thank you. The question has been taken as notice.</seg>
<seg id="385">Member for Pangnirtung, Ms. Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="386">Question 126 – 5(1): Status of Pangnirtung’s Old Health Centre (Nakashuk)</seg>
<seg id="387">Ms. Nakashuk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="388">My questions today are for the Minister of Community and Government Services.</seg>
<seg id="389">As the minister is aware, I have asked this question related to Pangnirtung’s previous health centre, probably now known locally as the old health centre, which is no longer used in any capacity upon the opening of the new health centre.</seg>
<seg id="390">The old health centre has not been in use for quite some time. Nonetheless, all of the windows are boarded up.</seg>
<seg id="391">My question to the minister is whether the department has any plans for this building and if he knows his department’s plans for this old health centre’s future.</seg>
<seg id="392">Minister of Community and Government Services, Minister Kusugak.</seg>
<seg id="393">Hon. Lorne Kusugak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="394">I thank my colleague for asking that question.</seg>
<seg id="395">When old surplus facilities that were owned by the government are not being used anymore by the department responsible, we ask other government departments whether they have any uses for it or not.</seg>
<seg id="396">The old health centre was built in 1975 and Pangnirtung went through that process.</seg>
<seg id="397">The Department of Health had no more use for it.</seg>
<seg id="398">We looked into which department has any use for it and we haven’t heard back from any of them.</seg>
<seg id="399">Using the government standard practice, we are now preparing whether the hamlet has any use for it. That’s where we are right now.</seg>
<seg id="400">If they don’t want the facility, then we will go to the next step of whether a non-profit organization has any use for it.</seg>
<seg id="401">This is the process we use for surplus government facilities.</seg>
<seg id="402">That’s where we stand right now, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="403">Your first supplementary, Ms. Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="404">If I understand correctly, now the community has been asked if they want to take it over. What’s going on?</seg>
<seg id="405">Hon. Lorne Kusugak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="406">We have not heard from government departments if they want to take it over or not.</seg>
<seg id="407">Now we are waiting to see if the municipal government is interested in taking over the building.</seg>
<seg id="408">That’s where we’re at right now.</seg>
<seg id="409">Your final supplementary, Ms. Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="410">Thank you, minister, for answering the question.</seg>
<seg id="411">I don’t know whether the hamlet would be interested in taking over that building. If the hamlet does not want to take it over, what generally happens after that?</seg>
<seg id="412">Thank you for asking questions about that.</seg>
<seg id="413">There are more than four steps that we take.</seg>
<seg id="414">Using the old health centre in Pangnirtung as an example, if the health department no longer requires it, we ask the other government departments if they are interested in taking it over.</seg>
<seg id="415">They were not interested and so we’re now going to see if the hamlet is interested in it.</seg>
<seg id="416">That’s the process that we normally follow.</seg>
<seg id="417">Member for Netsilik…Aivilik, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="418">Question 127 – 5(1): Family Services Client Travel Policy (Netser)</seg>
<seg id="419">Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My name is Natsiq.</seg>
<seg id="420">Mr. Speaker, I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Family Services today.</seg>
<seg id="421">First of all, I would like to say to my constituents, I keep forgetting to say “good afternoon.” I have been here for a while now and I haven’t said “good afternoon,” so I say “good afternoon.”</seg>
<seg id="422">We will be home soon and that’s great.</seg>
<seg id="423">Mr. Speaker, it is an unfortunate reality that some of our more vulnerable Nunavut residents must travel south to receive care, in a strange environment, far away from their home and family.</seg>
<seg id="424">I am sure you will agree that getting a visit from a family member makes all the difference in the world to these individuals.</seg>
<seg id="425">The Family Services Client Travel Policy published on the government website is dated June 2013 and is effective to March 31, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="426">I was given to understand that the former Minister of Family Services had committed to making changes to the Family Services Client Travel Policy.</seg>
<seg id="427">Can the minister clarify whether there have been any revisions to his department’s Client Travel Policy since 2013 and, if not, will he be making any changes after March 31 of this year?</seg>
<seg id="428">Minister of Family Services, Minister Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="429">Hon. Joe Savikataaq: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="430">I can’t comment on any other commitments that may or may not have been said by the previous minister of the day, but I can say that this policy is in effect ‘til the end of March 2018 and, like normal policies, will stay in effect until the new one is in place.</seg>
<seg id="431">I have not heard of any rumblings from within the department to do any changes to this policy.</seg>
<seg id="432">If there needs to be a change, we can look at that, but we’re not going to change a policy just for the sake of changing because it has a sunset clause.</seg>
<seg id="433">We would look at the policy and just see if there has to be any changes that would be beneficial to both the people that take advantage of this travel policy and for the Government of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="434">Your first supplementary, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="435">Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, minister.</seg>
<seg id="436">The Family Services Client Travel Policy’s Client Travel Benefits Guideline currently states that an adult client of Family Services who is in residential care is eligible to receive a visit from two family members or guardians per fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="437">Mr. Speaker, can the minister confirm whether or not this policy has been revised to permit two visits from two family members or guardians per fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="438">It will be two return trips, whether it can be two people going at the same time or one person going at two different times.</seg>
<seg id="439">To make it very simple, two return trips per year per person who is in out-of-community care.</seg>
<seg id="440">Your final supplementary, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="441">Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Will the minister commit to considering changing his department’s Client Travel Policy to increase the visit allocation for adult clients in residential care?</seg>
<seg id="442">This policy is expiring soon and this policy would be looked at, but I can’t commit to anything right off the bat without looking at the policy.</seg>
<seg id="443">The whole policy itself probably will be looked into because a lot of the travel that Family Services paid for are Health clients.</seg>
<seg id="444">Therefore we have to work with Health and make sure that this policy is adhered to and that we’re running it prudently. I can’t commit to anything, but since this travel policy is expiring soon, I’m sure everything that is in this policy will be looked at.</seg>

<seg id="446">Question 128 – 5(1): Contacting the Office of Patient Relations (Qirngnuq)</seg>
<seg id="447">Mr. Qirngnuq: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="448">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Health.</seg>
<seg id="449">Mr. Speaker, from time to time, constituents come to my office in the community to ask for help in getting health issues resolved.</seg>
<seg id="450">As the minister often tells us and earlier this week she even provided a phone number, Nunavummiut can contact the Office of Patient Relations with their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="451">Mr. Speaker, language and even dialect is sometimes a barrier over the phone.</seg>
<seg id="452">Can the minister tell this House what other ways the Office of Patient Relations can be contacted?</seg>
<seg id="453">Minister of Health, Minister Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="454">Hon. Pat Angnakak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="455">I understand your concern and yes, we usually like to try to encourage the toll-free number so you can get somebody right away.</seg>
<seg id="456">I don’t have it right here right now, but there’s an email address as well and perhaps even a fax number.</seg>
<seg id="457">Your first supplementary, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="458">Mr. Qirngnuq: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’m not sure if she answered the question or not, so I will ask this question.</seg>
<seg id="459">Mr. Speaker, the Information and Privacy Commissioner has raised a number of concerns about privacy and confidentiality and I appreciate that we have to be very careful that personal health information does not get into the wrong hands.</seg>
<seg id="460">The Office of Patient Relations has a form that can be filled out explaining a complaint or concern.</seg>
<seg id="461">However, it is not possible for people to submit that form by fax. Not everyone has a computer. They can’t scan the form or send an email.</seg>
<seg id="462">Can the minister explain why it is not possible to contact the Office of Patient Relations by fax?</seg>
<seg id="463">An Hon. Member: Good question.</seg>
<seg id="464">Minister Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="465">That’s a very good question, that’s true.</seg>
<seg id="466">I think because it’s harder and harder to find fax machines, maybe going forward, we tend to use more electronic type of devices such as email or there are websites.</seg>
<seg id="467">I’m just looking at my briefing note here. There’s a government website that can be reached and it is www.patientrelations.gov.nu.ca. I’m sure that we have health centres in every community.</seg>
<seg id="468">If there’s a form that you wanted to fax in, I’m sure the health centres could be used for that. We also have GLO offices in every community.</seg>
<seg id="469">I’m pretty sure that somebody in the community would have a fax that they could send it to our headquarters here.</seg>
<seg id="470">If we don’t have a fax number at the Office of Patient Relations, it’s something I can find out and get back to the member on.</seg>
<seg id="471">Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="472">Question 129 – 5(1): Income Assistance Policies (Towtongie)</seg>
<seg id="473">Ms. Towtongie: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="474">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="475">Mr. Speaker, I would like to follow up on questions asked by the Member for Kugluktuk regarding income assistance policies.</seg>
<seg id="476">The minister has indicated that when income assistance clients go from workplace to workplace with a job search form, this is a “productive choice.”</seg>
<seg id="477">Can the minister explain how doing a job search can be considered a “productive choice” when there are no jobs to be had?</seg>
<seg id="478">Minister of Family Services, Minister Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="479">On productive choices and looking for jobs, in my opinion I would say that if there are no jobs available at all, then it would be useless, but sometimes there are short-term jobs available like casual jobs.</seg>
<seg id="480">Maybe if that person on the right day, on the same day when that casual job is available came in, then the person could get a job.</seg>
<seg id="481">Your first supplementary, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="482">Income support is a policy of the Government of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="483">If it was legislation, it would be impossible to make amendments to the policy.</seg>
<seg id="484">I have seen young people who want you to sign, even though there are no job opportunities. They come every month about productive choices and sometimes they get embarrassed to ask for a job and the individual is feeling down.</seg>
<seg id="485">Can the minister clearly describe what kinds of Nunavut-specific policies they have? Can you come up with a policy for that in the smaller communities?</seg>
<seg id="486">We are following policies that are not geared for Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="487">The policy is just for Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="488">It can’t be used outside the territory.</seg>
<seg id="489">In regard to income assistance, there was a study and the policy has been changed.</seg>
<seg id="490">Anyone who is eligible for income support can request and they cannot claw back your child tax benefits. After the review, some changes have been made to the Income Support Program.</seg>
<seg id="491">We were going to look at the job search form again.</seg>
<seg id="492">It will be impossible to do a job search when there is no employment opportunity in the community. They have to choose a productive choice, so we will look at the productive choices. We are aware of that issue.</seg>
<seg id="493">Question 130 – 5(1): Mine Training (Kaernerk)</seg>
<seg id="494">Mr. Kaernerk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="495">I rise today to ask my questions to the Minister of Economic Development and Transportation.</seg>
<seg id="496">I strongly support responsible mining activities that balance the need to create jobs and business opportunity with the need to protect our environment.</seg>
<seg id="497">My questions today will focus on the issue of job training.</seg>
<seg id="498">The current 2017-18 budget for the Department of Economic Development and Transportation includes a $200,000 Nunavut Mine Training Fund.</seg>
<seg id="499">Can the minister indicate what projects her department has spent this funding on during the current 2017-18 fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="500">Mr. Speaker, I hope that makes sense.</seg>
<seg id="501">Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="502">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="503">I also thank the member for his question.</seg>
<seg id="504">In regard to mining training, although not all of them have been reported… .</seg>
<seg id="505">The department continues to work with the Department of Family Services, Nunavut Arctic College, Government of Canada, minerals industry, and Inuit organizations on a number of programs designed to prepare Nunavummiut for all opportunities in the mineral resource industries. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="506">Your first supplementary, Mr. Kaernerk.</seg>
<seg id="507">Mr. Kaernerk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="508">I thank the minister for her response.</seg>
<seg id="509">Can the minister indicate if her department will be requesting an increase or decrease in this budget for the upcoming 2018-19 fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="510">Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="511">I cannot respond to that question at this time, but perhaps I can get back to the member’s question for the $200,000 as to how the funding was utilized.</seg>
<seg id="512">For the Kitikmeot Corporation drillers’ assistant training, $61,000 was used; for the Qikiqtani Inuit Association for financial literacy, $60,000; as well as for the Hamlet of Arviat for the work readiness program and class 3 airbrakes for $78,000. Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="513">I also thank the minister for elaborating on my question.</seg>
<seg id="514">Earlier in our sitting, I tabled a copy of my recent letter to the president of North Arrow Minerals concerning the Mel Diamond Project in North Baffin.</seg>
<seg id="515">They will be drilling near Hall Beach this spring.</seg>
<seg id="516">Further, with regard to the information I tabled about the proposed work to be undertaken near our community, I wonder if the minister can indicate how her department is working with not only North Arrow Minerals but all mining companies to identify job training opportunities for Inuit near my home community or for Inuit in Quttiktuq.</seg>
<seg id="517">I believe these opportunities can provide beneficial employment for people due to this reasoning and to add further to this, Hall Beach is a smaller community and the project won’t be buying supplies from the community. However, some people have been hired to work on these projects, for which I thank them.</seg>
<seg id="518">As you stated earlier, you will be working to support mining companies.</seg>
<seg id="519">What I am trying to ask about is if these types of activities funded through the allocations the minister mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="520">To use this example, the Mary River project is in the Baffin region, Kivalliq has gold mines opening, and in the Kitikmeot, I think the future mine is also for gold.</seg>
<seg id="521">Will all of the projects have adjacent training courses?</seg>
<seg id="522">To use myself as an example, as I am an Inuk and if I wanted to training to get a more senior position, then what kind of training could be provided so that I could succeed? What type of assistance can the Department of Economic Development offer for prospective workers?</seg>
<seg id="523">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also thank you for your good questions. Economic Development is not alone in this.</seg>
<seg id="524">It’s interdepartmental through education, mining training, and trades. I think it’s also important to acknowledge that mines are at different times and we look at all those as a department. There’s active and advanced development under construction.</seg>
<seg id="525">You take all those into consideration while working with the different departments. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="526">Oral Questions.</seg>
<seg id="527">Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="528">Question 131 – 5(1): Support for Health Centre Staff (Main)</seg>
<seg id="529">Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="530">I rise today to ask questions to the Minister of Health.</seg>
<seg id="531">Let me start by providing some background to my question, as this question applies to numerous communities and not just to my particular community.</seg>
<seg id="532">I believe it applies everywhere in Nunavut as it pops up in various communities and it relates to our nursing staff as well as other workers in our local health centres.</seg>
<seg id="533">We are all aware that frontline health professionals are often tasked with heavy workloads. This chronically heavy workload results from having too many duties, or to say it in English, a full workload. When workloads are too heavy, one nurse sometimes has to undertake these responsibilities, with part of the reason being lack of nursing staff.</seg>
<seg id="534">When nurses are subject to extra work due to the lack of staff, it can lead to staff burnout, as a lack of replacement nurses results in more work for the remaining nurses who must still complete their tasks.</seg>
<seg id="535">It seems quite obvious that staff shortages leads to some nurses being overworked.</seg>
<seg id="536">It would appear to be quite evident in this case, and hopefully I am being understandable as I am speaking my dialect and I hope my colleagues comprehend my concerns here.</seg>
<seg id="537">Perhaps I will reiterate it in English. Mr. Speaker, it appears that there is an increasingly cyclical pattern with staff shortages contributing to an ever-increasing workload and burnout, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="538">My first question for the minister is: can the minister tell this House what steps her department has taken to provide additional support and resources, particularly to the health centre staff in communities which suffer from chronic workloads and burnout?</seg>
<seg id="539">Minister of Health, Minister Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="540">I thank the member for that really important question.</seg>
<seg id="541">I think the issue of staffing regarding health centres and nursing is a very important one. It’s something that we have always been working very hard as a department to ensure that we can have enough staff at all health centres as much as possible.</seg>
<seg id="542">That doesn’t always happen.</seg>
<seg id="543">I am aware of circumstances where yes, nurses feel very tired and very burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="544">The department does what it can when we come across such situations.</seg>
<seg id="545">We just had that situation in one of the communities and the department then sent additional nurses where we could.</seg>
<seg id="546">You’ve got to look at where can be spare a nurse or two and then once that is determined, they try to send that nurse to that community where maybe the workload is more than usual.</seg>
<seg id="547">It can be any kind of circumstances going on. Maybe somebody has gone on leave, and then the community perhaps came down with a lot of cases of flu or something, those kinds of impacts. What we try to do is we look at where else can we send some nurses from one area to another.</seg>
<seg id="548">We’re always trying to recruit nurses. We want to make sure that we keep the numbers up, that we have enough nurses to deliver the health care service in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="549">Your first supplementary, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="550">Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="551">I thank the minister for her response.</seg>
<seg id="552">I think we share this concern. In reviewing the department’s most recent staffing statistics, I’ll use the communities I represent as example. It is clear that vacancy rates remain unacceptably high in some health centres.</seg>
<seg id="553">According to the latest statistics, Whale Cove has a 70 percent vacancy rate; Arviat, 44 percent vacancy rate.</seg>
<seg id="554">I understand that this is a challenging issue and that it’s very complicated.</seg>
<seg id="555">I would like to ask the minister if the minister could describe some of the challenges her department faces in providing additional and adequate staff in these communities which face consistently heavy workloads.</seg>
<seg id="556">Minister Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="557">Our problem is once the 30 months is done, we can’t keep our nurses. They leave. They’ve had the experience and maybe the novelty has worn off, but it’s very stressful being a nurse in the community.</seg>
<seg id="558">You have to look at everything when somebody comes into a community and what kind of support they have. This is something the department has been working very hard in trying to address.</seg>
<seg id="559">Your final supplementary, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="560">I thank the minister for her response.</seg>
<seg id="561">I’ll try to rephrase it. Mr. Speaker, we know that there are issues in some of these communities where there are chronically heavy workloads and chronically short-staffed crews of health care professionals.</seg>
<seg id="562">I would like to understand specifically what is being done to address the issue in those communities specifically. What is being done?</seg>
<seg id="563">What is being considered in terms of making sure that our nurses and other health care staff are getting the support they need from the department?</seg>
<seg id="564">Hon. Pat Angnakak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="565">I know you want the specifics, but I perhaps don’t have an exhaustive list of what’s being done because that’s operational.</seg>
<seg id="566">We’re on, let’s say, an emergency basis only where people can’t make regular appointments” because maybe the workload is too much or too many nurses have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="567">The department, like I said before, is trying to fill all the positions that we can. It’s difficult to do that because we’re in competition with the rest of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="568">That’s one thing that they’re trying to do. I know that they work with an agency as well to try to hire northern nurses, people who have had experience working in the north, not so much always the Arctic but let’s say northern Manitoba.</seg>
<seg id="569">There are different areas that we’re trying to address this. I know that the Department of Health is very conscious of what a lot of our nurses go through and are trying to help in whatever way they can.</seg>
<seg id="570">That is not an easy thing. It’s not something we can solve overnight. It’s something we all have to keep working on and if you have any ideas, let me know.</seg>
<seg id="571">Question 132 – 5(1): Insurance Policy on Government Assets (Hickes)</seg>
<seg id="572">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="573">My next set of questions is directed at the Minister of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="574">As we’re all aware, in all the communities across the territory, the government owns a number of different pieces of infrastructure. There are airport terminals, health centres, schools, office buildings, and etcetera.</seg>
<seg id="575">My question to the minister is: for insurance purposes, are all those pieces of infrastructure lumped together in one policy or are they separated by need?</seg>
<seg id="576">Minister of Finance, Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="577">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Our insurance is broken into different stages and it all depends on exactly which property it is.</seg>
<seg id="578">Each of our property has slightly different policies, and some don’t even have policies. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="579">As I noticed recently in the news, there was an attempt by somebody in one of our communities to start a fire again at one of our community’s schools.</seg>
<seg id="580">I know the Department of Finance has taken measures to make sure that our infrastructure is insured for the appropriate amount. We also learned that our deductible on schools, as an example, is $10 million.</seg>
<seg id="581">What are the implications with our insurance provider if another school goes up in flames, Mr. Speaker?</seg>
<seg id="582">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Our current insurance premium has jumped from $10 million to $20 million for our schools in result of the fires that have taken place.</seg>
<seg id="583">We continue to advocate that through our Department of Education and through all of us to try to encourage people to prevent that. Those are very valuable properties that sadly there have been attempts of them being burned down.</seg>
<seg id="584">We need to try to communicate and ensure that we show that we are doing our diligence through our security systems and through various… . We need to prove that we are doing better and we are trying to do better because the insurance deductible is rising and rising to a point where we have to insure it ourselves. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="585">I appreciate that information and it scares me when we talk about having insurance premiums of half or more of the value of a building.</seg>
<seg id="586">I did ask what would happen if another school went up.</seg>
<seg id="587">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I hope that we will continue to be insurable.</seg>
<seg id="588">This recent one of $20 million is a result of schools being burnt down.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the rest of our other buildings, the deductible is at $1 million.</seg>
<seg id="590">There are different varieties of this.</seg>
<seg id="591">I can’t say before how many schools are burnt that we will be uninsurable.</seg>
<seg id="592">I hope that under our watch that we don’t see another school being burnt. I applaud the questions and applaud our efforts to try to do this. Together, as all members, we need to continue to advocate that these are to educate our children and educate the public.</seg>
<seg id="593">I think, not only for schools but even for health centres, those are very valuable properties that we try to run our services.</seg>
<seg id="594">Any property damage causes a lot of grief to people that we serve. I want to continue advocating that our buildings are ours.</seg>
<seg id="595">As our Speaker continues to remind us, this is everybody’s House.</seg>
<seg id="596">We need to remind all of our students and all of the public that schools, health centres, and garages are all of the public’s buildings and they are there to serve the public.</seg>
<seg id="597">I applaud and thank for questioning this and raising this in this House. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="598">Question 133 – 5(1): Increasing Educational Opportunities in Baker Lake (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="599">I would like to direct my question to the Minister responsible for Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="600">Mr. Speaker, in my member’s statement I noted that we, as the Fifth Assembly of Nunavut, have a new opportunity to push our territory towards a bright future.</seg>
<seg id="601">Can the minister tell this House whether he would be willing to reopen the consideration of establishing a university in Nunavut in partnership with the private sector and others?</seg>
<seg id="602">Minister responsible for Nunavut Arctic College, Minister Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="603">I also thank the Member for Baker Lake for asking that question.</seg>
<seg id="604">Nunavut Arctic College drafted a request for proposals, asking different universities outside of Nunavut on ways to collaborate on various courses that we could jointly offer.</seg>
<seg id="605">We started to develop a plan, although we were made aware that different bodies, for example, Agnico Eagle placed funds aside specifically for the creation of a university in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="606">This work is something we would like to continue to pursue. However, we have tried to draft up an agreement with some universities outside of Nunavut on developing a collaborative approach towards this goal.</seg>
<seg id="607">I truly feel that we must invest in expanding educational opportunities from Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit such as that delivered by the Piqqusilirivvik program to higher academics such as the kind of education that would be delivered in a university setting.</seg>
<seg id="608">Of course I feel that Baker Lake would be the perfect location for such an expansion.</seg>
<seg id="609">Can the minister clarify whether he and his officials have been in discussion with the Board of Governors of Nunavut Arctic College to develop a vision of how greater opportunities for higher education can be delivered in Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="610">Minister Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="611">Nunavut Arctic College shares that desire to provide greater opportunities for Nunavummiut to be able to receive a university degree in their home territory. What we have started noting is that emergence of online distance learning courses, as that is another avenue to research.</seg>
<seg id="612">With respect to the matter the member referred to regarding Piqqusilirivvik and how more programming could be disseminated to the satellite communities, it is another idea which we are contemplating.</seg>
<seg id="613">The board of governors of Arctic College will be involved in this initiative along with my officials. Specifically the Arctic College president and vice-president will be developing a plan to move towards this goal that can provide us momentum forward.</seg>
<seg id="614">Your final supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="615">Mr. Mikkungwak: Mr. Speaker, I recognize that the previous government accepted a recommendation not to pursue the option of a Nunavut university at that time.</seg>
<seg id="616">Will the minister commit to revisiting this concept and reporting back to the House on his findings?</seg>
<seg id="617">Minister Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="618">Hon. David Joanasie: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thank Mr. Mikkungwak for his question.</seg>
<seg id="619">That option about building a university in Nunavut, people have different ideas about it.</seg>
<seg id="620">Like I said, Agnico Eagle has earmarked $5 million towards a new facility if there is a will to do that.</seg>
<seg id="621">I think it’s still an ongoing discussion.</seg>
<seg id="622">Within this mandate over the next four years, I’m not sure if that is the route we want to take given that we just completed a fairly extensive feasibility study which we’re going to take into consideration and proceed as we need.</seg>
<seg id="623">Members, please note that the time for question period has expired.</seg>
<seg id="624">Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="625">Motion 015 – 5(1): Extension of Question Period (Main)</seg>
<seg id="626">Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Pursuant to Rule 39(7), I move, seconded by the Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, that the time allotted for oral questions be extended. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="627">The motion is in order and it is not debatable.</seg>
<seg id="628">All those in favour of the motion, please raise your hand.</seg>
<seg id="629">All those opposed.</seg>
<seg id="630">Therefore question period will be extended for an additional 30 minutes staring now.</seg>
<seg id="631">Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="632">Question 134 – 5(1): Grants and Contributions Programs (Main)</seg>
<seg id="633">Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="634">I rise to ask my question to the Minister of Environment, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="635">I would like to ask about the Department of Environment’s hunting programs and I would like information on how they actually benefit our hunters.</seg>
<seg id="636">Looking at the government’s main estimates for 2017-18, those programs are in three parts.</seg>
<seg id="637">Let me speak in English so that I’m clear. There are three grants under the Department of Environment that are administered for disaster compensation, wildlife damage compensation, and finally the Fur Pricing Program.</seg>
<seg id="638">The budgeted amount for these grants is $150,000 for the current fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="639">First of all, I wonder if the minister could explain how the department evaluates the effectiveness of these programs.</seg>
<seg id="640">Minister of Environment, Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="641">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and for that question.</seg>
<seg id="642">I know that that happens at least, I think it’s three times a year. I don’t have the details of that yet, but I know they just had a fur harvesters’ auction beginning of March. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="643">Your first supplementary, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="644">I thank the minister for bringing up particularly the fur markets.</seg>
<seg id="645">Mr. Speaker, information provided in this House in years past is very interesting to me and perhaps other harvesters in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="646">In 2011 the Department of Environment stated that the value of pelts auctioned off to the Fur Harvesters Auction was around $800,000.</seg>
<seg id="647">In 2012 it was around $1.1 million and in 2013 it was $1.04 million.</seg>
<seg id="648">Mr. Speaker, I wonder if the minister could give us an update in terms of how the fur markets are proceeding this year in terms of the latest information that she has available. It could be this year or it could be last year. I’m interested in the health and the economic viability or state of the fur markets.</seg>
<seg id="649">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I, too, have the same information you just read off actually.</seg>
<seg id="650">I cannot say where they’re at because I don’t have the results of the Fur Harvesters Auction recently.</seg>
<seg id="651">I can tell you that my hope is after the Northern Lights, it was doubled in sales when it comes to the industry and I hope that that will be an indication of what’s coming by way of the Fur Harvesters Auction. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="652">Your final supplementary, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="653">I also thank the minister.</seg>
<seg id="654">This is my final question on this, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="655">Can the Department of Environment make considerations to get more cash into the hands of our hunters to help them out?</seg>
<seg id="656">We know who the fox trappers and sealskin producers are.</seg>
<seg id="657">I think that the money that is used within a year is too small, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="658">I believe it’s just too small.</seg>
<seg id="659">Can the minister agree with me on this fact? Can the minister check into this in the coming months?</seg>
<seg id="660">I agree with you. I look forward to tabling one day to increase that.</seg>
<seg id="661">Question 135 – 5(1): Compensation Program for Hunters and Trappers (Keyootak)</seg>
<seg id="662">My question will be directed to the Minister of Environment.</seg>
<seg id="663">Mr. Speaker, we are all aware in Nunavut that our hunters’ equipment gets damaged, especially by polar bears. Their shacks get broken up and their important property like snowmobiles is damaged.</seg>
<seg id="664">Mr. Speaker, there is a compensation program for damaged equipment, but it’s very hard to access that money.</seg>
<seg id="665">Has the funding for wildlife damage compensation programs been depleted this year?</seg>
<seg id="666">Minister of Environment, Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="667">My apologies. I didn’t hear the whole question.</seg>
<seg id="668">Can he repeat the question, please?</seg>
<seg id="669">Speaker: Please repeat your question, Mr. Keyootak.</seg>
<seg id="670">Our properties like snowmobiles and shacks get damaged, especially by polar bears, when we’re not there.</seg>
<seg id="671">We all know that there are compensation programs for wildlife damage to property.</seg>
<seg id="672">My question was: has the budget for damage compensation been depleted this fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="673">Speaker: Thank you for clarifying the question.</seg>
<seg id="674">Minister of Environment, Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="675">Your first supplementary, Mr. Keyootak.</seg>
<seg id="676">The minister said that she would respond after she gets the information.</seg>
<seg id="677">Can she break it down between the Baffin region, the Kivalliq region, and the Kitikmeot region?</seg>
<seg id="678">Yes, I can provide a breakdown of the list.</seg>
<seg id="679">Question 136 – 5(1): Child Care and Early Learning Program (Hickes)</seg>
<seg id="680">I would like to direct my questions today to the Minister of Education.</seg>
<seg id="681">In his minister’s statement this afternoon he stated that all eligible licensed child care facilities will receive an increase and he gave a range of numbers dependent on the number, type, and location of the spaces.</seg>
<seg id="682">Is there an overall budget associated within this range? What is the total amount that is being provided to our licensed child care facilities?</seg>
<seg id="683">Minister of Education, Minister Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="684">Hon. David Joanasie: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="685">I thank Mr. Hickes for his question.</seg>
<seg id="686">Cabinet approved the signing of a multilateral framework for this agreement. It’s a three-year agreement and over the three years I think it’s broken down by four different categories.</seg>
<seg id="687">If you want specific statistics operations-wise, O&M would be overall $1.1 million for each year. It’s broken down into that.</seg>
<seg id="688">That’s kind of the overall numbers I have.</seg>
<seg id="689">I thank the minister for those details.</seg>
<seg id="690">Mr. Speaker, when I’m looking at the daycare regulations for Nunavut, A manual for early childhood programs, section 17 in the staffing speaks to “For all staff involved in the delivery of the daily program, it is recommended to include training as one of the expectations.”</seg>
<seg id="691">Mr. Speaker, I know there are a number of different programs offered within the Early Childhood Division as well as Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="692">How is success measured? How is this tracked from licensed daycare facilities across the territory to make sure that training is encouraged for day-to-day staff?</seg>
<seg id="693">Hon. David Joanasie: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Hickes, again.</seg>
<seg id="694">Training is one part of this agreement over the three years.</seg>
<seg id="695">That’s one of the other components outside of the $1.1 million for operations costs.</seg>
<seg id="696">We want to get more and more certified ECE workers that might already be working in a daycare facility.</seg>
<seg id="697">It’s an area that we want to continue to boost. Training and ongoing training on the job are some things that we look forward to over the three years and beyond.</seg>
<seg id="698">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="699">I encourage the minister to keep following up with that information.</seg>
<seg id="700">When we’re looking at workers in our licensed daycare facilities and the training that’s available, I’m always encouraged to hear from daycare workers when training is available. It makes them feel more valued. It makes them feel more knowledgeable and more empowered.</seg>
<seg id="701">One of the concerns I also hear, though, is the wage levels for people working in our licensed daycare facilities. Mr. Speaker, the turnover, as I’m sure all members are aware, is quite high.</seg>
<seg id="702">When you’re trying to provide a consistent educational environment for our children before they get into the actual K to 12 system, it is imperative that there be stability at that level.</seg>
<seg id="703">Is one of the conditions of this funding to be able to subsidize licensed daycare facilities for salaries to improve the option of a career path for our daycare workers, not a placeholder but a career path?</seg>
<seg id="704">I agree with Mr. Hickes. I totally agree in that we want to prepare our children best for a successful start in life prior to entering the school.</seg>
<seg id="705">I think part of that is we need to do our best to support our child care workers.</seg>
<seg id="706">We don’t want parents to see an increase in their parental fees. I’m hoping that we can work something out and that this agreement will mean that our child care workers are getting the value that they so deserve.</seg>
<seg id="707">I want to continuously work towards having that in our child care facilities across the north and across Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="708">Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="709">Question 137 – 5(1): Inuit Content Requirements for Government Contracts (Main)</seg>
<seg id="710">On Friday, March 16, I was speaking with the Minister of Community and Government Services.</seg>
<seg id="711">I wanted to get clarification in regard to the number of Inuit labour content.</seg>
<seg id="712">Mr. Speaker, it seems like the minister and I was in agreement and that he was in support of increasing the percentage of Inuit labour content.</seg>
<seg id="713">The 20 percent is being used for the Qikiqtaaluk Correctional Healing Centre and also for marine infrastructure in Iqaluit and Pond Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="714">If I understood correctly, the Inuit labour content is at 15 percent and 20 percent.</seg>
<seg id="715">Can the minister report to us how much they will be increasing the Inuit labour content for this tender, if the department is allowed to increase that figure?</seg>
<seg id="716">Minister of Community and Government Services, Minister Kusugak.</seg>
<seg id="717">I believe the member understands how it should be tendered through the department. The department helps the client departments.</seg>
<seg id="718">When it comes to marine infrastructure, Economic Development and Transportation is responsible. If we’re talking about correctional facilities, we work with the Department of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="719">We work with the client department to make sure that the contract is being followed.</seg>
<seg id="720">We work with the client department and they figure out what the Inuit labour content it should be.</seg>
<seg id="721">They try not to go over that level and we try to work with the “achievables” with the clients departments.</seg>
<seg id="722">I cannot tell you at this time and, as the tender has already been released to the public, I believe it would be impossible to make that change now, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="723">Let me continue my line of questioning.</seg>
<seg id="724">Now, if it reached the point of being unable to make changes to the work being tendered, are there any other ways to make positions available to Inuit?</seg>
<seg id="725">Is the Department of CGS able to work on this type of initiative?</seg>
<seg id="726">I hope I am being understandable here, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="727">Maybe I’ll rephrase that. Can the minister tell the House what the situation is for labourers from other communities inside Nunavut when it comes to seeking employment with a major construction project and are the workers from inside of Nunavut eligible for the same employer benefits that are received by labourers from outside of Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="728">Hon. Lorne Kusugak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="729">Thank you for rephrasing your question.</seg>
<seg id="730">Mr. Speaker, in the NNI Policy, the requirement for contract authority assesses the following factors in setting the Inuit labour requirement:</seg>
<seg id="731">The nature of skills required for work;</seg>
<seg id="732">The Inuit labour available with the required skills; and</seg>
<seg id="733">Other projects in the community that might impact the amount of Inuit labour force available.</seg>
<seg id="734">Mr. Speaker, we encourage all contractors to first hire local, hire regional, and hire Nunavut before seeking employers elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="735">That is encouraged and asked of all of the people who come into Nunavut to seek employers.</seg>
<seg id="736">We always encourage that and our client departments.</seg>
<seg id="737">We work very closely with our client departments in setting these “achievables.”</seg>
<seg id="738">Your final supplementary, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="739">Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="740">As a final question I’ll ask for a commitment from the minister. Can the minister commit to working with the client departments involved, specifically with these major construction projects that we just previously mentioned?</seg>
<seg id="741">Can the minister commit to working with these client departments to make sure the jobs are posted and that Inuit have a chance to apply on construction jobs from outside of a single community? He mentioned regional hiring and Nunavut hiring.</seg>
<seg id="742">Can the minister commit to making sure that this is taken into consideration by the construction firms which eventually will win the contracts?</seg>
<seg id="743">I believe that the Nunavut government as a whole encourages people who are out there looking for employers to first look within Nunavut to hire.</seg>
<seg id="744">That’s the way we have always gone and that’s the way we will continue to go, Mr. Speaker.</seg>

<seg id="750">Last week I tabled a copy of my recent correspondence with the president of North Arrow Minerals outlining my concerns about their proposed drilling project near my home community of Hall Beach.</seg>
<seg id="751">As I stated earlier today, I will voice my support for these mining companies on behalf of my constituents in Amittuq, as there are not many employment opportunities available in our area.</seg>
<seg id="752">Today I am quite pleased to table the response from the president of North Arrow Minerals as he appended the company’s 2018 annual report on their plans to develop their project.</seg>

<seg id="781">Mr. Main.</seg>

<seg id="783">We wish to commence the review of Bill 2, followed by the review of Bill 3 and Bill 4 and the supporting budget documents.</seg>
<seg id="784">Chairman: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="785">Is the committee in agreement that we first start with Bill 2?</seg>
<seg id="786">Again, do we agree?</seg>
<seg id="787">Bill 02 – Interim Appropriation (Operations & Maintenance) Act, April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018 – Consideration in Committee</seg>
<seg id="788">You can find Bill 2 in your legislative white binder that’s down below your seats.</seg>
<seg id="789">To continue, I would now like to ask Mr. Akeeagok if you have any witnesses that you would like to appear at the witness table with you.</seg>
<seg id="790">Hon. David Akeeagok: Yes, with your permission, I would like officials with me at the table.</seg>
<seg id="791">Chairman: Thank you. Do members agree to have the witnesses appear before the committee?</seg>
<seg id="792">Sergeant-at-Arms, if you could please escort the witnesses in.</seg>
<seg id="793">Mr. Akeeagok, if you could introduce your witnesses and please proceed on into your opening comments.</seg>
<seg id="794">On my left is my Assistant Deputy Minister, Dan Carlson.</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am here to present Bill 2, Interim Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, 2018-2019.</seg>
<seg id="796">Through this bill, our government is seeking legal authority to spend up to $491,804,000 between April 1, 2018 and June 30, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="797">Mr. Chairman, at this time of year the Minister of Finance would normally seek funding for a full fiscal year. However, our Fifth Assembly only recently sat together to develop our shared mandate and priorities.</seg>
<seg id="798">Because we would like our 2018-19 budget to reflect our shared plans and goals, I plan to table the full 2018-19 main estimates for the Assembly’s consideration during the upcoming spring session in May and June.</seg>
<seg id="799">Until then we will require an interim appropriation so that our departments can continue to deliver the basic programs and services Nunavummiut rely on for the next few months.</seg>
<seg id="800">This approach follows the budgeting process used in the year after the elections.</seg>
<seg id="801">Mr. Chairman, all departments and territorial corporations have had an opportunity to review the proposed interim amounts. Our calculations are based on departments’ spending patterns and cash flows needed over the last four years.</seg>
<seg id="802">We are satisfied the amounts we are seeking are enough to cover operations until the Assembly has had an opportunity to review and pass the full year’s budget.</seg>
<seg id="803">In particular Bill 2 seeks the following appropriations:</seg>
<seg id="804">$8.62 million to the Office of the Legislative Assembly;</seg>
<seg id="805">$11.66 million to the Department of Executive and Intergovernmental Affairs;</seg>
<seg id="806">$29.08 million to the Department of Finance;</seg>
<seg id="807">$49.1 million to the Department of Family Services;</seg>
<seg id="808">$32.44 million to the Department of Justice;</seg>
<seg id="809">$10.77 million to the Department of Culture and Heritage;</seg>
<seg id="810">$64.1 million to the Department of Education;</seg>
<seg id="811">$85.77 million to the Department of Health;</seg>
<seg id="812">$8.32 million to the Department of Environment;</seg>
<seg id="813">$82.73 million to the Department of Community and Government Services;</seg>
<seg id="814">$23.29 million to the Department of Economic Development and Transportation;</seg>
<seg id="815">$73.39 million to the Nunavut Housing Corporation; and</seg>
<seg id="816">$12.54 million to Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="817">Mr. Chairman, this concludes my opening comments.</seg>
<seg id="818">I would be pleased to take any questions or comments.</seg>
<seg id="819">I will now ask if any committee members have general comments.</seg>
<seg id="820">Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="821">Ms. Towtongie: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="822">Just on the Inuktitut because I was reading Inuktitut, $32.44 million to the Department of Justice, in the Inuktitut, it tells me $32.44 million to the Legislative Assembly, “Maligalirijikkunnut.”</seg>
<seg id="823">There’s a differentiation in the translation because $8.6 million in the Inuktitut also says $8.62 million for the Office of the Legislative Assembly. “Maligalirijikkunnut,” I need a clarification if that’s for the Legislative Assembly or for Justice.</seg>
<seg id="824">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. For clarification, the Office of the Legislative Assembly, through this interim appropriation, is seeking $8.62 million and the Department of Justice is seeking $32.44 million.</seg>
<seg id="825">I’m sorry if the translation for this document was inaccurate. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="826">Yes, the English version is correct.</seg>
<seg id="827">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="828">I just have a general question. I know that with this interim appropriation, it is just basically a percentage of previous budgets that has been applied for and it follows the budgeting process used previously in election years.</seg>
<seg id="829">I know there has been a lot of discussion around this House about the budget process, and the minister himself has said that there needs to be some fairly serious changes to the process to truly give an accurate picture of what a department needs to provide the services that it’s mandated to do to Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="830">I know it’s not directly related to this bill, Mr. Chairman, but it does have direct relevance to the impact of this.</seg>
<seg id="831">Have there been any substantial changes to the budgetary process that are going to be upcoming in the next appropriation phase of this?</seg>
<seg id="832">Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="833">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you very much for the question.</seg>
<seg id="834">At this point there’s no direct change for the operations and maintenance process at this time, but I have committed that we’re likely to see the capital appropriations process this coming fall. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="835">No more comments?</seg>
<seg id="836">Okay. At this time I will allow members if they have any questions on the minister’s opening comments, please do so now.</seg>
<seg id="837">If not, we will move on to clause by clause.</seg>
<seg id="838">In the white binder that is below your desk, go to Bill 2.</seg>
<seg id="839">Bill 2, Interim Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="840">Chairman: Clause 2. Do members agree?</seg>
<seg id="841">Chairman: Go to Schedule on page 2. Schedule. Interim Amounts Appropriated for the Period of April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="842">Vote 1: Operations and Maintenance. Total Interim Appropriation. $491,804,000.</seg>
<seg id="843">Mr. Main, do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="844">Mr. Main: Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="845">I’m unsure if I should have raised this earlier, but I have a question regarding the departments that deliver grants and contributions funding.</seg>
<seg id="846">My understanding is that these amounts represent a percentage of the annual budget, but some grants and contributions programs are typically spent… . The complete amount for the entire year will be spent very quickly following April 1.</seg>
<seg id="847">I would just like clarification. When it comes to these grants and contributions programs, particularly economic development or Nunavut Housing Corporation, how is this issue being dealt with given that this budget is not intended to last for an entire fiscal year, but some programs are administered on yearly basis?</seg>
<seg id="848">Chairman: Thank you, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="849">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A very good question.</seg>
<seg id="850">It’s something that, through this budget process, as in my opening comments, we looked at the last four years of spending by each department. Some of them spent their first quarter a lot more, especially on grants and contributions, as you have mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="851">I can easily say that Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation are the two major ones that you can see their budget reflection in this, that their grants and contributions are geared towards keeping the operations.</seg>
<seg id="852">When it comes to application-based where it requires applications, there are certain things that each department does slightly different and that’s where we have been able to look at for the last four years each of the departments’ spending patterns by each quarter and our finance through. We analyze it and come up with and agree to with the departments in terms of how much grants and contributions they need towards this.</seg>
<seg id="853">Chairman: Thank you, Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="854">Just as a follow-up question, can the minister confirm that it will be business as normal when it comes to these programs, or have there been any programs that have been placed on hold or placed on freeze, or is it just a straight across the board business as normal situation?</seg>
<seg id="855">Chairman: Thank you, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="856">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We have given the departments that this has to be status quo and these are the amounts that have been given to us.</seg>
<seg id="857">Hopefully by tomorrow we will have put our mandate which we will then look at for future spending, but before we are able to make these decisions as the Fifth Assembly, I have given directions to the departments and to our ministers that this should be status quo for the next three months. Come May is when we would look at those programs.</seg>
<seg id="858">Ms. Towtongie, you had a question. No? Okay.</seg>
<seg id="859">Sorry. Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="860">Mr. Qirngnuq: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome, minister and your officials.</seg>
<seg id="861">The appropriation of $491,804,000, there are figures above that on the top portion of the page.</seg>
<seg id="862">First of all, to use as an example, in Bill 2, there is $8,603,000. In the minister’s opening comments, it says $8.62 million.</seg>
<seg id="863">The $3,000 is not included in your opening comments, and there’s a total difference of $64,000.</seg>
<seg id="864">Why is it written that way?</seg>
<seg id="865">That is my question.</seg>
<seg id="866">Chairman: Thank you, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="867">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="868">Bill 2, with three pages, those are the actual numbers that we are trying to get approved.</seg>
<seg id="869">Those are the exact numbers.</seg>
<seg id="870">In my opening comments, we just rounded it off. In English, it’s rounded up or rounded down and that is listed in the opening comments. I didn’t want to mention all of the exact numbers, so we just rounded off the numbers in my opening comments.</seg>
<seg id="871">Just for clarification, the numbers that we will be using are accurate in the bill itself, so these are the numbers we will be using. He just rounded them off in his opening comments.</seg>
<seg id="872">Again, Total Interim Appropriation. $491,804,000. Agreed?</seg>
<seg id="873">Clause 5. Do members agree?</seg>
<seg id="874">Chairman: Do members agree to Bill 2 as a whole?</seg>
<seg id="875">Do members agree, pursuant to Rule 62(2), that Bill 2 can be placed on the orders of the day for third reading?</seg>
<seg id="876">Minister Akeeagok, do you have any closing comments?</seg>
<seg id="877">Hon. David Akeeagok: Mr. Chairman, I would just like to thank our staff for getting this put together to keeping this government operational up to June.</seg>
<seg id="878">I really sincerely thank each of the members for help in approving this through this appropriation. I look forward to sitting here along with my colleagues on each of our entire budgets come May and June.</seg>
<seg id="879">I just wanted to thank everybody for that.</seg>
<seg id="880">That completes Bill 2.</seg>
<seg id="881">I will now ask the minister if we can proceed on to his comments on Bill 3.</seg>
<seg id="882">Bill 03 – Supplementary Appropriation (Operations & Maintenance) Act, No. 3, 2017-2018 – Consideration in Committee</seg>
<seg id="883">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="884">I would like to keep my officials here. I would like you all to know that I will have to change my witnesses with the other items and I’ll be calling witnesses as necessary as we proceed, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="885">Can I start my opening remarks?</seg>
<seg id="886">I appear before you today to present Bill 3, Supplementary Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, 2017-2018, No. 3. Through this bill, the government is seeking to increase its overall appropriation by $56,602,000 as follows:</seg>
<seg id="887">$49 million to the Department of Health, required to address cost overruns in a variety of health programs, including medical travel, mental health and treatment, elders’ long-term residential care, hospitals and physicians treatment, and TB screening clinic;</seg>
<seg id="888">$6.2 million to the Department of Justice, required to address projected cost overruns within the RCMP, Corrections and Court Operations Branch; and</seg>
<seg id="889">$1,402,000 for the Department of Family Services to address the projected cost overruns with Children and Family Services and Corporate Services branches.</seg>
<seg id="890">Mr. Chairman, this concludes my opening comments. I would be pleased to take any questions or comments. We are quite open for that.</seg>
<seg id="891">Are there any general comments?</seg>
<seg id="892">Supplementary Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) 2017-18, No. 3. Family Services. Not Previously Authorized.</seg>
<seg id="893">Total Children and Family Services. $1,402,000.</seg>
<seg id="894">I see that number in the details, but it still doesn’t really give me an answer on where the focus… .</seg>
<seg id="895">Minister Savikataaq, are you prepared to answer that question?</seg>
<seg id="896">Hon. Joe Savikataaq: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="897">I don’t have exact categories broken down exactly how much and the numbers, but the two main categories are we’re sending more people for out-of-territory care and we’re also sending more people to visit the clients that we have out-of-territory and out-of-settlement care.</seg>
<seg id="898">For example, if they have an elder in Igloolik or Gjoa Haven or down in Ottawa, then we pay for the people to go visit clients.</seg>
<seg id="899">These are not our clients that are going down to go do the visiting.</seg>
<seg id="900">Those two are the main categories, so more people being sent out for treatment, elders’ care, and out-of-territory care for people who can’t get the services within Nunavut and more people travelling to visit people who are out of the community care.</seg>
<seg id="901">With the consolidation of senior services last year of bringing all Family Services responsibility for seniors back into the Department of Health, are there currently any senior programs through Family Services that they’re still having expenditures on?</seg>
<seg id="902">I believe our minister just mentioned that some of them are not necessarily Family Services care, under their care.</seg>
<seg id="903">Some of them are under health care and those are an example of seniors who are under health care that families want to travel and go see them. There’s a program that’s available through Family Services and that program would be used.</seg>
<seg id="904">That’s one of the examples. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="905">I realize that from a family visit or the visiting people in residential care does fall under Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="906">Just a clarification on the question that I asked, are there still any seniors being provided any type of care through Family Services that hasn’t been transferred over to the Department of Health?</seg>
<seg id="907">Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="908">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Based on the information that I currently have, anything that was to be transferred to Health has been transferred to Health.</seg>
<seg id="909">There are budgets for Health towards that. Anything that was not transferred back to Health is still run as Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="910">That’s the two distinctions, but for whether there are any programs that haven’t gone to Family Services, looking through the information and looking at our business plans, I don’t think there are any outstanding programs. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="911">I don’t know if you’re as confused as I am about that response, but maybe if the minister would care to redirect his question to the minister responsible to get some clarity, it might be appreciated.</seg>
<seg id="912">It’s up to Minister Akeeagok if he wants to redirect the question and I’ll leave it up to him.</seg>
<seg id="913">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’ll try to clarify.</seg>
<seg id="914">The question that I thought I asked was, “Are there programs that are in Health that are supposed to be in Family Services or in Family Services that are supposed to be in Health?”</seg>
<seg id="915">The answer that I provided was what’s in Health is there when it comes to senior care, what’s there right now.</seg>
<seg id="916">What’s in Family Services is in Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="917">This supplementary appropriation is focused on what Family Services has over-expended. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="918">I appreciate that response and clarification from the minister.</seg>
<seg id="919">I do understand now.</seg>
<seg id="920">Maybe I’m asking the question a little bit unclear.</seg>
<seg id="921">Does the Department of Family Services still have any senior programs under its responsibility?</seg>
<seg id="922">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yes, there are programs that are geared towards seniors and if I missed any programs, through you, I’ll ask our family services minister.</seg>
<seg id="923">The programs that I’m currently aware of are the Senior Fuel Subsidy program, the income assistance for seniors, and Family Services may have clients that are over 60. Those are the programs that Family Services would be operating.</seg>
<seg id="924">If I did miss anything, I would ask that I have Minister Savikataaq assist me on this question. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="925">I thank both ministers for that clarification.</seg>
<seg id="926">I just have, I believe, one final question.</seg>
<seg id="927">When somebody is sent outside of the territory to receive care, are they still eligible for income support? If they are in a southern facility, are they still getting income support?</seg>
<seg id="928">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Through you, I’ll ask for Minister Savikataaq to respond to that question. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="929">Chairman: Thank you, minister.</seg>
<seg id="930">It really depends on the situation. It’s case by case.</seg>
<seg id="931">There may be some instances where they would be allowed on income support, but I can’t give a broad statement.</seg>
<seg id="932">I have a question here on the details.</seg>
<seg id="933">Within the department, it indicates that they are reallocating budget surpluses from other divisions.</seg>
<seg id="934">With that occurring, does that impact the other divisions that should be benefiting all Nunavummiut?</seg>
<seg id="935">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Overall it does have an impact in terms of divisions that haven’t spent.</seg>
<seg id="936">In terms of Family Services, the bulk of that that they transferred over to help with their overruns would be on income assistance.</seg>
<seg id="937">If there is not as much income assistance, then you transfer it over to another branch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="938">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="939">When you are reallocating budgets from various divisions, when do you identify that they may get into a deficit situation and how is that deficit taken care of?</seg>
<seg id="940">I’m not sure what that has to do with the process we’re doing here today, but Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="941">Our departments provide a variance report on a monthly basis and it’s towards of the end of the fiscal year that once we start seeing any cost overruns, those are the ones we ask departments to realign their budgets. If they can’t physically do that, then we would have to go through the supplementary appropriation that is here for us right now.</seg>
<seg id="942">Again, we’re on page 4.</seg>
<seg id="943">Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="944">The material provided here makes reference to the fact that this residential care service is demand-driven. The number of clients is increased from 189 to 243.</seg>
<seg id="945">Is this a trend that’s expected to continue?</seg>
<seg id="946">What caused this increase?</seg>
<seg id="947">Do we know the root cause of this sudden increase in the number clients?</seg>
<seg id="948">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It has been a trend since 2013. It has been a steady trend in terms of the clients that have been required. This is a trend that we follow.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that’s a trend that has been in place for a number of years, will it be taken into account when we’re going forward from this point in terms of looking forward to next year, looking forward to not approving a supplementary appropriation because the correct amount will be budgeted in the first place?</seg>
<seg id="950">Is that trend being taken into account?</seg>
<seg id="951">I think we’re going to go through each of the pages and we can speak to the trends. When there are trends that are happening and can’t meet the budgetary, we then start looking at our own budgets.</seg>
<seg id="952">That’s a very valuable question that we will be expecting when we present our main estimates. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="953">Also in the materials provided here, it makes reference to the fact that within the department, there is less available surplus.</seg>
<seg id="954">It makes reference to the department’s recent and ongoing income assistance reforms.</seg>
<seg id="955">I wonder if the minister could clarify: where have those surpluses been eaten up? Is it in the administration of the Income Assistance Program or is there more money going to these income assistance clients?</seg>
<seg id="956">Just a general indication would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="957">I’m trying to understand: where is that money being directed?</seg>
<seg id="958">Are the income assistance reforms… ? Does it mean that we’re heavier on the administrative side or does it actually meant that we’re providing more funds to the income assistance clients? Where is that money going?</seg>
<seg id="959">Chairman: Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="960">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think there are a number of factors when it comes to Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="961">The programs, over the transition in terms of when it was moved out from another department, a lot of the work was trying to figure out who’s doing the work and how do you do the work.</seg>
<seg id="962">The recent income support reform that’s taking place has a contribution to this and the government’s response to residential services in terms of sending out clients and ensuring that clients are going. There are different kinds of care that are being transferred.</seg>
<seg id="963">There are a number of factors, I think, in terms of how Family Services have come to the point that there are budget shortfalls for this fiscal year. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="964">I’ll rephrase this.</seg>
<seg id="965">This information indicates that the department is spending more of the money that is budgeted on income assistance, right? They’re spending more than they have in past years.</seg>
<seg id="966">Where is that additional spending going? Is it going toward their own staff? Is it going to the clients?</seg>
<seg id="967">Through you, Minister Savikataaq is better able to respond to the question.</seg>
<seg id="968">Mr. Savikataaq, if you could, please.</seg>
<seg id="969">The income support reforms that were done directly affect the amount of money that is spent. The best example I can come up with is the child tax benefit.</seg>
<seg id="970">Before the reforms came into place, the amount that a family received for child tax benefit was considered income and was deducted from the amount that would be paid out in income support.</seg>
<seg id="971">After the reforms, it’s not considered income, so the calculations that are made for the clients are that they get more money. The clients of income support are getting more money if they are within a family group. The bottom line is that the child tax benefit is not considered income for income support calculations, so therefore there is more income support money being paid out to the clients.</seg>
<seg id="972">We are at Total Children and Family Services.</seg>

<seg id="976">Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="977">Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="978">Welcome, minister.</seg>
<seg id="979">It states in here, purchase of new equipment for the test on new drugs. Is this anticipation of the federal legislation on cannabis this coming summer?</seg>
<seg id="980">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Through you, Mr. Chairman, if I could ask of switching my witness, I would like the Deputy Minister of Justice to sit next to me in replacement of my ADM. If I could have that first and then I’ll respond to the member’s question.</seg>
<seg id="981">Do members agree to change witnesses at the witness table?</seg>
<seg id="982">Sergeant-at-Arms, if you could please escort the witness in.</seg>
<seg id="983">For the record, Mr. Akeeagok, if you could please introduce your witness.</seg>
<seg id="984">On my left is the Deputy Minister of Justice, Bill MacKay.</seg>
<seg id="985">With your permission, I can now respond to the question that was just asked.</seg>
<seg id="986">Mr. Chairman, that is a very good question for the law enforcement in terms of drugs.</seg>
<seg id="987">No, that is not in relation to cannabis.</seg>
<seg id="988">There has been a big opioid crisis in Canada and hopefully it won’t land in Nunavut, but these are the new drugs that are coming out that they need to learn and enforce.</seg>
<seg id="989">In December, as finance ministers met, a lot of the money that will be received through cannabis, the 25 percent that the federal government had asked for is going to go towards the RCMP law enforcement in terms of testing for cannabis.</seg>
<seg id="990">There are two components to it.</seg>
<seg id="991">I thank the minister for the answer.</seg>
<seg id="992">The other question that I have is on our packages, it goes the high cost of housing due to a lack of housing in the communities.</seg>
<seg id="993">Could the minister explain why this is there? What are the high housing costs for?</seg>
<seg id="994">Chairman: Thank you, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="995">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This one is related to the RCMP. They hired nine additional members to their force in various communities and as a result, they do offer staff housing.</seg>
<seg id="996">When there are additional members, as part of the government contracts, we also have to find staff housing towards it. The additional cost for finding that housing was in the range of $300,000. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="997">Mr. Main, you had a question?</seg>
<seg id="998">Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="999">The minister mentioned, under this item here which is $2.6 million, how it has been broken down in here, he mentioned about $300,000 was for housing.</seg>
<seg id="1000">I wonder if he could break that figure down further into the different components.</seg>
<seg id="1001">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I may miss a number.</seg>
<seg id="1002">If I do, I do ask assistance from our staff here.</seg>
<seg id="1003">Those are the numbers that I have rounded.</seg>
<seg id="1004">Qujannamiik, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1005">I thank the minister. You mentioned earlier that $1 million is for vehicle replacements.</seg>
<seg id="1006">Why weren’t you expecting to have to purchase them?</seg>
<seg id="1007">They should have already been included in the budget.</seg>
<seg id="1008">You said it was for new vehicle purchases.</seg>
<seg id="1009">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you. That’s a good question.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The $1 million is for replacement of vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1011">We have a contract with the RCMP and in that contract they receive any equipment that is needed.</seg>
<seg id="1012">Last year the vehicles were not really replaced because of lack of funding.</seg>
<seg id="1013">They were trying to delay the replacement of vehicles. This year, with the vehicles that are breaking down, they had to purchase the new vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1014">That’s why it’s such a sharp increase from last year.</seg>
<seg id="1015">They were holding back on the purchase of vehicles, but the vehicles are aging.</seg>
<seg id="1016">The contract with the RCMP doesn’t really indicate whether or not we need to purchase this or we need to purchase that.</seg>
<seg id="1017">During our discussions with them to plan the budgets, they come to an agreement and that’s how it’s such a big increase.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1019">It also states here… . Well, my colleague mentioned this.</seg>
<seg id="1020">The new drugs are the most dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1021">Is the testing equipment for those drugs for all the communities or only some of the communities?</seg>
<seg id="1022">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yes, every officer will have these packages and for all the communities, a number of things.</seg>
<seg id="1023">Those are the new equipment that they needed to purchase for the officers and for the public that may get into that situation. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1024">Are they starting to find the new drugs that are more dangerous in our communities, and is that why they planned for it? Alternatively, if they are not finding the new drugs, which communities has the RCMP found those drugs in to date?</seg>
<seg id="1025">The new drugs are coming into our communities and this is very bad news. I wish they could be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="1026">There have been two communities that have been affected. Any new drugs that come into Canada would start coming here and they’re already in the NWT.</seg>
<seg id="1027">Those drugs are very dangerous. I fear for those who want to take drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1028">It’s dangerous because they’re now coming into our communities and I applaud the RCMP for preparing for this.</seg>
<seg id="1029">Mr. Main: I thought I was done here.</seg>
<seg id="1030">I just have a final question.</seg>
<seg id="1031">It mentions here the high housing cost due lack of housing in the communities. Does that mean Nunavut? What’s “the communities”?</seg>
<seg id="1032">It is written in the documents we have provided that we have nine new police officers that have been placed in six Nunavut communities and they need housing.</seg>
<seg id="1033">It’s just a general comment.</seg>
<seg id="1034">Moving on. Mr. Hickes, you had a question?</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the $2.6 million request, it speaks to increased demand for extra judicial officers and interpreters, and it states that seven additional judicial officers have been hired. Have any additional interpreters had to be hired out of this as well?</seg>
<seg id="1036">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Currently no, there haven’t been additional interpreters and there are a number of factors that they had done in terms of not hiring. One of the major components is having trained, qualified interpreters that are in the legal or judicial role.</seg>
<seg id="1037">I’ll leave that alone. I’ll go over to where it’s talking about in the program 1 again, it is talking about the new radio system that these dollars are being used to keep the old system running.</seg>
<seg id="1038">With the knowledge that there’s a new system that’s going to be needed to replace the existing system, are there budgeted dollars forthcoming for the new system or is that going to be a supplementary appropriation next time when they know what the actual figures are from the RCMP?</seg>
<seg id="1039">Yes, this is currently being planned by our department. We will be asking for an appropriation and we’re in the planning stages for that.</seg>
<seg id="1040">During our finance ministers’ meeting, the public service minister was also there and he rolled out the plans for the RCMP if and when the cannabis legislation is passed. There are a number of things, as my member colleague has mentioned, for road tests and other. There are plans towards it, but there’s nothing in this supplementary appropriation towards cannabis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In program 3, the correctional facilities on the overtime, it speaks to each correctional centre has to have a full squad on duty every hour of every day. What is a full squad here at the BCC?</seg>
<seg id="1042">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Eight. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1043">Did he say eight?</seg>
<seg id="1044">Mr. Hickes: That leads me to my next question where the example provided on what is needed for overtime it states that the BCC alone, for a three-day blizzard, costs $180,000. I think I’m in the wrong career, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Maybe the minister may want to clarify that number.</seg>
<seg id="1046">Through you, may I ask for Deputy MacKay to respond to this question?</seg>
<seg id="1047">Mr. MacKay: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1048">There are many staff other than the squad that are on duty. If there is a storm, then all of those people have to stay in the facility and another shift is called in as well, so that adds to the overtime costs.</seg>
<seg id="1049">Just a clarification, the way I understand it, if there is a blizzard, the staff that are on duty aren’t able to make it home, so they have stay, yet he stated that there is another shift that is called in at the same time, so they’re double staffed during a storm, just to clarify.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Mr. MacKay, for clarification, please.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Yes, we’re double staffed. They will call in the other shift when they think a storm is going to occur and they will come in and so they are double staffed for a period of time.</seg>
<seg id="1052">Mr. Lightstone.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1054">My question for Justice, for program 1, RCMP, you have identified the need for housing for nine additional regular members.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Is staff housing provided for each RCMP member?</seg>
<seg id="1056">It was one of our staff that has caused this, but it was in a friendly game of hockey. It wasn’t at the workplace. I hope for a full recovery of my deputy minister, who can’t write right now.</seg>
<seg id="1057">He’s got to whisper to me.</seg>
<seg id="1058">For the question that is related to the nine members, the RCMP procures their staff housing through the federal program.</seg>
<seg id="1059">I don’t know if I mentioned this, but we do have a unique relationship with the RCMP through a contract.</seg>
<seg id="1060">For those that were in the standing committee, I just want to clarify that 70 percent of the RCMP cost is borne by this government and 30 percent is borne by the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="1061">There are differences in terms of how the RCMP are treated within our public service. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1062">Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1063">I’m just curious if the RCMP intends on providing staff housing to all RCMP members.</seg>
<seg id="1064">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. When the RCMP does send out their members, they do it in a set time. They don’t stay in one community for a number of years.</seg>
<seg id="1065">Their operations are quite unique where they don’t keep members in one community for a long period of time; they do shifts.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Therefore through that, they don’t expect that their members will own their houses in those communities for the majority of the time. They pretty much match members with staff housing.</seg>
<seg id="1067">That’s the program that, through their unique operations, they do that.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When they do identify that need for a member in all 25 communities, they try to match with staff housing. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1069">I find it a little bit disappointing that the RCMP doesn’t encourage the members to become part of the community.</seg>
<seg id="1070">For the rare instances that RCMP members do buy a home, what does the RCMP provide for them?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Chairman: Thank you, Mr. Lightstone.</seg>
<seg id="1072">I’m not sure this is quite the line of questioning we need for here.</seg>
<seg id="1073">We can’t expect them to buy their own houses in our communities, which is why the service is provided by the RCMP, not even our government.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Mr. Akeeagok, if you want to comment on that, please.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Hon. David Akeeagok: Qujannamiik.</seg>
<seg id="1076">Very good comments, Mr. Chairman, on this.</seg>
<seg id="1077">I do want to give a very good shout-out to the RCMP. Even though they’re there for three years, their role is to help build a community and have a safe community, and they do a wonderful job on it.</seg>
<seg id="1078">In an event that an RCMP member does decide to buy their own house, there are federal programs geared for housing.</seg>
<seg id="1079">They’re getting paid through the federal pay system, not necessarily through our system. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Last question on the RCMP is: how much is the total contract on an annual basis for the RCMP service?</seg>
<seg id="1081">On page 5 of the bill it states $40,071,000.</seg>
<seg id="1082">If that is approved, then $42,671,000 would be the contract for the 2017-18 fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="1083">Thank you for that information.</seg>
<seg id="1084">I’ll move on to program 3, correctional facilities overage on permanent staff overtime and casuals.</seg>
<seg id="1085">Chairman: Mr. Lightstone, we’re only on law enforcement so far; we’re not to the other two line items, so if you can please hold your questions until we get to that point.</seg>
<seg id="1086">Right now we’re asking questions on law enforcement. Are there any more questions on law enforcement?</seg>
<seg id="1087">Mr. Lightstone: Yes, one last question on law enforcement.</seg>
<seg id="1088">In the minister’s letter that provided us additional information, we had a total budget of $40 million to law enforcement with actual spent of $30 million, with a forecast of $42 million.</seg>
<seg id="1089">I was just curious if or how law enforcement intends on spending $42 million up until the end of the fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="1090">I would like to ask my colleague what number he’s referring to.</seg>
<seg id="1091">If he can give me a page number of what he’s looking at, as I can’t find it in the correspondence he is referring to. I see the $30 million in the letter that I provided on Friday, but maybe he can provide clarification.</seg>
<seg id="1092">A letter dated March 16 to the Chair of the Regular Members’ Caucus, which was provided to us by the Minister of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="1093">It’s that letter that I’m referring to and it’s on page 4 of 5.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Thank you for asking questions about the letter.</seg>
<seg id="1095">The $30 million that is written in there has been spent up to now and they’re planning to use $42 million.</seg>
<seg id="1096">This is from a report from RCMP expenditures and what they think they’re going to spend. $2.6 million is the supplementary appropriation following the numbers we got from the RCMP. That’s what I wrote in the letter.</seg>
<seg id="1097">I’m looking at $2.6 million for program 1, MLA briefing notes, and it’s telling me that the RCMP in Nunavut is operating on an outdated radio system which is failing. At the top, background for requests, it’s saying that the Department of Justice is dedicated to improving operational efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="1098">However, due to the nature of its operations, a $2.6 million increase is required to cover needs for staff training, extra staff due to extreme weather, and unexpected incidents at the facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1099">What’s the situation here? It’s talking about $2.6 million for coverage on permanent staff overtime and casual salaries, then later on same thing, $2.6 million. It’s talking about an outdated radio system.</seg>
<seg id="1100">Can I get a clarification on that, Mr. Chairman?</seg>
<seg id="1101">This line of question was already asked earlier by another member, but Mr. Akeeagok, if you want to enlighten us again, please.</seg>
<seg id="1102">That figure under the RCMP, $2.6 million, I covered the breakdowns. When you go further down, there’s another section which is program 3. There’s $2.6 million on corrections too.</seg>
<seg id="1103">I think that’s what my member colleague is referencing. There are two $2.6 million that are being referenced here, one is on the RCMP and one is on corrections.</seg>
<seg id="1104">For the RCMP, I covered the radios, the staff housing, the purchase of vehicles, and the incidents that have arose in Nunavut. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1105">I thank Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="1106">If we’re talking about two $2.6 million, is that $5.2 million or $6.2 million? What is the total cost of this? I’m not understanding it and Mr. Chairman, if somebody could clarify it for me.</seg>
<seg id="1107">Chairman: Thank you, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="1108">On page 5 of our document, we’re dealing with law enforcement of $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1109">Further down the page, it says “Total Corrections. $2.6 million.” We’re not dealing with it as a total right now. We’re dealing with law enforcement of $2.6 million on one line item.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Do you have any more questions on that particular line item?</seg>
<seg id="1111">Ms. Towtongie: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for that clarification.</seg>
<seg id="1112">I do have a question in reading Inuktitut. In English it is saying “Main Estimates” for the supplementary appropriation, but in Inuktitut it telling me “Miksautisimajuq.” That means that is guesswork of the estimate.</seg>
<seg id="1113">Which one would be clearer, the main estimates or guesswork, miksautisimajuq? That’s “almost what we’re requesting.” Mr. Chairman, can I get a clarification on that piece, main estimates for that year, 2017-18?</seg>
<seg id="1114">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The one on the far left that says “Main Estimates,” the numbers that are bolded like the $40 million for law enforcement and registries is $11 million are already authorized main estimates.</seg>
<seg id="1115">The one on the right are what is not previously authorized and we’re still in 2017-18, so in Inuktitut, miksautisimajuq is this is the best guess that we have that these will be over on certain amounts. Therefore we are asking this House to give a blessing on the supplementary appropriation. I’ll use Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1116">For the overall, $6.2 million, of that, $2.6 million is for RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="1117">Those are the amounts that we are presenting to you to this House at this time. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1118">I was just getting confused in the Inuktitut version that these are the best guesswork that we have and the main estimates.</seg>
<seg id="1119">It’s almost clear in my mind now, so I’m finished with my questioning.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Again, we’re on Law Enforcement. $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1121">The next line item is Total Registers and Court Services. $1 million.</seg>
<seg id="1122">Total Corrections. $2,600,000.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1124">To continue on my questioning about corrections, every year the branch has a cost overrun and if I recall correctly, those overruns are due to overtime of correctional facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Is that correct?</seg>
<seg id="1126">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1127">The member is correct. The bulk of it is on overtime and I’ll also add, on casual staff.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1129">If I recall correctly, the correctional facilities operate on a 12-hour shift basis. Is that correct?</seg>
<seg id="1130">Now, considering that the correctional facilities are running on a 12-hour schedule and that’s causing considerable overtime, has the department ever considered switching to three eight-hour shift schedules and would that possibly solve the overtime issues?</seg>
<seg id="1131">Through you, I’ll have the deputy minister, Mr. MacKay, respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The member is correct that there are 12-hour shifts.</seg>
<seg id="1133">Those 12-hour shifts are calculated so that it’s a 42-hour workweek. There isn’t overtime past the 12 hours and there isn’t overtime until you go past the 42 hours in a week.</seg>
<seg id="1134">This was a change we made, I think, three years ago with the collective agreement. That significantly reduced our overtime costs from 2015-16. It was around the $4 million range for overtime and now it’s down to a $2.1 million range.</seg>
<seg id="1135">Consequently the Corrections Division’s deficits dropped in that time period from $4.5 million to the $2.6 million you see here.</seg>
<seg id="1136">We are making some headway into reducing those overtime costs and we will continue to do so.</seg>
<seg id="1137">I would just like to remind members to please mute your telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Now, the facility operations run with a considerable amount of overtime and you base the schedule on 42 hours a week.</seg>
<seg id="1140">What is the actual number of hours on average of employees’ workweek? Was it 50 or 60 hours a week?</seg>
<seg id="1141">Hon. David Akeeagok: Qujannamiik, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1142">That is in so much detail that I’ll ask if we need to provide it to the House, we will provide it in the form of a written response.</seg>
<seg id="1143">Our deputy isn’t able to respond to that either.</seg>
<seg id="1144">We don’t have that information.</seg>
<seg id="1145">I didn’t know how far we needed to in terms of the operations of the corrections services.</seg>
<seg id="1146">I have questions.</seg>
<seg id="1147">What kind of training do they receive?</seg>
<seg id="1148">Through you, Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask Deputy Minister MacKay to respond.</seg>
<seg id="1149">Just in response, I think I’m answering the member’s question. In terms of training, yes, there’s a training component to our supplementary appropriation under both court services and correctional facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1150">Part of the reason for that is currently we don’t have people who do training as full-time staff.</seg>
<seg id="1151">We contract that out so that adds to the cost of training and then as this notes, that also increases the overtime because when people are training, they have to be covered by someone else and sometimes that will involve overtime as well. That does increase our costs.</seg>
<seg id="1152">Like everything else, we’re looking at ways we can better plan for that and better budget for that, for instance, by perhaps asking for extra staff that would be full-time training for both correctional facilities and courts so that we can rely less on contract training.</seg>
<seg id="1153">Ms. Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="1154">I was curious in terms of when we’re talking about a $2.6 million increase in getting staff training.</seg>
<seg id="1155">My question was: what kind of training is being offered to staff or casual employees? Are they also getting the training necessary?</seg>
<seg id="1156">In the case of both corrections and courts, that training is provided to all casual employees as well as obviously indeterminate employees.</seg>
<seg id="1157">When a casual person comes on, on a casual contract, it’s a four-month contract, but they will spend a certain number of weeks at the beginning of that doing their training. The training is geared, for the most part, at least for correctional facilities, it’s called NUHALT and it is terms of dealing… . Conflict management training is the main component of that training.</seg>
<seg id="1158">I’m not sure. Can I ask what kind of programs they also offer for people who are in corrections, or am I getting off topic?</seg>
<seg id="1159">I’m not sure that they will have this kind of detail in front of them, but Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="1160">Through you, I would like to have Deputy Minister MacKay to highlight that, if you will allow it.</seg>
<seg id="1161">Mr. MacKay.</seg>
<seg id="1162">As you mentioned, I don’t have the exact details in front of me, but I can give the member an overview of what kind of programming is offered to inmates.</seg>
<seg id="1163">It depends on the facility, obviously. For the lower-security facilities, for instance, in Rankin Inlet or the halfway house here in Iqaluit, there is a lot of trades training. It often involves the participation of employers in the community who will take on inmates as an apprentice or in a mentor relationship to give them skills so that when they leave the facility, they can take on employment.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Within the BCC and Makigiarvik, there’s less opportunity for those inmates to leave the facility, but they do provide programming that will address each inmate-specific need. For instance, there is programming available for addictions counselling or for anger management programming, things that are tailored to the particular inmate to allow him or her to be able to address the issues that may have put them into the correctional facility to begin with.</seg>
<seg id="1165">They are also training that, again, even if they’re not able to leave the facility, they do offer some training that will allow them to more employable when they do get out of the facility. For example, they will help them finish their high school education or can provide some foundation for trades training. We have a trades foundation course that the NAC offers.</seg>
<seg id="1166">They offer that in Rankin Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="1167">There’s a wide variety of programming that we try to provide for the inmates.</seg>
<seg id="1168">Ms. Nakashuk: I’m done.</seg>
<seg id="1169">We are on page 5.</seg>
<seg id="1170">Justice. Operations and Maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="1171">Total Department. Not Previously Authorized. $6,200,000.</seg>
<seg id="1172">Moving to page 6.</seg>
<seg id="1173">Department of Health. Operations and Maintenance. Not Previously Authorized.</seg>
<seg id="1174">Mr. Akeeagok, you wanted to make a comment?</seg>
<seg id="1175">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Not a comment, but if you may, we are going to another department.</seg>
<seg id="1176">I have a witness available. Through you, if I could switch my witnesses before we get into questions. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1177">I was going to give you the opportunity to change witnesses at some point, but if you want to do it now, that’s fine.</seg>
<seg id="1178">Sergeant-at-Arms, if you could exchange witnesses, please.</seg>
<seg id="1179">Do members agree that he can exchange the witnesses?</seg>
<seg id="1180">Chairman: Okay. Sergeant-at-Arms, please.</seg>
<seg id="1181">For the record, Minister Akeeagok, if you could please introduce your new witness.</seg>
<seg id="1182">The person who just entered on my left is the Deputy Minister of Health, Colleen Inuujaq Stockley.</seg>
<seg id="1183">Operations and Maintenance. Not Previously Authorized. Total Directorate. $5.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Mr. Netser: My mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1185">I was going to ask a question under medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Chairman: Okay. Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1187">Are there any questions under the directorate?</seg>
<seg id="1188">I don’t have too many questions under this one, but when we’re talking about elders’ home operational costs, it talks about the three continuing care facilities that are funded and three different elders’ homes.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In a line of questioning the other day we were talking about the prefeasibility of the Igloolik and Gjoa Haven, exploring the option of expanding those facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1190">At the time the minister wasn’t sure of what number of beds was being looked at to start the prefeasibility study.</seg>
<seg id="1191">I’m just wondering if we can get an update today on making these existing facilities more efficient and where that prefeasibility study is sitting at right now.</seg>
<seg id="1192">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for the question.</seg>
<seg id="1193">For this year, under the preplanning phase, we are looking at Igloolik under the preplanning. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1194">What is that preplanning going to entail and what is the current status of it?</seg>
<seg id="1195">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you. Through you, may I ask the deputy of health to elaborate more on the preplanning of the capital plans?</seg>
<seg id="1196">The Department of Health had preplanning money approved in the capital last year for 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1197">The preplanning was to look at the feasibility for making an expansion to Igloolik, as the minister alluded to.</seg>
<seg id="1198">Keeping in mind that an election happened and we expect that there will be a new government mandate, we’re still in the process of looking at what options we could do to expand Igloolik.</seg>
<seg id="1199">It hasn’t gotten very far at this point, but we expect that there will be further movement once we know the new government mandate.</seg>
<seg id="1200">More of a comment just to finish off, when we’re talking about utilizing government resources and we have identified the inefficiency of the current model of a number of our facilities, I would suggest the department and when the mandate comes out, I’m sure the government will have some topics on there on elder care.</seg>
<seg id="1201">I look forward to seeing some progress on maximizing the efficiency of existing facilities as well as identifying different areas around the territory where there’s opportunity for new facilities to meet and address the current wait-list we have.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Just a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1203">I’ll follow up with my colleague’s line of questioning there regarding the elders’ home operational costs.</seg>
<seg id="1204">I would be interested to see what the breakdown is of that $900,000.</seg>
<seg id="1205">Which facilities are requiring this money? How is it being broken down among the different facilities?</seg>
<seg id="1206">That $900,000 is shared by three facilities at $300,000 each for the three elders’ homes.</seg>
<seg id="1207">Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’m just wondering, because it’s mentioned in here, these facilities are operated under a service contract by non-profit Nunavut societies.</seg>
<seg id="1208">What is the procedure for these societies to notify the Department of Health that they’re going to have a cost overrun?</seg>
<seg id="1209">The figures relate to the three elders’ homes administered by non-government organizations, which recently got new contracts for continuation of services. This was part of that amount.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Further, if these figures are needed to be increased or decreased, the protocol is that the Department of Health meets with these societies to discuss these figures.</seg>
<seg id="1211">When they are required to deliberate over issues, they can do that.</seg>
<seg id="1212">They do have specific Nunavut and Canada standards, to state it in English, to adhere to.</seg>
<seg id="1213">It mentions in here that when the three elders’ homes initially opened, they were intended to provide residential care at levels 2 and 3 clients. There are a number of things that have contributed to the fact that it states in here that the majority of the homes’ residents have required more direct care and assistance and have been allowed to age in place.</seg>
<seg id="1214">Getting back to the budget here, is it predicted for the coming years that the cost of operating these elders’ homes is going to continue to increase or is it a plateau type of situation where we’re now capturing all the costs?</seg>
<seg id="1215">When these contracts were initially set up with those three elders’ homes, they were set up by the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="1216">The Department of Health only took over those contracts as of April 1, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1217">One of the things that we immediately became aware of is that the standards that Health wanted to see were perhaps a little different. We were giving them a clinical eye. We had some differences in terms of how much care and by whom.</seg>
<seg id="1218">We had some recommendations with regard to nutrition, dietitian input, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When we looked at the contracts, there was no way that the elders facilities could provide what was required for those elders with the $1 million.</seg>
<seg id="1220">Each of the three of them went up to $1.3 million. $855,000 is what we expect it will be next year and we have asked for that through the proper budgeting process, but we’re in a deficit of almost $900,000 for this year and that’s the reason behind it.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Correct me if I’m wrong or stop me completely, but looking at the budget, I see a lot set aside for mental health and treatment contracts. What I don’t see and I believe what is happening all over Nunavut is trauma care.</seg>
<seg id="1222">We go through a lot of shocks; post-traumatic stress syndrome.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Has trauma care been discussed in setting aside budget items for it along with mental care?</seg>
<seg id="1224">Today we’re here to only talk about budget overruns and that’s what we’re trying to do in the O&M. We’re not talking about actual costs for other issues, so I think that question is a little out of line.</seg>
<seg id="1225">It could probably be better asked in the House or through some other venue, if you don’t mind.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Do you have any other questions? Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Thank you for clarifying that. I appreciate that.</seg>
<seg id="1228">I was looking at the forecast for mental health and treatment contracts in 2017-18 and it’s $16 million. What’s the number, $16.7 million, compared to the budget of $6.2 million? What is the situation here?</seg>
<seg id="1229">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. That’s my final question.</seg>
<seg id="1230">With regard to the $5.9 million on the page we are reviewing and as per my colleague’s question, the figure of $43.1 million includes that amount.</seg>
<seg id="1231">This figure includes $16 million along with $10 million that is within the total figure here.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Through you, I would ask that Deputy Minister Stockley be allowed to respond in greater detail as to why the request includes another $10 million within the total figure. If you can allow her to respond to the question.</seg>
<seg id="1233">It’s really a good news story that Nunavummiut are asking for help, and that’s the whole idea of getting the message out of calling, going to your health centre, using the helpline, and asking for help.</seg>
<seg id="1234">We’re seeing that more people are asking for help and therefore more people are going out for treatment. We’ve had an increase in people going out for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1235">We know that there is a high prevalence of mental health disorders; mental health and addictions.</seg>
<seg id="1236">There are cost drivers that are outside of the realm of the Department of Health, so clients from the Department of Family Services and case referrals from the Department of Justice. Anybody who is court mandated to have treatment would also fall under this budget.</seg>
<seg id="1237">We just finished Total Directorate. Before we move on to the next one, we’re going to take a five-minute break.</seg>
<seg id="1238">>>Committee recessed at 18:03 and resumed at 18:10</seg>
<seg id="1239">I would like to call the committee meeting back to order.</seg>
<seg id="1240">We are on Total Health Care Service Delivery of $43,100,000.</seg>
<seg id="1241">Under elders’ out-of-territory long-term residential care, you have identified the issue of dementia care.</seg>
<seg id="1242">You also mentioned that the number is likely understated because of routine screening for dementia is not available in the territory.</seg>
<seg id="1243">This sort of sparked my interest.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Is the department looking into making dementia screening available in the territory anytime soon?</seg>
<seg id="1245">It’s included in there, but it’s not one of the top priorities.</seg>
<seg id="1246">The mental health services are more important right now.</seg>
<seg id="1247">On the same topic of elders’ out-of-territory long-term care, the last bullet under that heading identified that prior years cost of this out of territory was absorbed by regional mental health budgets.</seg>
<seg id="1248">I was kind of surprised when the minister’s letter showed the breakdown of the budgets that the department didn’t include any internal funds to cover the over-expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Are all of the areas under the department going to be fully expending their budget this year?</seg>
<seg id="1250">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On page 6, item No. 1, $5.9 million, Not Previously Authorized, that’s for the elders’ out-of-territory long-term residence. The main estimates for Health towards that were not identified.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is something that has come for this year in terms of getting the elders’ care and that’s where we’re seeking that $5.9 million towards the elder care and sending them to the appropriate places. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1252">My question was more along the lines of: is the Department of Health covering any of its over-expenditures from other areas within their budget?</seg>
<seg id="1253">Through you, if I make a mistake, Deputy Minister Stockley can correct me.</seg>
<seg id="1254">We find money in areas that are not spent and I think that was the question. I can respond that in areas that will be over-expended, Health has not taken anything out internally.</seg>
<seg id="1255">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for the clarification.</seg>
<seg id="1256">Yes, anything that has not been spent within the department, what we do through the budgets is take what’s not going to be spent and we put it over to those that are being over-expended and try to balance that.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The remainder of the balance for the Department of Health is $49 million.</seg>
<seg id="1258">In the letter that I recently sent as early as for the Inuktitut version that’s today and the English version on Friday, it’s an attachment that does not have a number which shows where the overage and under-expense.</seg>
<seg id="1259">If you look at what they plan to transfer, it’s quite small compared to the overage that we’re seeking for through this supplementary appropriation. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1260">I do appreciate the appendix where the internal transfers by branch have been provided, but what I was sort of referring to is, in the letter that the minister had sent us on Friday on page 4, it has a breakdown of program areas which require additional funds.</seg>
<seg id="1261">Under Family Services, they were kind enough to provide their lapses that they’re going to be using to partially fund their overage.</seg>
<seg id="1262">I was just curious why Health hadn’t done the same.</seg>
<seg id="1263">Health does not have anything to… . Any of their branches does not indicate anywhere there are going to be lapses.</seg>
<seg id="1264">Therefore what’s on page 4 of 5 is a true reflection of what Health is currently dealing with and it’s over by $49 million. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1265">I would just like to point out that the listing under Health is not branches; it’s actually programs.</seg>
<seg id="1266">I do know that there are a number of programs under the branches in Health that do have chronic lapses every single year. Even though they might be spent elsewhere, the budget still remains a lapse in that area, such as the nursing recruitment strategy, HR, IT. If I recall correctly, those each had $1 million lapses in prior years.</seg>
<seg id="1267">Would it be possible for the minister to give us a breakdown for Health of all the programs that are contributing their lapsed funds to cover some of these overages?</seg>
<seg id="1268">Again you’re asking for information that is very detailed which may not be available here today.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Minister Akoak…</seg>
<seg id="1270">…Akeeagok. Sorry.</seg>
<seg id="1271">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for recognizing that.</seg>
<seg id="1272">We don’t currently have that level of detail here.</seg>
<seg id="1273">If we do need to provide it to the House, we will commit for it at a later date. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1274">I’ll move on to the elders’ homes operational costs.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Under the second bullet it indicates that the current elder homes are operated under service contracts by non-profit Nunavut societies.</seg>
<seg id="1276">I would just like to say that is a great opportunity for Nunavut’s societies, I should say.</seg>
<seg id="1277">I hope that the department will continue to contract as many non-profit organizations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Moving on to the next bullet on the next page, under the topic of 24-hour care elder care, about halfway through the bullet it indicates that care is 24 hours per day, seven days a week, and that is to adhere to the Nunavut Department of Health residential care and facilities standards for elders’ homes.</seg>
<seg id="1279">These standards identify the minimum standards for the operation of elders’ homes in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1280">I would just like to question if these elder care facilities are actually meeting the minimum standards.</seg>
<seg id="1281">I responded to this question earlier.</seg>
<seg id="1282">They have a new contract and the contracts have been increased because the Department of Health wants to make sure they follow the residential care facilities standards.</seg>
<seg id="1283">The Department of Health meets and reviews these homes to make sure the standards are being followed.</seg>
<seg id="1284">Mr. Lightstone.</seg>
<seg id="1285">I would just like to clarify again: are these elders’ homes currently meeting the minimum standards?</seg>
<seg id="1286">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1287">Right now as this is a new contract with this increase of $900,000 that we talked about in the $5.9 million that was discussed, there are minimum standards that are built into this contract.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Through working very closely with the three societies and the department, they will and are striving to meet the standards to the level.</seg>
<seg id="1289">Immediately not all of them are meeting the standards and it’s one that our health and that was mentioned and the minister has mentioned that they are working towards getting into meeting the standards. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Mr. Netser: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1291">I had to clear my throat as I haven’t said anything in a while.</seg>
<seg id="1292">Mr. Chairman, on the medical travel about $15 million is being requested and we have raised it in the House many times about the atrocious medical appointments that people are missing, especially in my region where a patient goes down to Winnipeg and finds out that he or she has no appointment.</seg>
<seg id="1293">I wonder: does the department have a record of the people that have gone down to their medical appointment but have, prior to landing in Winnipeg, been cancelled due to some miscommunications within the department? I wonder if the department has any figures on the actual costs of these missed appointments, including the airfares and doctors’ bills. Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1294">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for the question.</seg>
<seg id="1295">Our Minister of Health has committed to doing this extensive review on the medical travel. This includes those appointments that were missed or appointments that the hospital themselves have deferred for a number of things.</seg>
<seg id="1296">I think that’s one that our government has committed to making sure that there’s a thorough review and find out which areas was at fault.</seg>
<seg id="1297">I think I remember his questioning and he’s witnessing what’s happening. It is a testament and we would include those in the review.</seg>
<seg id="1298">I want to thank the member for raising that.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Our minister has raised it and, through quick collaborations, was able to verify yes, any of those appointments that are missed are going to be part of that comprehensive review that our minister is reviewing. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1300">Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I look forward to whenever the review report comes out.</seg>
<seg id="1301">On the $1.5 million request for the TB clinic in Qikiqtarjuaq, recently on I believe it was February 26 the federal government made quite a lot of money available to ITK. It was something like $80 million. They set aside that money to be used for TB screening.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Has ITK indicated to the Department of Heath that we got a whole bunch of money from the federal government and told the Nunavut government that they have money available, that they could help pay for the TB screening?</seg>
<seg id="1303">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1304">That’s a good question.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Right now the federal government has indicated that for the 2018-19 budget, that’s the money they will use to help Inuit fight TB. It has been indicated that money will be given to Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami to use for the next five years to work in Inuit lands.</seg>
<seg id="1306">They have indicated that they have a task force comprised of people from Inuit lands and the Department of Health is a part of this group.</seg>
<seg id="1307">With respect to the extra money that was supposed to be given to us by the federal government for that purpose, I haven’t seen that as the finance minister.</seg>
<seg id="1308">We will be provided with the details, which I look forward to. Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami does a good job and we know that they are familiar with our department and our officials.</seg>
<seg id="1309">That is where it stands at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1310">As we hear the details, we will be kept informed as ministers. That was a very good question.</seg>
<seg id="1311">I would like to follow up on that medical travel issue.</seg>
<seg id="1312">It mentions in here that medical travel is driven by uncontrollable factors, including birth rates, demographics, contract increases, and etcetera.</seg>
<seg id="1313">In terms of this $15 million overage, does the department have a good feel for what is driving this trend?</seg>
<seg id="1314">The actuals are predicted to increase 5.6 percent over the previous fiscal year in terms of the drivers.</seg>
<seg id="1315">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Through you, may I ask Deputy Minister Stockley to respond to that question?</seg>
<seg id="1317">Yes, medical travel and medevacs are up every year.</seg>
<seg id="1318">We have a lot more people going on regular scheduled travel, which again is a good thing. It means they’re potentially being diagnosed earlier and they’re going for treatment. We have a huge increase in medevacs.</seg>
<seg id="1319">A lot of it has been driven by respiratory illness. We have very low uptake of flu vaccine in our territory. We’re probably the lowest in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="1320">I’ll give you an example.</seg>
<seg id="1321">We expected probably about 60 medevacs in the Baffin in December and we’re budgeted for probably about 40. We had over 90 and that trend has continued.</seg>
<seg id="1322">We have such an increase in medevacs that we have been monitoring them on a weekly basis, especially this time of year during flu season. It’s mainly respiratory-driven, so people with pneumonia, breathing problems, and those kinds of things.</seg>
<seg id="1323">It’s a combination of people going out for regular scheduled care but also a huge increase in medevacs.</seg>
<seg id="1324">I won’t get into too much more detail here just in terms of understanding the drivers and the trend.</seg>
<seg id="1325">In the population on the whole in Nunavut, are health conditions worsening or are they getting better?</seg>
<seg id="1326">Maybe that’s too broad of a question, but I’m just trying to understand here: are we getting ahead of the ball or is the ball catching up to us?</seg>
<seg id="1327">Through you, may I ask Deputy Minister Stockley to respond to that?</seg>
<seg id="1328">Unfortunately we don’t do very well in Nunavut. We have the worst health outcomes in the country among Inuit, as you know, mainly tied to the social determinants of health in terms of food insecurity and overcrowded housing, which is not helping certainly in driving the TB rate. Unfortunately we aren’t making a lot of progress and we probably won’t until many of the social determinants of health are addressed.</seg>
<seg id="1329">We just added some things like a fracture clinic at the QGH.</seg>
<seg id="1330">We are doing more here and we will continue to do that anywhere we can in order to reduce medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="1331">Things are moving in a good direction and the other regions as well.</seg>
<seg id="1332">When I talk about telehealth, it would be involved in all three regions.</seg>
<seg id="1333">You will hear more as we come forward with our O&M requests and some other things that we’re hoping to do.</seg>
<seg id="1334">Thanks for that response.</seg>
<seg id="1335">I look forward to the O&M discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1336">When it comes to this mental health overage, $10.5 million, on one hand it’s very encouraging because I think we all agree that we need to invest in mental health and it’s very important.</seg>
<seg id="1337">I’m looking at the material and it doesn’t really explain again what’s driving this $10.5 million increase.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Has there been a push within the department to diagnose more folks or doing more outreach in terms of what’s driving this? I’m curious.</seg>
<seg id="1339">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Both, it’s diagnosed and testing that’s being done.</seg>
<seg id="1340">If I may, in the Fourth Assembly, suicide was determined as an emergency for the government to take action.</seg>
<seg id="1341">I think a lot of that action speaks through this of putting an outreach to our population and saying that there are services available. It is one that I think we need to continue to promote. Through the diagnoses, testing, and through proper care, we will see a turn of events for our population.</seg>
<seg id="1342">I encourage our members to continue raising that through this House and through the public.</seg>
<seg id="1343">My last question on this mental health heading: how many clients are we talking about in terms of clients that are receiving services outside of the territory?</seg>
<seg id="1344">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 64.</seg>
<seg id="1345">How does this number 64 compare with previous years, the trend?</seg>
<seg id="1346">I don’t have the details in terms of the past, but it is growing and if we need to provide that further level of detail, we will be able to provide that, more probably best suited in the main estimates coming up.</seg>
<seg id="1347">I’m going to skip over to the Qikiqtarjuaq TB screening clinic. I think we would all agree that it’s a very encouraging project and that’s additional resources to address that need.</seg>
<seg id="1348">It mentions supplies and equipment. I was wondering if any of that equipment would be kept by the department in order to deploy in other communities or if it’s just small stuff that will probably stay in the community.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Through you, may I ask Deputy Stockley to respond to that?</seg>
<seg id="1350">Is that equipment that was included in the capital or is it… ?</seg>
<seg id="1351">I’m just a bit lost here.</seg>
<seg id="1352">If it’s equipment, in my mind it should be under capital. Maybe just a clarification.</seg>
<seg id="1353">Through you, may I ask Deputy Minister Stockley to respond to that?</seg>
<seg id="1354">Much of the larger equipment actually came from the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Much of that came through the federal government. Other supplies like the bottles for sputum samples, gauze, the bedding, and things like that would have come through the Department of Health, as per our normal processes.</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1357">I have one final question or I think it’s my final question.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Under health care service delivery staffing, it mentions the issue of the use of agency nurses and contract nurse services. It mentions that the department has made significant progress in reducing the use of these services.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Again, I’ll just ask in terms of this year’s expenses comparing it to previous years. What is the trend in terms of those expenses?</seg>
<seg id="1360">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It’s about the same request.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Instead of having agency nurses, we’re having more of our in-house.</seg>
<seg id="1362">It’s almost the same for the supplementary appropriation. Comparing it from last year to this year, there are more in-house than there are agencies.</seg>
<seg id="1363">This is my final, final question.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A breakdown of that $8.6 million would be appreciated.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The breakdown is for 2017-18. For permanent salaries, the shortfall was under surplus lapse of $52.5 million; with casual wages going over by $45.3 million; overtime, that’s regular pay, premium, standby, and callback of over $15.7 million; and agency nurses over $0.1 million; with a total overage of $8.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1366">I think I just have one question and it’s probably just a comment, but within the breakdown that you’re talking about, I’ll just pick up where Mr. Main just left off.</seg>
<seg id="1367">I’m not getting into the nitty-gritty detail too deep.</seg>
<seg id="1368">I know that if there is a nurse in Sanikiluaq that is dealing at midnight with a medevac… . I don’t want to look like I’m picking on anything in the way of overtime.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Almost all of it is by nurses.</seg>
<seg id="1370">I know the minister himself was answering questions today on what steps the department is doing to staff some of these nursing positions.</seg>
<seg id="1371">I’m going to leave that lie.</seg>
<seg id="1372">I’m just going to make a comment. When we’re looking at the types of appropriation, the health care staffing, the physician services contracts, mental health and treatment, medical travel, these are recurring supplementary appropriations that come forward every year.</seg>
<seg id="1373">The numbers, even looking at mental health, the budget from what I can recollect didn’t really change from last year, yet I think there was a $6.8 or $7.8 million supplementary appropriation last year.</seg>
<seg id="1374">When I spoke earlier about the budgeting process, what kinds of changes have been made, and the Minister of Finance did say that there haven’t been any substantial changes and I truly believe there needs to be.</seg>
<seg id="1375">When we’re coming back and having to approve, to go through this exercise of repeated supplementary appropriations when we know that the need is higher than what the budgeted amount is for, there needs to be a real reset button on the budget process so that departments can bring forward budgets on their actual need, not just adding a percentage of growth from the year before and “Bob’s your uncle.”</seg>
<seg id="1376">That is just a comment, but I would like to hear the minister’s comment back.</seg>
<seg id="1377">I share those comments very well and it’s something that we are seriously looking at as our Fifth Assembly and as we move forward. I think some of the discussions we have been having is exactly that. There are some departments and Health is one and Justice is another that continually comes back and asks for supplementary appropriation.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Something has to happen, and it’s one that I’m very happy that we are having this discussion on budget process and something that I’ll work very closely with my colleagues on this.</seg>
<seg id="1379">I know I’m answering some of these health-related issues. Right from the day that I got into the office, health has been a very topic of our discussions with finance. That’s a lot of attention that we pay towards health.</seg>
<seg id="1380">It’s one that we really need to do something about in terms of the main estimates of making some corrections on some of the very obvious things that have repeated over the years. It doesn’t necessarily have to change the budget process, but we should recognize these through our processes that are taking place.</seg>
<seg id="1381">It’s going to be through this House that we make a number of efforts.</seg>
<seg id="1382">One of our colleagues, in his regular member’s statement, made very good observations in terms of the budget process and I applaud that too.</seg>
<seg id="1383">It’s one that we need to work together as 22 members. That’s very needed.</seg>
<seg id="1384">This 2017-18 overage, I think, illustrates on some of the challenges that we are going to be facing as members. I would want to really work closely with you, with the Premier and the mandate, and through our processes throughout of ensuring that we don’t necessarily have to spend the time here because if we do know the actual appropriations that are needed by the departments, we really shouldn’t be coming back unless there are emergencies because we should know what our budgets are.</seg>
<seg id="1385">I wanted to make that comment and I thank you, Chair, and the members for giving an opportunity to state that.</seg>
<seg id="1386">I thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1387">I applaud the minister in recognizing the need to kind of hit the reboot button.</seg>
<seg id="1388">He mentioned Justice again being a repeat guest at this endeavour that we are sitting in right now and a lot of it stems from overtime. I’m talking about nursing. We’re talking in the corrections system and there are a number of other departments that repeatedly come back for appropriations related to overtime.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Again, I think there needs to be a serious recognition from the Minister responsible for Human Resources on how to go about filling this government’s capacity.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Filling within the positions that we’ve got in our org. charts, if we actually filled the positions, we would see where our weaknesses and strengths are. Mr. Main today talked about how the strain it puts on certain professions within our government where it’s creating burnout, it’s creating health issues for some of our staff where we need to take a step back and really evaluate what we can do to move forward to fill our government to capacity so that we know where our strengths and weaknesses are and we’re not playing catch-up all the time.</seg>
<seg id="1391">Again, it’s just a comment, and overtime is of interest to me and I would like to get some further information as we go forward on where some of the priorities and where some of the real triggers are so that we can look forward to finding solutions together.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Just a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Mr. Mikkungwak, you had a question?</seg>
<seg id="1394">Mr. Mikkungwak: Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1395">I just have one question here. On mental health, facilities, and treatment contracts, in your fourth bullet it indicates that although some charges are absorbed by Justice when medical travel is required, with that sentence, is that reflected in the $10.5 million?</seg>
<seg id="1396">I’ll try to make it short. Yes, it’s included in there.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Mr. Lightstone, you had another question?</seg>
<seg id="1398">My line of question falls back on both Mr. Main’s and Mr. Hickes’ questions.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last item you have provided is the health care staffing budget shortfall of $8.6 million. Now, you have identified the current budget of $143 million and a requirement of $151 million to come up with that $8.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1400">Is that for all compensation and benefits for the entire department?</seg>
<seg id="1401">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yes, that is for all compensation and benefits.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1403">Is that $151 million 100 percent accurate?</seg>
<seg id="1404">Are you foreseeing an increase of $25 million in salaries this year?</seg>
<seg id="1405">I don’t think any budgets are 100 percent accurate.</seg>
<seg id="1406">What I mentioned earlier, the permanent salaries, the casual wages, overtime, agency nurses, if I add them all up, I think what we have tried to do and which is the reason for asking for this $8.6 million is it’s our best estimate in terms of how much will be covered under the compensation and benefits. I think that’s the closest that we can get it.</seg>
<seg id="1407">I thank you, Chair, for recognizing that it can’t be 100 percent accurate at this point until we get through our public accounts. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1408">That led me to believe me that with the year-end so close, that’s quite a large projection.</seg>
<seg id="1409">Moving on to the letter provided by the minister on page 4, you have provided a list of budgets for the programs and for medical travel, you had a budget of $63.8 million at the beginning of the fiscal year for 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1410">I’m just curious: what was the original main estimate budget for medical travel in the 2016-17 fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="1411">Hon. David Akeeagok: Mr. Chairman, please bear with me. We’re just trying to look for the 2016-17, which I don’t have right in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="1412">If you want, I can go get that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1413">I would like to caution Mr. Lightstone that we are trying to deal with 2017-18 numbers, not 2016-17 or prior.</seg>
<seg id="1414">I’ll keep that in mind. I’ll disregard 2016-17.</seg>
<seg id="1415">The reason I was asking about medical travel budget for last year was I would like to enquire what the department is budgeting for medical travel in 2018-19.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Again, we’re working on numbers for 2017-18 and we’re not trying to look forward to what’s happening next year. I don’t know if Mr. Akeeagok wants… . He may not have the numbers, but Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think we’re getting too ahead. I’ll be doing a budget address in May. That will be part of the Budget Address for 2018-19.</seg>
<seg id="1418">We just voted on an interim appropriation, which would be of status quo at 2017-18. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1419">I was trying to reinforce the fact that there’s an issue in our budget process and it’s proven on the chart that the minister has provided us. There’s a serious misalignment of budgets to actuals and it’s going to be repeating every single year until it’s corrected, which I’m hoping will be this upcoming fiscal year, which is why when the time comes, I definitely will be requesting additional information when Health comes forward with their O&M request in 2018-19.</seg>
<seg id="1420">I really would hate to see the Assembly continue to approve supplementary appropriations every year and just let it be as it has always been.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Hopefully, when the department comes forward with their O&M request, they will have the detailed information down to the level that we require.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Not a question, just a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Chairman: Thank you. Mr. Qirngnuq, you had a question?</seg>
<seg id="1424">Mr. Qirngnuq: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1425">I need clarification on one issue on medical travel. I’ll speak in English so that it’s clear. Medical travel, third bullet, from April to December, both scheduled and medical travel volumes have increased over the same period last year. Can the minister clarify to me as to why it’s that way, Mr. Chairman?</seg>
<seg id="1426">That’s talking about an increase in medical travel and it has been utilized more for people falling ill, more pregnant women travelling to give birth, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1427">There has been an increase in the number of patients going on medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Mr. Mikkungwak, you had a question? No?</seg>
<seg id="1429">Sorry. I thought you had your hand up for one more question.</seg>
<seg id="1430">We are on Health. Operations and Maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="1431">We just finished health care, $43,100,000. Moving to the bottom of the page. Total Department. $49 million.</seg>

<seg id="1434">Go to Bill 3 in your legislative binder.</seg>
<seg id="1435">Sorry. I’ve got to step backwards a little bit.</seg>

<seg id="1442">At this time, Minister Akeeagok, do you have any closing comments?</seg>
<seg id="1443">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Very quickly, I really appreciate the questions that we received, the commitment on the budgetary process that we envision for the upcoming main estimates, and the hard work that our staff have done to put together the best estimates that are in here.</seg>
<seg id="1444">Through this, we will be able to revise our budgets.</seg>
<seg id="1445">Before we get into the other bill, may I ask one of the witnesses to be escorted out?</seg>
<seg id="1446">For her wonderful work, her reward will be to leave the seat.</seg>
<seg id="1447">Chairman: Thank you. Did you want a different witness in or no?</seg>
<seg id="1448">Okay. Sergeant-at-Arms, if you could escort the witness out, please.</seg>
<seg id="1449">Moving on to Bill 4.</seg>
<seg id="1450">Mr. Akeeagok, could you do your opening comments, please.</seg>
<seg id="1451">Bill 04 – Supplementary Appropriation (Capital) Act, No. 4, 2017-2018 – Consideration in Committee</seg>
<seg id="1452">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1453">I appear before you today to present Bill 4, Supplementary Appropriation (Capital) Act, 2017-2018, No. 4.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Through this bill, the government is seeking an additional $96,000 for 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1455">This supplementary appropriation will provide the Department of Community and Government Services with non-cash funding of $96,000 to account for the adjusted interest costs due to delays in negotiations and subsequent capital lease signings with the Nunavut Construction Corporation for the Legislative Assembly building and the nine decentralized Government of Nunavut office buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1456">I would be very pleased for any questions or comments related to this.</seg>
<seg id="1457">Are there any general comments on the minister’s statement?</seg>
<seg id="1458">I’m just new to this process. I would like to understand why this is required.</seg>
<seg id="1459">Is CG&S unable to reallocate some funds from within their own capital budget for this?</seg>
<seg id="1460">This is an accounting requirement. It’s to reflect the accounting of an interest. I think it’s more to be transparent.</seg>
<seg id="1461">It’s not related to cash. The cash is available; it’s just we need to account for what the interest rate was. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>

<seg id="1517">Tomorrow is the first official day of spring. As the light returns to our sky, we look forward to the future.</seg>
<seg id="1518">I hereby prorogue the First Session of the Fifth Legislative Assembly and summon all members to meet in this Chamber at 1:30 p.m. tomorrow for the opening of the Second Session.</seg>
<seg id="1519">Speaker: Before we get to Item 22, I wish to make a statement.</seg>
<seg id="1520">As Speaker of the Legislative Assembly and Chairperson of the Order of Nunavut Advisory Council, I am extremely honoured to take this opportunity to announce this year’s recipients of the Order of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1521">On January 1, 2010, The Order of Nunavut Act came into force.</seg>
<seg id="1522">The objective of the order is to recognize individuals who have made outstanding contributions to the territory.</seg>
<seg id="1523">The order is the highest honour of Nunavut and takes precedence over all other orders, decorations, or medals conferred by the Government of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1524">As of today, a total of 15 individuals have received the Order of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1525">They have been recognized for their achievements and contributions in a variety of fields, including public service, the arts, education, language promotion, spiritual leadership, and economic development.</seg>
<seg id="1526">I am pleased to announce that two individuals have been chosen this year to receive the Order of Nunavut: Ms. Betty Brewster and Mr. Ludy Pudluk.</seg>
<seg id="1527">I am very glad that Mr. Pudluk is in the gallery right now.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Welcome, Mr. Pudluk.</seg>
<seg id="1529">As members will be very much aware, Betty Brewster is a renowned interpreter/translator whose career has spanned several decades.</seg>
<seg id="1530">In 2016 she was recognized by her peers for her lifetime of contributions to the profession with an Inuit Uqausinginnik Taiguusiliuqtiit Language Award.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Ludy Pudluk served as a Member of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories from 1975 to 1995.</seg>
<seg id="1532">During his many years of public service, Mr. Pudluk represented the communities of the High Arctic and was instrumental in the movement that led to the creation of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1533">I am pleased to announce that the investiture ceremony for Ms. Brewster and Mr. Pudluk will be held during the upcoming spring 2018 sitting of the Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="1534">The ceremony will be held here in the Chamber of the Legislative Assembly and will be televised live across the territory.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Her Honour Commissioner Nellie Kusugak will preside over the investiture ceremony in her capacity as Chancellor of the Order, and I look forward to all Members of the Legislative Assembly joining us on what I anticipate will be a wonderful occasion.</seg>

<seg id="1">Conspiracy-theorizing megachurch preacher visits Nunavut</seg>
<seg id="2">“The whole of the Arctic depends on what is happening here tonight”</seg>
<seg id="3">"Rodney Howard-Browne, an evangelical pastor from Florida, preaches in Iqaluit on Aug. 27."</seg>

<seg id="6">"A fundamentalist Christian evangelist known for conspiracy theories, climate change denial and marketing schemes brought his crusade to rid the world of the Antichrist to an Iqaluit church on Aug. 27."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Rodney Howard-Browne, a South African immigrant to the United States, told his congregation near Tampa Bay last year that those who rule the world worship Lucifer and drink the blood of human sacrifices."</seg>
<seg id="8">He preached for over an hour at an Iqaluit church to more than 100 people.</seg>
<seg id="9">But his message is not for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="10">“The whole of the Arctic depends on what is happening here tonight.</seg>
<seg id="11">"So if you want the fire [of the holy ghost], stand here [by the altar], otherwise you can leave."</seg>
<seg id="12">"The choice is yours,” Howard-Browne said at the end of the 2.5-hour event."</seg>
<seg id="13">About 50 people crowded the altar.</seg>
<seg id="14">“I didn’t fly thousands of miles to come play games here.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I didn’t come here to be liked either, and I didn’t come here for your approval. … Remember: When Jesus was raised from the dead, he had to ask people to leave the room.”"</seg>
<seg id="16">"The mostly Inuit audience included infants, youth and elders."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Inside the Christian Fellowship church in Iqaluit’s Road to Nowhere neighbourhood, kids ran around and played between the rows of folding chairs."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Outside, the church and mosque faced each other across a small parking lot, both overlooking Dead Dog Lake."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Howard-Browne’s sermon was part of an event organized by the Bill Prankard Evangelistic Association’s Arctic Hope Project, which is based in Ottawa."</seg>
<seg id="20">The association did not respond by Nunatsiaq News’ deadline to a request for comment.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The evangelist’s performance, number 119 on a tour of 300 one-night city stops he plans, began about one hour into the event."</seg>
<seg id="22">"First, a local Christian band opened the night followed by Iqaluit evangelist and singer Looee Arreak, who helped found the Christian Fellowship Church."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Eric Gonyon, an associate pastor with Howard-Browne’s Revival Ministries International, then held a 40-minute promotional session for his boss."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Looee Arreak, an Iqaluit evangelist and singer, performs before Rodney Howard-Browne speaks."</seg>
<seg id="25">(Image courtesy of Revival Ministries International)</seg>
<seg id="26">“God loves a generous giver”</seg>
<seg id="27">Gonyon asked the audience to provide their email address on registration cards and to follow Howard-Browne on Instagram.</seg>
<seg id="28">He gave out gift cards for Howard-Browne’s religious products.</seg>
<seg id="29">"And he plugged Howard-Browne’s upcoming book, Killing the Planet, which he said follows the history of corrupt economic institutions over the past 200 years."</seg>
<seg id="30">"“It’s really the spirit of the Antichrist, is what it comes down to,” Gonyon said."</seg>
<seg id="31">Gonyon then played an 18-minute promotional video of Howard-Browne’s evangelical career.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Towards the end of the video, Howard-Browne prayed that those who donate money to his ministry will get credit before God for the souls his ministry saves."</seg>
<seg id="33">"“God loves a generous giver,” Howard-Browne said in the video."</seg>
<seg id="34">Gonyon praised his boss when the video ended.</seg>
<seg id="35">"“One sows and one reaps and together we rejoice in the harvest, so that if you sow into this, whatever comes into this ministry’s account actually goes into your account."</seg>
<seg id="36">It’s really amazing.”</seg>
<seg id="37">"He then handed out offering envelopes and challenged people to do their “best gift for souls,” by either cash, cheque made out to RMI Canada, credit card or via smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="38">"“I always tell people, don’t let the biggest cheque you ever wrote be for a Sea-Doo or a new phone … let it be to revive the church and win souls."</seg>
<seg id="39">Amen?”</seg>
<seg id="40">Many people filled and sealed the envelopes and put them into blue plastic beach buckets passed around.</seg>
<seg id="41">Some looked at others and held the envelopes in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="42">One Inuk woman folded the empty envelope and put it in her purse.</seg>
<seg id="43">The call for donations comes in a city where poverty is widespread: Nearly half of Nunavut’s population relies on social assistance amidst long-standing crises in food security and housing.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Howard-Browne did not respond to an interview request from Nunatsiaq News, so how much money was raised is unknown."</seg>
<seg id="45">His net worth has been a closely kept secret but his website says he provides training sessions in 158 countries.</seg>
<seg id="46">It also says people who enrol in his Aircraft Donation Program will receive tax breaks.</seg>
<seg id="47">Gonyon told the audience to hold their offerings to Revival Ministries up in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="48">"“Father, we just thank you for this offering, and we thank you for representing souls, that whatever comes into our account goes to their account,” Gonyon said."</seg>
<seg id="49">Three one-foot-tall buckets of envelopes were collected.</seg>
<seg id="50">Rodney Howard-Browne preaches over a woman who he is about to lay hands on.</seg>
<seg id="51">Preacher counts Patterk Netser as a friend</seg>
<seg id="52">"Fundamentalist Christian evangelism already has deep roots in Nunavut, with followers in almost every community."</seg>
<seg id="53">"Bible conferences take place annually and, at least into the mid-2000s, were drawing bigger and bigger crowds."</seg>
<seg id="54">"One advocate and organizer of such conferences, Roger Armbruster, told Nunatsiaq News in 2004 that the conferences are powerful magnets for those whose lives have been torn apart by abuse and addictions."</seg>
<seg id="55">But Howard-Browne’s brand of capitalist and aggressive fundamental evangelism may be new to the territory.</seg>
<seg id="56">"Patterk Netser, a long-time defender of fundamentalist Christianity and current Nunavut minister of housing and Arctic College, is what Howard-Browne calls one of his “Eskimo friends” who tell him climate change is a hoax."</seg>
<seg id="57">"Netser declined an interview request by Nunatsiaq News but said, “Rodney is a friend of mine and we connect regularly.”"</seg>
<seg id="58">"When asked to respond to Howard-Browne’s many run-ins with the media, which includes saying a U.S. Supreme Court Justice should be shot for insulting the American Constitution, Netser said, “What goes on in the States is none of my business."</seg>
<seg id="59">My primary concerns are for my people and Nunavummiut.”</seg>

<seg id="61">“Tonight will be fire on ice”</seg>
<seg id="62">"One hour into the event, Howard-Browne—the main act—took to the altar."</seg>
<seg id="63">"“Tonight will be fire on ice,” the evangelist said to over 100 people, mostly Inuit, of all ages."</seg>
<seg id="64">"“If you don’t want the fire, you better make a run for the door now while you can.”"</seg>
<seg id="65">"Over the next hour, Howard-Browne’s voice rose and fell rhythmically."</seg>
<seg id="66">He paused for effect and shouted for emphasis at times. And he told jokes.</seg>
<seg id="67">"“I know I don’t look like I’m African, but it’s only because my parents kept me in the house most of the time, they never let me outside,” he said to scattered laughter."</seg>
<seg id="68">“Moses was the first one to use a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="69">He broke the first one and had to go out and get another one.</seg>
<seg id="70">And Adam and Eve were the first ones to use an Apple product.”</seg>
<seg id="71">"Howard-Browne rose to fame, in large part, for his laughing revival meetings where worshippers were seized with laughter for minutes at a time."</seg>
<seg id="72">"His granddaughter was visited by the Holy Ghost when she was two years old, laughing for 12 minutes straight, Howard-Browne said."</seg>
<seg id="73">Howard-Browne has been criticized by many in the international evangelical community.</seg>
<seg id="74">He has been called a false teacher who substitutes Christian teachings with frenzied laughter and hysterical emotionalism. Howard-Browne has responded to that criticism by saying those who insult him are insulting the Holy Ghost and are therefore bound for hell.</seg>
<seg id="75">"Arreak, the Iqaluit evangelist and singer who helped open the event, was the only member of the audience to be gripped by laughter during the sermon."</seg>
<seg id="76">"“This is not a funeral, why are people sad?”"</seg>
<seg id="77">Howard-Browne said.</seg>
<seg id="78">Arreak laughed.</seg>
<seg id="79">“We are serving Jesus and he is alive.”</seg>
<seg id="80">Arreak laughed loudly.</seg>
<seg id="81">"“I like this pastor,” he said to Arreak, whose sustained laughter grew even louder."</seg>
<seg id="82">Howard-Browne laughed with her as others in the audience laughed softly.</seg>
<seg id="83">“Such joy.</seg>
<seg id="84">"With joy shall you draw forth water, out of the wells of salvation.”"</seg>
<seg id="85">Arreak’s laughter hit a shrill pitch and echoed off the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="86">“This is legal.</seg>
<seg id="87">Nobody’s going to be arrested tonight.”</seg>
<seg id="88">"Arreak, who told Nunatsiaq News she refused to speak to media, whooped with more laughter."</seg>
<seg id="89">"Howard-Browne also spoke in tongues, which he claimed was once understood in the obscure native dialect of a Papua New Guinea pastor."</seg>
<seg id="90">“Man-gah-no-ra-pa-ta.</seg>
<seg id="91">"Ran-bum-go-pah-tah,” he said."</seg>
<seg id="92">Rodney Howard-Browne calls the audience around the altar to receive the fire of the Holy Ghost.</seg>
<seg id="93">Not all laughs</seg>
<seg id="94">But not everyone found Howard-Browne’s sermon captivating or funny.</seg>
<seg id="95">He lashed out at those who tried to leave before the end of his sermon.</seg>
<seg id="96">"Before he lay hands on a few audience members, Howard-Browne harangued two people as they left."</seg>
<seg id="97">“Where are you going brother?</seg>
<seg id="98">Hey.</seg>
<seg id="99">Hey!</seg>
<seg id="100">You leaving?”</seg>
<seg id="101">Howard-Browne said to one man as he quietly left the church.</seg>
<seg id="102">"“You come in here, you were filming with your phone and then you leave?"</seg>
<seg id="103">Are you the reporter for the daily newspaper here?”</seg>
<seg id="104">The audience laughed.</seg>
<seg id="105">"“I wonder what he would do if I would run and grab him and bring him back in…. Find out who he is and why he’s filming and why he left,” he said to one of his staff."</seg>
<seg id="106">"As he called the audience to the altar at the end of his sermon, Howard-Browne seized on two women sitting in the second row because he didn’t like the looks on their faces."</seg>
<seg id="107">“Are you guys born again?</seg>
<seg id="108">"What are you, Jehovah Witnesses?”"</seg>
<seg id="109">The audience laughed.</seg>
<seg id="110">“I’ve never seen people so indifferent sitting in the second row.</seg>
<seg id="111">"So you can either jump in with the rest, or you may be better than everybody else.”"</seg>
<seg id="112">The two women stood up and began walking out of the church.</seg>
<seg id="113">“I’m just asking a question.</seg>
<seg id="114">"I do this, you know, this is my job."</seg>
<seg id="115">I know what body language is.</seg>
<seg id="116">Don’t scoff at me.</seg>
<seg id="117">It’s not a joke.</seg>
<seg id="118">The whole of the Arctic depends on what is happening here tonight.”</seg>
<seg id="119">Event staff told the audience not to take pictures or recordings.</seg>
<seg id="120">"Meanwhile, they photographed the entire event."</seg>
<seg id="121">That included running up to people who were sobbing as Howard-Browne laid hands on them and taking close-up pictures.</seg>
<seg id="122">"A photo album on Revival Ministries International’s website shows pictures of nameless audience members at their most vulnerable—pained facial expressions, eyes closed, mouths wide open, or collapsing to the floor."</seg>
<seg id="123">A woman on whom Howard-Browne just laid hands lies crying on the floor beneath a thin blanket.</seg>
<seg id="124">"In front of her, Howard-Browne and his staff advance to lay hands on an Inuit couple."</seg>
<seg id="125">Event originally scheduled for St. Jude’s</seg>
<seg id="126">"The event was originally scheduled to be held at St. Jude’s Anglican Cathedral in Iqaluit, but was changed at the last minute."</seg>
<seg id="127">"That change came from those who invited Howard-Browne, a receptionist at St. Jude’s said."</seg>
<seg id="128">"David Parsons, the Anglican bishop for the Arctic, said he was not aware that Howard-Browne was set to preach at St. Jude’s."</seg>
<seg id="129">"And if he had known, he said he would have stopped the event because Howard-Browne is an extremist."</seg>
<seg id="130">"In this case, local Anglican officials failed to follow protocol by getting the bishop’s approval before such an event, Parsons said."</seg>
<seg id="131">"The Anglican church has a reputation as a caring, compassionate church and, at times, works closely with other denominations, Parsons said."</seg>
<seg id="132">"“But there’s a lot of trust there, that you’re not going to be doing things that would, first of all discredit Christianity or the ministry of the people who are there.”"</seg>
<seg id="133">Howard-Browne appears to take a different approach.</seg>
<seg id="134">“I’m not here to appease religious people.</seg>
<seg id="135">"If religion was going to shake the Arctic, it would’ve shaken the Arctic,” he told the audience."</seg>
<seg id="136">"“I don’t go by invitation, I go by commandment."</seg>
<seg id="137">"… When you have the fire, you don’t need an invitation.”"</seg>

<seg id="1">"With little fanfare, Canada quietly launches new Arctic policy document"</seg>
<seg id="2">Liberals claim new policy represents “profound change of direction”</seg>
<seg id="3">"Thousands of Arctic cotton plants cover a meadow near Bathurst Inlet, Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="4">"Just one day prior to the federal election call, the Liberal government has released its long-waited Arctic policy framework."</seg>
<seg id="5">(File photo)</seg>
<seg id="6">By Jim Bell</seg>
<seg id="7">"One day prior to the start of Canada’s national election campaign, the Liberal government, with little fanfare, launched its long-awaited Arctic and northern policy framework on Sept. 10."</seg>
<seg id="8">"The document, which represents the first phase of a continuing process, will replace Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s 2009 Northern Strategy and the Harper government’s 2010 Statement on Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy."</seg>
<seg id="9">It’s supposed to serve as a guide for federal policy in the Arctic until 2030—but it contains no implementation plan or governance measures to guide future collaboration.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Those matters are to be dealt with in a second phase, the framework says."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Notwithstanding all that, a foreword from Carolyn Bennett, the minister of Crown-Indigenous relations and northern affairs, claims the policy document represents a “a profound change of direction for the Government of Canada.”"</seg>
<seg id="12">The release of the policy also comes much later than expected.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Earlier this year, Bennett said the policy would likely be released in June."</seg>
<seg id="14">CBC reported earlier this month that an announcement event planned for Yellowknife in August had been cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="15">"At the heart of the Liberal policy are eight “goals,” with accompanying objectives, and 10 “principles.”"</seg>
<seg id="16">"They cover a wide range of policy areas, including local and regional economic development, infrastructure, Indigenous rights, environmental protection, national defence and foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="17">"When Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, on Dec. 20, 2016, announced his government’s intention to create the new policy, he promised it would be “co-developed” with northern governments and Indigenous organizations."</seg>
<seg id="18">"To that end, more than 25 Indigenous organizations, along with the governments of Nunavut, the Northwest Territories, Yukon, Manitoba, Quebec and Newfoundland-Labrador, joined in on the co-development process."</seg>
<seg id="19">"“In co-developing Canada’s Arctic and Northern Policy Framework, our partners helped us to understand and reflect the unique opportunities and challenges within the different regions, jurisdictional responsibilities and treaty rights across the Arctic and the North,” Bennett said in a news release."</seg>
<seg id="20">"And some of those partners have written their own chapters, which are published outside the main policy document."</seg>
<seg id="21">Some chapters don’t represent federal policy</seg>
<seg id="22">"For example, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the Government of Nunavut, the Government of the Northwest Territories and the three territorial governments as a group have each respectively contributed their own chapters."</seg>
<seg id="23">But there’s a catch.</seg>
<seg id="24">The chapters contributed by the co-development partners may not actually represent federal policy.</seg>
<seg id="25">That’s a sign the federal government may have run into problems finding consensus among the more than 31 groups.</seg>
<seg id="26">"“While the framework chapters are an integral part of this process, they do not necessarily reflect the views of either the federal government, or of the other partners,” the framework document says."</seg>
<seg id="27">"The document also suggests that where they did find consensus, it wasn’t easy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"“The ideas, the aspirations, and the goals and objectives are the result of the meeting of many minds and perspectives."</seg>
<seg id="29">This often meant compromise on the part of governments and Indigenous partners as we strove for consensus.”</seg>
<seg id="30">You can find links to the Arctic policy documents at this webpage.</seg>
<seg id="31">Eight goals</seg>
<seg id="32">"Here are the eight goals of the strategy, representing what the federal government wants to strive for."</seg>
<seg id="33">"• Strong, sustainable, diversified and inclusive local and regional economies."</seg>
<seg id="34">• Canadian Arctic and northern Indigenous peoples are resilient and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="35">"• The Canadian Arctic and North and its people are safe, secure and well-defended."</seg>
<seg id="36">• Strengthened infrastructure that closes gaps with other regions of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="37">• The rules-based international order in the Arctic responds effectively to new challenges and opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="38">• Knowledge and understanding guides decision-making.</seg>
<seg id="39">• Canadian Arctic and northern ecosystems are healthy and resilient.</seg>
<seg id="40">• Reconciliation supports self-determination and nurtures mutually respectful relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples.</seg>
<seg id="41">Each of those goals is fleshed out with multiple “objectives” listing more specific aspirations.</seg>
<seg id="42">Ten principles</seg>
<seg id="43">"And to help carry out all those goals and objectives, the policy document lists the following principles below, which were developed to provide “continuing guidance on implementation of the framework”:"</seg>
<seg id="44">"• Decisions about the Arctic and the North will be made in partnership with and with the participation of northerners, to reflect the rights, needs and perspectives of northerners."</seg>
<seg id="45">"• The rights and jurisdictions of Canada’s federal, territorial, provincial Indigenous and municipal governments will be respected."</seg>
<seg id="46">"• Development should be sustainable and holistic, integrating social, cultural, economic and environmental considerations."</seg>
<seg id="47">"• Ongoing reconciliation with Indigenous peoples, using the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission as a starting point, is foundational to success."</seg>
<seg id="48">"• As climate change is a lived reality in the region, initiatives will take into account its various impacts, including its impact on Indigenous northerners, who continue to rely on the land and wildlife for their culture, traditional economy and food security."</seg>
<seg id="49">"• Policy and programming will reflect a commitment to diversity and equality, and to the employment of analytical tools such as Gender-Based Analysis Plus to assess potential impacts on diverse groups of people."</seg>
<seg id="50">"• The framework will respect a distinctions-based approach to ensure that the unique rights, interests and circumstances of Inuit, Arctic and northern First Nations and Métis are acknowledged, affirmed and implemented."</seg>
<seg id="51">"• The Government of Canada recognizes Inuit, First Nations, and Métis as the Indigenous peoples of Canada, consisting of distinct, rights-bearing communities with their own histories, including with the Crown."</seg>
<seg id="52">"• The work of forming renewed relationships based on the recognition of rights, respect, co-operation and partnership must reflect the unique interests, priorities and circumstances of each people."</seg>
<seg id="53">"• Every sector of society, from the private sector to universities and colleges, the not-for-profit sector, community-based organizations and individual Canadians, has an important part to play in building a strong Canadian Arctic and North."</seg>

<seg id="6">"Nunavut’s Conservative candidate says that if her party forms the next government, they would eliminate the carbon tax because it “increased the cost of absolutely everything.”"</seg>
<seg id="7">Leona Aglukkaq is setting off on a campaign tour across the territory.</seg>
<seg id="8">The former Nunavut MP launched her campaign at an event in Iqaluit on Sept. 12 at the Frobisher Inn.</seg>
<seg id="9">She then flew to Rankin Inlet the next day before returning to Iqaluit the following week.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nunatsiaq News sat down with Aglukkaq while she was in Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The carbon tax “has raised the cost of air travel, consumer goods, shipping, hunting and home ownership,” reads Aglukkaq’s campaign poster."</seg>
<seg id="12">Aglukkaq also told Nunatsiaq News the tax would negatively affect daycares and elders’ homes by increasing heating costs.</seg>
<seg id="13">“Every business is impacted by a carbon tax.”</seg>
<seg id="14">Aglukkaq said.</seg>
<seg id="15">“Introducing a carbon tax while we have affordability issues is one side of the brain not talking to the other.”</seg>
<seg id="16">"But George Hickes, Nunavut’s finance minister, announced in May that through an agreement with Ottawa, electricity and aviation fuel for aircraft operating within the territory are exempt from the tax."</seg>
<seg id="17">The territorial government has also subsidized half the cost of the carbon tax for Nunavut residents.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Aglukkaq’s platform for Nunavut has four priorities: affordability, housing, mental health and infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="19">“How can we as a government and private sector and territorial government work together to address this huge issue of social housing needs throughout the North?”</seg>
<seg id="20">"The housing portion of Aglukkaq’s campaign priorities says she will develop a comprehensive strategy that includes transitional housing, elders’ housing and housing for those with special needs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"The federal and territorial governments also need to consider boosting private homeownership, she said."</seg>
<seg id="22">Aglukkaq said she also promises to invest in northern infrastructure projects and mental health training for Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="23">"“Nunavut is the largest coastal region of Canada and we still lag behind in adequate marine infrastructure in our region, so getting back on track with major investments of that nature in the North,” she said."</seg>
<seg id="24">"“We need to address the need of building capacity, of training Nunavummiut to provide mental health services to support our communities.”"</seg>
<seg id="25">"When asked if she would make changes to the federal government’s Nutrition North program, Aglukkaq said the carbon tax has made food more expensive through increased shipping costs."</seg>
<seg id="26">"When asked if she thought the program was working and, if not, what she would do to fix it beyond scrapping the carbon tax, she said she would consult with the Nutrition North advisory committee."</seg>
<seg id="27">"She said if the Conservatives formed government, that committee would remain in place."</seg>
<seg id="28">“It’s important to have people on the ground from the North providing advice to the government on how to improve the program.</seg>
<seg id="29">It’s not a perfect program.</seg>
<seg id="30">Nothing is perfect in this world.</seg>
<seg id="31">We do need a subsidy in the North for food.”</seg>
<seg id="32">"Aglukkaq would not specifically say how she would address Nutrition North, but said a subsidy will still be needed on food and “removing is not an option.”"</seg>
<seg id="33">"Recently, research published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal found that food insecurity had actually worsened in Nunavut under Nutrition North, according to data from the Canadian Community Health Survey."</seg>
<seg id="34">"Aglukkaq said her former experience as minister of environment would help her address climate change and reduce emissions, but did not specifically say how."</seg>
<seg id="35">She said she would also support the Kivalliq hydro-fibre link and the Grays Bay road and port in the Kitikmeot.</seg>
<seg id="36">“Will we ever completely not depend on diesel anytime soon?</seg>
<seg id="37">"No,” she said."</seg>
<seg id="38">"When Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer visited Iqaluit in June, he said the territory needs to develop its natural resources, something he said is “virtually impossible” under the current Liberal government."</seg>
<seg id="39">"Aglukkaq said she is confident the policies already in place to consult Inuit on natural resource development will decide what will be, and won’t be, developed."</seg>
<seg id="40">"“The Nunavut Land Claims Agreement explains how business gets done in the North…. The land claims agreement, in my view, is the most comprehensive environmental plan."</seg>
<seg id="41">"It protects our land, it protects our waters, it protects our wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="42">“It’s already set out in terms of how projects proceed.</seg>
<seg id="43">And that’s a constitutionally entrenched agreement that we should be very proud of.</seg>
<seg id="44">"And decisions about the Arctic should be made by people of the Arctic, not Ottawa.”"</seg>
<seg id="45">"Aglukkaq left the capital for Pond Inlet and Arctic Bay on Sept. 19, her office said."</seg>
<seg id="46">"She also plans to make stops in Pangnirtung, Qikiqtarjuaq and Clyde River, before making stops in the Kivalliq and Kitikmeot regions."</seg>

<seg id="1">MLAs to launch search for new Nunavut languages commissioner</seg>
<seg id="2">Helen Klengenberg resigns for health reasons</seg>
<seg id="3">"Nunavut MLAs will soon launch a search for a new Nunavut languages commissioner, following the recent resignation of Helen Klengenberg from the position."</seg>
<seg id="4">Klengenberg had served as languages commissioner since June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">By Nunatsiaq News</seg>
<seg id="6">"Nunavut MLAs will soon launch a search for a new languages commissioner, following the recent resignation of Helen Klengenberg from the position."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Klengenberg, who has served as Nunavut’s languages commissioner since June 2017, resigned recently for health reasons."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Because the languages commissioner is an officer of the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut and reports directly to the assembly, it’s now up to MLAs to recruit Klengenberg’s successor."</seg>
<seg id="9">"They’ll do that through their management and services board, which is a committee of MLAs that looks after the assembly’s administrative affairs, Speaker Simeon Mikkungwak said in a short statement this past Sept. 17."</seg>
<seg id="10">"“I anticipate that the management and services board will begin its recruitment process for this position in the near future and will make announcements as required with respect to an acting appointment,” Mikkungwak said."</seg>
<seg id="11">"The languages commissioner’s job, according to a mandate described in the Official Languages Act, is to act as a language rights watchdog in Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Klengenberg’s appointment in 2017 came after a lengthy search that took about a year, following the abrupt resignation of Sandra Inutiq in June of 2016."</seg>
<seg id="13">Inutiq quit the position only about a month after submitting a report on the Qikiqtani General Hospital that found the hospital had no language policy and offered poor services to Inuktitut- and French-speaking patients.</seg>
<seg id="14">She also said it took the deputy minister of health more than a year to supply some files required for her investigation.</seg>
<seg id="15">"After that, MLAs advertised the position three times before they were able to recruit Klengenberg."</seg>
<seg id="16">"In 2017, the languages commissioner job paid an annual salary ranging from $119,000 to $170,000 a year, with a northern allowance of $15,016 per year, 25 days a year of paid holidays and various other benefits."</seg>

<seg id="2">"ITK’s election priorities include reducing inequity, building infrastructure, Inuit self-determination"</seg>
<seg id="3">Canada’s national Inuit representative organization wants a major nation-building exercise for Inuit Nunangat “comparable in scale to the development of the trans-Canadian highway or the trans-national railway [that] connected Western and Eastern Canada.”</seg>
<seg id="4">Canada’s national Inuit organization has issued a clarion call to whomever forms the country’s next federal government: launch a major nation-building exercise for Inuit Nunangat “comparable in scale to the development of the trans-Canadian highway or the trans-national railway [that] connected Western and Eastern Canada.”</seg>
<seg id="5">"In support of that, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami has issued a nine-point statement setting out the priorities it wants all political parties to consider during the current federal election campaign. (See document embedded below.)"</seg>
<seg id="6">“Inuit Nunangat remains the least developed geographic region in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Inuit experience extreme inequality compared to other Canadians, and to other Canadians in Inuit Nunangat,” ITK said in a news release."</seg>
<seg id="8">"In addition, ITK has also released a submission for what it wants the next federal government to include in the 2020 federal budget, which would normally be unveiled next February or March."</seg>
<seg id="9">That budget submission urges the next federal government to continue implementing an Inuit Nunangat fiscal policy for the allocation of Inuit-specific funding.</seg>
<seg id="10">"“ITK calls on all parties to commit to implementing an Inuit Nunangat policy throughout government, to ensure that Inuit are able to access and benefit from policies, programs and initiatives that are intended to benefit our people,” ITK President Natan Obed said in the news release."</seg>
<seg id="11">Both documents contain ambitious demands that include:</seg>
<seg id="12">• Connecting all 51 Inuit Nunangat communities to fibre optic telecommunications by 2031.</seg>
<seg id="13">• Eliminating the infrastructure defect in Inuit Nunangat by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="14">• Ending the social housing backlog in all four Inuit Nunangat regions within two years.</seg>
<seg id="15">• Creating more addictions treatment centres.</seg>
<seg id="16">• Creating more family violence shelters and transitional housing units.</seg>
<seg id="17">• Spending more on Inuit mental health and suicide prevention.</seg>
<seg id="18">The nine points in ITK’s statement of priorities are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="19">1.</seg>
<seg id="20">Action on social infrastructure and suicide prevention.</seg>
<seg id="21">2.</seg>
<seg id="22">Action on housing to completely fill the social housing backlog across Inuit Nunangat within the first two years after the election.</seg>
<seg id="23">3.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Action on renewable energy and climate action, so that Canada achieves net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050."</seg>
<seg id="25">4.</seg>
<seg id="26">Action on strengthening the Inuit-Crown partnership.</seg>
<seg id="27">5.</seg>
<seg id="28">"Action on infrastructure and economic self-reliance, starting with the creation of an Arctic infrastructure fund, accessible to all four regions of Inuit Nunangat, with an initial contribution of $1 billion."</seg>
<seg id="29">6.</seg>
<seg id="30">Action on education to close the gap in educational outcomes between Inuit and non-Inuit.</seg>
<seg id="31">7.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Full implementation of the calls for justice issued by the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, including the 46 Inuit-specific calls for justice."</seg>
<seg id="33">8.</seg>
<seg id="34">Action on poverty reduction and food insecurity.</seg>
<seg id="35">9.</seg>
<seg id="36">Action on advancing Inuit self-determination in research.</seg>
<seg id="37">"ITK continues its traditional non-partisan position, and does not endorse any political party."</seg>
<seg id="38">"In the most recent CBC Canada Poll Tracker report, as of Sept. 20, the Liberal Party of Canada and the Conservative Party of Canada find themselves in a statistical tie."</seg>
<seg id="39">"The poll tracker, which aggregates all publicly available polling data, has the Conservatives at 34.7 per cent of popular support, the Liberals at 34.1 per cent, the New Democratic Party at 13.5 per cent, the Green party at 9.6 per cent, the Bloc Québécois at 4.4 per cent and the Peoples Party of Canada at 2.8 per cent."</seg>
<seg id="40">The poll aggregator also suggests the Liberals still have a slightly greater chance of winning the most seats.</seg>
<seg id="41">"The federal election will be held on Monday, Oct. 21."</seg>

<seg id="1">Nunavut has a new polar bear management plan: NWMB</seg>
<seg id="2">“We are going to do what we can do to get this in place before this season”</seg>
<seg id="3">"Nunavut’s new polar bear management plan brings in a one-to-one male-female harvesting ratio for all Nunavut subpopulations, says the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board."</seg>

<seg id="5">By Jane George</seg>
<seg id="6">CAMBRIDGE BAY—The Government of Nunavut has approved a new polar bear management plan.</seg>
<seg id="7">That was the news from the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board to members of the Kitikmeot Regional Wildlife Board at its annual general meeting in Cambridge Bay.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The cornerstone of the new polar bear management plan is the one-to-one male-female harvesting ratio for all Nunavut subpopulations, the NWMB chair, Dan Shewchuk, told those at the meeting."</seg>
<seg id="9">"The gathering in Cambridge Bay is the first of three regional wildlife board annual meetings that he and Jason Akearok, the NWMB’s executive director, plan to attend."</seg>
<seg id="10">Akearok said getting the polar bear management plan done has been “quite a feat.”</seg>
<seg id="11">"“We are going to do what we can do to get this in place before this season,” he said."</seg>
<seg id="12">"The plan has been under consideration for nearly five years, with a big discussion about the draft plan last March in Iqaluit at an NWMB board meeting."</seg>
<seg id="13">The plan will be in effect until 2029.</seg>
<seg id="14">This female polar bear leaps into the water near Arctic Bay as her four cubs watch her.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Under the new polar management plan, the defence kill of these polar bears would count against three of the community’s polar bear tags."</seg>
<seg id="16">(File photo by Niore Ikalukjuak)</seg>
<seg id="17">"Of the circumpolar world’s 19 subpopulations of polar bears, 12 are found mainly in Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="18">There are quotas now for each of those subpopulations—and defence kills fall under annual quotas for each community.</seg>
<seg id="19">"While the new plan won’t increase quotas right now, new total allowable harvests, as the quotas are called, will be considered as new data comes."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Under the previous plan, Nunavut communities could only hunt one female polar bear for every two male polar bears hunted through an annual allotment of community polar bear tags.  That applied everywhere except to a Baffin Bay subpopulation of polar bears, where a one-to-one male-female harvesting ratio was in place."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Under the new plan, it won’t make any difference if a polar bear harvested in Nunavut is a male or female, as long as the balance between males and females is maintained."</seg>
<seg id="22">Cubs will count as a half tag.</seg>
<seg id="23">"The new one-to-one harvest ratio should allow communities to continue with defence kills, when needed."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Polar bear incursions into communities have been an increasing concern in the territory after two deaths by polar bear mauling in the Kivalliq region last year—but, under the current management plan, the defence killing of a polar bear, when female, has counted as two tags."</seg>
<seg id="25">This has left some communities with no more tags to count on after a defence kill.</seg>
<seg id="26">"The new plan will also encourage communities to engage in polar bear deterrence, Shewchuk told Nunatsiaq News."</seg>
<seg id="27">"But he has previously said that aggressive polar bears are harmful to Inuit culture and lifestyle, because of damage to cabins, bird colonies and seal populations."</seg>
<seg id="28">Those at the meeting in Cambridge Bay welcomed news of the change in the polar bear management plan.</seg>
<seg id="29">They were also pleased to learn that Cambridge Bay will have five more tags for grizzly bears.</seg>
<seg id="30">"A large grizzly bear was seen, and later shot, after roaming around an area close to Mount Pelly where there are many cabins."</seg>
<seg id="31">"Elsewhere, the reaction to the new polar management plan could be mixed."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Polar bears face an uncertain future due to threats posed by climate change, according to a 2018 assessment by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada.  The committee, known as COSEWIC, once again assessed polar bears as a “special concern.”"</seg>
<seg id="33">That means the species may become threatened or endangered because of a combination of biological characteristics and identified threats.</seg>

<seg id="1">Inuktut Qaliujaaqpait — the product of history and determination</seg>
<seg id="2">“It is a gift to our children today and the generations to come”</seg>
<seg id="3">Here’s the Inuktut Qaliujaaqpait chart — a writing system for all dialect and all regions.</seg>
<seg id="4">ITK says it does not replace syllabics and that regions can and will continue use of syllabics and other distinct writing systems.</seg>
<seg id="5">ITK also says there is no expectation that people who already use older writing systems will have to change the way they write.</seg>
<seg id="6">By Mary Simon</seg>
<seg id="7">"I was very pleased to hear the news that the board members of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami unanimously approved the new Inuktut writing system, Inuktut Qaliujaaqpait, earlier this month."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami means “united Inuit of Canada,” and there are few examples more powerful of our people taking united action to ensure the survival of our culture and language."</seg>
<seg id="9">It is a proud moment for me.</seg>
<seg id="10">"In June 2011, when I was president of ITK, we created a bold new vision to transform our education system."</seg>
<seg id="11">"We released the national strategy on Inuit education with 10 ambitious recommendations born from a collective vision to see our children thrive in their formal education, while being strong in their Inuit culture and language."</seg>
<seg id="12">One of the recommendations was to establish a unified writing system for the Inuit language.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has taken Inuit in Canada decades to get to this point and it is the dawn of a new era.</seg>
<seg id="14">The passion and dedication of Inuit language keepers throughout all of our communities across Inuit Nunangat made way for Inuktut Qaliujaaqpait.</seg>
<seg id="15">It means that we now have a unified writing system that is compatible for use in all Inuktut dialects.</seg>
<seg id="16">The introduction of the new writing system will be gradual.</seg>
<seg id="17">"It is not meant to take away or replace the writing systems Inuit are currently using in their communities, but rather to be used as a tool alongside existing writing systems that will improve communication between Inuit."</seg>
<seg id="18">It is a gift to our children today and the generations to come.</seg>
<seg id="19">"I can now imagine a time when Inuit are communicating across Canada and sharing valuable publications and education curriculum, where capacity to develop high-quality education material is no longer an issue and our children are graduating from high school fully bilingual, literarily and verbally."</seg>
<seg id="20">"History has challenged us as a people. Colonization ravaged our ways of life, our familial structures and our language."</seg>
<seg id="21">But we are here today.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have looked to the past so that we can understand who we are today and why things have come to be the way they are.</seg>
<seg id="23">I believe that we are now at a crossroads where we can either keep looking back or begin to focus on the possibilities of our future.</seg>
<seg id="24">The adoption of Inuktut Qaliujaaqpait for all Inuit in Canada tells me that we are ready to move forward together.</seg>
<seg id="25">"During the eight years since the launch of the National Strategy on Inuit Education, we’ve been able to adopt the term “Inuktut” to mean all Inuit languages, no matter the dialect."</seg>
<seg id="26">"For me, it has also become a symbol of Inuit unity. It transcends all our artificial political boundaries."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Our language is who and what we are, and the health of our language lies at the core of our well-being."</seg>
<seg id="28">My hope is that we can use Inuktut in all its beautiful spoken and written forms and move forward with the same determination we put towards our collective land claims.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Mary Simon was president of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami in 2011 when the organization released its national strategy on Inuit education, which contained a recommendation for the creation of a common writing system for the Inuit language."</seg>

<seg id="2">"“Many laws, policies, standards or institutional practices in place are sources of discrimination and inequity”"</seg>
<seg id="3">"Quebec Premier Francois Legault apologized to the First Nations and Inuit of Quebec on Oct. 2, following the release of a report on the discrimination they have faced in their relations with the public service."</seg>
<seg id="4">(Screenshot)</seg>
<seg id="5">"In this way, Legault said, the province of Quebec has failed in its duty to Indigenous people."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Legault gave the apology—the first of 142 recommendations that came out of the report—in the National Assembly on Wednesday, Oct. 2, two days after retired Superior Court Justice Jacques Viens, who led the commission, released his report."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Excuses are not enough, Legault said."</seg>
<seg id="8">He promised to consider each of the recommendations and to look deeper into why this discrimination took place.</seg>
<seg id="9">"“Many laws, policies, standards or institutional practices in place are sources of discrimination and inequity to the point of seriously compromising the quality of services offered First Nations and Inuit,” Viens said at the Sept. 30 release of the report."</seg>
<seg id="10">"His inquiry looked specifically at the treatment of Indigenous people by police, the justice system, the correctional system, health and social services, and youth protection services."</seg>
<seg id="11">Lucy Grey was the Inuit liaison for the Viens commission.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Here, she testifies during the November 2018 hearings."</seg>

<seg id="14">"In response to the report, the Kativik Regional Government released a statement recognizing the importance of the recommendations, or calls for action, in improving the relationship between Indigenous people and the provincial government."</seg>
<seg id="15">"In particular, the KRG urged the government to take action on a recommendation that videoconferencing be implemented for bail hearings for offenders in remote areas, something the regional government has been in talks with the province about."</seg>
<seg id="16">"“The KRG is fully committed to working closely with all government authorities and other regional organizations to implement all the commission’s calls for action that fall under its mandate,” said KRG chairperson Jennifer Munick in a news release."</seg>
<seg id="17">The Nunavik Regional Board of Health and Social Services also responded to the report by saying that it addressed the concerns the board had expressed during the commission’s hearings about health and social services and youth protection services.</seg>
<seg id="18">The need for funding and autonomy in providing health and social services for Inuit was voiced by the board during the hearings.</seg>
<seg id="19">"“We now expect the Government of Quebec to respond to the report’s calls for action, and this with our close involvement in their design and application,” said executive director Minnie Grey in an Oct. 2 news release."</seg>
<seg id="20">The board also expressed appreciation for the commission tasking the Quebec ombudsperson with overseeing that the 142 recommendations are acted on.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Makivik president Charlie Watt spoke during the hearings about the Nunavik region’s process of self-determination, and said in an Oct. 1 release that Inuit provided testimony in all areas of the inquiry’s mandate."</seg>
<seg id="22">"“Many times, in tears, my fellow Inuit testified to the commission about their experiences with the health, justice, social services, youth protection, historical injustices, and other interactions with Quebec government services,” Watt said."</seg>
<seg id="23">"While he noted a full response to the report was forthcoming, “based on the first call to action—that Quebec apologize to Inuit and First Nations for the rampant discrimination found in public services provided to our people—we feel we have been heard.”"</seg>

<seg id="14">This includes getting remote and northern communities off diesel generators.”</seg>
<seg id="15">"The Liberal Party, meanwhile, says it will be “moving forward with investments that will see all Inuit communities are off diesel and instead powered by clean, renewable and reliable sources of energy—such as hydro, wind, and solar—by 2030.”"</seg>
<seg id="16">And the New Democratic Party says it “will set a target to power Canada with net carbon-free electricity by 2030…. Meeting this carbon-free electricity goal in a way that respects local communities and creates good jobs is essential.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We’ll support investments in innovative community-owned and operated clean energy projects to keep jobs and expertise local, and work in partnership with Indigenous and northern communities to move off diesel.”"</seg>
<seg id="18">"According to an Environment and Climate Change Canada report released earlier this year, Nunavut’s contribution to the national carbon footprint has always been less than one per cent."</seg>
<seg id="19">"In 2017, the territory produced the equivalent of 0.6 megatonnes of carbon dioxide, roughly the same as 18,000 passenger vehicles."</seg>
<seg id="20">"The same year, Alberta, which led the country in greenhouse gas emissions, produced the equivalent of almost 84 million passenger vehicles."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Despite this, Nunavut has seen its greenhouse gas emissions increase by over 30 per cent since 2005, the biggest growth in the country and nearly double that of Alberta, which has the second-largest growth over the same period."</seg>
<seg id="22">"While the switch to renewable energy proposed by the three parties would reverse this growth, the impact it would have on the nation’s carbon footprint would be minuscule."</seg>
<seg id="23">It’s the communities that would benefit the most.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Nunavummiut pay more for electricity than people anywhere else in the country, and investments into renewable energy could reduce that."</seg>
<seg id="25">"However, the challenge with renewable energy projects is balancing their upfront cost with the pre-existing expense of current power needs."</seg>
<seg id="26">"Last month, the WWF released a report that looked at how viable renewable energy could be in powering each of Nunavut’s 25 communities."</seg>
<seg id="27">"It found that under an eight per cent discount rate—which accounts for the level of risk on a project or other sources of funding—Baker Lake, Coral Harbor, Iqaluit and Rankin Inlet could all save money by transitioning to 20 per cent renewable energy, including upfront costs, over a 15-year period."</seg>
<seg id="28">"The study also identified 16 other communities that with a four per cent discount rate—around what QEC would be able to borrow money for—and approximately $2 million in grant funding, could also make the transition to 20 per cent renewable energy."</seg>
<seg id="29">"But the report just takes a high-level look at the viability of these projects, only suggesting making the transition to renewable energy if it’s cheaper than current energy costs."</seg>
<seg id="30">Actually transitioning the viable communities to renewable energy would require a considerable amount of work.</seg>
<seg id="31">"“There’s a lot of consultation that would have to happen, and it would probably need to start in the next year if they’re going to hit those targets for every single community,” said Lenio."</seg>
<seg id="32">"“You would have to go to the community, work out what they would like to do, what the community vision for energy is, find out what other local priorities are and what areas around the community are important for traditional uses like harvesting and wildlife.”"</seg>
<seg id="33">"That doesn’t include setting up data collection equipment for solar or wind, a process that can take two years for adequate data, or any work with the QEC to ensure that the renewable energy could connect to and integrate with their system."</seg>
<seg id="34">"Transitioning all communities to 100 per cent renewable energy, as all three parties call for, would not only require a considerable time investment but a significant financial one as well."</seg>
<seg id="35">"While the NDP and Liberals have yet to announce what their financial commitment to the transition would be, the Green Party did so last week."</seg>
<seg id="36">"Included in their platform-costing report, the party pledged $150 million over the next five years to transitioning all remote and northern communities—not just those in Nunavut—away from diesel."</seg>
<seg id="37">It isn’t enough.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Lenio points out that for a community like Arctic Bay to transition even 60 per cent of their power to renewable energy, there would need to be a capital expenditure of at least $27.8 million."</seg>
<seg id="39">"According to the same report, for other communities to achieve even a 60 per cent reliance on renewable energy, the initial expenditures are even higher."</seg>
<seg id="40">"In Iqaluit, it’s expected to cost $148 million."</seg>
<seg id="41">"While this represents a significant reduction from the $250-500-million price tag attached to the hydroelectric project once considered by the city, it would use all Green Party allocated funds on one community."</seg>
<seg id="42">"Lenio doesn’t expect the federal government to fully pay for these projects, but added that finding project partners and ways to leverage the work also takes time."</seg>
<seg id="43">"Given the 2030 deadline, time is in short supply."</seg>
<seg id="44">"“For solar, I’d say the two- to five-year range."</seg>
<seg id="45">"For wind energy, you’re looking more at like the five- to seven-year range,” said Lenio when asked how long renewable energy projects can take."</seg>
<seg id="46">"When these timelines are multiplied by more than 25 communities and intended to happen at roughly the same time across vast, remote areas with seasonal access, Lenio wonders how it would get done."</seg>
<seg id="47">"In spite of those challenges, she’s optimistic.  “Hopefully with these ambitious targets, it will result in some positive changes."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Even if we don’t make it 100 per cent of the way there, it’s good to have that ambition.”"</seg>
<seg id="49">"Note: This article references the federal election campaign platforms of the Green Party, the Liberal Party and the NDP."</seg>
<seg id="50">"At the time of publication, the Conservative Party had yet to officially release their platform and, thus, was not included in the story."</seg>

<seg id="1">Iqaluit’s Inuktut daycare calls for greater government support</seg>
<seg id="2">“We must recognize how essential our early learning and child-care workers are to the Nunavut workforce”</seg>
<seg id="3">"Laakkuluk Williamson Bathory, who is chair of the Tumikuluit Saipaaqivik (Iqaluit Inuktitut Daycare Society) board of directors, is seeking greater support from the Government of Nunavut for quality early learning and child care grounded in Inuit language and culture."</seg>
<seg id="4">By Nunatsiaq News</seg>
<seg id="5">"Open letter to Nunavut Premier Joe Savikataaq and Education Minister David Joanasie:  Dear Hon. Savikataaq and Minister Joanasie,"</seg>
<seg id="6">I am a part of a group of Inuit parents who care deeply about our language and culture.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I am also the chair of the board of directors of Tumikuluit Saipaaqivik, the only Inuktut-immersion early learning and child-care facility in Iqaluit and the only institution in the capital city of Nunavut that sends children into the education system already speaking Inuktut."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Tumikuluit Saipaaqivik was closed from Aug. 21 until Sept. 12, 2019, simply because there was not enough staff to stay open and, moreover, it has been operating under capacity for nearly a year."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Not many people apply to work at Tumikuluit because of the relatively low pay (though the highest of all daycares in Iqaluit), little to no benefits, no housing and because of the social system that sees daycare work as low status and female."</seg>
<seg id="10">"The daycare is now open again, but under a crisis regime: we have lost our long-time and amazing executive director due to burnout."</seg>
<seg id="11">"We now have a part-time office administrator, a full-time daycare manager, two full-time caregivers, and each of the parents take turns to work at the daycare (all with cleared criminal record checks and vulnerable sector checks in hand), for a whole day each, while we continue to look for full-time, qualified staff."</seg>
<seg id="12">"It is an unconventional system, but as parents, we believe in giving our children safe and whole Inuktut spaces to our children, so we are making every effort to keep the daycare open."</seg>
<seg id="13">We are still at risk of closing permanently.</seg>
<seg id="14">"The Nunavut daycare system is not sustainable. Child-care workers are expected to take on one of the most important roles in children’s lives by providing quality early childhood education, grounded in Inuit culture and language while being undervalued and under supported."</seg>
<seg id="15">Our non-profit society depends on many different and inadequate streams of annual funding programs and parent volunteers to govern and oversee the management of an early learning centre.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Our child-care workers are often on the brink of poverty because of the low pay and benefits, the lack of training on the job and the lack of housing."</seg>
<seg id="17">Child-care workers are currently being asked to work for less than what is needed to support themselves or their family.</seg>
<seg id="18">The adverse circumstances our daycare finds itself in are compounded by the unique skill set we require in order to promote and maintain Inuit language and culture during the most critical stages of our children’s lives; Tumikuluit only hires Inuit who can speak Inuktut fluently.</seg>
<seg id="19">We have 100 per cent Inuit employment.</seg>
<seg id="20">But we struggle with chronic staff turnover because we are unable to offer competitive wages and benefits to retain valuable staff.</seg>
<seg id="21">"In turn, this affects the quality of our early learning and child-care programming."</seg>
<seg id="22">Inuit must be sufficiently supported and valued to pass on our language and culture to our children.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Government of Nunavut must consider how it can better support quality early learning and child care grounded in Inuit language and culture.</seg>
<seg id="24">"We need to be able to offer our valued early learning and child-care workers competitive wages and benefits, which includes housing, vacation travel assistance benefits, and training–both on the job and in school."</seg>
<seg id="25">Tumikuluit’s vision has consistently been to expand our reach and programming to accommodate more Inuit children.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We have been actively seeking larger, more sufficient day care space to achieve that vision, insofar as to fundraise approximately $80,000 towards a new space."</seg>
<seg id="27">We propose some of the following solutions to the Government of Nunavut:</seg>
<seg id="28">"• Integrate early learning and child-care workers as part of GN staff so that they are part of competitive salaries offered by the GN, following the GN’s eight pay levels, on par with all teachers working in the Nunavut school system."</seg>
<seg id="29">• Incorporate operations and maintenance of all daycares in Nunavut into the existing school system.</seg>
<seg id="30">"• Offer comprehensive benefits to early learning and child-care workers, including but not limited to short-term and long-term sick leave, vacation pay, bilingual pay, parental leave and housing."</seg>
<seg id="31">• Create a central body to support all daycares in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="32">• Work with early learning and child-care centres immediately to address the crisis we collectively and currently face while we work together on a longer-term plan for systemic change.</seg>
<seg id="33">We must recognize how essential our early learning and child-care workers are to the Nunavut workforce.</seg>
<seg id="34">Our daycares must be fully staffed and all staff need sustainable employment.</seg>
<seg id="35">We must keep our daycares open.</seg>
<seg id="36">"With the necessary systemic change, Nunavut’s early learning and child-care professionals will value their employment and that will be a significant step towards achieving an early learning and child-care system that provides the best possible start to life for Inuit children, including the opportunity to learn and speak Inuktut, to grow up prepared to live a harmonious life rooted in Inuit ways of knowing, and to be equipped to participate in Canadian society."</seg>
<seg id="37">"Sincerely,"</seg>
<seg id="38">Laakkuluk Williamson Bathory</seg>
<seg id="39">"Chair, Tumikuluit Saipaaqivik (Iqaluit Inuktitut Daycare Society) Board of Directors"</seg>

<seg id="2">“The name of it is Inuit Studies Conference so it makes sense … that we wanted to use an Inuit language”</seg>
<seg id="3">"Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. president Aluki Kotierk, right, speaks on a panel entitled “Inuktut as a human right” on Thursday, Oct. 3, at the Inuit Studies Conference in Montreal."</seg>
<seg id="4">"With her is Louis Tapardjuk, board member of Inuit Uqausinginnik Taiguusiliuqtiit, Nunavut’s language authority."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Despite the absence of translation, the two spoke entirely in Inuktut."</seg>
<seg id="6">(Photo by Lisa Gregoire)</seg>
<seg id="7">By Lisa Gregoire  Special to Nunatsiaq News</seg>
<seg id="8">"A Montreal hotel conference room was abuzz on Thursday, Oct. 3, as people attending the 21st annual Inuit Studies Conference streamed in to hear two Inuit leaders talk about why speaking Inuktut in Nunavut is a human right and how that right is casually denied."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. president Aluki Kotierk and Louis Tapardjuk, a former Nunavut government minister and board member of Inuit Uqausinginnik Taiguusiliuqtiit, Nunavut’s language authority, arrived on time and sat in two comfortable wingback chairs at the front of the room."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Camera operators set up to live-stream the event to NTI’s Facebook page, a screen projection offered the audience various conference hashtags to use and a link to English-language speaking notes, and the mostly Inuit audience settled in for the talk."</seg>
<seg id="11">Kotierk welcomed her audience and began the discussion in Inuktitut. Inuktitut-speakers responded from time to time with nods of agreement and applause.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Those who couldn’t speak Inuktitut, this writer included, sat and stared."</seg>
<seg id="13">Some people left the room.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Some leaned over and privately scrolled their phones, waiting for the English part."</seg>
<seg id="15">There was no English part.</seg>
<seg id="16">Welcome to the bewildering world of many Inuit in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="17">"“The name of it is Inuit Studies Conference so it makes sense, particularly when we’re talking about Inuit languages, that we wanted to use an Inuit language,” Kotierk said following the presentation."</seg>
<seg id="18">“Both Louis and I spoke about it and knew there would be no interpretation but decided it was crucially important that we use our language when we’re talking about the need to support and continue to have our language thrive.”</seg>
<seg id="19">"The international conference, which brings together Arctic experts from the North and south, has, in recent years, begun to include more Inuit speakers and presenters, more panels relevant to Inuit needs and more collaborations between Inuit and non-Inuit academics."</seg>
<seg id="20">"This Inuktitut panel, about language as human right, appeared to symbolize that evolution."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Kotierk’s speaking notes, which can be found here, outline numerous laws that ought to promote and protect Inuktut in Nunavut where the majority population is Inuit and the majority language spoken is Inuktut."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Those laws range from the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples to the calls to action and justice from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the National Inquiry into Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls, and territorial language laws in Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Kotierk listed several recent examples where Inuit deaths were attributed, at least in part, to language and culture barriers, such as that of Annie Kootoo, who died of acute liver failure in 2017, and 15-year-old Ileen Kooneeliusie, who died from tuberculosis that same year."</seg>
<seg id="24">“Inuit want to live with dignity and have the human right to do so.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Inuit Canadians should not be dying because they are unable to access and receive essential services on an equitable basis with other Canadians,” Kotierk wrote in her speaking notes."</seg>
<seg id="26">"In his speaking notes, Tapardjuk described a recent incident in Iqaluit where RCMP officers visited an elder to tell her that her adopted son had been stabbed to death at a young offenders facility."</seg>
<seg id="27">The woman was alone and did not speak English.</seg>
<seg id="28">Tapardjuk said police officers had to stop a vehicle and ask someone to help them deliver the traumatic news.</seg>
<seg id="29">"“There are a number of protocols in that scenario that should be followed in terms of does the person have support when you’re coming with life-altering information, let alone an interpreter,” Kotierk told Nunatsiaq News."</seg>
<seg id="30">“So many of us Inuit who speak English and Inuktitut are often called to do this.</seg>
<seg id="31">"We are expected to interpret in any given situation, even if we don’t know the people."</seg>
<seg id="32">Sometimes it’s confidential information.</seg>
<seg id="33">"So that, I would say, is another breach of human rights.”"</seg>
<seg id="34">"Kotierk said at the very least, Inuktut-speakers in Nunavut should have access to frontline service in their language in the areas of health care, justice and education."</seg>
<seg id="35">But even those aren’t guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="36">She and other leaders continue to call on the federal government to protect language and dignity in their homeland.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Ottawa passed its new Indigenous Languages Act in June to much criticism from NTI and Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, who said it ignored most of their suggested amendments."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Kotierk says she wants Inuit to know, “we are the ones in power."</seg>
<seg id="39">Let’s speak Inuktut when we go to the store.</seg>
<seg id="40">Let’s speak Inuktut when we go to the bank.</seg>
<seg id="41">Let’s speak Inuktut when we go to the school.</seg>
<seg id="42">"The more we speak Inuktut, and not accommodate other people who cannot understand, the more it will be a given that it needs to be used.”"</seg>

<seg id="1">QIA announces fees for tourism operators accessing Inuit-owned land</seg>
<seg id="2">Fees come into effect immediately</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tourism operators visiting the Qikiqtani region of Nunavut will now be charged tourism fees to access Inuit-owned land, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association announced during its annual general meeting held in Iqaluit on Oct. 8-10."</seg>
<seg id="4">"Commercial tourism operators now have to pay fees to access Inuit-owned land in the Qikiqtani region, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association announced during its annual general meeting in Iqaluit on Wednesday, Oct. 9."</seg>
<seg id="5">The Qikiqtani region receives the most cruise ship visits of any region in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Pond Inlet received 17 cruise ships this year, while Iqaluit received four."</seg>
<seg id="7">"“Inuit in Qikiqtani communities have expressed concern regarding the increased amount of commercial tourism activities in the region, particularly cruise ships."</seg>
<seg id="8">"QIA put in place these tourism operation fees to generate direct benefits for Inuit in communities impacted by tourism,” P.J. Akeeagok, QIA’s president, said in a news release."</seg>
<seg id="9">The announcement was followed by a presentation from QIA’s department of lands and resources on the new fees.</seg>
<seg id="10">The new fees include the following:</seg>
<seg id="11">• Plane landing on Inuit-owned land: $150 per landing</seg>
<seg id="12">• Helicopter landing on Inuit-owned land: $100 per landing</seg>
<seg id="13">• Commercial guest access for camping on Inuit-owned land: $50 per day</seg>
<seg id="14">• Commercial guest access for less than six hours on Inuit-owned land: $25 per day</seg>
<seg id="15">"Half of the fees collected will go to the hunters and trappers organization of the community adjacent to the Inuit-owned land being accessed by tourism operators, the release said."</seg>
<seg id="16">The other half will go to the QIA.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Cruise ships visiting Nunavut typically carry anywhere from 150 to 400 people, Rosanne D’Orazio, the QIA’s director of lands and resources, told the QIA’s board members during the meeting."</seg>
<seg id="18">The $25 per day fee applies to every passenger on a cruise ship accessing Inuit-owned land—or IOL.</seg>
<seg id="19">"“Regardless of how many people get off that ship and touch IOL, they get charged by the amount of people on the ship,” D’Orazio told the board."</seg>
<seg id="20">D’Orazio said cruise ships sailing in the Qikiqtani region will typically send the QIA the exact number of passengers on board a month or so before sailing.</seg>
<seg id="21">"“So if that ship has 350 passengers on it, we charge $25 per day per person."</seg>
<seg id="22">"So some of the larger cruise ships easily come up to a $10,000 to $20,000 fee just to land on IOL,” D’Orazio said."</seg>
<seg id="23">"For communities that receive a lot of cruise ships in the summer, like Pond Inlet, their HTO could receive $50,000 to $70,000 in fee payments, she added."</seg>
<seg id="24">The new fees will also be put up on the QIA’s land use application online registry.</seg>
<seg id="25">"That way, tour operators would be given notice of the new fees when they apply to access Inuit-owned land."</seg>
<seg id="26">D’Orazio said the QIA set the fees based on what other organizations were charging for tourism.</seg>
<seg id="27">"For example, Parks Canada charges $25 per day per person to enter a national park."</seg>
<seg id="28">"Hamlets will also often charge cruise ships and tourism operators when they enter communities, D’Orazio added."</seg>
<seg id="29">"“The cruise ships that access IOL are paying this fee only when they actually go into IOL parcel itself,” she said."</seg>
<seg id="30">"Joe Attagutaluk, the QIA’s secretary-treasurer, asked if it was possible that the fees would be increased in the future."</seg>
<seg id="31">"D’Orazio said changes would be possible, but would have to be discussed and decided on by the QIA’s board."</seg>
<seg id="32">“It’s an exciting initiative.</seg>
<seg id="33">"We’re leading again as an example of Inuit bringing back the benefits to the community,” Akeeagok told board members."</seg>
<seg id="34">"The fees take effect immediately, the QIA said."</seg>

<seg id="2">“Is Baffinland assuming that behind our backs NIRB or government has pre-approved the project?”</seg>
<seg id="3">"The cargo vessel Biglift Barentsz docked at Bremerhaven, Germany, last summer."</seg>
<seg id="4">"On top of the deck you can see two prefabricated buildings, 33 and 34 metres high, that Baffinland Iron Mines Corp. acquired from ThyssenKrupp and shipped to the Mary River mine site this summer."</seg>

<seg id="6">"They’re for use in the company’s railway-based expansion project, which regulators haven’t approved yet."</seg>
<seg id="7">(Photo © Thyssenkrupp Industrial Solutions)</seg>
<seg id="8">Community leaders in Pond Inlet are unhappy about a massive sealift of railway materials that Baffinland Iron Mines Corp. transported to its Mary River iron mine site this summer.</seg>
<seg id="9">"They’re concerned because, to get an early start on its big railway-based phase two expansion plan, which regulators have not yet approved, Baffinland sent two huge 10-storey pre-fabricated buildings from Bremerhaven, Germany, to the company’s port at Milne Inlet on north Baffin Island this summer."</seg>
<seg id="10">"They also shipped two smaller prefab buildings and large amounts of railway-construction materials, such as tracks and spikes."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Baffinland, as early as November 2018, told regulators and its partners at the Qikiqtani Inuit Association about the shipments, through written documents buried inside the public registries of the Nunavut Impact Review Board and the Nunavut Water Board."</seg>
<seg id="12">But people in Pond Inlet are only finding out about it now.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The Biglift Barentsz approaches Baffinland’s port at Milne Inlet this past August, carrying big prefabricated buildings for use in the company’s railway-based expansion."</seg>
<seg id="14">"When people in Pond Inlet saw the vessel pass by their community, it was the first they had heard of the shipment. Two more vessels carrying railway-based material arrived later, and more shipments are to arrive in the summer of 2020. ((Photo courtesy of ThyssenKrupp)"</seg>
<seg id="15">“We’ve just been finding out over the past three or four weeks.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We see these things [ships] passing by Pond Inlet being shipped up,” Joshua Arreak, manager of the Mittimatalik hunters and trappers organization, told Nunatsiaq News"</seg>
<seg id="17">“We wondered why and who and how they were doing that.</seg>
<seg id="18">"There is no explanation whatsoever from NIRB [Nunavut Impact Review Board], QIA [Qikiqtani Inuit Association] or anyone."</seg>
<seg id="19">"We were caught by surprise by this,” Arreak said."</seg>
<seg id="20">“We have not heard from QIA or NIRB.</seg>
<seg id="21">I don’t know.</seg>
<seg id="22">It’s within the Inuit organizations that we are having problems.</seg>
<seg id="23">"They are not communicating with us,” he said."</seg>
<seg id="24">NIRB acknowledged sealift earlier this year</seg>
<seg id="25">"No Nunavut regulator and no federal government minister has said yes to Baffinland’s phase two expansion plan, which would see a 110-kilometre railway between Milne Inlet and Mary River, a doubling of ore production to 12 million tonnes a year, and nearly 200 voyages annually by huge ore-carrying vessels."</seg>
<seg id="26">The project can’t be formally approved by the federal government until after a final public hearing before the NIRB that’s set to start this Nov. 2 in Iqaluit and finish up Nov. 8 and Nov. 9 in Pond Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="27">"The NIRB, which did not seek comment on the issue from stakeholders, acknowledged the early sealift of railway materials in a letter sent to Baffinland this past July 25."</seg>
<seg id="28">"The NIRB warned the company that if its phase two plan is not approved, it would be up to Baffinland to remove the materials, likely worth many millions of dollars, from the site."</seg>
<seg id="29">They also said the sealift will not affect NIRB’s decision-making on the file.</seg>
<seg id="30">"In an email sent Oct. 17, NIRB’s executive director, Ryan Barry, clarified that there is no legal mechanism for NIRB to either approve or prevent the sealift activity."</seg>
<seg id="31">"“The NIRB was left to instead point out that these activities would continue to be included in the ongoing assessment and all related materials could be subject to removal if the proposal is not approved to proceed at the conclusion of the Board’s assessment,” Barry wrote."</seg>

<seg id="35">"That makes each building, part of a prefabricated crushing and screening plant, roughly equal in height to a 10-storey apartment building—likely higher than any other enclosed structure in the eastern Arctic."</seg>
<seg id="36">But Baffinland does not yet have permission to use them.</seg>
<seg id="37">"“Baffinland will clearly mark the equipment as ‘Phase 2 only—Do Not Use’ until such a time that the Phase 2 Proposal reconsideration process has been finalized,” the company wrote last July 19 in a report to the NIRB."</seg>
<seg id="38">Materials stored on Inuit-owned land</seg>
<seg id="39">"In joint submissions to regulators, QIA and Baffinland say the materials would be stored on Inuit-owned land, subject to the terms of QIA’s commercial lease agreement with the company."</seg>
<seg id="40">"For Arreak and others, the process so far suggests Baffinland may believe approval of the project is already a done deal."</seg>
<seg id="41">“Pond Inlet people are not happy.</seg>
<seg id="42">Is Baffinland assuming that behind our backs NIRB or government has pre-approved the project?</seg>
<seg id="43">"I don’t know,” he said."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Frank Tester, a technical advisor to the Hamlet of Pond Inlet, received permission from the mayor of Pond Inlet, Joshua Katsak, to speak to Nunatsiaq News on behalf of the hamlet."</seg>
<seg id="45">"“Baffinland does indeed seem to have acted on the assumption that they would get approval for Phase 2,” Tester said in an emailed statement."</seg>
<seg id="46">"“Whether NIRB had any powers with regard to this matter, the net effect is to give the impression that it puts pressure on NIRB with respect to its responsibilities and saying ‘yes’ to the proposal."</seg>
<seg id="47">"This is of concern,” Tester said on behalf of the hamlet."</seg>
<seg id="48">"“Technicalities aside, the hamlet is of the opinion that this should not have happened."</seg>
<seg id="49">"This was clearly driven purely by financial considerations and assumptions made by Baffinland about approval for Phase 2,” he wrote."</seg>
<seg id="50">"“Our main concern is animals, the mammals and the marine environment."</seg>
<seg id="51">We would be the most affected community.</seg>
<seg id="52">That’s our concern.</seg>
<seg id="53">"Money won’t bring back the animals,” Joshua Arreak said on behalf of the hunters and trappers, stating an oft-repeated message that Pond Inlet has made for years in response to the marine transport component of Baffinland’s plan."</seg>
<seg id="54">"As for the non-governmental organization Oceans North, an intervenor at the upcoming public hearing on Baffinland’s expansion plan, they say they support “responsible development” of the Mary River mine."</seg>
<seg id="55">"But they also say Baffinland may be shipping too much ore too fast without a full appreciation of its environmental impact, and they’re critical of Baffinland’s decision to ship large quantities of ore out of Milne Inlet rather than Steensby Inlet to the south, which they were permitted to do back in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="56">"“I am not surprised that community members are upset that large shipments of rail equipment have arrived at Milne Inlet in advance of regulatory approval for this expansion,” said Chris Debicki, the vice president of policy development and counsel for Oceans North."</seg>
<seg id="57">Prefab system acquired from ThyssenKrupp</seg>
<seg id="58">These materials that are being shipped to Milne Inlet are part of a prefabricated railway-based material handling system that Baffinland acquired from the ThyssenKrupp conglomerate in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="59">"The two big buildings, which arrived first, were assembled in Bremerhaven, while a third structure, a rail-car unloading station, was assembled in Stettin, Poland, ThyssenKrupp said in a news release."</seg>
<seg id="60">"Baffinland has also transported a ship loader, a conveyor belt system and numerous other materials for use in a railway transportation system."</seg>
<seg id="61">"The list of materials that Baffinland filed with the NIRB and the NWB includes railway ties, bundles of rails, along with track spikes and tie plates."</seg>
<seg id="62">"ThyssenKrupp’s first shipment for Baffinland, on a vessel called the BigLift Barentsz, amounted to 5,500 tonnes of material, departing from Bremerhaven in early August."</seg>
<seg id="63">"Two more cargo ships delivered more materials this past summer, with more to follow in the summer of 2020, ThyssenKrupp said."</seg>
<seg id="64">"In a deal with QIA, Baffinland has agreed to put an extra $18 million into a reclamation security fund set aside to clean up the Mary River site if and when the project ends, NWB documents state."</seg>

<seg id="1">Montreal women’s shelter announces plans for new emergency night shelter</seg>
<seg id="2">Inuit women make up about 15 per cent of the current clientele of Chez Doris</seg>
<seg id="3">"Marina Boulos-Winton, the executive director of Chez Doris, and Cathy Wong, the city councillor for the Peter-McGill district and Speaker of Montreal city council, talk about the plans for a new 22-bed women’s shelter in downtown Montreal on Oct. 16 at a news conference at Chez Doris."</seg>
<seg id="4">(Photo courtesy of the City of Montreal)</seg>
<seg id="5">"Montreal’s downtown borough of Ville-Marie has given the green light to an expansion project launched by Chez Doris, a day shelter for homeless women, by granting a zoning change for a building it acquired last year."</seg>
<seg id="6">"The borough’s decision, announced on Wednesday, Oct. 16, will allow for major renovations to the new building located not far from the current shelter, so it will become a new emergency night shelter for women."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Chez Doris, the women’s day shelter at 1430 Chomedey St. in Montreal, is open seven days a week to women who need help."</seg>
<seg id="8">Many are Inuit.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The shelter’s current building is located on Chomedey St., not far from Atwater St. and Cabot Square, a gathering place for Inuit downtown."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Chez Doris is familiar to many Inuit women, who make up about 15 per cent of the shelter’s clientele."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Slated to open in the winter of 2021, the building that will house the new emergency overnight shelter was purchased last year with a $1-million donation from Montreal businessman Andrew Harper through the Jewish Community Foundation of Montreal."</seg>
<seg id="12">"“Thanks to our new pavilion, we will be able to offer 22 emergency overnight beds for women who are homeless,” said Marina Boulos-Winton, the executive director of Chez Doris, in a news release following an event held at the Chez Doris shelter."</seg>
<seg id="13">"“Currently, women make up about 25 per cent of the homeless population in Montreal, yet the resources dedicated to women in vulnerable situations are far from sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="14">This project is certainly a step in the right direction.”</seg>
<seg id="15">"The good news about the shelter’s expansion came less than a week after a longtime Inuk shelter client, Klara Okkuatsiajuak, originally from Nunatsiavut, passed away on Oct. 11 in hospital."</seg>
<seg id="16">Boulous-Winton told Nunatsiaq News that Okkuatsiajuak had never recovered from the recent loss of her daughter to suicide while in jail.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Most of the shelter’s Inuit clients first end up in the city as a result of housing shortages and legal problems, Boulos-Winton said."</seg>
<seg id="18">Many of them come to sleep in Chez Doris’s six respite beds during the day where they sleep for a few hours and then head back out onto the streets for the night.</seg>
<seg id="19">That will change with the new night shelter.</seg>
<seg id="20">"For now, Chez Doris, which receives up to 100 women a day, offers services and programs to provide for women’s basic and immediate needs related to homelessness, poverty, mental illness and addictions."</seg>
<seg id="21">Boulos-Winton said the numbers of Inuit women using the shelter have remained stable since 2018.</seg>
<seg id="22">"“However, we have seen a surge in the number of Inuit women needing help with primary needs such as emergency clothing and showers,” she said."</seg>
<seg id="23">"The only women’s day shelter in Montreal, Chez Doris is now open seven days a week, from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Dependent on donations for its programs, Chez Doris had to stop offering its weekend service for six months in 2014 due to a lack of money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"“We hope to receive financial support from Makivik [Corp.], but do not know at this time if we will,” said Boulos-Winton."</seg>
<seg id="26">"Chez Doris runs an Inuit assistance program—but Chez Doris fundraises to offer this program, as it does for 70 per cent of its roughly $1.7-million annual budget."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Cathy Wong, the city councillor for the Peter-McGill district and Speaker of Montreal city council, said at the announcement about the new night shelter that it would give women access to “adapted services offered by people who care about their well-being and their safety.”"</seg>

<seg id="1">Nunavut repudiates the Liberals</seg>
<seg id="2">"On the questions that matter most, the Liberals had little to offer"</seg>
<seg id="3">Mumilaaq Qaqqaq’s victory on Oct. 21 represents a repudiation of Liberal policy in Nunavut and the Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="4">Remember all those Liberal announcements?</seg>
<seg id="5">Announcement after announcement after announcement.</seg>
<seg id="6">More than we or any of you can possibly remember.</seg>
<seg id="7">"And that doesn’t matter, because as most Nunavut voters demonstrated on Oct. 21, they signified nothing."</seg>
<seg id="8">"From 2015 onwards, Justin Trudeau and other members of the Liberal government have showered Nunavut with announcements."</seg>
<seg id="9">A few of those announcements even offered things that were new.</seg>
<seg id="10">"But in the end, the people of Nunavut said “no thanks.”"</seg>
<seg id="11">"In the end, they turned to the party that, since 1961, Canadians have often turned to when they want to protest the status quo: the New Democrats."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Young Mumilaaq Qaqqaq’s upset victory represents a rejection of Trudeau’s approach to Arctic and northern Canada, which includes a repudiation of the much-talked-about Inuit-Crown partnership."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Since 2015, Trudeau has built relationships with the elite office holders at organizations like Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, Nunavut Tunngavik Inc., the Qikiqtani Inuit Association and others."</seg>
<seg id="14">"But this week’s election result shows that for ordinary Nunavummiut, the Inuit-Crown partnership is so far mostly irrelevant."</seg>
<seg id="15">"And that’s not surprising, because, in the end, on the big questions that matter most to Nunavummiut, the Liberals had little to offer."</seg>
<seg id="16">"It’s well-known that for most people in Nunavut, the top issues are economic and social: the perennial shortage of housing, poverty, the cost of store-bought food and air fares, the prevalence of deadly diseases like tuberculosis, and the everyday reality of suicide."</seg>
<seg id="17">"But on his last visit to Nunavut, this past Oct. 8, Trudeau brought no convincing messages on those issues."</seg>
<seg id="18">He used the landscape of south Baffin to talk about climate change and conservation.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Those are critical issues for all Canadians, but in this election, it’s issues like housing and the cost of living that Nunavut residents wanted answers for."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Instead, Trudeau turned the picturesque valley of the Sylvia Grinnell River into a vast studio for use in a video shoot aimed, not at Nunavut voters, but at southern Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="21">"In doing so, he failed to respond to the suffering of Nunavummiut and he badly failed Nunavut’s highly promising Liberal candidate, Megan Pizzo-Lyall, who deserved better support from her party leader."</seg>
<seg id="22">"On food prices and malnutrition, the Liberals have actually acted, creating a special higher-level subsidy for the Nutrition North Canada program, as well as putting more money, $12.5 million a year, into a fund for Indigenous harvesters in Nunavut and other northern regions."</seg>
<seg id="23">"But the harvesting money has yet to materialize and no one, so far, has been able to explain why."</seg>
<seg id="24">"And this past Aug. 1, Trudeau made a big splash in Iqaluit and in Arctic Bay, when he sealed a deal to create the Tallurutiup Imanga marine protected area and promised the creation of a new protected area called Tuvaijuittuq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"In doing so, he showered millions on the communities of north Baffin, for small harbours and conservation-related jobs."</seg>
<seg id="26">He also pushed conservation as a way to achieve reconciliation with Indigenous people.</seg>
<seg id="27">"The problem with that approach is this: when you’re coughing your lungs out with tuberculosis inside a badly overcrowded house, the term “reconciliation” doesn’t mean much."</seg>
<seg id="28">"Speaking of which, remember the Liberal government’s major announcement about TB?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"That was early in 2018, when Jane Philpott, then the national health minister, promised to eliminate the disease from Inuit Nunangat by 2030."</seg>
<seg id="30">"But Philpott, the federal minister who took personal charge of that file and made that promise, is gone."</seg>
<seg id="31">"Disgusted by Trudeau’s treatment of former justice minister Jody Wilson Raybould and by his unethical interference in the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, Philpott quit cabinet."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Since then, the Liberals have been mostly silent on the elimination of tuberculosis."</seg>
<seg id="33">"Like the harvesting fund, it appears to be stuck somewhere inside the Inuit-Crown partnership. This suggests that their bold anti-TB promise is now in jeopardy."</seg>
<seg id="34">"And as everyone knows, TB is a disease of poverty, related directly to poor nutrition and poor housing."</seg>
<seg id="35">"But on housing, Trudeau offered only a re-heated re-announcement this past summer."</seg>
<seg id="36">"And his government’s National Inuit Housing Strategy, “co-developed” with ITK, offers little hope for concrete action."</seg>
<seg id="37">We extend our congratulations to Mumilaaq Qaqqaq for her impressive victory.</seg>
<seg id="38">"As a new member of the fourth-largest party in the House of Commons, she’ll need much support to ensure her voice is heard."</seg>
<seg id="39">Nunavummiut should give her the benefit of the doubt and make sure she gets that support.</seg>
<seg id="40">"Qaqqaq defeated two highly talented opponents, Leona Aglukkaq and Megan Pizzo-Lyall."</seg>
<seg id="41">We hope defeat does not deter either of those two women from offering continued service to Nunavut and the Arctic.</seg>

<seg id="1">MLAs question ministers on $80M increase to fibre optic line project</seg>
<seg id="2">“I look at my colleagues here and we have a lot of suggested uses for $80 million”</seg>
<seg id="3">"Joelie Kaernerk, MLA for Amittuq, was one of the MLAs who stood in Nunavut’s legislative assembly to question the government on an $80-million increase to the Iqaluit-Nuuk fibre optic project."</seg>
<seg id="4">Some Nunavut legislators are questioning what they feel is an unjustified increase in funding to the territory’s Nuuk-Iqaluit fibre optic project.</seg>
<seg id="5">"In August, the federal government committed $151 million to the project, which involves 1,700 kilometres of fibre optic cable running from Nuuk, Greenland, across the Davis Strait to Iqaluit."</seg>
<seg id="6">"From there, a branch will extend to Kimmirut."</seg>
<seg id="7">"The Government of Nunavut will design and execute the project, set to be complete by 2023."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Last year, MLAs approved the project, which was originally supposed to cost $126 million."</seg>
<seg id="9">"“After this year passed, we received notification that the project cost jumped commensurate to increased costs and now is estimated at $209 million,” John Main, MLA for Arviat North-Whale Cove, said in his member’s statement on Wednesday, Oct. 23."</seg>
<seg id="10">"That’s an $80-million difference, Main said."</seg>
<seg id="11">"“I look at my colleagues here and we have a lot of suggested uses for $80 million,” Main said."</seg>
<seg id="12">The federal funds come from the rural and northern communities infrastructure stream of the Investing in Canada Plan.</seg>
<seg id="13">The project is also currently before the legislature’s committee of the whole as it reviews capital expenses for 2020-21.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Later that day during question period, Joelie Kaernerk, MLA for Amittuq, asked Lorne Kusugak, minister of community and government services, if the $80-million increase had gone through the government’s preplanning process."</seg>
<seg id="15">"That process, as defined in the GN’s capital planning process handbook, “is intended to ensure that the program is clearly defined, and that enough information is available to develop appropriate scope, a reliable cost estimate and schedule, prior to proceeding further in the capital planning process.”"</seg>
<seg id="16">"“Did it go through the preplanning stages, yes or no?”"</seg>
<seg id="17">Kaernerk asked Kusugak.</seg>
<seg id="18">“The planning has been done and trying to come up to a definitive figure as to how much it would cost.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Once we got more information, we found out that it would be much more expensive,” Kusugak replied."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Main, who sits next to Kaernerk in the assembly, rose next to continue questioning Kusugak."</seg>
<seg id="21">“Can the minister explain how a project of this magnitude can see such a huge cost increase in the space of one year?”</seg>
<seg id="22">"Kusugak repeated that after the money requested for the project was approved last year, the department reviewed the project and the cost increased after that review."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Kusugak added that in May 2019, his department determined that the funding request to the federal government should be increased to $201.6 million “in order to ensure that maximum available federal funding contribution was available for this initiative if required.”"</seg>
<seg id="24">"The next day, on Oct. 24, Main rose again during question period to press Finance Minister George Hickes on the same point."</seg>
<seg id="25">"“In terms of the financial management board, what specific processes and actions took place following that notification from the department that there was an $80-million cost increase to this ongoing capital project?”"</seg>
<seg id="26">Main asked.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Hickes said because the federal government increased its contributions to the project, along with a fully funded marine survey of the proposed project area, the GN increased its funding too."</seg>
<seg id="28">“The Department of Community and Government Services brought it back to [the financial management board] with the recognition that the cost estimates were under-estimated.”</seg>
<seg id="29">"Hickes also pointed out that the GN contributes one-quarter of the money for the project, while the federal government contributes the other 75 per cent."</seg>
<seg id="30">"“As the GN, we’re not on the hook for $80 million, we’re on the hook for 25 per cent of that."</seg>
<seg id="31">"So we will be looking at sometime down the road in future fiscal years, be looking at additional funds to complete out this project,” he added."</seg>

<seg id="1">"Nunavik needs its own riding, says Makivik president"</seg>
<seg id="2">Charlie Watt responds to federal election with optimism and a call for change</seg>
<seg id="3">"Charlie Watt, president of Makivik Corp., released a statement on Oct. 22 following the federal election, calling for Nunavik to have its own federal riding."</seg>
<seg id="4">By Elaine Anselmi</seg>
<seg id="5">"Makivik Corp. president Charlie Watt didn’t mince his words about Nunavik’s political landscape when he sent his congratulations to the region’s new MP, Sylvie Bérubé."</seg>
<seg id="6">"“We intend to follow up with the electoral boundaries commission to make the point, once again, that a Nunavik riding be created that reflects our region for Inuit, now more so considering the self-determination project we are working on,” he said."</seg>
<seg id="7">“We need this at the provincial level as well.”</seg>
<seg id="8">"Abitibi–James Bay–Nunavik–Eeyou is the largest federal riding in Quebec, extending from Nunavik south to the La Vallée-de-l’Or regional county municipality, where four of the six 2019 federal candidates reside, including Bérubé of the Bloc Québécois."</seg>
<seg id="9">Nunavik leaders have lobbied for a riding of their own since 1972.</seg>
<seg id="10">"In 2002, the Kativik Regional Government along with Makivik went before the Federal Electoral Boundaries Commission on the issue and again in 2011."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Since then, the boundaries of the riding were increased in 2013, adding two more southern communities."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Boundaries are redrawn, according to the commission, so that each contains roughly the same number of people."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Across Quebec, they average around 100,000 people per riding, with Abitibi–James Bay–Nunavik–Eeyou on the lower end with about 85,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="14">"With a population of about 13,000, Nunavik is well below this, but their leaders have argued for an exception due to the region’s ethnic makeup."</seg>
<seg id="15">"The smallest federal riding in Canada is Labrador, with about 26,000 people, while the Newfoundland ridings hover around 80,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bérubé won the northern Quebec riding with more than 11,000 votes, or nearly 40 per cent, followed by the Liberal and Conservative party candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Watt congratulated Green Party candidate Kiara Cabana-Whiteley, an Inuk from Kuujjuaq, who came in fifth with just over 1,000 votes."</seg>
<seg id="18">"In his statement, Watt invited Bérubé to visit the Nunavik region at her earliest opportunity."</seg>
<seg id="19">"“I look forward to meeting with her, and receiving her support for our work on self-determination, and on issues such as the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples,” Watt said."</seg>
<seg id="20">"He had a firm message for Bloq Québécois leader Yves-François Blanchet, whose separatist party won 32 seats across Quebec."</seg>
<seg id="21">"“We hope you are supportive of our development projects in Nunavik—both political and economic—and on that political terrain we can develop positive relations,” said Watt."</seg>
<seg id="22">"“However, on the issue of Quebec sovereignty, Inuit have a solid history of supporting a united Canada.”"</seg>
<seg id="23">"Watt framed the election, which gave the Liberals a minority government, as an opportunity to bring the different parties and parts of the country together."</seg>
<seg id="24">"“Justin Trudeau has a strong minority government, and he can work with the other parties—the NDP, the Bloc Quebecois, Greens, the Conservatives, and the Independent candidate—to pass bills and present them to the House, and in the process build national unity,” he said."</seg>
<seg id="25">"For Nunavut’s new NDP MP, Mumilaaq Qaqqaq of Baker Lake, he had hopeful words."</seg>
<seg id="26">"“I remember the [Inuit Tapirisat of Canada] meeting in Baker Lake in 1971 with Tagak Curley,” Watt said."</seg>
<seg id="27">“We were all young back then.</seg>
<seg id="28">"You’ll do well Mumilaaq, and I look forward to meeting you and working on Inuit self-determination together, for the next generation.”"</seg>

<seg id="1">"Expand use of anti-RSV agent in Nunavut, thousands of petitioners say"</seg>
<seg id="2">"“For the Inuit, you save money because of the high rate of RSV”"</seg>
<seg id="3">A Nunavut Lifeline air ambulance parked at the Iqaluit airport during a summer air show.</seg>
<seg id="4">"In some years, infant medevacs caused by RSV outbreaks can generate huge medevac and hospitalization costs."</seg>
<seg id="5">"When Dr. Anna Banerji and her fellow alumni from the University of Toronto medical school class of 1989 first posted their petition on change.org at the end of September, they hoped to attract 1,000 signatures."</seg>
<seg id="6">"But at the time this article was written, they had gathered 23,322 names—and they now hope to reach 25,000."</seg>
<seg id="7">Their petition says the Government of Nunavut could prevent multiple needless deaths and admissions to hospital of infants by extending the use of an antibody called palivizumab to all babies under the age of six months.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Palivizumab is an immunization agent, though not a vaccine, and is marketed under the brand name Synagis."</seg>
<seg id="9">"It’s been proven effective in preventing lower lung infections in infants caused by RSV, short for “respiratory syncytial virus,” which attacks the lower part of the lung, causing a frightening disease called bronchiolitis."</seg>
<seg id="10">"But Dr. Michael Patterson, the chief medical officer of health in Nunavut, told Nunatsiaq News in an interview that the GN only gives palivizumab to about 11 to 12 per cent of all children younger than two years of age."</seg>
<seg id="11">"“We do it selectively, for children that are at the greatest risk of severe complications from RSV, and groups where there is demonstrated real-world benefit in giving them palivizumab,” he said."</seg>
<seg id="12">"That includes children born prematurely, at fewer than 35 weeks’ gestation, or children with chronic lung or heart disease."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Banerji, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Toronto’s faculty of medicine, has published multiple studies over the past decade and a half on the prevalence and cost of RSV in the Arctic."</seg>
<seg id="14">"And, based on that research, she disagrees strongly with Nunavut’s current policy and says all Nunavut infants should get the antibody."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Dr. Anna Banerji, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Toronto’s faculty of medicine, says her research demonstrates that immunizing all Inuit infants with an antibody called palivizumab would save lives and money."</seg>
<seg id="16">Nunavut’s staggering costs make it worthwhile</seg>
<seg id="17">She said her studies have shown the prevalence of RSV in Nunavut can reach staggering levels and produce staggering medevac and hospitalization costs for Nunavut’s Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The antibody is expensive: about $5,600 per dose."</seg>
<seg id="19">"But even at that price, Banerji and many others believe it’s a bargain."</seg>
<seg id="20">"That’s because Nunavut’s high infection rates and high emergency evacuation costs make it economical to use, they argue."</seg>
<seg id="21">"“We did several cost analyses that shows that in most parts of the Arctic that if you give palivizumab, it saves money,” she said in an interview."</seg>
<seg id="22">"One cost analysis, published in 2013, found a big rate of lower respiratory tract infection in Kitikmeot babies: calculated at 389 per 1,000."</seg>
<seg id="23">"During that study period, which ran from Jan. 1, 2009, to June 30, 2010, the average cost of admission to hospital per infection ran to $57,535."</seg>
<seg id="24">"For the Qikiqtani region, lung infections in infants occurred at a rate of 202 per 1,000 live births and in the Kivalliq region, at a rate of 230 per 1,000 live births."</seg>
<seg id="25">This meant the GN spent about $5.9 million to care for gravely ill Qikiqtani infants and about $5.7 million for sick Kivalliq infants during the study period.</seg>
<seg id="26">"The Kivalliq region racked up the highest average cost per lower respiratory tract infection admission: $63,686."</seg>
<seg id="27">"“For the Inuit, you save money, because of the high rate of RSV,” she said."</seg>
<seg id="28">Head of Ontario physicians group supports petition</seg>
<seg id="29">"The president of the Ontario Medical Association, Dr. Sohail Gandhi, endorses Banerji’s position.  “Inuit infants have 10 times the rates of admission with RSV than the “high-risk” infants and the symptoms are often more severe."</seg>
<seg id="30">"Despite this disparity, Inuit infants in Nunavut do not get the antibody,” Gandhi wrote in his endorsement."</seg>
<seg id="31">"That position is also endorsed by professionals at the Northern School of Medicine, the Canadian Medical Association and the Canadian Institutes of Health Reseach Institute of Indigenous Peoples’ Health."</seg>
<seg id="32">But healthy babies in Nunavut whose mothers carry them to full term don’t get the antibody—even if they’re from high-risk communities outside Iqaluit with historically high levels of RSV infection.</seg>
<seg id="33">Banerji says that’s the wrong approach.</seg>
<seg id="34">“I’ve done my due diligence.</seg>
<seg id="35">I’ve shown my data to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Carolyn Bennett, Jane Philpott, they’ve seen the data and they say yeah, it’s really convincing,” she said."</seg>
<seg id="37">Nunavik immunizes all babies</seg>
<seg id="38">"And she points out that, unlike Nunavut, health authorities in Nunavik have given palivizumab to all infants for about three years now."</seg>
<seg id="39">"In the Nunavut legislature on Oct. 18, Health Minister George Hickes said, in response to questions from Iqaluit-Niaqunngu MLA Pat Angnakak, that the GN is taking a close look at the Nunavik example."</seg>
<seg id="40">"“We are following the progress of that program,” he said."</seg>
<seg id="41">Angnakak said that RSV can have a devastating impact on families.</seg>
<seg id="42">"“Recently, somebody who I know had their baby medevaced because of RSV and it really has an impact on the family, especially when the baby is so young."</seg>
<seg id="43">But Hickes defended the GN’s current approach and denied that his government is trying to save money by restricting the antibody to only pre-term babies.</seg>
<seg id="44">“It’s not a political or a policy decision based on cost.</seg>
<seg id="45">"It’s following best medical practices,” Hickes said."</seg>
<seg id="46">Patterson acknowledged that Nunavik went ahead three years ago with blanket immunizations of all infants under six months.</seg>
<seg id="47">"“We are waiting for some analyses on those numbers, and if we can find demonstration that there’s significant cost savings to administering palivizumab, we would probably adopt it as quickly as we could,” Patterson said."</seg>
<seg id="48">"But he said that in his opinion, there isn’t enough evidence to justify extending its use in Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="49">"“There’s a couple of things that I disagree with in the petition and one of them is the presentation that this is a done deal, or that there’s a scientific consensus on this issue."</seg>
<seg id="50">"There are still a lot of people with questions,” he said."</seg>
<seg id="51">The controversy over the use of palivizumab in Nunavut dates back many years.</seg>
<seg id="52">"In 2008, the GN refused to even participate in one of Banerji’s studies on RSV, even though officials in Greenland, Nunavik and the Northwest Territories agreed to participate in it."</seg>

<seg id="1">Model tiny home arrives in Kuujjuaq</seg>
<seg id="2">Nunavik Building offers a small housing solution</seg>
<seg id="3">"A model tiny house, from Nunavik Building, was shipped up to Kuujjuaq on the sealift this summer."</seg>
<seg id="4">(Photo courtesy Nunavik Building)</seg>
<seg id="5">The first of a series of tiny homes developed for Nunavik arrived on the sealift in Kuujjuaq this summer.</seg>
<seg id="6">"“I wanted to show people what kind of quality of house we are building for the North,” said Willie Gadbois, co-founder of Nunavik Building, a home designer and developer with offices in Kuujjuaq and Napierville, Quebec."</seg>
<seg id="7">"About a decade ago, Gadbois, a Kuujjuaq-based plumber, furnace repairman and housebuilder, met building expert Claude Jannelle."</seg>
<seg id="8">"“We started talking about affordable housing in the North,” Gadbois said."</seg>
<seg id="9">“Housing in the North is so expensive.</seg>
<seg id="10">That’s where it started.”</seg>
<seg id="11">"From that, they’ve developed designs for tiny homes that take the northern elements into consideration."</seg>
<seg id="12">The houses have metal siding and roofing to withstand high winds and last longer than other commonly used materials.</seg>
<seg id="13">"They’re built with foam insulation injected into the floors, roof and ceiling and with triple-pane windows to keep warmth in."</seg>
<seg id="14">"They also use radiant floor heating, rather than wall-mounted radiators, to evenly distribute the heat."</seg>
<seg id="15">"“I think that’s the way to go in the North,” Gadbois said."</seg>
<seg id="16">“There are all of these problems in the North with heating and heat not being distributed right.</seg>
<seg id="17">Half the time people say their feet are freezing.</seg>
<seg id="18">The house is well-insulated but their feet are cold.”</seg>
<seg id="19">The floor plan for Nunavik Building’s one-bedroom tiny home.</seg>
<seg id="20">(Courtesy Nunavik Building)</seg>
<seg id="21">"Having worked in heating and plumbing across Nunavik, Gadbois takes personal care in seeing the units constructed to specifications, ensuring everything is installed properly and easy to maintain."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Nunavik Building has a range of designs for tiny homes, up to four bedrooms, where separate compartments of the house are attached together."</seg>
<seg id="23">"And they can be added on to with additional bedrooms and space if, for example, the family grows."</seg>
<seg id="24">"The house on show in Kuujjuaq is a one-bedroom unit, at just under 5 metres wide and 10 metres long."</seg>
<seg id="25">"You enter at the end of the building, into the open-concept kitchen and living room."</seg>
<seg id="26">The bedroom sits just back of that and behind it is the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="27">The mechanical room for the house is a separate building just behind it.</seg>
<seg id="28">It took about two hours to get the finished house in place and hooked up to power and plumbing.</seg>
<seg id="29">"This model retails for $228,000, hooked up and everything in, said Gadbois."</seg>
<seg id="30">"By comparison, a typical house in Nunavik would run between $500,000 and $600,000, he said."</seg>
<seg id="31">"“We’re trying to build affordable houses that are comfortable and don’t have problems with infiltration of water,” said Gadbois."</seg>
<seg id="32">"“I’ve been a plumber, furnace-man for so many years and so many things are not built right, the plumbing is not right, the heating systems are not right."</seg>
<seg id="33">I’ve worked on this for many years and we’ve finally got something that’s more adaptable to the North.”</seg>
<seg id="34">"The houses are constructed in Sherbrooke, Quebec, which takes about a month, Gadbois said, and then trucked and shipped up on the sealift."</seg>
<seg id="35">"So once orders are in, as long as there’s enough time to book space on the sealift, the house can be in place the following summer."</seg>
<seg id="36">"“In the future, if everything goes good, we’re talking about building a factory in the North,” he said."</seg>
<seg id="37">“But that takes a lot of money.”</seg>
<seg id="38">He added that the homes are a fit across the North and they’d be happy to see orders come in from Nunavut or even Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="39">"“We’re open and ready to give quotations and ready to build houses,” said Gadbois."</seg>
<seg id="40">“We’re ready to help people out that need houses.”</seg>

<seg id="1">"Across Arctic Canada, sea ice levels are again at record lows"</seg>
<seg id="2">“We could be up to a month behind where we should be at this time of year”</seg>

<seg id="8">"Last October, when Juuta Sarpinak of Igloolik set off on a seal hunt, he took his snowmobile."</seg>
<seg id="9">"For the same trip exactly a year later, he’d need a boat."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Across Nunavut and the rest of the Arctic, the same scenario is playing out."</seg>
<seg id="11">"“It’s the latest I’ve ever seen it freeze up in my lifetime,” said Willie Aglukkaq, who’s lived in Gjoa Haven for nearly 40 years."</seg>
<seg id="12">He’s right.</seg>
<seg id="13">"As of Oct. 15, sea ice levels hit 5.118 million square kilometres, making them the lowest on record, which began in 1968."</seg>
<seg id="14">"“Depending on the area, we could be up to a month behind where we should be at this time of year,” said Gilles Langis, senior ice forecaster with the meteorological service of Canada."</seg>
<seg id="15">But it’s not the first time this year ice levels have been at record lows.</seg>
<seg id="16">April also saw the least amount of sea ice ever recorded.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was then followed by a record-setting July.</seg>
<seg id="18">"In August, the ice loss slowed."</seg>
<seg id="19">"“We were tied for the second-lowest [amount of ice] with 2007 and 2016, but quite a bit above 2012,” said Walt Meier, a senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center."</seg>
<seg id="20">"“But now we’re actually below 2012 levels for this time of year because it’s a slow freeze-up—2012 recovered pretty quickly, but we’ve been very sluggish in growing ice this year.”"</seg>
<seg id="21">"As of Oct. 15, sea ice levels dropped below those from 2012, which previously held the record."</seg>
<seg id="22">(Graph courtesy of the NSIDC)</seg>
<seg id="23">"With sea ice growth, the big driver is air temperature."</seg>
<seg id="24">"“If you have an area of open water and the temperatures above it are cooler than the water temperature, it’ll lose heat into the atmosphere and the water will start cooling off to the point where it reaches freezing,” said Langis."</seg>
<seg id="25">"But Arctic air temperatures through October have been unseasonably warm, much like the previous six months."</seg>
<seg id="26">"“It was a pretty extreme summer,” said Meier."</seg>
<seg id="27">"From April onward, every month has ranked in the top three warmest—in terms of Arctic air temperature—on record, with May and August now holding top spots."</seg>
<seg id="28">(Photo courtesy of UNEP)</seg>
<seg id="29">What’s going on this year is representative of something larger.</seg>
<seg id="30">"“Under the influence of global heating caused by human-induced greenhouse gases emissions, we have seen a sharp decrease in the extent of Arctic sea [ice] since 1979,” says Pascal Peduzzi, Director of GRID-Geneva, in a press release published by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"Much like the scenario currently playing out across the Arctic this year, declining sea ice has amplified Arctic warming over the last several decades."</seg>
<seg id="32">"According to the press release, “Temperatures increased by around 0.5°C per decade between 1982 and 2017, primarily due to increased absorbed solar radiation accompanying sea ice loss since 1979."</seg>
<seg id="33">This is twice as fast as the global average.”</seg>
<seg id="34">This season isn’t an exception.</seg>
<seg id="35">"But while the year-to-year trend continues on, ice coverage this year is on the rebound."</seg>
<seg id="36">"“It’s just finally starting to freeze,” said Aglukkaq."</seg>
<seg id="37">"Over the last 10 days, since Oct. 20, sea ice coverage has increased by almost 1.5 million square kilometres, including the water near Gjoa Haven."</seg>
<seg id="38">"If the current pace of ice growth continues, 2019 may soon once again be above 2012 levels."</seg>

<seg id="2">"“For me, it’s an exciting opportunity”"</seg>
<seg id="3">Gord Howard has been Iqaluit’s new fire chief for only about two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="4">"He’s spent most of that time reading and learning as much as he can, but he says his new position offers him an opportunity he relishes."</seg>
<seg id="5">(Photo by Dustin Patar)</seg>
<seg id="6">"When Gordon Howard appeared before Iqaluit city council for the first time on Oct. 22 as the city’s newly hired fire chief, he didn’t expect one question that was thrown at him."</seg>
<seg id="7">“I’m very much hoping that you are a Montreal Canadiens fan?”</seg>
<seg id="8">asked Coun. Joanasie Akumalik.</seg>
<seg id="9">"After several long moments of silence, Howard shook his head and responded, “Nope.”"</seg>
<seg id="10">The room broke into laughter.</seg>
<seg id="11">"A week later, during an interview with Nunatsiaq News, Howard admitted, “I felt at that point that maybe I should just keep my team to myself.”"</seg>
<seg id="12">"Howard, who originally grew up in Hamilton, came to Iqaluit by way of Meaford, Ontario, a small town near Collingwood on Georgian Bay."</seg>
<seg id="13">"While it’s his first time here, he’s not a complete stranger to the North."</seg>
<seg id="14">"During a decade-long career as an emergency medical technician with the Canadian Forces, he’s spent time near Arviat living in a tent during the height of winter."</seg>
<seg id="15">"“So I understand snow, I understand cold, but that offers its own unique challenges."</seg>
<seg id="16">"You know, it’s a different world up here and I think that that was kind of the draw for me to come up here."</seg>
<seg id="17">"It’s an interesting department,” said Howard, referring to the fact that the Iqaluit fire department is a composite department—one that’s made up of career firefighters and volunteers."</seg>
<seg id="18">That wasn’t all that drew Howard to Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition to the position utilizing his background in both firefighting and EMS—a rarity in most other departments—the other big draw was the prevalence of fires in Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="20">"“The statistics for this department are staggering,” said Howard."</seg>
<seg id="21">"“This is a busy, busy place and they’ve stayed afloat with what they have.”"</seg>
<seg id="22">"The challenges facing the department, and now Howard, are nuanced, from the recurring water issues and a need for more volunteers, to problems with arson and a fire station the department has outgrown."</seg>
<seg id="23">“It’s not going to be something that we change overnight and I don’t think anybody really wants to change anything overnight.</seg>
<seg id="24">"As long as we’re moving forward and we’re not taking any steps backwards, I’ll be happy,” said Howard."</seg>
<seg id="25">"“For me, it’s an exciting opportunity."</seg>
<seg id="26">"It’s exciting, all the things we’re trying to do and then building off what we already do really well.”"</seg>
<seg id="27">"Going back to the first question he was asked as the city-appointed director of emergency services, “I’m a Toronto fan,” said Howard with a smile."</seg>
<seg id="28">“Luckily some guys in the department are Toronto fans.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I brought a flag, so we can hang it off the truck when they win the Stanley Cup in 20-30 years from now.”"</seg>

<seg id="1">Bedbug sightings raise alarm among Nunavik patients in Montreal</seg>
<seg id="2">Hotel manager says repeated inspections by exterminators failed to find the critters</seg>
<seg id="3">This is the hungry critter you don’t want to find in your room: a bedbug.</seg>
<seg id="4">But recently bedbugs have been reported in a Dorval hotel where patients from Nunavik stay when receiving health care in the city.</seg>
<seg id="5">Bedbug sightings in places where Nunavik residents stay while receiving health care in Montreal have caused a lot of anxiety among patients and their families.</seg>
<seg id="6">This photo shows the bedbug that Cecilia Kutchaka saw last month on a bedsheet while in her mother’s room at the Quality Hotel on Cote de Liesse in Dorval.</seg>
<seg id="7">(Photo courtesy of Cecilia Kutchaka)</seg>
<seg id="8">"In mid-October Cecilia Kutchaka was visiting her mother at the Quality Hotel on Cote de Liesse in Dorval when she got a fright: under the bed cover she said she found a bedbug, of which she took a photo."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Kutchaka then reported that she had seen a bedbug to the onsite security staffer for patients from Nunavik’s Ullivik patient residence, which takes a block of rooms, 39 in all, on the hotel’s first floor for its overflow."</seg>
<seg id="10">Kutchaka then called her mother who told her that she’d never stay there again.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The hotel’s general manager, Nader Abdel Nour, told Nunatsiaq News last week that he’s perplexed about some of the bedbug sightings."</seg>
<seg id="12">"That’s because recent, repeated inspections, for which he provided reports from exterminators, haven’t turned up any."</seg>
<seg id="13">"One inspection of a room showed that there could have been bedbugs there at one point, but they were no longer in the room."</seg>
<seg id="14">Abdel Nour also shared emails citing complaints from patients who said they had seen bedbugs.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Because of the importance of Ullivik to his hotel operations, Abdel Nour said they had treated all the rooms earlier this year and continue to conduct routine inspections and treatments, if necessary."</seg>
<seg id="16">Nunatsiaq News was unable to get a statement from the Nunavik Regional Board of Health or the Module du Nord québécois that deals with Nunavik patients in Montreal about the bedbug sightings and how they deal with these situations.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the MNQ has spoken about its concerns in an email to Adbel Nour.</seg>
<seg id="18">"“It appears that the client-residents at the hotel are verbalizing a bedbug problem and are refusing to stay at the hotel,” wrote George Delatolla, the head of lodging at Ullivik, on Oct. 16."</seg>
<seg id="19">“Please advise me of what and how and when this problem will be resolved.</seg>
<seg id="20">We need to assure arriving residents that the bedbug issue has been looked into and taken care of.”</seg>
<seg id="21">Ullivik reportedly treats patients’ bags before they enter the residence.</seg>
<seg id="22">That there are bedbugs in Montreal is undeniable: a bug infestation closed government offices at the huge Complexe Guy-Favreau last month.</seg>
<seg id="23">"And if there are bedbugs afoot where there are patients from the North, it would not be the first time, as was the case in 2010 in Winnipeg."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Bedbugs are not welcome company: they may be small, but they can cause itchy red welts, blisters and rashes where they bite into the skin."</seg>
<seg id="25">The insect uses one hollow feeding tube to inject saliva that makes the victim’s blood thinner and numbs the skin.</seg>
<seg id="26">"With another tube, the bedbug sucks out blood, usually for about five minutes."</seg>
<seg id="27">"After feeding, they turn dark red and bloated.  Bedbugs only need to eat every five to 10 days and they can live for up to a year, lurking in the folds of mattresses, bed sheets and other warm, dark places, only surfacing occasionally to feed."</seg>
<seg id="28">"The good news is that bedbugs don’t like low temperatures, which cause them to go into hibernation and die."</seg>
<seg id="29">So you can kill them by leaving your bags outside for two or more days if the temperature remains below zero.</seg>
<seg id="30">"To guard against bedbugs when you’re travelling, inspect the headboard of the bed, look at the mattress and don’t leave your bag on the bed."</seg>
<seg id="31">"And, when you get home, wash your clothes before bringing them into your bedroom and make sure no bedbugs travelled back with you in your bag."</seg>
<seg id="32">"If you see bedbugs in Montreal at a hotel, you can call 311 to file a complaint with the city."</seg>

<seg id="2">“Inuit have to be part of the process.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It affects every part of Inuit lives,” says NTI president"</seg>
<seg id="4">"Representatives from Igloolik and Pond Inlet listen as Aluki Kotierk, Nunavut Tunngavik Inc.’s president, puts forward a motion to adjourn the Nunavut Impact Review Board’s final public hearing on Baffinland’s phase two expansion on Wednesday, Nov. 6, in Iqaluit."</seg>
<seg id="5">(Photo by Emma Tranter)</seg>
<seg id="6">By Emma Tranter and Elaine Anselmi</seg>
<seg id="7">"The Nunavut Impact Review Board hearing on Baffinland Iron Mines Corp.’s proposed expansion of its Mary River mine has been abruptly adjourned, with two days of meetings in Pond Inlet now cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="8">"On Wednesday, Nov. 6, Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. president Aluki Kotierk brought forward a motion to immediately suspend the final public hearing and defer its continuation for eight months to one year."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Whispers could be heard throughout the room as intervenors turned to their colleagues. Members of the audience turned their heads, looking for Baffinland’s reaction to what was unfolding."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Baffinland officials sat stone-faced, sometimes crossing their arms and looking down at the table as Kotierk spelled out the motion."</seg>
<seg id="11">“We are concerned that we are going to conclude the public hearing when all things haven’t been finished.</seg>
<seg id="12">The people have to be consulted and have a meaningful discussion.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Everyone around the table would like to understand everything that is being presented and how it’s going to affect NTI and organizations,” Kotierk said to a room packed with intervenors and the public."</seg>
<seg id="14">"It affects every part of Inuit lives,” she said."</seg>
<seg id="15">"The motion was brought forward on the fifth day of the hearing in Iqaluit, an hour before it was scheduled to end."</seg>
<seg id="16">The NIRB’s original agenda had the hearing continuing to Pond Inlet for community roundtable sessions on Nov. 8 and 9.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The NIRB ruled in favour of NTI’s motion, suspending the hearing and cancelling the Pond Inlet sessions."</seg>
<seg id="18">"All week, Baffinland representatives had gone back and forth with intervenors on their planned construction of a rail line north from the Mary River site to its Milne Inlet port."</seg>
<seg id="19">"The railway, and additional port infrastructure, would make it possible for the company to ramp up their production from the current 6 million tonnes of iron ore per year to 12 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="20">"But one sticking point throughout the week was Baffinland’s request for an amendment to its project certificate that would remove its production cap and replace it with a limit tied to transportation of its product, of 20 train trips per day and 176 ship transits per year."</seg>
<seg id="21">"The motion to adjourn was supported by all intervenors, many of whom shared similar concerns about uncertainties over the project."</seg>
<seg id="22">"P.J. Akeeagok, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association’s president, told Nunatsiaq News he had faith in the NIRB’s process to ensure “Inuit would have opportunities to ask good questions in terms of what’s important to them” and “allow community members to really voice their concerns that have been persistent.”"</seg>
<seg id="23">"Akeeagok said the motion was not pre-conceived, but came together on the final day of the hearing."</seg>
<seg id="24">Baffinland staff watch as Kotierk introduces the motion to adjourn.</seg>
<seg id="25">“I think it just boiled down to there’s just too many outstanding questions that haven’t been resolved.</seg>
<seg id="26">"From my perspective, if you’re going to make a decision for your future, you’ve got to ensure you have all the information available to make that sound decision."</seg>
<seg id="27">It just wasn’t quite there.”</seg>
<seg id="28">Representatives from North Baffin communities all agreed with the motion.</seg>
<seg id="29">"“Further information and assessment is needed,” said Amanda Hanson Main, advisor to the Mittimatalik Hunters and Trappers Organization."</seg>
<seg id="30">She said the project “has a serious potential to impact the resources we depend on and maintain our sense of purpose and belonging in the world.”</seg>
<seg id="31">"Some groups around the table said they do not oppose the Mary River project in general, and they want Baffinland to continue operating in Nunavut, but they have too many questions and concerns with the proposed expansion."</seg>
<seg id="32">"“The information we’ve been given is watered down and it’s not enough,” said Peter Ivalu, representing the Hamlet of Igloolik."</seg>
<seg id="33">“All of the information given should be translated.</seg>
<seg id="34">You have to make sure everything is transparent.”</seg>
<seg id="35">"The Government of Nunavut agreed with the motion, offering a measured response, saying there has been disagreement between intervenors and the proponent that’s created a standstill."</seg>
<seg id="36">"The Government of Canada also supported the motion, but said it was up to the NIRB to determine the appropriate length of the delay."</seg>
<seg id="37">"Through its legal counsel, Baffinland responded that they were opposed to the motion to adjourn for more than eight months and objected that they were given no notice of the motion."</seg>
<seg id="38">"“All parties to this hearing came to the hearing ready to proceed on November 2 when it started,” said Brad Armstrong, legal counsel for Baffinland."</seg>
<seg id="39">“Not one party indicated to you that they were not ready to proceed on that date.</seg>
<seg id="40">There has been nothing in the course of this proceeding that has made anybody less ready than they were when they got here.”</seg>
<seg id="41">"Megan Lord-Hoyle, vice-president of sustainable development for Baffinland, said delaying the hearing would cause “immediate ramifications” to the business."</seg>
<seg id="42">"“But we will do everything possible to survive and protect the employment of 3,000 Canadians, 476 of which are Inuit."</seg>
<seg id="43">We need to know that Inuit will work with us.</seg>
<seg id="44">"We need some time to determine the ramifications on the business,” Lord-Hoyle said."</seg>
<seg id="45">"While the QIA has said that it cannot support phase two, Akeeagok said its work to ensure Inuit are informed about the project and that the project is sustainable will not end."</seg>
<seg id="46">“We’re not opposed to Mary River at all.</seg>
<seg id="47">We are partners.</seg>
<seg id="48">We own the Inuit-owned lands that they’re on.</seg>
<seg id="49">"We support Inuit employment,” he said."</seg>

<seg id="1">Nunavut MLAs approve amendments to Income Tax Act</seg>
<seg id="2">“Our government is taking significant action to recycle carbon revenues back into our economy“</seg>
<seg id="3">"MLA Adam Lightstone questions Finance Minister George Hickes about Bill 26, the act to amend the Income Tax Act, during the legislative sitting on Wednesday, Nov. 6."</seg>
<seg id="4">Nunavut MLAs have amended the territory’s Income Tax Act to help take the sting out of carbon pricing.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The changes, which passed third reading on Wednesday, Nov. 6, include an increase to the basic personal amount from $13,325 to $16,000."</seg>
<seg id="6">"That means taxpayers will be able to earn almost $3,000 more in a year before having to pay territorial income tax."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Another change is an increase to the maximum cost of living tax credit from $1,200 to $1,500."</seg>
<seg id="8">"That means taxpayers who earn more than $60,000 will receive up to an additional $300 back when they file their taxes."</seg>
<seg id="9">And Nunavut’s corporate tax rate for small businesses has dropped from 4 per cent to 3 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="10">"“Our government is taking significant action to recycle carbon revenues back into our economy,” said Finance Minister George Hickes."</seg>
<seg id="11">"On July 1, the federal carbon tax came into effect in Nunavut. To help offset the increase to gas prices—which would have risen by five cents per litre—the territorial government introduced a carbon rebate program, which reduces that fuel price increase by half."</seg>
<seg id="12">"During debates over the income tax amendments, Nunavut’s MLAs agreed that carbon tax revenues should be returned to the territory’s residents."</seg>
<seg id="13">But there was disagreement about the best way to do this.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Adam Lightstone, MLA for Iqaluit-Manirajak, raised concerns that, with income taxes being cut, the government would come to depend on carbon tax revenues to fund government operations."</seg>
<seg id="15">“It’s my understanding that we’re currently heavily reliant on federal transfers and our own source revenues make up 10 to 15 percent of what we receive.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We’re very reliant on those own source revenues that we do generate to meet our operational needs,” said Lightstone."</seg>
<seg id="17">“Why is it that the government is using carbon tax revenues to fund government operations?”</seg>
<seg id="18">"“A very small part of the carbon tax revenue that we collect is going to stay with the Government of Nunavut and it’s basically to offset our own carbon,” responded Hickes, who added, “I don’t think the public would be very fond of us if we took these carbon revenues and put them into our general revenue and didn’t pass on any of these savings to the consumer.”"</seg>
<seg id="19">Lightstone said he didn’t think that amending the Income Tax Act was the most efficient way of giving back to Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="20">"He also expressed concern that the carbon tax funds being transferred to the territorial government aren’t being used in the way they were intended, to reduce Nunavut’s carbon footprint."</seg>
<seg id="21">“Climate change is a matter that I take very seriously and I believe that it is one of the major challenges that are facing this generation as well as the generations to follow.</seg>
<seg id="22">"With that being said, I have put forward rough ideas and recommendations to this government on numerous occasions about ideas to incentivize or introduce programming to encourage Nunavummiut to adopt energy efficiency initiatives,” said Lightstone."</seg>
<seg id="23">“Why have those ideas not been taken into consideration and proposed to be used with carbon tax revenues?“</seg>
<seg id="24">Hickes responded by saying that he’s sure individual departments—who are responsible for specific programs—were listening.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Some of those departments have already put forward business cases, including the Qulliq Energy Corp., whose program to install energy-efficient LED streetlights across the territory was approved by the MLAs last week."</seg>
<seg id="26">"In 2019-20, the Government of Nunavut expects to raise over $12 million in carbon taxes."</seg>
<seg id="27">That will be broken down as follows:</seg>
<seg id="28">• $2 million will go towards the government’s own higher utility bills to heat public housing and government buildings like schools and health centres.</seg>
<seg id="29">• $3.6 million for the new Nunavut Carbon Rebate Program.</seg>
<seg id="30">• $6.2 million will be returned to Nunavummiut and Nunavut businesses this year through the Income Tax Act amendment.</seg>
<seg id="31">"But for Lightstone, the math didn’t add up."</seg>
<seg id="32">"“Given the 50 per cent rebate at the pump plus this additional 50 per cent usage of the carbon tax revenues, why is there so little room being left behind for energy efficiency initiatives?”"</seg>
<seg id="33">"Hickes replied that the federal carbon tax increases each year for the next five years, and while the 50 per cent rebate at the pump program will continue, the annual increase in the tax means more money will be available for additional programs."</seg>
<seg id="34">The bill passed its second reading during the day of Nov. 6 and received third reading that evening.</seg>
<seg id="35">"By then, Lightstone, who welcomed a new son into the world the night before and told the legislature he was running on three hours of sleep, had gone home."</seg>
<seg id="36">"In a later email to Nunatsiaq News, Lightstone said he had planned to vote against the bill."</seg>
<seg id="37">"“I disagree with the fundamentals of Bill 26, I do not believe it makes for good fiscal policy,” wrote Lightstone in a comment meant to be read to the assembly."</seg>
<seg id="38">“The purpose of the carbon tax is to reduce consumption of fossil fuel and greenhouse gasses and address climate change.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Had this bill included specific energy-specific tax rebates for individuals and businesses who wish to invest in energy efficiencies, or if the GN had created an incentive program to assist the public with the purchase and installation of energy initiatives I would have happily voted in favour of this bill.”"</seg>
<seg id="40">"Despite Lightstone’s objections, the bill passed."</seg>
<seg id="41">Hickes said he’s open to ideas on how to further use carbon tax revenues to reduce Nunavut’s carbon footprint.</seg>
<seg id="42">"“I would strongly encourage members or people out in the public, if they have ideas, to write to their MLA or to the government and bring forward some of these ideas.”"</seg>

<seg id="1">"Over 34,000 more people visited Nunavut in 2018 than in 2015"</seg>
<seg id="2">Government of Nunavut releases annual tourism report for 2018-2019</seg>
<seg id="3">"Passengers on a One Ocean expedition cruise in zodiacs near Digges Island, on the north-western tip of the Ungava Peninsula."</seg>
<seg id="4">(Photo by Emma Tranter)</seg>
<seg id="5">"From April to Sept. 2018, over 51,000 people visited Nunavut from outside the territory."</seg>
<seg id="6">"That’s according to Nunavut’s annual tourism report for 2018-2019 from the Department of Economic Development and Transportation, tabled in the legislative assembly earlier this month."</seg>
<seg id="7">"That same group of people spent a total of $271,383,000 on their travel during that time period, including transportation costs."</seg>
<seg id="8">The report does not break down specifically how much money was spent on non-transportation costs.</seg>
<seg id="9">"By comparison, there were an estimated 16,750 non-resident visitors to the territory from May to Oct. 2015, according to that year’s Nunavut visitor exit survey."</seg>
<seg id="10">The Qikiqtaaluk and Kivalliq regions received the most visitors in Nunavut from July to Sept. 2018.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The Qikiqtaaluk region had 95,600 visits, with just over half (53.2 per cent) of those visits to Iqaluit with a total of $75.1 million spent."</seg>
<seg id="12">Pond Inlet and Pangnirtung were the second and third most visited communities in the region.</seg>
<seg id="13">"In the Kivalliq, Rankin Inlet had 33,600 visits and $68 million in spending, followed by Baker Lake and Arviat."</seg>
<seg id="14">Cambridge Bay was the dominant community visited in the Kitikmeot.</seg>
<seg id="15">Passengers on a One Ocean expedition arrive in Kimmirut by zodiac in Aug. 2019. (Photo by Emma Tranter)</seg>
<seg id="16">"Also in 2018, 3,404 cruise tourists visited Nunavut over a two and a half month period."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Cruise operators spent $388,351 to access community services, according to the report."</seg>
<seg id="18">But weather and ice conditions affected half of the cruise visits planned for the territory that year.</seg>
<seg id="19">The department received data from eight cruise operators on 23 voyages that stopped in Nunavut from July to Sept. 2018.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Those cruise ships carried a total of 3,404 passengers."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Just over half, or 59 per cent, of the passengers in the sample who disembarked in Nunavut visited Pond Inlet."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Iqaluit was the second-most visited community for cruise ships with 8.3 per cent, followed by Qikiqtarjuaq with 6.1 per cent and Grise Fiord with 5.9 per cent."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Not only did cruise ship visitors to Pond Inlet spend a total of $246,565, but those visitors also accounted for 100 of the 189.5 hours spent by cruise ship visitors in Nunavut, according to the report."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Cambridge Bay, Gjoa Haven, Kimmirut and Kugluktuk did not receive any cruise ship visits in 2018."</seg>
<seg id="25">"According to the report, both Cambridge Bay and Gjoa Haven were expecting seven visits, which were all cancelled due to weather."</seg>
<seg id="26">"The report notes that Cambridge Bay and Gjoa Haven were negatively impacted by these cancelled visits, which represents a collective loss of about $25,300."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Most of the information included in the report comes from the department’s visitor exit survey from 2018, which surveyed cruise ship operators and other visitors to the territory last year."</seg>
<seg id="28">"In 2018, the GN responded to community concerns from Pond Inlet and Clyde River about cruise ships going into traditional harvesting areas."</seg>
<seg id="29">"According to the report, the GN communicated with the Association of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators and all cruise ship operators complied by avoiding these areas."</seg>
<seg id="30">"It also notes that although tourism is driven by private sector development, it requires government support to flourish."</seg>
<seg id="31">"In Nunavut’s case, this means training and hiring Nunavummiut to work in tourism."</seg>
<seg id="32">“Prominent among these challenges is the absence of a suitable labour pool that is interested and trained in different elements of the tourism sector.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Without a pool of trained, certified employees, opportunities in the tourism industry remain unrealized potential."</seg>
<seg id="34">"Training has long been a recognized need for the tourism sector in Nunavut,” the report states."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Nalunaiqsijiit, the Government of Nunavut’s Inuit Cruise Training Initiative, trains 12 Inuit per year to work on board cruise ships as expedition team members, the report states."</seg>
<seg id="36">"According to the report, all of the GN’s current tourism surveyors are Inuit."</seg>
<seg id="37">"“Historically, tourism data collection in the territory has been weak, leading to uncertainty regarding the true size of the industry and its contributions to Nunavut’s economy,” the report states."</seg>
<seg id="38">"The department also funded a total of 115 projects related to tourism in 2018, totalling $1,272,822."</seg>
<seg id="39">A few of the highlighted projects include:</seg>
<seg id="40">"• Nunatta Sunakkutaangit Museum, Voices from Nunavut exhibition: $50,100"</seg>

<seg id="1">"Mary River: if financial viability is a factor, then prove it"</seg>
<seg id="2">Regulators should demand that Baffinland produce financial evidence</seg>
<seg id="3">Participants sit inside Iqaluit’s Cadet Hall on the fourth day of the Nunavut Impact Review Board’s public hearing on Baffinland Iron MInes Corp.’s railway-based expansion proposal for Mary River.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Nunavut’s system for regulating industrial development, born within the 1993 Nunavut land claims agreement, has likely never faced a greater test than the twisting, turning series of environmental and socio-economic assessments for the Mary River iron mine over the past 10 years."</seg>
<seg id="5">"This was on full public display in Iqaluit earlier this month, when the Nunavut Impact Review Board’s final public hearing on the $900-million railway expansion proposal from Baffinland Iron Mines Corp. imploded amidst a mood of confusion and incoherence."</seg>
<seg id="6">"The final two days of that seven-day hearing, scheduled for Pond Inlet, were cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="7">"At the same time, the fate of Baffinland’s multibillion dollar, multigenerational iron mine is now shrouded in uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="8">"When this editorial was written, the review board had yet to decide on a motion from Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. that, if accepted, would delay proceedings for eight to 12 months."</seg>
<seg id="9">"And Baffinland’s landlord, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, declared earlier they cannot support or endorse the railway-based expansion."</seg>
<seg id="10">"But QIA’s business arm, the Qikiqtaaluk Corp., has declared its enthusiastic support for the idea."</seg>
<seg id="11">So has Arctic Co-operatives Ltd.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is a complex issue.</seg>
<seg id="13">"As for Baffinland, its vice-president of sustainable development, Megan Lord-Hoyle, reacted by claiming that the company is now concerned about the project’s very survival, saying, “we will do everything possible to survive and protect the employment of 3,000 Canadians, 476 of which are Inuit.”"</seg>
<seg id="14">"Just this week, Baffinland confirmed to Nunatsiaq News that it has laid off 490 non-Inuit contract workers and 96 Inuit contract workers."</seg>
<seg id="15">That leads directly to what has emerged as one of the biggest unanswered questions surrounding the project: Mary River’s financial health.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Baffinland claims that the mine’s financial viability cannot be guaranteed unless regulators permit them to build a 110-kilometre railway to Milne Inlet and raise production to 12 million tonnes a year, which would require up to 176 voyages through the environmentally sensitive waters of Eclipse Sound."</seg>
<seg id="17">"The problem is, they’ve put no evidence on the public record to support that claim."</seg>
<seg id="18">"And until recently, most of the big players weren’t even asking for it."</seg>
<seg id="19">"But one year ago, that lack of evidence didn’t stop stakeholders from accepting that claim as gospel truth."</seg>
<seg id="20">"For example, through the summer and fall of 2018, the QIA stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Baffinland, defending it against the Nunavut Impact Review Board."</seg>
<seg id="21">"On Aug. 31 of that year, the NIRB recommended the federal government say no to an earlier and smaller annual production increase request—from 4.2 million tonnes of iron ore to six million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="22">"So Baffinland and its partner, QIA, swung into action."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Within weeks, they fired off letters asking that the real decision-maker in such matters, Dominic LeBlanc, then the federal northern affairs minister, reverse the review board’s recommendation."</seg>
<seg id="24">Why?</seg>
<seg id="25">Because of money.</seg>
<seg id="26">"The Inuit organization said they feared for the Mary River mine’s viability, which threatens a long list of cash handouts and other benefits, worth more than $20 million contained in a new Inuit impact and benefit agreement."</seg>
<seg id="27">Ottawa agreed.</seg>
<seg id="28">"Heavily influenced by QIA’s fears for the financial viability of the mine, the federal government approved Baffinland’s request last year."</seg>
<seg id="29">"“We are also concerned about the long-term viability of the Mary River mine and cognizant of QIA’s concern that the economic viability of the project depends on the production increase proposal,” Leblanc wrote on Sept, 30, 2018, in a letter co-signed by Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett."</seg>
<seg id="30">"In other words, the most important regulator of them all—the federal government—accepts financial viability as a relevant and important factor."</seg>
<seg id="31">And they did so without having received a shred of financial evidence on that issue.</seg>
<seg id="32">That’s a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Because if it’s true that a project can’t make money, the regulator should be required to call the proponent’s bluff and ask them to prove that claim."</seg>
<seg id="34">"In just about all other aspects of the Mary River project, Baffinland staff—as they should be—are required to supply mountains of evidence in support of the claims they make in their environmental impact statement."</seg>
<seg id="35">"But on the project’s financial viability, the NIRB has been reluctant to put any evidence on the public record."</seg>
<seg id="36">"For example, the review board ruled a lengthy financial document acquired by Oceans North is “irrelevant” and should not be put on the review board’s public registry."</seg>
<seg id="37">(The document remains on our website.)</seg>
<seg id="38">NIRB made that ruling even after it had made the document public—and then pulled it away from public view at Baffinland’s behest.</seg>
<seg id="39">"For its part, Baffinland even offered to submit, in confidence, a much shorter financial summary explaining why Mary River is financially viable only at a greater rate of production."</seg>
<seg id="40">The request for confidentiality may be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="41">But at least Baffinland made some effort to clear the air.</seg>
<seg id="42">"In response, NIRB deferred a decision on the matter, which makes no sense."</seg>
<seg id="43">"If the federal government can accept financial viability as a factor, then so should the federally funded advisory board."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Indeed, NIRB and other regulators should do more than just accept such evidence."</seg>
<seg id="45">They should demand it.</seg>
<seg id="46">"So should Baffinland’s landlord, QIA."</seg>
<seg id="47">"And since this kind of issue is likely to come up in other assessments, the federal government should amend the federal law that governs the NIRB’s procedures, the Nunavut Planning and Project Assessment Act, to clarify how such financial information can be handled in the future."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Yes, as many intervenors have said, there are multiple unanswered questions surrounding Baffinland’s latest expansion proposal, related to the railway’s impact on caribou, the impact of ships on narwhal, the project’s low Inuit employment numbers, and much more."</seg>
<seg id="49">"More questions surround the status of the Steensby Inlet southbound rail-port proposal, which Baffinland has had permission to build since 2013, with a permitted production rate of 18 million tonnes a year."</seg>
<seg id="50">It’s still unclear why Baffinland has chosen not to carry out that plan.</seg>
<seg id="51">But the biggest question of all may be how this project can even survive.</seg>

<seg id="2">Healthy economic growth lets Quebec deliver on commitments earlier than promised</seg>
<seg id="3">Children and educators are seen at the Aqaivik child-care centre in Kangiqsualujjuaq in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="4">"That year, the Quebec provincial government put additional contributions by families for child care in place based on family income."</seg>
<seg id="5">"On Nov. 7, 2019, those contributions were eliminated, bringing the cost of daycare back to a flat rate of $8.25 per day."</seg>
<seg id="6">(Photo courtesy of nunavikchildcare.ca)</seg>
<seg id="7">By Elaine Anselmi</seg>
<seg id="8">"An optimistic economic update from Quebec has allowed for more money for families and child-care services across the province, including Nunavik."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Provincial economic growth was pegged at 2.4 per cent for 2018-19, which is 0.6 per cent more than what was forecast."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Thanks to this, the province’s finance minister, Eric Girard, announced on Nov. 7 that $857 million will go toward making good on commitments a few years earlier than expected."</seg>
<seg id="11">Two areas this will go toward are Quebec’s already highly envied child-care subsidies and its family allowance.</seg>
<seg id="12">"“The Update on Québec’s Economic and Financial Situation shows that Québec is doing very well,” Girard said in a news release."</seg>
<seg id="13">“The robust economic growth in Québec allows us to reduce the debt burden and to step up the implementation of the government’s commitments.”</seg>
<seg id="14">"With this funding, the province is eliminating the additional contribution required of families for childcare that was put in place under Philippe Couillard’s provincial Liberal government in 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Under that program, an additional contribution for child care on top of the flat day rate was geared to income."</seg>
<seg id="16">That contribution went up to an additional $15 per day for the highest earners.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Families with an income of less than about $50,000 saw no additional contribution."</seg>
<seg id="18">"The Nov. 7 announcement will return Quebec’s daycare rate to a flat fee of $8.25, eliminating the additional contribution for all income levels."</seg>
<seg id="19">"The new rate will apply to Nunavik, under the Kativik Regional Government’s program Nunavik Childcare."</seg>
<seg id="20">"According to the province’s news release, the new rate will apply this year, and the Montreal Gazette reported it would be retroactive to Jan. 1, 2019."</seg>
<seg id="21">"As of this week, the head of daycare services for the KRG, Julie-Ann Berthe, had not received information on how or when exactly the new rates would be rolled out in Nunavik."</seg>
<seg id="22">Premier Francois Legault’s government originally pitched a gradual elimination of the additional contribution that would see it fully removed by 2022.</seg>
<seg id="23">The healthy economy and newfound surplus of $4 billion for 2019-20 are effectively speeding up that process.</seg>
<seg id="24">"As well as removing the additional cost of childcare, the provincial government is moving ahead with increasing the family allowance that it had promised by 2021."</seg>
<seg id="25">"As of January 2020, the province says families will on average receive an additional $779 per year."</seg>
<seg id="26">"This allowance is tied to income, with a minimum allowance of $1,000 and maximum of $2,515 per year."</seg>
<seg id="27">"The new rules will treat all children the same, rather than the Liberals’ scale of allowances whereby there was a larger allowance for the first child in a family."</seg>
<seg id="28">"“Today, we are completing the implementation of several measures that will benefit Quebecers,” Girard said."</seg>
<seg id="29">“We are giving money back to Quebecers more quickly.”</seg>

<seg id="2">“Peter was well-respected for his commitment to public service and his environmental advocacy”</seg>
<seg id="3">"The community flag of Sanikiluaq flies at half-mast in front of the Nunavut legislature on the evening of Wednesday, Nov. 20, in honour of the former MLA and cabinet minister Peter Kattuk, who died that morning after a long illness."</seg>
<seg id="4">"Sanikiluaq’s community flag is flying at half-mast this morning in front of the Nunavut legislative assembly building in Iqaluit, out of respect for the late Peter Kattuk of Sanikiluaq, who died on the morning of Nov. 20 after a long illness."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Kattuk, 69, a highly respected MLA, mayor and community leader in his hometown, became part of the territory of Nunavut’s history on Feb. 15, 1999, when voters in the constituency of Hudson Bay chose him to sit in Nunavut’s first legislature, which held its first sitting on April 1 that year."</seg>
<seg id="6">"The late Peter Kattuk (left) with former Nunavut Commissioner Peter Irniq on April 12, 2000, when Kattuk was sworn into the Nunavut cabinet."</seg>
<seg id="7">"During the life of the first legislative assembly, Kattuk became minister of culture, language, elders and youth on April 12, 2000, replacing Kugluktuk MLA Donald Havioyak, who had resigned from the post."</seg>
<seg id="8">"On Dec. 17, 2001, Kattuk moved from that portfolio to become minister of public works and government services, where he served until 2004."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Also in 2004, Sanikiluaq voters re-elected him to the Hudson Bay seat, where he sat as a regular MLA until 2008."</seg>
<seg id="10">"“Peter represented the constituency of Hudson Bay for two terms and I join his family and former constituents in mourning his passing,” Nunavut Speaker Simeon Mikkungwak said in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Born on June 2, 1950, Kattuk served for many years in Sanikiluaq as an environmental activist, mayor and community leader."</seg>
<seg id="12">"In the early 1990s, he was part of the Sanikiluaq Environment Committee, which gathered local knowledge related to how huge hydroelectric dams constructed in nearby northern Quebec had affected sea ice and marine life around the Belcher Islands."</seg>
<seg id="13">That led to a well-known report called Voices from the Bay: Traditional Ecological Knowledge of Inuit and Cree in the Hudson Bay Bioregion.</seg>
<seg id="14">"As mayor of Sanikiluaq, Kattuk also spoke out against the now-defunct Great Whale hydroelectric dam proposal."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Later on, Kattuk was part of the Nunavut Hudson Bay Inter-Agency Working Group, also called Nunavuummi Tasiujarjuamiuguqatigiit Katutjiqatigiingit."</seg>
<seg id="16">"That group, formed by the Government of Nunavut, Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. and the Hamlet of Sanikiluaq, monitored marine conditions around the Belcher Islands in response to a second hydro dam proposal, also put on hold since that time, involving the Eastmain and Rupert Rivers."</seg>
<seg id="17">"And in 1996, Kattuk served on the Nunavut Water Board, a body created by the 1993 Nunavut land claims agreement."</seg>
<seg id="18">"The late Peter Kattuk speaks in the Nunavut legislature on Feb. 19, 2008, near the end of his second term as MLA for Hudson Bay."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Kono Tattuinee, the president of Arctic Co-operatives Ltd., remembers Kattuk as “quite an extraordinary kind of guy,” who introduced Tattuinee to sea urchins, a local delicacy in the Belcher Islands."</seg>
<seg id="20">"When Paul Okalik, then the Nunavut premier, appointed Kattuk as minister responsible for the old Department of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth in April 2000, he said Kattuk promoted Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit long before it became fashionable."</seg>

<seg id="5">Nunavik’s new MP says she wants to hear from the region’s Inuit leaders so that she can better share their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="6">MP Sylvie Bérubé won the Abitibi-James Bay-Nunavik-Eeyou riding in the fall federal election with 37.7 per cent of the vote.</seg>
<seg id="7">"While the Bloc Québécois MP is primarily French speaking, she said she is actively searching for an Inuktitut translator to work with."</seg>
<seg id="8">"“I wish to clearly report the needs in the Indigenous communities,” she said."</seg>
<seg id="9">"So far, Bérubé said that two pressing issues she’s aware of in Nunavik are health care and housing."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Health care may be under provincial jurisdiction, but it’s federally funded, said Bérubé."</seg>
<seg id="11">"In order to see an increase in that health funding, Bérubé said the federal government could reconsider how it calculates the transfers."</seg>
<seg id="12">Bérubé has worked in the health sector for more than three decades.</seg>
<seg id="13">"In the Bloc Québécois election platform, the party stated the province would need 10,000 homes over the next decade."</seg>
<seg id="14">"It’s something Bérubé said she is already in talks about, to have different models for housing development drawn up."</seg>
<seg id="15">"“If we want the [federal] Liberals to move forward, we will have to propose a solution ourselves,” Bérubé said."</seg>
<seg id="16">"The new MP may not be a familiar face in Nunavik, but said she plans to visit for the next annual general meeting of Makivik Corp., which will place in March."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Following Bérubé’s election, Makivik President Charlie Watt released a statement inviting Bérubé up to visit the region at her earliest convenience."</seg>
<seg id="18">"“I look forward to meeting with her, and receiving her support for our work on self-determination, and on issues such as the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples,” Watt said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"It is those talks with Inuit leadership, Bérubé said, that will determine her role in helping along Makivik’s work on self-determination,"</seg>
<seg id="20">"On Bill C-262, which would bring Canadian law in line with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Bérubé is fully in support."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Two versions of the bill were put forward by her predecessor, outgoing NDP MP Romeo Saganash."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Introduced in 2018, Bill C-262 was held up by Conservative senators this spring but the Liberal government’s representative in the chamber, Senator Peter Harder, said if re-elected, the Liberal government was committed to making it law."</seg>
<seg id="23">"“It is important for me to continue the process of Bill C-262 to align Canadian laws with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People and the work of my predecessor Romeo Saganash,” Bérubé said."</seg>
<seg id="24">“I will continue to support this project and I’ve already offered my support to Romeo for future action.</seg>
<seg id="25">It’s unacceptable that Canada is not yet at this stage by 2020.”</seg>

<seg id="1">The Trudeau government 2.0: prepare for a letdown</seg>
<seg id="2">"“If you’re wise, you’ll keep your expectations low”"</seg>
<seg id="3">"Jane Philpott, then the Indigenous services minister, is seen on March 23, 2018, with ITK President Natan Obed, while promising that the federal government will eliminate tuberculosis from Inuit Nunangat by 2030."</seg>
<seg id="4">"Less than a year later, she quit the federal cabinet."</seg>
<seg id="5">"You may have noticed that during the recent federal election campaign, none of the national party leaders spent much time talking about issues that matter to residents of Nunavut and other northern regions."</seg>
<seg id="6">That’s no surprise.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The major political parties appeared to have calculated that across mainstream Canada, which means southern Canada, there are few votes to be gained by talking about remote northern regions most southern Canadians have never heard of."</seg>
<seg id="8">"The Liberal government signalled that themselves, with their dump-and-run release of the much-delayed Arctic and northern policy framework the day before the campaign period officially started."</seg>
<seg id="9">"During the election campaign, Indigenous-specific issues, many of which overlap with northern issues, didn’t get much attention either."</seg>
<seg id="10">"So for the new reduced version of Justin Trudeau’s government, whose cabinet members took their oaths of office this past Nov. 20, all signs point to a continuation of that indifferent attitude."</seg>
<seg id="11">Here’s just one example.</seg>
<seg id="12">It concerns one of the most significant promises to the North the Trudeau government has made since gaining power in 2015: to eliminate 50 per cent of tuberculosis cases from Inuit Nunangat by 2025 and to eliminate the disease entirely by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="13">"That included a starter fund of $27.5 million over five years, the spending of which is “self-determined” by the four members of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami."</seg>
<seg id="14">"But that bold pledge already smells like a broken promise. For starters, the TB elimination campaign has lost its most credible and competent federal government champion: Jane Philpott, the Indigenous services minister who made that promise."</seg>
<seg id="15">She quit Trudeau’s cabinet this past March 4 to protest his shabby treatment of Jody Wilson-Raybould.</seg>
<seg id="16">She did so only four days before Trudeau flew to Iqaluit to apologize for Canada’s mistreatment of Inuit patients with tuberculosis in the 1950s and 1960s.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Since then, a cone of silence has descended on the Arctic tuberculosis issue."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Even during the election campaign, it received little attention."</seg>
<seg id="19">"And as of now, work on TB elimination appears to have ground to a halt."</seg>
<seg id="20">"For example, in Nunatsiavut, where the active TB rate between 2006 and 2016 was recorded at 248.5 per 100,000, health authorities have done only one community-wide screening."</seg>
<seg id="21">"That occurred in Nain, in 2018, following a major outbreak in which scores of people developed active TB and a 14-year-old boy died of the disease at a hospital in St. John’s."</seg>
<seg id="22">"In Nunavik, 313 people got sick with TB between 2006 and 2016, creating the second-worst incidence rate in Inuit Nunangat, 234 cases per 100,000."</seg>
<seg id="23">"But no community-wide screenings appear to have been done in Nunavik since early 2018, when Philpott made her announcement."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Indeed, most of Nunavik’s recent mass screenings appear to have occurred in reaction to earlier TB outbreaks, when Stephen Harper’s Conservatives were still in power, long before Trudeau’s Liberal government was elected."</seg>
<seg id="25">"As for Nunavut, where 670 people developed active TB between 2006 and 2016, producing an incidence rate of 171.8 per 100,000, there has been some modest activity."</seg>
<seg id="26">(One major exception is the Inuvialuit settlement region of the Northwest Territories.</seg>
<seg id="27">"There, no active TB cases were reported between 2007 and 2016.)"</seg>
<seg id="28">Tuberculosis is a disease of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="29">"That’s been pointed out so often, it’s become a cliché."</seg>
<seg id="30">But it’s true.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Where people are poorly nourished and poorly housed, tuberculosis thrives."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Take, for example, the poverty to be found in Cape Dorset, where a 12-week TB screening program ended last May."</seg>
<seg id="33">The 2016 unemployment rate was 27.3 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="34">"The median income in 2015 for those aged 15 and over was $18,933."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Of 370 dwelling units, 120 were in need of major repairs."</seg>
<seg id="36">"And by the national measure of overcrowdedness, 140 of those 370 units were deemed “unsuitable” by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation standards."</seg>
<seg id="37">That means they don’t have enough bedrooms to accommodate the number of people who live in them.</seg>
<seg id="38">There are few places in Canada where people are more poorly housed.</seg>
<seg id="39">"It’s no wonder, then, that over the past two decades, TB became a public health emergency in Nunavut and other Arctic regions."</seg>
<seg id="40">And it’s inconceivable that TB can be eliminated in these communities without a dramatic increase in the number and quality of social housing units.</seg>
<seg id="41">"But during the run-up to the last election campaign, Trudeau’s party offered nothing on Inuit housing, other than a regurgitation of 2016 and 2017 federal budget commitments."</seg>
<seg id="42">"On this issue, they can’t even be accused of breaking a promise. Such was their indifference that they never made one in the first place."</seg>
<seg id="43">"That, in essence, represents how they’ve responded to one of Canada’s worst public health emergencies, where the rate of active tuberculosis in the Inuit regions is more than 300 times greater than the rate found among the non-Indigenous Canadian-born population."</seg>
<seg id="44">"And in Nunavut, it might be even worse than we think."</seg>
<seg id="45">A report last year found more than one in every 100 infants in Nunavut may have the disease.</seg>
<seg id="46">"So if that indifference characterizes their response to a dire public health emergency, how much indifference are the Trudeau Liberals likely to show on other issues, such as mental health, community infrastructure, post-secondary education, and so on?"</seg>
<seg id="47">"If you’re wise, you’ll keep your expectations low."</seg>
<seg id="48">"If you don’t, you’d better prepare yourself for a big letdown."</seg>
<seg id="49">"Note: The quoted statistics on TB prevalence are sourced from ITK’s Inuit Tuberculosis Elimination Framework, released in November 2018."</seg>
<seg id="50">The statistics on Cape Dorset are sourced from a Statistics Canada report based on data gathered during the 2016 census.</seg>

<seg id="1">New year will see new recruits and tech for Nunavik police</seg>
<seg id="2">A full complement of officers and the use of body-worn cameras in the pipeline</seg>
<seg id="3">The Kativik Regional Police Force is introducing new recruits and body-worn cameras in early 2020.</seg>
<seg id="4">(Photo by Elaine Anselmi)</seg>
<seg id="5">"After months of low staffing levels, the Kativik Regional Police Force is seeing the fruits of its aggressive recruiting efforts."</seg>
<seg id="6">Police chief Jean-Pierre Larose updated councillors at the Kativik Regional Government meeting on Nov. 26 on progress so far.</seg>
<seg id="7">That includes the graduation of 10 new KRPF recruits from the Ontario Police College this week.</seg>
<seg id="8">The recruitment program also included connecting with recently retired southern officers about coming up to work in the Kativik region.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Because of the staffing shortage, the KRPF has had officers from the provincial force, the Sûreté du Québec, filling out the complement."</seg>
<seg id="10">"In September, there were 20 SQ officers in Nunavik."</seg>
<seg id="11">"The number of SQ officers has slowly decreased with the KRPF’s recruiting efforts, and Larose said by early 2020 they should no longer need provincial officers."</seg>
<seg id="12">Cultural awareness training kicks off</seg>
<seg id="13">An Inuit cultural awareness training program for KRPF officers is also now online as of Nov. 18.</seg>
<seg id="14">"The training was co-developed by the KRPF and Laval University and includes general information on Nunavik, Inuit culture, and the history of policing in the region."</seg>
<seg id="15">"That three-hour training program is followed by an exam, which is factored into their interview."</seg>
<seg id="16">"“This part of the training will help KRPF select its new officers based on their cultural sensitivity,” Larose said."</seg>
<seg id="17">"The second part of the training is nine hours long and will be mandatory for all officers, said Larose."</seg>
<seg id="18">It’s expected to be completed early in the new year.</seg>
<seg id="19">Cameras to be worn by officers</seg>
<seg id="20">Another addition to the force that was welcomed by councillors is the use of cameras to be worn by some officers while on duty.</seg>
<seg id="21">"This is a pilot project, with six cameras currently ready for use."</seg>
<seg id="22">"“The pilot project has been initiated in response to the request of Nunavimmiut for the KRPF to be more transparent in their police operations,” Larose said."</seg>
<seg id="23">“It is KRPF’s goal to increase and maintain the trust between the population and its officers.”</seg>
<seg id="24">Kuujjuaq councillor Jobie Tukkiapik was hopeful the cameras would provide reassurance to people who have had negative experiences with the police.</seg>
<seg id="25">“We hear about mistreatment by police and for those that were mistreated they don’t want to disclose.</seg>
<seg id="26">"They are intimidated by police,” Tukkiapik said."</seg>
<seg id="27">“These body cameras need to be used.”</seg>
<seg id="28">"He added that even when it’s just one or two officers mistreating people, it has a much larger effect, creating concerns about the whole force."</seg>
<seg id="29">"He hoped the cameras, which record events the officer is involved in, would be put to use as soon as possible."</seg>
<seg id="30">Larose said they would start using the cameras in January.</seg>
<seg id="31">He also responded that any aggressive or inappropriate behaviour would not be accepted on the force.</seg>
<seg id="32">"“I fired a police officer last week that was not conforming to our goal for policing in Nunavik,” he said."</seg>
<seg id="33">“We will not tolerate any cocky police officer in Nunavik.”</seg>

<seg id="2">"Representatives from Greenland, Canada and U.S. talk ideas and lessons learned"</seg>
<seg id="3">"Bruno Pereira, president of the Qulliq Energy Corp., presents at the Powering Arctic and Remote Communities conference in Iqaluit on Nov. 22, 2019."</seg>
<seg id="4">(Photo courtesy of US Consulate General)</seg>
<seg id="5">Renewable energy experts from across the Arctic gathered in Iqaluit on Nov. 21 and Nov. 22 to share ideas and lessons learned when operating in the North.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Participants from Nunavut, Yukon, the Northwest Territories, Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, Greenland and the United States discussed the failures of different projects in their respective regions."</seg>
<seg id="7">"The workshop, called Optimizing Operations, Integrating New Technologies and Engaging Stakeholders, was organized by the U.S. Department of State in partnership with the Government of Nunavut and the Qulliq Energy Corp."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Bruno Pereira, president of QEC, said the workshop was a chance to learn from each other."</seg>
<seg id="9">"“In terms of adopting renewable energy in our communities, we’re very interested in looking at other jurisdictions, seeing what’s made them successful or some of the pitfalls that they’ve encountered,” Pereira said."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Pereira also said that although it was important to bring representatives from Arctic communities together to discuss green energy possibilities, there are different challenges in Nunavut than in Alaska, for example."</seg>
<seg id="11">"“Some of those communities have road access, so they’re not really remote in the context of Nunavut communities."</seg>
<seg id="12">"But they face some of the same challenges we face, in terms of logistics, getting the technical skills in those communities, so we do see similarities.”"</seg>
<seg id="13">"Chris Rose, executive director of the Renewable Energy Alaska Project, said the state’s investments through the Alaska Renewable Energy Fund have helped its renewable energy projects to flourish."</seg>
<seg id="14">“So we’ve been able to build about 80 projects in remote communities that include renewable energy on top of the existing diesel grid.</seg>
<seg id="15">"So I think we just have a lot of experience now that’s starting to pay off,” Rose said."</seg>
<seg id="16">"That fund, which is designed to promote the development of renewable energy projects, provides benefits to Alaskans by reducing and stabilizing the cost of energy."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Rose said in Southwest Alaska, five communities have worked together to install refurbished wind turbines that they now share energy from."</seg>
<seg id="18">"“So now there’s this cross-pollination of understanding of how to operate and maintain these turbines and they help each other install them,” Rose said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"In Alaska, as in Nunavut, home heating bills are very expensive."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Rose said the communities using wind turbines have found a way to use excess wind energy to not only power their homes, but to help heat them too."</seg>
<seg id="21">“The way they’ve done that is by putting small resistance heaters in people’s homes that are surrounded by ceramic tiles.</seg>
<seg id="22">"So when there’s excess wind electricity goes into those heaters, and they’ve essentially built a small smart grid so that the wind heaters can talk to the power plant operators electronically,” Rose said."</seg>
<seg id="23">"“But because those ceramic heaters can store heat, it’s an interruptible load."</seg>
<seg id="24">"It can be turned on and off in the home without really impacting the people’s comfort, plus they have a backup heater.”"</seg>
<seg id="25">"But in Greenland, installing wind turbines has proved difficult, according to Niels Erik Hagelqvist, a technical special advisor on renewable energy in Nuuk."</seg>
<seg id="26">"Cold temperatures and long periods of darkness make it difficult for wind turbines designed for the south to work in the North, Hagelqvist said."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Hagelqvist said although two turbines that were successful in other parts of the world were installed in northern Greenland, they ended up failing."</seg>
<seg id="28">“We say in Greenland that we prefer proven technology.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Even these two wind turbines we put up, they have been established, one of them in 200 different places in the whole world and the other one 150 different places,” he said."</seg>
<seg id="30">"One of the turbine’s blades fell off, while for the other, the oil used to lubricate its gears became too thick in the cold temperatures and caused the engine to break down, Hagelqvist explained."</seg>
<seg id="31">"During the 2019 federal election campaign, three parties promised that if elected they would get Nunavut off diesel by 2030."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Although it will take some time to develop renewable energy projects that function in the Arctic, Hagelqvist said the need for green energy is urgent."</seg>
<seg id="33">"“We have to do something to replace all the diesel fuel and all the normal oil, because of global warming, because something is going wrong at the moment."</seg>
<seg id="34">"It’s a political question if you will have this green energy, because you have the technology but you don’t have the money."</seg>
<seg id="35">"You can do it if you have enough money,” he said."</seg>
<seg id="36">Pereira said there is a lot to learn through discussions with Nunavut’s Arctic neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="37">"“I think it really allows us to consider other options, in terms of how we start a transition process on incorporating renewables."</seg>
<seg id="38">Some people have used some technology and they’ve gone through the process of having failures with things that worked in the south but not in the North.</seg>
<seg id="39">"So when we get to the point where the financial situation allows us to adopt some of that, we can maybe avoid some of the pitfalls they’ve gone through,” Pereira said."</seg>

<seg id="2">“This is a fundamental policy change that will affect many Inuit parents and Inuit children in Nunavut”</seg>
<seg id="3">"Aluki Kotierk, the president of Nunavut Tunngavik Inc., speaks during the the standing committee on legislation’s hearing on Bill 25, An Act to Amend the Education Act and the Inuit Language Protection Act."</seg>
<seg id="4">"By Aluki Kotierk  President, Nunavut Tunngavik Inc."</seg>
<seg id="5">Re: Education Minister David Joanasie’s letter to the editor on Bill 25</seg>
<seg id="6">"Minister Joanasie wrote a letter published by Nunatsiaq News on Nov. 25, 2019, referencing past exchanges between the Department of Education and Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated on Bill 25, characterizing these exchanges as motivated by good faith and offering NTI ample opportunity to voice concerns."</seg>
<seg id="7">The minister is of the view that inviting NTI to public meetings and allowing NTI to listen to the GN’s views at meetings is collaboration.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is not.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Inuit have the right under Article 32 of the Nunavut Agreement to participate in the development of social and cultural policies, and in the design of social and cultural programs and services, including their method of delivery."</seg>
<seg id="10">There is a fundamental difference.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Bill 25 proposes to amend the Education Act and the Inuit Language Protection Act, setting out the policy and the method of delivery for the Inuit language of instruction."</seg>
<seg id="12">This is a fundamental policy change that will affect many Inuit parents and Inuit children in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="13">"As such, Inuit have the right to participate in its development and design."</seg>
<seg id="14">NTI was not provided the opportunity to participate in the development of the policy aspirations outlined in the legislative proposal for Bill 25.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Not only is this contrary to the government obligations outlined in the Nunavut Agreement, experience demonstrates that past partnerships led to the passing of legislation that better incorporated Inuit goals and objectives."</seg>
<seg id="16">"NTI has in the past co-developed legislation with the Government of Nunavut, such as the Inuit Language Protection Act, the Official Languages Act and the Wildlife Act."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Knowing it can be done, NTI reached out to the premier and the ministers on Jan. 8, 2018, conveying NTI’s willingness to constructively work with the newly elected government in active partnership and collaboration on Inuit priorities, including on education, language and culture."</seg>
<seg id="18">"The Department of Education did not provide its legislative proposal to NTI until Aug. 31, 2018, when the department provided its list of planned community consultations."</seg>
<seg id="19">This left NTI less than a week to analyse Bill 25 and prepare and plan for the Nunavut consultation tour.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is not collaboration.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The department hosted the consultations with a narrow scope, and did not make any attempts to significantly address or accommodate concerns raised by Inuit, NTI and other organizations such as the district education authorities and the Coalition of Nunavut District Education Authorities, who also attended."</seg>
<seg id="22">"I remind the minister of education again that the Nunavut Agreement clearly outlines the obligations to fulfil Article 32, and that the Department must act purposively, with due diligence and uphold honour of the Crown when it collaborates with Inuit."</seg>
<seg id="23">"NTI believes that rewriting of the Education Act in fulfilment of Inuit participation obligations requires a fundamental change in the department’s approach, and full recognition of Inuit rights."</seg>
