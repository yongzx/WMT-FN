<seg id="1">TikTok is hiding undesirable videos from users</seg>
<seg id="2">According to TikTok, the number of its users exceeds 500 million worldwide, 40 percent of which are younger than 18 years old.</seg>
<seg id="3">Imagine China / Reuters</seg>
<seg id="4">Chinese social network TikTok is censoring videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence or the forbidden Falun Gong religious group, The Guardian reported.</seg>
<seg id="5">Documents obtained by the publication, reveal that the owners of TikTok (ByteDance company) with the help of their app are promoting Chinese foreign policy goals overseas.</seg>
<seg id="6">Most of the violations concerning Chinese policy fall under "inciting hatred."</seg>
<seg id="7">In every case, TikTok classifies the undesirable posts to fall under the scope of general rules so the social network's actions do not appear to be censorship.</seg>
<seg id="8">For example, a ban on criticizing the Chinese socialist system falls under the general ban of "criticism or attacks on the politics or social rules of any country as well as constitutional monarchies, parliamentary systems and so on ..."</seg>
<seg id="9">A ban on referring to the events of Tiananmen Square or the genocide in Cambodia falls under "distorting the history of China or other countries."</seg>
<seg id="10">The document also lists 20 forbidden names of "foreign leaders or politicians" including North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il, Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, US presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Geun-hee, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</seg>
<seg id="11">The document states that banned materials fall under two categories.</seg>
<seg id="12">Posts in the first category are deleted by the social network administrators and can lead to the user being blocked.</seg>
<seg id="13">Less severe violations are included in the second category: such posts remain on the site but their circulation is restricted by the TikTok algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="14">ByteDance representatives told The Guardian that these rules are out of date and are no longer used: "Now we use a local approach to moderating as well as drawing on independent local specialists."</seg>
<seg id="15">TikTok has no specific restrictions on posts for Russian users, said Rustem Bogdanov, founder of Producer Center.</seg>
<seg id="16">Producer Center is one of the Russian media companies that officially works with TikTok.</seg>
<seg id="17">All the advertising materials from Producer Center's bloggers are agreed with the social network's representatives, but user materials can be posted without approval, said Bogdanov.</seg>
<seg id="18">When asked about whether users could talk about politics or Putin on TikTok, Bogdanov spoke in the affirmative and said that he had seen such posts.</seg>
<seg id="19">Roman Zaripov, founder of the Our Digital agency, agreed with Bogdanov: "The main rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: no posting shocking content, discriminatory rhetoric and so on."</seg>
<seg id="20">However, any content disliked by the moderators can fall under these rules, noted Zaripov.</seg>
<seg id="21">Zapirov's agency is another of TikTok's Russian partners.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to TikTok, the number of its users exceeds 500 million worldwide, 40 percent of which are younger than 18 years old.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to its user agreement, only people over 13 years of age can use TikTok.</seg>
<seg id="24">The social network's administrators verify ages with the aid of artificial intelligence: a neural network analyses faces and determines how old people appear, said Bogdanov.</seg>
<seg id="25">If the neural network decides that a user is younger, the user may be deleted, he added.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to RBK, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of the WeWork co-working center.</seg>

<seg id="4">The matter almost reached the courts, but the Catalonians offered the player a resolution without the need for the courts' involvement.</seg>
<seg id="5">Otherwise, they refused to allow his return.</seg>
<seg id="6">Neymar and his astute father, who is also the Brazilian's agent, contrived an interesting maneuverer: according to the agreement with Barcelona, which the player signed in 2016, he was due to receive 40 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, after literally one year, the forward moved to Paris Saint-Germain for a record 222 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="8">Nonetheless, he received 22 million from the Catalonians and now wants to claim the remaining 18 million.</seg>
<seg id="9">Moreover, the Brazilian's lawyers insist that the club owes him interest for late payments.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Neymar's demands became known in the capital of Catalonia, Barcelona filed a counterclaim.</seg>
<seg id="11">The club insists that the bonus is dependent on the entire contract being fulfilled – from 2016 to 2022.</seg>
<seg id="12">As such, the club considers that the player is entitled to only one-quarter of the 40 million euros and demands the return of a portion of the first payment.</seg>
<seg id="13">But most interestingly, Neymar and Barcelona almost agreed that the "prodigal" player would return to Catalonia's fold in summer.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the agreement collapsed, however, hope remains that the forward will return.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Russian MFA commented on the situation with the outrage caused by an episode of Andrei Malakhov's progam "Live," reports RIA Novosti.</seg>
<seg id="3">Earlier, the Russian diplomat was called to the Kyrgyz MFA after the show aired.</seg>
<seg id="4">The republic's MFA believes the host made some inappropriate statements regarding the situation with the Kyrgyzstani citizen Islambek Akbarov, who was involved in an accident in which the Russian Alexander Marugov died.</seg>

<seg id="7">Marugov crashed on a motorcyle into the taxi Akbarov was driving.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to preliminary information, the taxi driver is at fault for the accident.</seg>
<seg id="9">Malakhov, who Kyrgyzstani citizens demanded an apology from, said his words were simply his personal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="10">As the Russian Diplomatic Department explained, the Kyrgyz MFA did not summon the Russian diplomats-there was a planned working visit during which they discussed the host's statements, among other issues.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Andrei Malakhov's point of view is the opinion of a journalist, his personal view of the situation," the MFA said, noting that the incident does not affect Russian-Kyrgyzstani interstate relations.</seg>

<seg id="2">Pension payments can be made by the Russian Pension Fund as well as by non-state pension funds.</seg>
<seg id="3">NSPFs are private companies, reports Volgogradskaya pravda.ru.</seg>
<seg id="4">They work like a deposit: you contribute money, the fund invests it and later returns it to you with interest.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you are interested in this method, first study the information about NSPFs on the Central Bank of Russia website.</seg>
<seg id="6">All funds operate under the same rules, which are established by federal laws.</seg>
<seg id="7">Pension points can be purchased according to the law.</seg>
<seg id="8">A shortfall in points is determined by how many years in the workforce you are lacking for pension eligibility.</seg>
<seg id="9">This way suits those who worked unofficially.</seg>
<seg id="10">Also, it is possible to make a contribution for a relative, for example, a homemaker wife.</seg>
<seg id="11">Recommendations for those who start thinking about the pension at the start of their working life.</seg>
<seg id="12">Larger pension payments are awarded to civil servants, doctors, teachers, agricultural workers and people who spent a certain number of years working in the Far North.</seg>
<seg id="13">So that you don't have to refuse yourself anything when you reach pension age, provide for it in advance.</seg>
<seg id="14">Purchase real estate, currency, securities, save money in deposits.</seg>
<seg id="15">Most importantly – constantly raise your financial knowledge.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs has prepared amendments to the law "On the Police", aimed at protecting officers from the spread of slanderous and defamatory information on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Friday, an application for public discussion of the bill appeared on the federal portal of normative legal acts, while the draft document itself has not yet been published.</seg>
<seg id="4">The document's explanatory memo notes that it is being developed in connection with the need to protect the honor and dignity of police officers from "the spread of information of a defamatory nature, including that of a discrediting nature, in information and communication networks, including on the internet".</seg>
<seg id="5">It is not specified how exactly it intends to protect the police from slander online.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the same time, the explanation on the document notes that the provisions of the amendments will be applied "by individualizing the mechanism" already provided for by the law on blocking posts offending government officials and the law on fines for such posts.</seg>
<seg id="7">Both laws came into effect in March of this year.</seg>
<seg id="8">The final text of the bill will be published after the public discussions and an independent anti-corruption review.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to the explanatory memo, the amendments to the law "On the Police" should come into force in January 2020.</seg>
<seg id="10">On March 18, President Vladimir Putin signed a law on punishment for "explicit disrespect for the government" on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to this document, Roskomnadzor (the Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media) warns the resource about the violation and gives it a day to remove it.</seg>
<seg id="12">A fine of 30 to 30,000 rubles is stipulated for the first violation, and repeated violations incur administrative arrest for up to 15 days.</seg>
<seg id="13">Roskomnadzor applied this rule with regard to the media for the first time on April 12, blocking the Yaroslavl outlet 76.ru.</seg>
<seg id="14">Soon thereafter, the Chudovo regional court of the Novgorod Oblast fined a local resident 30,000 rubles for publishing online "two notes with information in an unseemly form that offend human dignity and public morality and express clear disrespect for society, the state, and the bodies of executive state power in the Russian Federation".</seg>

<seg id="4">Spider-Man, one of the most famous comic book characters, will remain in the Marvel movie universe.</seg>
<seg id="5">Disney and Sony Pictures have managed to reach an agreement on the rights to use him in the franchise's films.</seg>
<seg id="6">This was announced in a Sony press release stating that the third Spider-Man film with Tom Holland will be released on July 16, 2021.</seg>
<seg id="7">Earlier it was reported that Spider-Man would leave the Marvel movie universe because Disney and Sony Pictures couldn't come to an agreement on the division of revenue.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sony owns the rights to the movie hero.</seg>
<seg id="9">It leased them out for Marvel films, which belong to Disney.</seg>
<seg id="10">As a result, Sony received revenue from the box office, and Disney collected revenue from souvenirs and toys.</seg>
<seg id="11">As reported, at some point this situation was no longer suitable for Disney, and the company wanted to reexamine the agreement.</seg>
<seg id="12">The president of Marvel Studios, Kevin Feige, said that he's excited.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's amazing that Spidey's journey in the Marvel movie universe will continue.</seg>
<seg id="14">"All of us at Marvel Studios are very glad to be able to continue working on it.</seg>
<seg id="15">Spider-Man is an iconic figure.</seg>
<seg id="16">He's a hero whose story touches every generation and audiences around the world," reads the press release.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the same time, Feige noted that Sony is creating its own cinematic universe built around Spider-Man.</seg>
<seg id="18">"He also happens to be the only hero with the superpower to cross cinematic universes.</seg>
<seg id="19">As Sony continues to develop their own Spidey-verse you never know what surprises the future might hold," he said.</seg>
<seg id="20">Tom Holland, who has played Spider-Man in five films, apparently commenting on the news, posted a quote from the film Wolf of Wall Street on his Instagram account, where the hero Leonardo DiCaprio shouts, "I'm not leaving!"</seg>
<seg id="21">Information about the conflict between the companies appeared in August.</seg>
<seg id="22">As the media reported, Disney wanted to take half of the box office revenue from Spider-Man films, provided that both companies would pay half the cost of producing the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="23">But this did not suit Sony.</seg>
<seg id="24">News of the possibility of the beloved superhero leaving the Marvel movie universe angered many loyal fans.</seg>
<seg id="25">Details of the new conditions have yet to be disclosed.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to CNBC, Sony refused to comment on the agreement, but said: "We have worked well together over the past four years, and our common desire to continue working together was in line with that of many [Spider-Man] fans.</seg>
<seg id="27">We are glad that we can move forward together."</seg>

<seg id="3">Dust particles may also be added to the packaged drink, food safety expert Elizaveta Tikhonova told Nation News.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the agronomist, a consumer cannot get reliable information about the composition of packaged tea – the producer can add ingredients that will not be shown on the packaging.</seg>

<seg id="11">Useful experience</seg>
<seg id="12">Support programs for small and medium-sized business have been adopted and are successfully functioning in many regions of the country at present.</seg>
<seg id="13">For example, the Center of Entrepreneurship Support is operating in Vologda region, providing financial support and assisting businesspeople with product certification.</seg>
<seg id="14">In Ivanov region a business support system has been developed, providing for the implementation of the single-window principle through a multifunctional center.</seg>
<seg id="15">In Krasnodar Krai, new agricultural consumer cooperatives are offered grants from the krai budget.</seg>
<seg id="16">A cluster development center is functioning in Oryol region.</seg>
<seg id="17">As part of the "Acceleration of SMEs" federal project, Amur region is providing for the possibility to subsidize business incubators created on the foundation of non-state co-working centers, with funding from the federal budget.</seg>
<seg id="18">Special measures to support youth entrepreneurship are being adopted in a number of other regions.</seg>
<seg id="19">The self-employed are continuing to come out of the shadows</seg>
<seg id="20">In the opinion of regional governments, a number of changes should be made to current legislation in order to provide more effective support for small and medium-sized business.</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, Arkhangelsk region proposed changing the term "self-employment" to "entrepreneurial activity", since it "best corresponds to the content of state services promoting self-employment to unemployed citizens".</seg>
<seg id="22">Ivanovo region considers it necessary to introduce amendments providing for expanding the list of types of activity performed by self-employed citizens, including types of activity in fitting out and renovating residential properties, dacha construction, fitness training.</seg>
<seg id="23">Bryansk region believes it is important to tighten control over unscrupulous producers of dairy products, using the Mercury veterinary system.</seg>
<seg id="24">And Kostroma and Magadan regions are advocating for legal and statutory recognition of the concept of "social entrepreneurship" and efforts to support social entrepreneurship.</seg>
<seg id="25">All the proposals from the regions will be considered in the preparation of state programs to support SMEs, and the most important ones will be developed in the form of draft legislation.</seg>

<seg id="9">Several of them thanked the air carrier, remarking that other airlines should follow suit.</seg>

<seg id="12">Many tourists noted that they would always try to choose Japan Airlines for their journeys, as they could see no good coming from being seated next to a crying baby in an enclosed space.</seg>

<seg id="1">Deliveries of sanctioned foodstuffs to Russia fall to 1 percent of previous levels.</seg>
<seg id="2">The Russian government has calculated that the deliveries to Russia of agricultural produce and foodstuffs from countries falling under Russia's food embargo have shrunk to 1 percent of their 2013 levels.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the report provided to Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the first half of 2019, 31,000 tons of foodstuffs were imported from sanctioned countries compared with 3.4422 million tons for the same period in 2013, Interfax reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">The value of imported foodstuffs fell to $226.5 million from $4.9755 billion, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="5">This refers to the supply of goods that was not subject to the embargo.</seg>
<seg id="6">The report showed that the falling volumes of prohibited foodstuffs were compensated for by increased imports from CIS countries, Africa, Southeast Asia and Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the end of August, the government extended until December 31, 2020, the rule dictating the destruction of agricultural produce, staples and foodstuffs that are forbidden for import into Russia under counter-sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="8">The document, posted on the official legal information portal, states that the rule was extended for a further year – from December 31, 2019, until December 31, 2020.</seg>
<seg id="9">At first, the regulation on the destruction of embargoed foodstuffs applied to produce from the US, EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later, from August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein "joined" the list – from January 1, 2016, Ukraine was added.</seg>
<seg id="11">The decree signed by Putin on the destruction of illegally imported embargoed goods (products that fall under the foodstuffs embargo put in place by Moscow in response to West's anti-Russian sanctions), came into force in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Furthermore, the government authorized the destruction of sanctioned goods using any legal method.</seg>
<seg id="13">In response to the West's continued sanctions, Russia also extended its counter measures.</seg>
<seg id="14">The measures, however, do not extend to foodstuffs that citizens import for their own personal use.</seg>
<seg id="15">The ban does not apply to goods for personal use weighing under 5 kilograms.</seg>
<seg id="16">The head of the Presidential Council for Civil Society and Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov, earlier referred to the destruction of food products as "simply immoral" and by his account, it negatively influenced peoples' development.</seg>
<seg id="17">Russian Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing came out in support of efforts to destroy edible foodstuffs.</seg>
<seg id="18">Following this, the Presidential Council for Civil Society and Human Rights issued an equivalent recommendation to the government.</seg>
<seg id="19">Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Gordeyev stated that the destruction of food products was incorrect and that thought needed to be put into how to use them once their quality had been established.</seg>

<seg id="2">This is reported by TASS citing the European Southern Observatory (ESO) press service.</seg>
<seg id="3">ESO says that this week construction officially began on the dome of the building that is to house the E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope), currently the most expensive and ambitious terrestrial astronomical project.</seg>
<seg id="4">Its overall cost, according to ESO estimations, exceeds a billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="5">A large part of this money will be spent making the equipment and constructing the observatory building.</seg>
<seg id="6">The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is the record-setting large mirror, with a diameter of about 39 meters.</seg>
<seg id="7">It will consist of 798 hexagonal 1.4-meter segments.</seg>
<seg id="8">This huge mirror, and also two supplementary reflective surfaces 4.2 and 3.75 meters in diameter, will help the E-ELT obtain the first detailed photographs of planets outside the Solar System, stars in other galaxies, and also search for Earth twins.</seg>
<seg id="9">Researchers will also try to use this observatory to view the surroundings of Sgr A*, a supermassive back hole at the center of the Milky Way.</seg>
<seg id="10">Despite the fact that construction of the dome has only just begun, scientists, engineers and other specialists have already been developing the mirrors, research instruments and other components of the observatory for three years – from the moment when the first plans to build the E-ELT were announced.</seg>
<seg id="11">The contract to produce the main mirror, the total cost of which was about 400 million euros, was received by the German company SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.</seg>
