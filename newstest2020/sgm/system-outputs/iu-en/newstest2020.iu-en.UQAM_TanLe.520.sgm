<seg id="111">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon, my colleagues, people of Cape Dorset and Kimmirut.</seg>
<seg id="112">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to announce today that the Department of Education will be providing O M funding to eligible daycares.</seg>
<seg id="113">Mr. Speaker, this increase is a result of the three-year plan that my staff has developed for early childhood and child care programs, which was signed in September 2017 with the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="114">Mr. Speaker, this fiscal year, we will see qualified daycares receive an increase of $1,918.80, which will be the highest cost of $45,494.80 depending on the number of daycares and the location of these facilities.</seg>
<seg id="115">If daycares don't increase their child care rates, they will not be eligible to receive similar funding in the next fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="116">Mr. Speaker, this funding will not only assist daycare operations with operating expenses, but will also assist families without increased costs.</seg>
<seg id="117">Mr. Speaker, we are proud to provide this funding to support daycares and families.</seg>
<seg id="118">I also believe, and I'm sure that we also believe that this money will have a positive impact on the overall budget and the day-care expenses.</seg>

<seg id="123">Mr. Speaker, my department is committed to supporting the mining industry so that Nunavummiut can benefit from these activities.</seg>
<seg id="124">Mr. Speaker, the National Mining Symposium will be held in Iqaluit on April 9 to 12, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="125">Mr. Speaker, this conference provides an excellent opportunity for Inuit to learn about the new territory's mineral exploration and mining sector, to ensure that our communities are fully involved in the exploration and mining industry in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="126">We hope that this year's mining symposium will continue to be attended by more than 400 participants in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="127">Mr. Speaker, I look forward to welcoming mines, Inuit organizations, search and rescue organizations, communities, and other stakeholders to this important conference.</seg>
<seg id="128">Finally, Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members of the Legislative Assembly and the public to participate in this public forum on April 11.</seg>

<seg id="162">Mr. Akoak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="163">I rise today to raise concerns that have been brought to my attention by constituents regarding the illegal sale of tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="164">I just recently received a letter stating, "My family of Iqaluit's local housing authority is in a multiplex year.</seg>
<seg id="165">A couple of years ago when people smoke, we had to move out of the smoke, the smoke went to my house very strong. "</seg>
<seg id="166">This document further indicates that, and I quote, "I am deeply concerned about the impact of tobacco on my children, my children, and others."</seg>
<seg id="167">Mr. Speaker, as residents of Iqaluit and my family, we also have apartments.</seg>
<seg id="168">Mr. Speaker, the effects of second-hand smoke have a negative impact on smoking.</seg>
<seg id="169">It takes a long time for a non-smoker to smoke. When it's a very short illness, it's a disease that's known by the government.</seg>
<seg id="170">As fathers and children, I don't want them to be affected by health problems, including tobacco, and tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="171">As my colleague from Pangnirtung pointed out, he asked a question to the Minister of Health about whether there would be an impact on smoking.</seg>
<seg id="172">In speaking with my constituents, they have similar concerns.</seg>
<seg id="173">Mr. Speaker, I recognize that we need to be flexible.</seg>
<seg id="174">The federal government's proposed ban on smoking will be lifted within a few months.</seg>
<seg id="175">I seek unanimous consent to conclude my statement.</seg>
<seg id="176">The member is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statement. Are there any nays?</seg>
<seg id="177">Mr. Lysy, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="178">Thank you, colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="179">However, the government will have to develop a protocol in place to determine where to smoke in a community.</seg>
<seg id="180">Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Rankin Inlet North also pointed out last week that the government's own analysis and results have indicated that there have been concerns with the growth and accessibility of units and duplexes.</seg>
<seg id="181">Mr. Speaker, I believe that once this legislation is introduced in the House, it will need to clearly identify issues of concern and I look forward to the results of the consultations with my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="182">Before we proceed, Mr. Akoak is not here today due to illness.</seg>
<seg id="183">Mr. Akoak, please proceed.</seg>

<seg id="185">Member's Statement 099 - 1 (5): Increase Programs in Baker Lake (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="186">Mr. Mikkungwak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="187">I say "hello" to the people of Baker Lake and all Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="188">I rise today to encourage our government to increase training opportunities in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="189">Mr. Speaker, the community of Baker Lake is growing very rapidly and it will be important that this year's increased support for training and employment opportunities for residents of Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="190">Mr. Speaker, Piqqusilirivvik operates programs in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="191">This can be expanded so that the public can have a better understanding of Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit.</seg>
<seg id="192">Mr. Speaker, the idea of establishing a university in Nunavut has been raised, and Agnico-Eagle Mines has indicated that they are willing to support this type of initiative in order to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="193">I think it would be best if it was put into a central location.</seg>
<seg id="194">Mr. Speaker, one of my colleagues pointed out that it's very important that when something comes up, we take it very seriously.</seg>
<seg id="195">However, it is important that we encourage and encourage any opportunities that arise in our appearances.</seg>
<seg id="196">Mr. Speaker, this is the first time that we've started as Members of the Fourth Legislative Assembly, and I look forward to seeing myself as a step forward.</seg>
<seg id="197">The expansion of programs in communities such as Baker Lake would be an excellent step forward.</seg>

<seg id="201">Good afternoon, colleagues, Kuglukturmiut, and Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="202">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage the government to better monitor the day-to-day operations of medical boarding homes.</seg>
<seg id="203">Mr. Speaker, a number of my constituents have raised concerns with me on a number of occasions.</seg>
<seg id="204">We've had food problems and we've had garbage thrown away.</seg>
<seg id="205">Mr. Speaker, it is important that the government ensures that services that are paid to Nunavummiut are actually delivered.</seg>
<seg id="206">I understand that the boarding homes require a lot of billets on a day-to-day basis but it's also very important that even though that's the case, they have to be comfortable and</seg>
<seg id="207">Mr. Speaker, it is unclear whether boarding homes will be included in the review of medical travel clients.</seg>
<seg id="208">I look forward to seeing the results of the review and the recommendations to improve services and the conditions of the boarding home.</seg>
<seg id="209">Member for Aivilik, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="210">Member's Statement 101 - 1 (5): Congratulations to Rosemary Ejangiaq (Netser)</seg>
<seg id="211">Mr. Netser (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="212">She is a young person who has completed her studies, but she has worked very hard and has been recognized for her efforts. She has been awarded the Hospice Elders Canada Scholarship.</seg>
<seg id="213">Mr. Speaker, the Host Society of Canada's FANS program recognizes that grants and contributions made to high school students have been difficult for them to succeed.</seg>
<seg id="214">Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize Ms. Ivalu for her dedication and commitment to continuing her education.</seg>
<seg id="215">Our youth are facing many challenges and difficulties in completing their university.</seg>

<seg id="225">Mr. Simailak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="226">Good day to the people watching the televised proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="227">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reflect on some of the observations and recommendations that I have seen on the government's financial management practices.</seg>
<seg id="228">Mr. Speaker, we have learned a lot over the last couple of weeks.</seg>
<seg id="229">Mr. Speaker, as the Chair of the Regular Members "Caucus of the Legislative Assembly, I would like to thank all of my colleagues for the opportunity to work together since the beginning of the new Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="230">Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to say to the public that on Friday, the Legislative Assembly will no longer accept the government's own procurement practices.</seg>
<seg id="231">Mr. Sammurtok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) My colleague from Iqaluit-Tasiluk made a very important motion on Friday and we will proceed with the next sitting of the Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="232">Mr. Speaker, we are a territory and this is not always working.</seg>
<seg id="233">For example, as I indicated in my opening comments last week, when we were dealing with the college's capital estimates, the government listened to our concerns and made significant changes to the budget.</seg>
<seg id="234">I look forward to seeing more of that in the coming weeks and years, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="235">Mr. Speaker, over the last few weeks, members have been asking a lot of questions on a daily basis.</seg>
<seg id="236">I think it's very obvious that we need to review the government expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="237">It's not enough.</seg>
<seg id="238">Mr. Speaker, I seek unanimous consent to conclude my statement.</seg>
<seg id="239">The member is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statement. Are there any nays?</seg>
<seg id="240">Mr. Moyo, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="241">Mr. Mrazek: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="242">Mr. Speaker, I'm talking about pilot projects.</seg>
<seg id="243">Mr. Speaker, I believe that this information should be made available to the public in the Legislative Assembly so that we, as elected officials, can be fully informed of what decisions should be made, whether or not the budget should be increased, or not, or whether it should be taken out of the funds because we have limited resources.</seg>
<seg id="244">Mr. Speaker, let me give you an example.</seg>
<seg id="245">I think it's safe to say that we can agree that the government's administration of the government's Fuel Tax Rebate Program doesn't provide much support to hunters.</seg>
<seg id="246">The Department of Environment administers the government's harvester support program, which requires careful scrutiny of programs and how to improve programs for harvesters to support the cost of fuel.</seg>
<seg id="247">Mr. Speaker, I will also use an example of the government's grants and contributions programs.</seg>
<seg id="248">As we all know, the government has spent a considerable amount of money in promoting economic development.</seg>
<seg id="249">We know that there have been loans made to businesses.</seg>
<seg id="250">We know who received the money.</seg>
<seg id="251">We don't know what the money was used for.</seg>
<seg id="252">We don't know how many people have been hired from Nunavut to fill those positions.</seg>
<seg id="253">Mr. Speaker, as you know, it's going to take a long time, but I'll leave it at that.</seg>
<seg id="254">In addition, I look forward to working with all Members of the Legislative Assembly to strengthen our budget and support our communities and constituents.</seg>
<seg id="255">Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="256">Member's Statement 104 - 1 (5): More Two Elders Travelling for Care (Towtongie)</seg>
<seg id="257">Ms. Towtongie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="258">From Rankin Inlet North and Chesterfield Inlet, I rise today to pay tribute to our most respected elder, Annie Tatty, who is currently travelling to Ottawa on a scheduled flight.</seg>
<seg id="259">Also, one of our oldest elders, Amarok, who I rise today in the House, was sent to Gjoa Haven because he doesn't have an elder in Rankin Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="260">I would like to hear from Rankin Inlet North and Chesterfield Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="261">When I was elected in November, when I was elected, when I was looking at the capital estimates, I asked about the Public Health Strategy and where the plans are for the establishment of an elders facility in Rankin Inlet or in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="262">I was told by the Minister of Health and Social Services that all of us as Members of the Legislative Assembly care for our elders.</seg>
<seg id="263">At our meeting in Pond Inlet, this issue will be raised.</seg>
<seg id="264">I am waiting.</seg>
<seg id="265">A few days ago, I rose in the House when we were dealing with the capital estimates. I didn't see anything set aside for the elders facility.</seg>
<seg id="266">I was told that I shouldn't be talking about it.</seg>
<seg id="267">However, I was very grateful to our co-chair, Mr. Allan Rumbolt, for allowing me to continue with my statement.</seg>
<seg id="268">I rise today as elected officials because I am not satisfied.</seg>
<seg id="269">This is not acceptable.</seg>
<seg id="270">As Members of the Legislative Assembly, we want to have a good government and we have told our elders to congratulate them, and to send them out of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="271">Member for Amittuq, Mr. Tapardjuk.</seg>
<seg id="272">Member's Statement 105 - 1 (5): Recognition of Hall Beach and Igloolik volunteers and Search Rescue (Irqittuq)</seg>
<seg id="273">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="274">I rise today to express my pride in my fellow residents.</seg>
<seg id="275">The search and rescue teams work very hard to search for search and rescue.</seg>
<seg id="276">They use their own transportation.</seg>
<seg id="277">I rise today to congratulate individuals from my community of Hall Beach. They are (interpretation ends) chairperson Kyle Issigaitok (interpretation) and second place is George Inukshuk, who is the Director of the Martha Gibbons.</seg>
<seg id="278">An elder, Abraham, is an elder.</seg>
<seg id="279">I said that this is the first time that I have said that this person has been out on the land for quite some time.</seg>
<seg id="280">Let's give more support to the young people because the elders say the truth.</seg>
<seg id="281">We don't think it's going to be a future.</seg>
<seg id="282">I'm here now, although I'm very disappointed, but if I listen to you again.</seg>
<seg id="283">I hope that this won't happen again.</seg>
<seg id="284">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would also like to recognize the Igloolik Search and Rescue Society for meeting this week in Hall Beach.</seg>
<seg id="285">With that being the case, Mr. Speaker, if you're going to be going out on the land and you're going to be using SPOT devices, please ask the elders if I'm going anywhere, so I'll try to catch up.</seg>
<seg id="286">Those types of things.</seg>
<seg id="287">The reason why I rise today is to state that the search and rescue society has one snowmobile and we have been lobbying the Department of Community and Government Services.</seg>
<seg id="288">I urge the search and rescue organizations to provide more support.</seg>
<seg id="289">That's it.</seg>
<seg id="290">The last name on the list, Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="291">Member's Statement 106 - 1 (5): Bathurst Inlet Athletes (Joanasie)</seg>
<seg id="292">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="293">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to announce that the Cape Dorset School will be hosted by Sam Pudlat School and anyone will be invited to attend a music festival or music festival.</seg>
<seg id="294">I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the choir's fine songwriters, and I would also like to thank them for being able to go to Cape Dorset at the Canadian Museum of Nature and assisting the Hamlet of Cape Dorset.</seg>
<seg id="295">There are none.</seg>
<seg id="296">Member for Quttiktuq, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="297">Hon. David Simailak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="298">I would like to recognize four individuals.</seg>
<seg id="299">First of all, I would like to recognize my wife, Caroline Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="300">I would like to thank my sister-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="301">Also, another long-time employee who has been here for a number of years, who has been here for a number of years, who has been here for a number of years. He has always been in our daughter's education. I am very proud of his accomplishments and we would like to welcome Jacqueline Natanine.</seg>
<seg id="302">I would like to give a brief overview.</seg>
<seg id="303">When I was a child, I was still a child...</seg>
<seg id="304">... when I first caught my first seal in the lake.</seg>
<seg id="305">I don't think there are too many lakes that were used for the first time, but we were on the island.</seg>
<seg id="306">They were very helpful and I was my father.</seg>
<seg id="307">I would like to thank them for coming.</seg>
<seg id="308">Welcome to your Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="309">Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="310">Ms. Towtongie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="311">Although my mother is now a territorial park, I would like to recognize all of you.</seg>
<seg id="312">Also, I used to be billeted in Igloolik and I would like to thank Teresa Otak for giving me a cup of tea and Lew Otak.</seg>
<seg id="313">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="314">Welcome to the Gallery.</seg>
<seg id="315">Member for Kugluktuk, Mr. Evyagotailak.</seg>
<seg id="316">Mr. Kattuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="317">I would like to recognize Naomi Kuluguqtuq and Carol Akeeagok, who are my relatives.</seg>
<seg id="318">Naiomi from Grise Fiord, I don't have any relatives every day.</seg>
<seg id="319">Welcome to your Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="320">Member for Pangnirtung, Ms. Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="321">Mr. Netser (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would also like to recognize and congratulate my husband, Andrew Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="322">Please welcome him.</seg>
<seg id="323">Mr. Nakashuk, welcome to our Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="324">I have no more names on my list.</seg>
<seg id="325">We will move on in our orders of the day.</seg>
<seg id="326">Member for Iqaluit-Tasiluk, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="327">Question 123 - 1 (5): Conflict of Interest Legislation (Hickes)</seg>
<seg id="328">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="329">My questions are for the Minister of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="330">Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask my colleagues to join me in wishing my constituents a very good week and a very happy two weeks of success in their training.</seg>
<seg id="331">I would like to ask the minister if this is something that we as a government will be bringing forward.</seg>
<seg id="332">Minister of Justice, Minister Okalik.</seg>
<seg id="333">Hon. Jeannie Ell (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="334">To date, the Government of Nunavut doesn't have a policy on that.</seg>
<seg id="335">Our department is aware of the companies that are operating in our communities such as health centres.</seg>
<seg id="336">We are in the process of reviewing the policies to establish the Nunavut Business Credit Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="337">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="338">As the minister is indicating, one of the last provinces and territories doesn't have a Western Canada Lottery Act. I think it's very important that businesses have the ability to be accountable for their services.</seg>
<seg id="339">We have introduced legislation in all regions.</seg>
<seg id="340">My next question is: when they're reviewing the policy, will they be introducing legislation in the House?</seg>
<seg id="341">Minister Iqaqrialu.</seg>
<seg id="342">Hon. Monica Ell-Kanayuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Mr. Hickes, yes, we can work towards developing policies or regulations for private businesses.</seg>
<seg id="343">Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="344">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="345">I thank the minister for that commitment.</seg>
<seg id="346">Mr. Speaker, I would just like to take this opportunity to say that the Department of Justice is responsible for monitoring the enforcement of the RCMP. Do the enforcement officials work closely with the Department of Community and Government Services to coordinate the contracting and procurement activities of the Government of Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="347">Hon. Monica Ell (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="348">I don't have that information in front of me, but I can get back to the member.</seg>
<seg id="349">Question 124 - 1 (5): Status of Clean-up in Baker Lake (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="350">Mr. Mikkungwak: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="351">My questions are for the Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="352">One of the questions that I asked the minister last week concerning the clean-up of contaminated sites in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="353">In his response to me, the minister indicated that this "final report" was prepared and submitted to QEC.</seg>
<seg id="354">Will the minister commit to providing a copy of this report to both the Hamlet Council of Baker Lake and as a Member of the Legislative Assembly?</seg>
<seg id="355">Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation, Minister Picco.</seg>
<seg id="356">Hon. Monica Ell (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="357">Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="358">I thank the minister for that commitment.</seg>
<seg id="359">One of the things that the minister stood up and said, "Can we work with the Hamlet of Baker Lake to clean up the pump house?" Mr. Speaker, I would be very pleased to hear that this is good news for the hamlet. If I go back to the community next week, I will encourage the hamlet staff to meet with the Qulliq Energy Corporation staff.</seg>
<seg id="360">Mr. Speaker, I don't think it would be possible to have the Qulliq Energy Corporation's warehouse located in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="361">The minister indicated that the Qulliq Energy Corporation has already spent $1.68 million on the clean-up.</seg>
<seg id="362">Can he clarify how much it would cost to clean up the remaining site?</seg>
<seg id="363">Minister Iqaqrialu.</seg>
<seg id="364">Hon. Jeannie Ell (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="365">One of the things that we're hoping to do is work with the Hamlet of Baker Lake on the cleanup of the contaminated site.</seg>
<seg id="366">Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="367">As I indicated in my question last week, the federal government or the Government of Nunavut hasn't set the rate yet.</seg>
<seg id="368">Mr. Speaker, I am in support of the Qulliq Energy Corporation's actions in this area.</seg>
<seg id="369">Will the Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation commit to working with the Minister of Justice to review and clarify legal options that may be open to this issue?</seg>
<seg id="370">Hon. Monica Ell (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="371">Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, Mr. Lyall.</seg>
<seg id="372">Question 125 - 1 (5): School Attendance Policy (Irqittuq)</seg>
<seg id="373">My questions are for the Minister responsible for the Public Service Act.</seg>
<seg id="374">In recent years, the government's most recent annual report on the administration of the Public Service Act on the administration of the Public Service Act was tabled in the Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="375">It is unfortunate that the 2016-17 annual report did not include this information.</seg>
<seg id="376">Can the minister provide this information to the House?</seg>
<seg id="377">Minister of Finance, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="378">Hon. David Simailak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="379">The annual report that the member referred to seems like it's going to be tabled on an annual basis.</seg>
<seg id="380">I will look into the member's request.</seg>
<seg id="381">Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="382">I would just like to ask the minister if he could provide this House with information on how many employees accessed this program in 2016-17.</seg>
<seg id="383">Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="384">Speaker (interpretation): The question has been taken as notice.</seg>
<seg id="385">Member for Pangnirtung, Ms. Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="386">Question 126 - 1 (5): Status of Pangnirtung Old Health Centre</seg>
<seg id="387">Mr. Netser (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="388">My questions today are for the Minister of Community and Government Services.</seg>
<seg id="389">I have asked the minister before about the old health centre in Pangnirtung.</seg>
<seg id="390">The old health centre is no longer being used for a long time, but it has been closed.</seg>
<seg id="391">My question is what kind of plans does the minister have for the old health centre?</seg>
<seg id="392">Minister of Community and Government Services, Minister Kusugak.</seg>
<seg id="393">Hon. Lorne Kusugak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="394">I also thank my colleague for that question.</seg>
<seg id="395">With respect to the old buildings that are no longer owned by the government, whenever a building is no longer used by the department, they are asked if they would be used by other government departments.</seg>
<seg id="396">The old health centre that was built in 1975 was built in Pangnirtung.</seg>
<seg id="397">The Department of Health does not want to use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="398">We consulted with various government departments to see what they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="399">According to the government's way of doing things, we're now starting to plan on whether the hamlet would like to take over the road.</seg>
<seg id="400">If they don't want it, then they would be able to apply for it.</seg>
<seg id="401">It's an ongoing process.</seg>
<seg id="402">That is where we are at this point.</seg>
<seg id="403">Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="404">If I understood the question correctly, the communities have been asked if they would like to be incarcerated.</seg>
<seg id="405">Hon. Lorne Kusugak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="406">We didn't hear any requests from the government.</seg>
<seg id="407">At this time, we're in the planning stages to see if the hamlets would like to get that information.</seg>
<seg id="408">That is where we are at this point.</seg>
<seg id="409">Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="410">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="411">I don't know whether they would be interested or not, but if they weren't successful, how do they go about getting government buildings that are no longer being used?</seg>
<seg id="412">I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="413">There are four main areas that we use.</seg>
<seg id="414">For example, when the old Pangnirtung Health Centre was no longer requested by the Department of Health, we asked if there were any other government departments that wanted it.</seg>
<seg id="415">It wasn't requested and then we'll go back to the hamlet to see if they're interested</seg>
<seg id="416">That's what we use when we go through these processes.</seg>
<seg id="417">Member for Aivilik, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="418">Question 127 - 1 (5): Social Services Client Travel Policy</seg>
<seg id="419">Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="420">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="421">Today I would like to make a statement and I would like to say "good afternoon" to everyone since I have been here many times and I didn't have an opportunity to say "good afternoon" to them.</seg>
<seg id="422">We will be going home shortly.</seg>
<seg id="423">Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that Nunavut's most vulnerable individuals have to travel south for medical treatment when they are very far away from their families.</seg>
<seg id="424">I agree with you.</seg>
<seg id="425">The department's Client Travel Policy was tabled in the Legislative Assembly on June 31, 2013 and came into force on March 31, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="426">I was led to understand that the previous Minister of Family Services committed to making changes to the Child and Family Services Act.</seg>
<seg id="427">Can the minister indicate if there have been any changes to the Social Assistance Policy since 2013 and, if so, has there been any changes made since March 31 of this year?</seg>
<seg id="428">Minister of Family Services, Minister Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="429">Hon. Joe Savikataaq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="430">Mr. Speaker, I can't speak for the fact that I can't speak for the first time as a minister, but I can say that this policy will be in place until March 2018, before the new policy is changed.</seg>
<seg id="431">I haven't heard anything from the social workers to change the policy.</seg>
<seg id="432">If there's a need to change it, then we can look at changing it.</seg>
<seg id="433">If there is a need to change it seems to be useful for the clients and the government we can look into it.</seg>
<seg id="434">Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="435">Mr. Netser: Thank you, Minister.</seg>
<seg id="436">The Department of Family Services "Client Travel Policy states that elders who are placed in foster care can be visited on an annual basis.</seg>
<seg id="437">Can the minister indicate if this policy has been amended to allow for two visits per year?</seg>
<seg id="438">Two airlines can travel together or one trip twice.</seg>
<seg id="439">Just to be clear, two returns to one, two return tickets per year for one foster home.</seg>
<seg id="440">Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="441">Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Will the minister commit to considering making changes to the family travel program for elders who are in foster care?</seg>
<seg id="442">I can't commit to that at this time until we review the policy.</seg>
<seg id="443">I'm sure that there's going to be a review done on the medical travel for the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="444">We will have to work with the Department of Health to make sure that the policies are being followed, but I can't commit to that at this time because the Client Travel Policy is going to be expiring soon.</seg>
<seg id="445">Member for Netsilik, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="446">Question 128 - 1 (5): Contacting the Anglican Church Office (Qirngnuq)</seg>
<seg id="447">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="448">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Health.</seg>
<seg id="449">Mr. Speaker, from time to time, my constituents travel to my constituency office to seek assistance for medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="450">As the minister is very much aware, he recently released a phone number earlier this week stating that Nunavut residents can contact the Patient Relations Office if they have any concerns.</seg>
<seg id="451">Mr. Speaker, the language and where you live, it creates barriers.</seg>
<seg id="452">Can the minister tell us what steps are being taken to ensure that the patient relations office is kept informed?</seg>
<seg id="453">Minister of Health, Ms. Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="454">Hon. Pat Angnakak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="455">I understand your concern.</seg>
<seg id="456">I don't have that information in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="457">Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="458">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="459">Mr. Speaker, the Information and Privacy Commissioner has raised a number of concerns with respect to privacy issues.</seg>
<seg id="460">The patient relations office has a form that outlines complaints or concerns.</seg>
<seg id="461">However, if you don't have fax machines, they can't send them out on their own. They don't always have computers and they can't take pictures that are going to be sent to the website.</seg>
<seg id="462">Can the minister clearly explain why the Patient Relations Office is not allowed to send patients out?</seg>
<seg id="463">An Hon. Member: Good question.</seg>
<seg id="464">Ms. Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="465">A very good question.</seg>
<seg id="466">I think it's because of the growing number of fax machines that are out there moving forward as a government, we're seeing more and more usage of computers than in the paper.</seg>
<seg id="467">In reading the substantiation sheets, the government's website indicates that "www.gov.nu.ca has a health centre in every community."</seg>
<seg id="468">If you're going to be sending out application forms, you can send them out. We also have government liaison officers in every community.</seg>
<seg id="469">In most of our communities, they can be faxed to our headquarters office.</seg>
<seg id="470">If the patient relations office didn't have a fax machine, I can look into it.</seg>
<seg id="471">Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="472">Question 129 - 1 (5): Income Support Policies</seg>
<seg id="473">Mr. Towtongie: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="474">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="475">Mr. Speaker, the questions that were asked by the Member for Kugluktuk regarding income support.</seg>
<seg id="476">The minister indicated that income support clients would be signed off on a program that is part of the program selection process.</seg>
<seg id="477">Can the minister clearly describe how the government's efforts to select a successful candidate without a mandate?</seg>
<seg id="478">Minister of Family Services, Mr. Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="479">I would think that if they don't have a job, then they can get a job.</seg>
<seg id="480">If it's appropriate, then they can go to another department.</seg>
<seg id="481">Mr. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="482">The Income Support Policy is a Government of Nunavut policy.</seg>
<seg id="483">If it was a piece of legislation we would not be able to change it as members.</seg>
<seg id="484">I see that when a young person doesn't have a job and they're afraid to sign a job and they don't have a job, they're doing it on a monthly basis, they're doing that, and then they're trying to make sure that they're doing the right thing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Can the minister clearly describe what kinds of Nunavut-wide policies are in place for outpost camps?</seg>
<seg id="486">It is just a model for Nunavut that is not geared towards the north.</seg>
<seg id="487">The policy is for all of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="488">That's for all of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="489">The Income Support Program was reviewed.</seg>
<seg id="490">At this time, there are still funds available for income support and the child benefits that are taken out of the territory.</seg>
<seg id="491">The contract was signed and I will be looking into it further.</seg>
<seg id="492">If they don't have a job, then they won't be able to get a job. However, we have to look at how we can make improvements.</seg>
<seg id="493">Question 130 - 1 (5): Mining Training Program</seg>
<seg id="494">Mr. Arreak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="495">I rise today to direct my question to the Minister of Economic Development and Transportation.</seg>
<seg id="496">Mr. Speaker, I strongly believe that when the mining companies are trying to develop and create jobs, they are responsible for the environment.</seg>
<seg id="497">My questions today will focus on the issue of job training.</seg>
<seg id="498">The current 2017-18 budget for the Department of Economic Development and Transportation includes a $200,000 Nunavut Mine Training Fund.</seg>
<seg id="499">Can the minister indicate what projects her department has spent this funding on during the current 2017-18 fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="500">Mr. Speaker, I hope that makes sense.</seg>
<seg id="501">Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="502">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="503">I also thank the member for his question.</seg>
<seg id="504">In regard to mining training, although not all of them have been reported… .</seg>
<seg id="505">The department continues to work with the Department of Family Services, Nunavut Arctic College, Government of Canada, minerals industry, and Inuit organizations on a number of programs designed to prepare Nunavummiut for all opportunities in the mineral resource industries. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="506">Your first supplementary, Mr. Kaernerk.</seg>
<seg id="507">Mr. Kaernerk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="508">I thank the minister for her response.</seg>
<seg id="509">Can the minister indicate if her department will be requesting an increase or decrease in this budget for the upcoming 2018-19 fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="510">Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="511">I cannot respond to that question at this time, but perhaps I can get back to the member’s question for the $200,000 as to how the funding was utilized.</seg>
<seg id="512">For the Kitikmeot Corporation drillers’ assistant training, $61,000 was used; for the Qikiqtani Inuit Association for financial literacy, $60,000; as well as for the Hamlet of Arviat for the work readiness program and class 3 airbrakes for $78,000. Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="513">I also thank the minister for elaborating on my question.</seg>
<seg id="514">Earlier in our sitting, I tabled a copy of my recent letter to the president of North Arrow Minerals concerning the Mel Diamond Project in North Baffin.</seg>
<seg id="515">They will be drilling near Hall Beach this spring.</seg>
<seg id="516">Further, with regard to the information I tabled about the proposed work to be undertaken near our community, I wonder if the minister can indicate how her department is working with not only North Arrow Minerals but all mining companies to identify job training opportunities for Inuit near my home community or for Inuit in Quttiktuq.</seg>
<seg id="517">I believe these opportunities can provide beneficial employment for people due to this reasoning and to add further to this, Hall Beach is a smaller community and the project won’t be buying supplies from the community. However, some people have been hired to work on these projects, for which I thank them.</seg>
<seg id="518">As you stated earlier, you will be working to support mining companies.</seg>
<seg id="519">What I am trying to ask about is if these types of activities funded through the allocations the minister mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="520">To use this example, the Mary River project is in the Baffin region, Kivalliq has gold mines opening, and in the Kitikmeot, I think the future mine is also for gold.</seg>
<seg id="521">Will all of the projects have adjacent training courses?</seg>
<seg id="522">To use myself as an example, as I am an Inuk and if I wanted to training to get a more senior position, then what kind of training could be provided so that I could succeed? What type of assistance can the Department of Economic Development offer for prospective workers?</seg>
<seg id="523">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also thank you for your good questions. Economic Development is not alone in this.</seg>
<seg id="524">It’s interdepartmental through education, mining training, and trades. I think it’s also important to acknowledge that mines are at different times and we look at all those as a department. There’s active and advanced development under construction.</seg>
<seg id="525">You take all those into consideration while working with the different departments. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="526">Oral Questions.</seg>
<seg id="527">Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="528">Question 131 – 5(1): Support for Health Centre Staff (Main)</seg>
<seg id="529">Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="530">I rise today to ask questions to the Minister of Health.</seg>
<seg id="531">Let me start by providing some background to my question, as this question applies to numerous communities and not just to my particular community.</seg>
<seg id="532">I believe it applies everywhere in Nunavut as it pops up in various communities and it relates to our nursing staff as well as other workers in our local health centres.</seg>
<seg id="533">We are all aware that frontline health professionals are often tasked with heavy workloads. This chronically heavy workload results from having too many duties, or to say it in English, a full workload. When workloads are too heavy, one nurse sometimes has to undertake these responsibilities, with part of the reason being lack of nursing staff.</seg>
<seg id="534">When nurses are subject to extra work due to the lack of staff, it can lead to staff burnout, as a lack of replacement nurses results in more work for the remaining nurses who must still complete their tasks.</seg>
<seg id="535">It seems quite obvious that staff shortages leads to some nurses being overworked.</seg>
<seg id="536">It would appear to be quite evident in this case, and hopefully I am being understandable as I am speaking my dialect and I hope my colleagues comprehend my concerns here.</seg>
<seg id="537">Perhaps I will reiterate it in English. Mr. Speaker, it appears that there is an increasingly cyclical pattern with staff shortages contributing to an ever-increasing workload and burnout, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="538">My first question for the minister is: can the minister tell this House what steps her department has taken to provide additional support and resources, particularly to the health centre staff in communities which suffer from chronic workloads and burnout?</seg>
<seg id="539">Minister of Health, Minister Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="540">I thank the member for that really important question.</seg>
<seg id="541">I think the issue of staffing regarding health centres and nursing is a very important one. It’s something that we have always been working very hard as a department to ensure that we can have enough staff at all health centres as much as possible.</seg>
<seg id="542">That doesn’t always happen.</seg>
<seg id="543">I am aware of circumstances where yes, nurses feel very tired and very burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="544">The department does what it can when we come across such situations.</seg>
<seg id="545">We just had that situation in one of the communities and the department then sent additional nurses where we could.</seg>
<seg id="546">You’ve got to look at where can be spare a nurse or two and then once that is determined, they try to send that nurse to that community where maybe the workload is more than usual.</seg>
<seg id="547">It can be any kind of circumstances going on. Maybe somebody has gone on leave, and then the community perhaps came down with a lot of cases of flu or something, those kinds of impacts. What we try to do is we look at where else can we send some nurses from one area to another.</seg>
<seg id="548">We’re always trying to recruit nurses. We want to make sure that we keep the numbers up, that we have enough nurses to deliver the health care service in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="549">Your first supplementary, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="550">Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="551">I thank the minister for her response.</seg>
<seg id="552">I think we share this concern. In reviewing the department’s most recent staffing statistics, I’ll use the communities I represent as example. It is clear that vacancy rates remain unacceptably high in some health centres.</seg>
<seg id="553">According to the latest statistics, Whale Cove has a 70 percent vacancy rate; Arviat, 44 percent vacancy rate.</seg>
<seg id="554">I understand that this is a challenging issue and that it’s very complicated.</seg>
<seg id="555">I would like to ask the minister if the minister could describe some of the challenges her department faces in providing additional and adequate staff in these communities which face consistently heavy workloads.</seg>
<seg id="556">Minister Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="557">Our problem is once the 30 months is done, we can’t keep our nurses. They leave. They’ve had the experience and maybe the novelty has worn off, but it’s very stressful being a nurse in the community.</seg>
<seg id="558">You have to look at everything when somebody comes into a community and what kind of support they have. This is something the department has been working very hard in trying to address.</seg>
<seg id="559">Your final supplementary, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="560">I thank the minister for her response.</seg>
<seg id="561">I’ll try to rephrase it. Mr. Speaker, we know that there are issues in some of these communities where there are chronically heavy workloads and chronically short-staffed crews of health care professionals.</seg>
<seg id="562">I would like to understand specifically what is being done to address the issue in those communities specifically. What is being done?</seg>
<seg id="563">What is being considered in terms of making sure that our nurses and other health care staff are getting the support they need from the department?</seg>
<seg id="564">Hon. Pat Angnakak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="565">I know you want the specifics, but I perhaps don’t have an exhaustive list of what’s being done because that’s operational.</seg>
<seg id="566">We’re on, let’s say, an emergency basis only where people can’t make regular appointments” because maybe the workload is too much or too many nurses have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="567">The department, like I said before, is trying to fill all the positions that we can. It’s difficult to do that because we’re in competition with the rest of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="568">That’s one thing that they’re trying to do. I know that they work with an agency as well to try to hire northern nurses, people who have had experience working in the north, not so much always the Arctic but let’s say northern Manitoba.</seg>
<seg id="569">There are different areas that we’re trying to address this. I know that the Department of Health is very conscious of what a lot of our nurses go through and are trying to help in whatever way they can.</seg>
<seg id="570">That is not an easy thing. It’s not something we can solve overnight. It’s something we all have to keep working on and if you have any ideas, let me know.</seg>
<seg id="571">Question 132 – 5(1): Insurance Policy on Government Assets (Hickes)</seg>
<seg id="572">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="573">My next set of questions is directed at the Minister of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="574">As we’re all aware, in all the communities across the territory, the government owns a number of different pieces of infrastructure. There are airport terminals, health centres, schools, office buildings, and etcetera.</seg>
<seg id="575">My question to the minister is: for insurance purposes, are all those pieces of infrastructure lumped together in one policy or are they separated by need?</seg>
<seg id="576">Minister of Finance, Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="577">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Our insurance is broken into different stages and it all depends on exactly which property it is.</seg>
<seg id="578">Each of our property has slightly different policies, and some don’t even have policies. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="579">As I noticed recently in the news, there was an attempt by somebody in one of our communities to start a fire again at one of our community’s schools.</seg>
<seg id="580">I know the Department of Finance has taken measures to make sure that our infrastructure is insured for the appropriate amount. We also learned that our deductible on schools, as an example, is $10 million.</seg>
<seg id="581">What are the implications with our insurance provider if another school goes up in flames, Mr. Speaker?</seg>
<seg id="582">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Our current insurance premium has jumped from $10 million to $20 million for our schools in result of the fires that have taken place.</seg>
<seg id="583">We continue to advocate that through our Department of Education and through all of us to try to encourage people to prevent that. Those are very valuable properties that sadly there have been attempts of them being burned down.</seg>
<seg id="584">We need to try to communicate and ensure that we show that we are doing our diligence through our security systems and through various… . We need to prove that we are doing better and we are trying to do better because the insurance deductible is rising and rising to a point where we have to insure it ourselves. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="585">I appreciate that information and it scares me when we talk about having insurance premiums of half or more of the value of a building.</seg>
<seg id="586">I did ask what would happen if another school went up.</seg>
<seg id="587">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I hope that we will continue to be insurable.</seg>
<seg id="588">This recent one of $20 million is a result of schools being burnt down.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the rest of our other buildings, the deductible is at $1 million.</seg>
<seg id="590">There are different varieties of this.</seg>
<seg id="591">I can’t say before how many schools are burnt that we will be uninsurable.</seg>
<seg id="592">I hope that under our watch that we don’t see another school being burnt. I applaud the questions and applaud our efforts to try to do this. Together, as all members, we need to continue to advocate that these are to educate our children and educate the public.</seg>
<seg id="593">I think, not only for schools but even for health centres, those are very valuable properties that we try to run our services.</seg>
<seg id="594">Any property damage causes a lot of grief to people that we serve. I want to continue advocating that our buildings are ours.</seg>
<seg id="595">As our Speaker continues to remind us, this is everybody’s House.</seg>
<seg id="596">We need to remind all of our students and all of the public that schools, health centres, and garages are all of the public’s buildings and they are there to serve the public.</seg>
<seg id="597">I applaud and thank for questioning this and raising this in this House. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="598">Question 133 – 5(1): Increasing Educational Opportunities in Baker Lake (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="599">I would like to direct my question to the Minister responsible for Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="600">Mr. Speaker, in my member’s statement I noted that we, as the Fifth Assembly of Nunavut, have a new opportunity to push our territory towards a bright future.</seg>
<seg id="601">Can the minister tell this House whether he would be willing to reopen the consideration of establishing a university in Nunavut in partnership with the private sector and others?</seg>
<seg id="602">Minister responsible for Nunavut Arctic College, Minister Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="603">I also thank the Member for Baker Lake for asking that question.</seg>
<seg id="604">Nunavut Arctic College drafted a request for proposals, asking different universities outside of Nunavut on ways to collaborate on various courses that we could jointly offer.</seg>
<seg id="605">We started to develop a plan, although we were made aware that different bodies, for example, Agnico Eagle placed funds aside specifically for the creation of a university in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="606">This work is something we would like to continue to pursue. However, we have tried to draft up an agreement with some universities outside of Nunavut on developing a collaborative approach towards this goal.</seg>
<seg id="607">I truly feel that we must invest in expanding educational opportunities from Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit such as that delivered by the Piqqusilirivvik program to higher academics such as the kind of education that would be delivered in a university setting.</seg>
<seg id="608">Of course I feel that Baker Lake would be the perfect location for such an expansion.</seg>
<seg id="609">Can the minister clarify whether he and his officials have been in discussion with the Board of Governors of Nunavut Arctic College to develop a vision of how greater opportunities for higher education can be delivered in Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="610">Minister Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="611">Nunavut Arctic College shares that desire to provide greater opportunities for Nunavummiut to be able to receive a university degree in their home territory. What we have started noting is that emergence of online distance learning courses, as that is another avenue to research.</seg>
<seg id="612">With respect to the matter the member referred to regarding Piqqusilirivvik and how more programming could be disseminated to the satellite communities, it is another idea which we are contemplating.</seg>
<seg id="613">The board of governors of Arctic College will be involved in this initiative along with my officials. Specifically the Arctic College president and vice-president will be developing a plan to move towards this goal that can provide us momentum forward.</seg>
<seg id="614">Your final supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="615">Mr. Mikkungwak: Mr. Speaker, I recognize that the previous government accepted a recommendation not to pursue the option of a Nunavut university at that time.</seg>
<seg id="616">Will the minister commit to revisiting this concept and reporting back to the House on his findings?</seg>
<seg id="617">Minister Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="618">Hon. David Joanasie: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thank Mr. Mikkungwak for his question.</seg>
<seg id="619">That option about building a university in Nunavut, people have different ideas about it.</seg>
<seg id="620">Like I said, Agnico Eagle has earmarked $5 million towards a new facility if there is a will to do that.</seg>
<seg id="621">I think it’s still an ongoing discussion.</seg>
<seg id="622">Within this mandate over the next four years, I’m not sure if that is the route we want to take given that we just completed a fairly extensive feasibility study which we’re going to take into consideration and proceed as we need.</seg>
<seg id="623">Members, please note that the time for question period has expired.</seg>
<seg id="624">Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="625">Motion 015 – 5(1): Extension of Question Period (Main)</seg>
<seg id="626">Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Pursuant to Rule 39(7), I move, seconded by the Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, that the time allotted for oral questions be extended. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="627">The motion is in order and it is not debatable.</seg>
<seg id="628">All those in favour of the motion, please raise your hand.</seg>
<seg id="629">All those opposed.</seg>
<seg id="630">Therefore question period will be extended for an additional 30 minutes staring now.</seg>
<seg id="631">Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="632">Question 134 – 5(1): Grants and Contributions Programs (Main)</seg>
<seg id="633">Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="634">I rise to ask my question to the Minister of Environment, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="635">I would like to ask about the Department of Environment’s hunting programs and I would like information on how they actually benefit our hunters.</seg>
<seg id="636">Looking at the government’s main estimates for 2017-18, those programs are in three parts.</seg>
<seg id="637">Let me speak in English so that I’m clear. There are three grants under the Department of Environment that are administered for disaster compensation, wildlife damage compensation, and finally the Fur Pricing Program.</seg>
<seg id="638">The budgeted amount for these grants is $150,000 for the current fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="639">First of all, I wonder if the minister could explain how the department evaluates the effectiveness of these programs.</seg>
<seg id="640">Minister of Environment, Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="641">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and for that question.</seg>
<seg id="642">I know that that happens at least, I think it’s three times a year. I don’t have the details of that yet, but I know they just had a fur harvesters’ auction beginning of March. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="643">Your first supplementary, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="644">I thank the minister for bringing up particularly the fur markets.</seg>
<seg id="645">Mr. Speaker, information provided in this House in years past is very interesting to me and perhaps other harvesters in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="646">In 2011 the Department of Environment stated that the value of pelts auctioned off to the Fur Harvesters Auction was around $800,000.</seg>
<seg id="647">In 2012 it was around $1.1 million and in 2013 it was $1.04 million.</seg>
<seg id="648">Mr. Speaker, I wonder if the minister could give us an update in terms of how the fur markets are proceeding this year in terms of the latest information that she has available. It could be this year or it could be last year. I’m interested in the health and the economic viability or state of the fur markets.</seg>
<seg id="649">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I, too, have the same information you just read off actually.</seg>
<seg id="650">I cannot say where they’re at because I don’t have the results of the Fur Harvesters Auction recently.</seg>
<seg id="651">I can tell you that my hope is after the Northern Lights, it was doubled in sales when it comes to the industry and I hope that that will be an indication of what’s coming by way of the Fur Harvesters Auction. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="652">Your final supplementary, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="653">I also thank the minister.</seg>
<seg id="654">This is my final question on this, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="655">Can the Department of Environment make considerations to get more cash into the hands of our hunters to help them out?</seg>
<seg id="656">We know who the fox trappers and sealskin producers are.</seg>
<seg id="657">I think that the money that is used within a year is too small, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="658">I believe it’s just too small.</seg>
<seg id="659">Can the minister agree with me on this fact? Can the minister check into this in the coming months?</seg>
<seg id="660">I agree with you. I look forward to tabling one day to increase that.</seg>
<seg id="661">Question 135 – 5(1): Compensation Program for Hunters and Trappers (Keyootak)</seg>
<seg id="662">My question will be directed to the Minister of Environment.</seg>
<seg id="663">Mr. Speaker, we are all aware in Nunavut that our hunters’ equipment gets damaged, especially by polar bears. Their shacks get broken up and their important property like snowmobiles is damaged.</seg>
<seg id="664">Mr. Speaker, there is a compensation program for damaged equipment, but it’s very hard to access that money.</seg>
<seg id="665">Has the funding for wildlife damage compensation programs been depleted this year?</seg>
<seg id="666">Minister of Environment, Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="667">My apologies. I didn’t hear the whole question.</seg>
<seg id="668">Can he repeat the question, please?</seg>
<seg id="669">Speaker: Please repeat your question, Mr. Keyootak.</seg>
<seg id="670">Our properties like snowmobiles and shacks get damaged, especially by polar bears, when we’re not there.</seg>
<seg id="671">We all know that there are compensation programs for wildlife damage to property.</seg>
<seg id="672">My question was: has the budget for damage compensation been depleted this fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="673">Speaker: Thank you for clarifying the question.</seg>
<seg id="674">Minister of Environment, Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="675">Your first supplementary, Mr. Keyootak.</seg>
<seg id="676">The minister said that she would respond after she gets the information.</seg>
<seg id="677">Can she break it down between the Baffin region, the Kivalliq region, and the Kitikmeot region?</seg>
<seg id="678">Yes, I can provide a breakdown of the list.</seg>
<seg id="679">Question 136 – 5(1): Child Care and Early Learning Program (Hickes)</seg>
<seg id="680">I would like to direct my questions today to the Minister of Education.</seg>
<seg id="681">In his minister’s statement this afternoon he stated that all eligible licensed child care facilities will receive an increase and he gave a range of numbers dependent on the number, type, and location of the spaces.</seg>
<seg id="682">Is there an overall budget associated within this range? What is the total amount that is being provided to our licensed child care facilities?</seg>
<seg id="683">Minister of Education, Minister Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="684">Hon. David Joanasie: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="685">I thank Mr. Hickes for his question.</seg>
<seg id="686">Cabinet approved the signing of a multilateral framework for this agreement. It’s a three-year agreement and over the three years I think it’s broken down by four different categories.</seg>
<seg id="687">If you want specific statistics operations-wise, O M would be overall $1.1 million for each year. It’s broken down into that.</seg>
<seg id="688">That’s kind of the overall numbers I have.</seg>
<seg id="689">I thank the minister for those details.</seg>
<seg id="690">Mr. Speaker, when I’m looking at the daycare regulations for Nunavut, A manual for early childhood programs, section 17 in the staffing speaks to “For all staff involved in the delivery of the daily program, it is recommended to include training as one of the expectations.”</seg>
<seg id="691">Mr. Speaker, I know there are a number of different programs offered within the Early Childhood Division as well as Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="692">How is success measured? How is this tracked from licensed daycare facilities across the territory to make sure that training is encouraged for day-to-day staff?</seg>
<seg id="693">Hon. David Joanasie: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Hickes, again.</seg>
<seg id="694">Training is one part of this agreement over the three years.</seg>
<seg id="695">That’s one of the other components outside of the $1.1 million for operations costs.</seg>
<seg id="696">We want to get more and more certified ECE workers that might already be working in a daycare facility.</seg>
<seg id="697">It’s an area that we want to continue to boost. Training and ongoing training on the job are some things that we look forward to over the three years and beyond.</seg>
<seg id="698">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="699">I look forward to getting that information in the House.</seg>
<seg id="700">When we're looking at the day care workers and the curriculum that's available, I've heard a lot of times that when there's a training program, it seems like it's more effective.</seg>
<seg id="701">Mr. Speaker, I have also heard concerns about the lack of wage subsidies for daycare workers.</seg>
<seg id="702">It's very important that we make sure that there's consistent training for our children.</seg>
<seg id="703">I'm just wondering: in terms of the grants and contributions that they're trying to provide to day-care workers to make sure that they're getting a better salary so that they're full-time and they '</seg>
<seg id="704">I agree with Mr. Hickes and I totally agree with him that we want our children to be well prepared and successful in their lives before they enter the school system.</seg>
<seg id="705">That's what we're trying to do and we're trying to support the daycare staff.</seg>
<seg id="706">With this agreement, one of the things that we're trying to do is to make sure that if the parents don't increase the rates that they're providing daycares, we're able to work with the daycares to make sure that they're adequately funded.</seg>
<seg id="707">At this time, we're still working on that and we're hoping to have more daycare spaces in all of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="708">Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Sammurtok.</seg>
<seg id="709">Question 137 - 1 (5): Inuit Employment Requirements in Government Contracts</seg>
<seg id="710">On Friday, March 16, I asked questions to the Minister of Community and Government Services.</seg>
<seg id="711">The number of Inuit working for the government is increasing.</seg>
<seg id="712">Mr. Speaker, the minister indicated that he was in support of increasing Inuit employment.</seg>
<seg id="713">Is this 20 percent related to the construction of the Baffin Correctional Centre and the breakwaters in Iqaluit and Pond Inlet?</seg>
<seg id="714">If I understood you correctly, Mr. Speaker, 20 percent and 15 percent are Inuit.</seg>
<seg id="715">Can the minister give us a brief overview of how we're going to make changes to the tendering process?</seg>
<seg id="716">Minister responsible for Community and Government Services, Minister Kusugak.</seg>
<seg id="717">I'm sure you understand that when tenders are being done by CGS, they provide assistance to the departments that will be constructed.</seg>
<seg id="718">If it's going to be a docking facility, we're talking about the Department of Economic Development and Transportation.</seg>
<seg id="719">We work with the contractors to make sure that the contracts are being followed.</seg>
<seg id="720">We work with the client departments to determine how many Inuit will be employed.</seg>
<seg id="721">We're trying to make sure that we don't go over budget.</seg>
<seg id="722">I can't say at this time that after the tenders have been cancelled, the bids will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="723">That's my question.</seg>
<seg id="724">If they can't change anything, then they can't make any changes.</seg>
<seg id="725">Can the Department of Community and Government Services work on that?</seg>
<seg id="726">I hope I was understandable, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="727">Can the minister tell me, maybe tell the House if it's okay for the staff from other communities to work when they're building houses?</seg>
<seg id="728">Hon. Lorne Kusugak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="729">I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="730">Mr. Speaker, the NNI Policy provides that "contractors conduct evaluations on issues related to Inuit labour content as follows:</seg>
<seg id="731">equipment;</seg>
<seg id="732">Inuit who are eligible to be employed according to their education;</seg>
<seg id="733">Other community-based programs could affect Inuit employment opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="734">Mr. Speaker, we encourage contractors in the communities to hire from the regions before they are hired from outside of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="735">So that's one of the things that we're trying to do to attract people to come into Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="736">We encourage that.</seg>
<seg id="737">We work very closely with the client departments in trying to meet those goals.</seg>
<seg id="738">Mr. Enook.</seg>
<seg id="739">Mr. Browne: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="740">This will be my last question. Will the minister commit to working with his department to ensure that major infrastructure projects are completed?</seg>
<seg id="741">Will the minister commit to working with the service providers to ensure that jobs are created and that people are able to apply for jobs in the communities outside of Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="742">Will the minister commit to ensuring that this is taken into consideration so that Nunavut's current contracting practices will be included?</seg>
<seg id="743">I believe that the Government of Nunavut, as a whole, encourages the public to seek employment first so that they can hire Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="744">We will continue to do that.</seg>

<seg id="779">Chairman (interpretation): Good afternoon. I would like to call the committee meeting to order.</seg>
<seg id="780">In Committee of the Whole, we have the following items to deal with: Bills 2, 3, and 4.</seg>
<seg id="781">Mr. Moyo.</seg>
<seg id="782">Mr. Mrazek: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="783">We are reviewing Bill 2 and then Bill 3 and Bill 3.</seg>
<seg id="784">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="785">Does the committee agree that we first deal with Bill 2?</seg>
<seg id="786">Agreed?</seg>
<seg id="787">Bill 02 - Interim Appropriation (Operations Maintenance) Act, April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018 - Consideration in Committee</seg>
<seg id="788">Bill 2, please refer to your legislation binder.</seg>
<seg id="789">Moving on. Mr. Akeeagok, do you have witnesses that you would like to bring to the table?</seg>
<seg id="790">Hon. David Simailak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="791">Chairman (interpretation): Does the committee agree to bring in the witnesses?</seg>
<seg id="792">Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the witnesses in.</seg>
<seg id="793">Mr. Akeeagok, for the record, please introduce your witnesses and your opening comments.</seg>
<seg id="794">To my left is my Assistant Deputy Minister, Dan Cousins.</seg>
<seg id="795">Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to appear before you today to present Bill 2, Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, 2018-19.</seg>
<seg id="796">This bill will come into force on April 1, 2018 and June 30, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="797">Mr. Chairman, earlier this year, the Minister of Finance appeared before the Committee of the Whole on the occasion of its review of the government's main estimates and business plan.</seg>
<seg id="798">With that being the case, at this time, the 2018-19 main estimates and business plans for the 2018-19 fiscal year will be tabled in the Legislative Assembly in May and June.</seg>
<seg id="799">To this end, Mr. Chairman, the interim budget allows the department to deliver its programs and services to Nunavummiut in the coming months.</seg>
<seg id="800">It's almost impossible to set aside some money after the election.</seg>
<seg id="801">Mr. Chairman, all departments and territorial corporations have had the opportunity to review these interim appropriations based on the department's actual expenditures and budgetary processes over the past four years.</seg>
<seg id="802">We are satisfied that this amount will be sufficient for the operations of the Office of the Legislative Assembly following its review of the Legislative Assembly's main estimates and approval of the annual budget.</seg>
<seg id="803">The contents of the two bills are:</seg>
<seg id="804">$8.62 million for the Office of the Legislative Assembly;</seg>
<seg id="805">$11.66 million for the Public Service;</seg>
<seg id="806">$29.08 million for the Department of Finance;</seg>
<seg id="807">$49.1 million for the Department of Family Services;</seg>
<seg id="808">$32.44 million for the Department of Justice;</seg>
<seg id="809">$10.77 million for the Department of Culture and Heritage;</seg>
<seg id="810">$64.1 million for the Department of Education;</seg>
<seg id="811">$85.77 million for the Department of Health and Social Services "old office building;</seg>
<seg id="812">$8.32 million for the Department of Environment;</seg>
<seg id="813">$82.73 million for the Department of Community and Government Services "old office building;</seg>
<seg id="814">$23.29 million for the Department of Economic Development and Transportation;</seg>
<seg id="815">$73.39 million for the Nunavut Housing Corporation; and</seg>
<seg id="816">$12.54 million for Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="817">Mr. Chairman, that concludes my opening comments.</seg>
<seg id="818">Are there any questions or comments?</seg>
<seg id="819">Do members have any general comments?</seg>
<seg id="820">Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="821">Mr. Towtongie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="822">I was reading the Inuktitut version. $32.44 million from the Department of Justice. It talks about the Inuktitut version of the $32.44.</seg>
<seg id="823">What is the difference between the $8.62 million in Inuktitut and $8.62 million for the Office of the Legislative Assembly?</seg>
<seg id="824">Hon. David Simailak (interpretation): Just for clarification, the Legislative Assembly is requesting $8.62 million and the Department of Justice is seeking $32.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="825">I apologize if the translation was not translated properly. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="826">The English version is correct.</seg>
<seg id="827">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="828">That's just a question for the minister. We're not at a percentage of the budget, so I'm just wondering if that's something that has been spent on setting aside funds for elections.</seg>
<seg id="829">Mr. Speaker, I know there was a lot of debate on financial management and I think the minister has indicated that there should be a fundamental change in the way that the department provides accurate services to Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="830">Mr. Chairman, it doesn't really have anything to do with this bill.</seg>
<seg id="831">I'm just wondering if there's been any changes in the way that they're allocated within the next few years.</seg>
<seg id="832">Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="833">Hon. David Simailak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="834">To date, there haven't been any major changes to the O M budget, but we're hoping to see the capital budget in the fall. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="835">Are there any more general comments?</seg>
<seg id="836">Do members have any general comments?</seg>
<seg id="837">If not we will go clause by clause.</seg>
<seg id="838">Go to Bill 2 in your white legislation binder.</seg>
<seg id="839">Bill 2, Interim Appropriation Act, April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="840">Chairman: Clause 2. Do you agree?</seg>
<seg id="841">Chairman: Go to Schedule on page 2, Schedule on page 3 in Inuktitut, Interim Appropriation Act April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="842">Total Operations and Maintenance. $491,804,000.</seg>
<seg id="843">Thank you, Mr. Moyo, do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="844">Mr. Mrazek: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="845">I might have had to bring this up earlier, but I have a question on departmental grants and contributions.</seg>
<seg id="846">It's my understanding that the percentages are based on a yearly basis, but some of the grants and contributions are already used. If they're for one year, then they're going to be depleted on April 1.</seg>
<seg id="847">I just want to get some clarification on the grants and contributions. Is it the responsibility of the Nunavut Housing Corporation?</seg>
<seg id="848">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="849">Hon. David Simailak: Good question.</seg>
<seg id="850">In your opening comments, you said that it's a four-year program.</seg>
<seg id="851">I can say that the Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation are one of the biggest departments.</seg>
<seg id="852">If there's a request for proposals, then the departments have different processes, and then in the last four years, all the departments have quarterly payments.</seg>
<seg id="853">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="854">I guess I'll ask another question. Can the minister indicate if they're going to be using the same process that they're going to use for projects or are they just going to be using the terms of reference?</seg>
<seg id="855">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Moyo.</seg>
<seg id="856">Hon. David Simailak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="857">I'm hoping to be in a position tomorrow to be able to look at some of the projects that we're looking at in the future. One of the things that we've been able to put in place in the fifth Assembly is that we've been advised by the ministers that it's going to be the same thing for the next three months.</seg>
<seg id="858">Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="859">I'm sorry. Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="860">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome, minister and your officials.</seg>
<seg id="861">In the main estimates, we have $491,804,000.</seg>
<seg id="862">The first item I would like to clarify is under this bill, $8,623,000. In your opening comments, the minister stated that it's $8.26 million.</seg>
<seg id="863">It's not $3,000.</seg>
<seg id="864">Why is that the case?</seg>
<seg id="865">That is my question.</seg>
<seg id="866">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="867">Hon. David Simailak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="868">That's what we're trying to get at.</seg>
<seg id="869">Those are the numbers.</seg>
<seg id="870">As I indicated in my opening comments, I'm trying to keep the numbers closer to the main estimates. I don't want to say all the details, but we have reduced the numbers.</seg>
<seg id="871">The numbers that we're looking at in the bill were accurate and not all of them were correct.</seg>
<seg id="872">Total Supplementary Appropriation. $491,804,000. Do you agree?</seg>
<seg id="873">Clause 5. Do you agree?</seg>
<seg id="874">Chairman: Do members agree to Bill 2 as a whole?</seg>
<seg id="875">Do members agree, pursuant to Rule 62 (2), that Bill 2 can immediately be placed on the orders of the day for third reading?</seg>
<seg id="876">Minister Akeeagok, do you have any closing comments?</seg>
<seg id="877">Hon. David Simailak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would just like to thank my officials for preparing this bill so that we can have our government operational by June.</seg>
<seg id="878">Thank you very much to all the members for your support in approving this funding and I look forward to sitting in this House when we deal with the budget in March and June.</seg>
<seg id="879">I thank all of you.</seg>
<seg id="880">Bill 2 is concluded.</seg>
<seg id="881">I would now like to ask the minister if he can proceed with his opening comments on Bill 3.</seg>
<seg id="882">Bill 03 - Supplementary Appropriation (Operations Maintenance) Act, No. 3, 2017-2018 - Consideration in Committee</seg>
<seg id="883">Hon. David Simailak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="884">I will ask my officials to remain at the witness table. I would like you to know that as soon as we get to the next department, I will be able to invite my officials.</seg>
<seg id="885">Mr. Chairman, can I begin with my opening comments?</seg>
<seg id="886">I am pleased to present Bill 3, Supplementary Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, 2017-2018, No. 3, through this bill, the government is seeking to increase its budget by $56,602,000 for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="887">$49 million to the Department of Health to cover a shortfall in the Department of Health's budget for medical travel, mental health, addictions treatment, elders "long-term care, medical care, and TB treatment;</seg>
<seg id="888">$6.2 million to the Department of Justice to cover the shortfalls in the RCMP, Corrections and Justice; and</seg>
<seg id="889">$1,402 million in over-expenditures for the Children and Family Services Branch and the Corporate Services Branch.</seg>
<seg id="890">Mr. Chairman, that concludes my opening comments. I look forward to responding to any questions or comments that members may have.</seg>
<seg id="891">Are there any general comments?</seg>
<seg id="892">Supplementary Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) 2017-18, No. 3. Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="893">Total Children and Family Services. $1,402,000.</seg>
<seg id="894">I just saw the numbers and I still don't know where you're coming from.</seg>
<seg id="895">Mr. Savikataaq, can you respond to that question?</seg>
<seg id="896">Hon. David Savikataaq: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="897">I don't have the breakdown with me at this time, but there are two main facilities that we do have that we send more inmates out of the territory and we have increased the number of visits outside of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="898">For example, there's an elder from Igloolik, I don't know if it's in Gjoa Haven or Ottawa, so that the patient can go to the hospital and visit them.</seg>
<seg id="899">If they don't receive income support, then they're not given assistance.</seg>
<seg id="900">The majority of Nunavut's elders are sent out of the territory because they don't have the support they need in Nunavut. As I said earlier, there are more people going out of the territory to visit.</seg>
<seg id="901">I'm just wondering if you have any plans to repatriate all the elders "care facilities that are currently under the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="902">Some of the things that the minister mentioned are not actually under Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="903">Some of them are in the care of the Department of Health and some of them are in the care of the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="904">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="905">I understand that some people have to be visited by foster parents.</seg>
<seg id="906">My question is are there still elders who are still receiving social assistance that have not been transferred to the Department of Health?</seg>
<seg id="907">Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="908">Hon. David Simailak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) According to my briefing notes, the information that I have is that it was transferred to the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="909">They are not transferred to the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="910">I'm just wondering if there are any more positions that have been transferred to Family Services that haven't been transferred to Family Services. I'm just looking at the information here and looking at the business plan, I think all of them have been moved. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="911">I don't know if the minister can clarify that for me.</seg>
<seg id="912">It's up to Mr. Akeeagok to respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="913">Hon. David Simailak (interpretation): I'll try and clarify.</seg>
<seg id="914">I thought the question was: is it still within the Department of Health and Social Services?</seg>
<seg id="915">What I said was that it's under the Department of Health right now and it's under the seniors "program.</seg>
<seg id="916">We are still in Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="917">What we're trying to do is increase the budget for social services. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="918">Thank you for the explanation from the minister.</seg>
<seg id="919">Now I understand.</seg>
<seg id="920">Maybe I'll rephrase my question.</seg>
<seg id="921">Does the Department of Family Services still have elder care programs?</seg>
<seg id="922">Hon. David Simailak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) There are still programs available for elders and I would like the Minister of Family Services to clarify that.</seg>
<seg id="923">I'm aware that the government's programs for seniors "fuel subsidy, the Seniors" Fuel Subsidy Program, the Seniors "Fuel Subsidy Program, and the Department of Family Services, I'm sure, are over the age of 60.</seg>
<seg id="924">If I missed anyone, Minister Savikataaq can help me answer the question. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="925">I thank both ministers for clarifying that.</seg>
<seg id="926">My last one.</seg>
<seg id="927">When Nunavut residents are sent out of the territory, do they still receive income support?</seg>
<seg id="928">Hon. David Simailak: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation) Through you, I would like Minister Savikataaq to respond to that question. (interpretation ends) Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="929">Chairman: Thank you, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="930">It depends on the situation.</seg>
<seg id="931">In some cases, they are eligible for income support, but I can't say that they are the same.</seg>
<seg id="932">I have a lot of detailed questions within the department.</seg>
<seg id="933">They have indicated that they will be providing funding from other departments.</seg>
<seg id="934">As it stands now, does other departments in this territory support all Nunavummiut?</seg>
<seg id="935">Hon. David Simailak: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="936">Also from Family Services, almost all of those positions were transferred to the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="937">They don't get that much subsidy. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="938">I thank the minister for that answer.</seg>
<seg id="939">When you're going to be giving them to different departments, when do you identify when they're going to be in a deficit situation?</seg>
<seg id="940">Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="941">The department reports on a monthly basis and at the end of the fiscal year, it's slightly over-expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="942">We are on page 4.</seg>
<seg id="943">Mr. Moyo.</seg>
<seg id="944">In the document that we have before us, it says that they're providing residential care based on population growth. There were 189 residential care facilities.</seg>
<seg id="945">Do you foresee an increase in the numbers?</seg>
<seg id="946">What is the growing need for long-term care?</seg>
<seg id="947">I'm just wondering if you have an idea of what the reasons are for increasing the number of people requiring care.</seg>
<seg id="948">Hon. David Simailak: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="949">I'm just wondering if that's something that's been going on for a number of years now and if that's something that's going to be included in the overall budget starting from last year. I don't want to approve a supplementary appropriation that's accurate in the budget.</seg>
<seg id="950">Will that be included in the growth?</seg>
<seg id="951">If we're going through the page-by-page review, it's going to be evident that we're going to be talking about the changes when they're not meeting the budget.</seg>
<seg id="952">We will be asking questions when we get to the main estimates. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="953">In your briefing notes, it states that there is a surplus within the department.</seg>
<seg id="954">It mentions that the department recently revised the Income Support Program.</seg>
<seg id="955">I'm just wondering if the minister could indicate if any of the remaining funds were spent by the Department of Finance or were they all spent by income support workers or did the majority of the money go towards income support?</seg>
<seg id="956">Which one did you increase it to?</seg>
<seg id="957">I'm trying to understand where the surplus was spent.</seg>
<seg id="958">I'm just wondering if there's going to be an increase in the paperwork or is there going to be an increase in the income support amount?</seg>
<seg id="959">Chairman: Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="960">Hon. David Simailak: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="961">They have been hired to operate on a regular basis and they're moving from one department to another and some of these individuals have been hired.</seg>
<seg id="962">Mr. Speaker, when the Income Support Program was revised, it was funded through the government's response to the residential care review.</seg>
<seg id="963">There are a number of reasons why the Department of Family Services has arrived at budget shortfalls for this fiscal year. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="964">I will leave it at that.</seg>
<seg id="965">Information provided by the department indicates that one of the department's priorities is to, and I quote, "increase the number of income support clients."</seg>
<seg id="966">Will this funding be used for staff or will it be for income support?</seg>
<seg id="967">Perhaps my colleague, Minister Savikataaq, can respond to the question better.</seg>
<seg id="968">Mr. Savikataaq, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="969">The income support adjustments have a huge impact on income support payments.</seg>
<seg id="970">The National Child Benefit Supplement has been reduced.</seg>
<seg id="971">The National Child Benefit Supplement will no longer be in place. At this time, the income support recipients will be receiving more money than the income support recipients.</seg>
<seg id="972">We are on Total Children and Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="973">Not previously authorized. $1,402,000.</seg>
<seg id="974">Justice. Operations and Maintenance. Not Previously Authorized.</seg>
<seg id="975">Total Justice. $2,600,000.</seg>
<seg id="976">Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="977">Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="978">Minister, welcome.</seg>
<seg id="979">What I'm trying to get at is this (interpretation ends) "to purchase new drugs." (interpretation) Does the minister have any plans to amend the Tobacco Tax Act?</seg>
<seg id="980">Hon. David Simailak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Like you, Mr. Chairman, I would like to direct my question to the Deputy Minister of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="981">Does the committee agree to bring in the witnesses?</seg>
<seg id="982">Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the other witness out.</seg>
<seg id="983">For the record, Mr. Akeeagok, please introduce your witness.</seg>
<seg id="984">On my left is Deputy Minister of Justice Bill MacKay.</seg>
<seg id="985">If it's okay with you, I would like to take the question as notice.</seg>
<seg id="986">That's a very good question.</seg>
<seg id="987">This is not for smoking.</seg>
<seg id="988">These are new drugs that we need to learn and implement.</seg>
<seg id="989">In December of this year, during the Minister of Finance's recent Budget Address, funding was allocated under the Tobacco Reduction Framework for Action. 25 percent of the funding from the federal government will be allocated to the RCMP to conduct an inventory of drugs.</seg>
<seg id="990">That's two things.</seg>
<seg id="991">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="992">My next question is in regard to the housing crisis in the communities.</seg>
<seg id="993">Can the minister explain why this is included in there?</seg>
<seg id="994">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="995">Hon. David Simailak: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="996">If there's another RCMP member, we have to go through the government contract to get housing. So the cost was around $300,000. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="997">Mr. Main, did you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="998">Mr. Mrazek: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="999">The minister talked about the $2,600,000 breakdown of $300,000 for housing.</seg>
<seg id="1000">Can you elaborate a little bit more on that?</seg>
<seg id="1001">Hon. David Simailak: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1002">I will ask my officials.</seg>
<seg id="1003">Those are the numbers.</seg>
<seg id="1004">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1005">I thank the minister.</seg>
<seg id="1006">Why is it that these vehicles have to be purchased?</seg>
<seg id="1007">I believe it was supposed to be in the budget.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Was this a factor in purchasing new vehicles?</seg>
<seg id="1009">Hon. David Simailak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The $1 million is for the replacement of mobile equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1011">We do have a contract with the RCMP and there are various processes.</seg>
<seg id="1012">Last year, the vehicles were not replaced because of the lack of funding.</seg>
<seg id="1013">However, this year, the government's vehicles have failed to meet the basic needs of Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="1014">That's why there's a significant increase in this year.</seg>
<seg id="1015">The equipment has been damaged.</seg>
<seg id="1016">Through the RCMP's contracting arrangements, they have to purchase this equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1017">However, in discussions with the federal government, they have to come to an agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Mr. Ma: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1019">I believe my colleague is referring to that.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believe they're new.</seg>
<seg id="1021">Will the equipment that is going to be inspected be made available to all the communities?</seg>
<seg id="1022">Hon. David Simailak: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1023">Those are the new job evaluation tools for the RCMP and the public. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1024">If it's the most dangerous drugs in our communities, are there any plans in place to deal with them?</seg>
<seg id="1025">I wish everyone who is coming into our communities a safe and happy summer.</seg>
<seg id="1026">However, at least two communities have been impacted.</seg>
<seg id="1027">It's very dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1028">If you don't get those things, it's much better if you don't do it, but it's becoming a safety issue and I'm glad that the RCMP is preparing for it.</seg>
<seg id="1029">Mr. Mrazek: I thought you were done.</seg>
<seg id="1030">That's my last question.</seg>
<seg id="1031">In terms of the lack of housing in the communities, I'm just wondering if you could clarify that for me.</seg>
<seg id="1032">In the document that we have provided, it states that we have received nine additional RCMP officers in six Nunavut communities.</seg>
<seg id="1033">That was just a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1034">Moving on. Mr. Hickes, do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1035">On the $2.6 million that you're requesting, you're talking about the interpreters that go to court. Did you need seven judges?</seg>
<seg id="1036">Hon. David Simailak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) At this time, no, there are more interpreters and there are a number of other positions that we need to hire.</seg>
<seg id="1037">I'll just leave it at that. In his opening comments, he talked about the new telephone system and the replacement of the old system.</seg>
<seg id="1038">We know that there's going to be a replacement of the existing telephone system. Are they going to be setting aside additional funds or are they going to be requesting additional funding once the number is known by the RCMP?</seg>
<seg id="1039">It's being planned by the department.</seg>
<seg id="1040">The Department of Finance has a business plan that states that the government's Public Service Act has been passed. As my colleague pointed out, there is no funding for smoking prevention. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Within the other O M of the Baffin Correctional Centre, it talks about a full-time position and a full-time position at the Baffin Correctional Centre.</seg>
<seg id="1042">Hon. David Simailak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1043">Did he say eight?</seg>
<seg id="1044">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My next question is in regard to the information that was provided in the overtime. It says here that when the Baffin Correctional Centre gets over $180 thousand, is that correct?</seg>
<seg id="1045">Can the minister clarify that for me?</seg>
<seg id="1046">Through you, I would like my Deputy Minister, Mr. MacKay, to respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1047">Mr. MacKay: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1048">If it's a blizzard, then it's added to overtime.</seg>
<seg id="1049">When there's a blizzard, they can't go home and then the staff says that there's going to be another person going to work again. Is it two times when there's a blizzard?</seg>
<seg id="1050">Mr. MacKay, can you clarify your question?</seg>
<seg id="1051">If there's a blizzard, they're immediately referred to by the staff.</seg>
<seg id="1052">Mr. Lysy.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Mr. Pinksen: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1054">My questions are for the Minister of Justice. First of all, the RCMP has indicated that they will need new RCMP detachments for the next nine years.</seg>
<seg id="1055">When you hire RCMP members do they get housing separately?</seg>
<seg id="1056">I'm happy to say that one of my officials, who was playing hockey, was playing hockey with one of his colleagues, Taylor Kayok, I'm sure she's going to be okay and my deputy can't write.</seg>
<seg id="1057">It will take time.</seg>
<seg id="1058">My question is in regard to the 9 RCMP detachments.</seg>
<seg id="1059">As I stated earlier, we work with various entities.</seg>
<seg id="1060">I would like to be very clear that 70 percent of the RCMP costs to the Government of Nunavut are paid 30 percent by the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="1061">The RCMP is contracted by the federal government. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1062">Mr. Pinksen: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1063">I am just wondering if the RCMP will be providing housing to all the RCMP officers?</seg>
<seg id="1064">Hon. David Simailak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) When the RCMP officers are brought into the communities, they are identified on a yearly basis.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They don't send their officers out on the land.</seg>
<seg id="1066">They don't expect to have staff housing in the communities at the same time, but depending on how many RCMP members they need in the community, they are provided with housing.</seg>
<seg id="1067">The RCMP operates differently.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When they identify that they need more RCMP officers in all 25 communities, they try to include staff housing immediately. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1069">It's unfortunate that the RCMP does not try to involve the communities.</seg>
<seg id="1070">When the RCMP gets their own home, how does it help them?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Lysy.</seg>
<seg id="1072">I don't think there should be too many questions here.</seg>
<seg id="1073">I don't think we should expect them to get their own houses.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1076">That was a very good comment.</seg>
<seg id="1077">The RCMP is out there for three years even though they're in the community, they're involved in community fundraising.</seg>
<seg id="1078">If the RCMP wanted to get a house, they would be asking the federal government for housing.</seg>
<seg id="1079">The federal government doesn't make any money. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1080">My last question is in regard to the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="1081">Clause 40,071,000.</seg>
<seg id="1082">If this is approved, it will be $42,671,000 for this contract. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1083">Thank you for that clarification.</seg>
<seg id="1084">Moving on to the third item, Corrections.</seg>
<seg id="1085">Chairman (interpretation): Mr. Lysy, we're only on Law Enforcement. We haven't reached that stage yet. Can you wait for those questions?</seg>
<seg id="1086">Are there any further questions?</seg>
<seg id="1087">Mr. D'Arcy: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1088">In the minister's letter, he indicated that the total budget for this project was $40 million, which is estimated to be $30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1089">How is the $42 million budgeted for the end of the fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="1090">Maybe I could ask the member if he has any numbers.</seg>
<seg id="1091">I'm just wondering if there's a figure that I got from the letter that I received on Friday, I think it was $30 million, but if he could elaborate a little bit more.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The letter is dated March 16th to the Regular Members "Caucus addressed to the Minister of Finance's appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1093">The document I'm referring to is on page 4 and page 4.</seg>
<seg id="1094">I would like to thank the member.</seg>
<seg id="1095">That's the figure of 30 million dollars for this year that's been spent up to $30 million, and the plan is $42 million.</seg>
<seg id="1096">The RCMP has explained how they're going to use it and they're going to be using the $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1097">I'm looking at the $2.6 million that we're looking at on page 1 of the business plan, it indicates that "The RCMP operates with hurricane strapping."</seg>
<seg id="1098">Members note that the Legislative Assembly is proposing to make improvements to the management system. However, the uniqueness of the system is that it requires an additional $2.6 million to cover the costs associated with employee training, training, and employee retention.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The minister talked about the $2.6 million increase in compensation and benefits. On the same page, it talks about over $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1100">Can you clarify that, Mr. Chairman?</seg>
<seg id="1101">Mr. Akeeagok, if you would like to rephrase your question.</seg>
<seg id="1102">If you look at the breakdown that I mentioned earlier, there's an additional $2.6 million for corrections.</seg>
<seg id="1103">There are two separate categories of $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1104">The RCMP needs radio equipment, vehicles, and all kinds of emergency situations. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1105">I thank Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="1106">If we're talking about $2.6 million, what's the total amount of this amount? I don't understand it. Can you clarify that for me?</seg>
<seg id="1107">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="1108">On page 5 of your business plan, under Law Enforcement, we're dealing with $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1109">On another topic, "Correctional Facilities," there's $2.6 million that's also mentioned, but it's not totally what we're dealing with right now. At this time, we're looking at $2.6 million for code compliance.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1111">Mr. Towtongie (interpretation): Thank you for clarifying that.</seg>
<seg id="1112">In reading the Inuktitut version, it seems like the main estimates are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1113">Can you clarify what this means? Is it an estimate or is it for 2017-18?</seg>
<seg id="1114">Hon. David Simailak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) On my left, it talks about $40 million for the Law Enforcement Branch, $11 million that has already been approved by the department.</seg>
<seg id="1115">We're still in the 2017-18 fiscal year and you're projecting that it's going to be able to go up a little bit. That's why we're trying to get approval for supplementary appropriations for the Department of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1116">A total of $6.2 million has been allocated to the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="1117">That is what we are requesting from the House. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1118">I'm just confused in the Inuktitut version because it seems like they're estimates.</seg>
<seg id="1119">I understand my question now.</seg>
<seg id="1120">We are on Law Enforcement. $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Total Registries and Court Services. $1 million.</seg>
<seg id="1122">Total Justice. Corrections. $2,600,000.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Mr. Pinksen: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1124">My question is in regard to corrections.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Am I correct?</seg>
<seg id="1126">Hon. David Simailak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1127">The member is correct. The majority of that is for overtime and casuals.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Mr. Lyall.</seg>
<seg id="1129">If memory serves me correct, the Baffin Correctional Centre employs 12 hours. Is that correct?</seg>
<seg id="1130">I'm just wondering if the department has given any thought to having three or eight-hour positions in the Baffin Correctional Centre.</seg>
<seg id="1131">Perhaps through you, the deputy minister, Mr. MacKay, can respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The member is correct that we have 12 hours of work.</seg>
<seg id="1133">It's a two-hour program. It's a 42-hour program.</seg>
<seg id="1134">It was $4 million and now it's $2.49 million.</seg>
<seg id="1135">As a result, the Corrections Division's deficit was $4.5 million, almost $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1136">We're moving forward with telehealth and we will continue to do that.</seg>
<seg id="1137">I would like to remind everyone to turn your microphone off and keep it hoarse.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Mr. Pinksen: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1139">They go out on the land for overtime and they work for 42 hours a week.</seg>
<seg id="1140">Do they work for 50 or 60 hours a week?</seg>
<seg id="1141">Hon. David Simailak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This is quite detailed, so we have to provide it to the House.</seg>
<seg id="1143">Our deputy minister cannot respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1144">We don't have that information.</seg>
<seg id="1145">I don't know how much information they need for the operation of the facility.</seg>
<seg id="1146">My questions are for the Premier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">And what kind of training?</seg>
<seg id="1148">With your permission, I would like to ask Deputy Minister MacKay to respond.</seg>
<seg id="1149">I'm going to ask him to answer that question. There is a training and development supplementary appropriation under Court Services.</seg>
<seg id="1150">We don't provide training at this time.</seg>
<seg id="1151">We've got a trainer who has a contract in place and it's one of the reasons why it's so expensive to have overtime and on-the-job training and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="1152">We're also looking at other ways of how we can better plan the budget so that we can have more staff at the Corrections and Court Services so that we can provide more training to the contractors so that we can have less teachers.</seg>
<seg id="1153">Ms. Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="1154">I was wondering about the $2.6 million that was talked about earlier and the staff training.</seg>
<seg id="1155">What training will be provided to employees and casuals?</seg>
<seg id="1156">Both correctional facilities and the court system provide training for casual employees and staff.</seg>
<seg id="1157">If they're hired on a casual basis and they're contracted out for a number of weeks, then they're trained to work with the corrections officers and they're trained to deal with conflict of interest.</seg>
<seg id="1158">What kind of programs do they have for inmates or do I have to ask questions?</seg>
<seg id="1159">I don't know if they have that level of detail, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="1160">With your permission, Deputy Minister MacKay can elaborate further.</seg>
<seg id="1161">Ms. MacKay.</seg>
<seg id="1162">I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I will be able to provide that information to the member as to what training is provided to inmates.</seg>
<seg id="1163">Based on which low-risk inmates, such as here in Iqaluit, at the Baffin Correctional Centre, are receiving pre-trades training so that they will be able to work in the correctional facilities and provide training to inmates so that they can work in the correctional facility after they graduate.</seg>
<seg id="1164">We also have programs in place for individuals with special needs, addictions counselling, family violence counselling, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1165">Even though they can't leave the facility, they're trained to work in the correctional facility and they usually graduate from high school and they're also trained in the trades program.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The facility in Rankin Inlet provides programming for inmates.</seg>
<seg id="1167">There are different programs that we offer.</seg>
<seg id="1168">Mr. Netser: I'm done.</seg>
<seg id="1169">We are on page 5.</seg>
<seg id="1170">Justice. Operations and Maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="1171">Total Department. Not Previously Authorized. $6,200,000.</seg>
<seg id="1172">Turn to page 6.</seg>
<seg id="1173">Department of Health. Operations and Maintenance. Not Previously Authorized.</seg>
<seg id="1174">Mr. Akeeagok, would you like to respond?</seg>
<seg id="1175">Hon. David Simailak (interpretation): It's not just a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1176">If it's okay with you, we'll move on to another department. I'm sure my officials will be available to answer questions. I would like to have my officials at the witness table make some changes before we go to questions. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1177">I was going to give you an opportunity, but if you would like to make a comment, it's okay.</seg>
<seg id="1178">Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the officials out.</seg>
<seg id="1179">Does the committee agree to bring in the witnesses?</seg>
<seg id="1180">Chairman (interpretation): Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the other witness out.</seg>
<seg id="1181">For the record, Mr. Akeeagok, please introduce your new witness.</seg>
<seg id="1182">To my left, Deputy Minister of Health, Colleen Stockley.</seg>
<seg id="1183">Operations and Maintenance. Not Previously Authorized. Total Directorate. $5.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Mr. Netser: My mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1185">That's my question.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1187">Are there any questions under Directorate?</seg>
<seg id="1188">I don't have too many questions, but when we're talking about elders "facilities in Nunavut, there are three facilities that will be funded under different programs.</seg>
<seg id="1189">A couple of days ago when I was asking about the pre-feasibility study in Igloolik and Gjoa Haven, they were looking at expanding the elders "facility.</seg>
<seg id="1190">At that time, the minister was not aware of the number of beds that would be required.</seg>
<seg id="1191">I'm just wondering if we could get an update as to where they're at with that.</seg>
<seg id="1192">Hon. David Simailak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1193">It's under the preplanning stage. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1194">What is the status of this preplanning study?</seg>
<seg id="1195">Hon. David Simailak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Through you, Mr. Chairman, I would like my Deputy Minister of Health to respond to that because he knows more about the capital projects.</seg>
<seg id="1196">The Department of Health has already prepared its capital plan for 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1197">I wonder if this can proceed with the expansion of the Igloolik health centre.</seg>
<seg id="1198">In keeping in mind that during the election, the government was probably going to have new responsibilities and the option of expanding Igloolik.</seg>
<seg id="1199">It's not going to be very far, but we're expecting that it will start again once we know the government's mandate.</seg>
<seg id="1200">In closing, when we're talking about the use of the government's resources, we have identified some deficiencies in our infrastructure and I would like to take this opportunity to emphasize the department's role with respect to the delivery of government-wide elder care programs.</seg>
<seg id="1201">I look forward to seeing progress being made in this area, especially with respect to the existing infrastructure that is currently being used in Nunavut, identifying different opportunities for new infrastructure for people on the waiting list.</seg>
<seg id="1202">That was more of a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1203">In regard to my colleague's question about the elders "homes.</seg>
<seg id="1204">I would be interested in hearing how that $900,000 is divided up.</seg>
<seg id="1205">I'm just wondering if the minister could give us an idea of which infrastructure that they're looking at.</seg>
<seg id="1206">The $900,000 is divided into three regions and $300,000 is for each of the three elders.</seg>
<seg id="1207">Mr. Ma: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1208">I'm just wondering if the minister could explain what process the Department of Health has in place to inform the public if they're in a deficit situation.</seg>
<seg id="1209">These three communities are operated by the government, not by the government.</seg>
<seg id="1210">If there's a need to increase or decrease, then the Department of Health and Social Services and other organizations are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1211">When they have to discuss these issues, they try to resolve them.</seg>
<seg id="1212">It's based on national and territorial standards.</seg>
<seg id="1213">In his opening comments, he indicated that "three new continuing care facilities, two-thirds of residential care, and three-year-old facilities require a number of factors."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I'm just wondering if that's something that they're anticipating in the next year or so. Are they projecting that they're going to continue to increase the operating costs or is there going to be a cap on that?</seg>
<seg id="1215">When the contract first started, three of them were dealt with by Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="1216">The Department of Health finally assumed the contract in April 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1217">As far as I'm aware, the Department of Health and Social Services is a little bit different than the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="1218">One of the recommendations that were made was the Food Mail Program.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When we looked at the contract, the elders "facilities were not able to meet the needs.</seg>
<seg id="1220">That's where we are at this time.</seg>
<seg id="1221">If I'm wrong, please stop me.</seg>
<seg id="1222">It's a dangerous situation.</seg>
<seg id="1223">I'm just wondering if there has been any discussion in the past about allocating funds for mental health services.</seg>
<seg id="1224">We're on general comments. We're talking about supplementary appropriations for operations and maintenance. We're not talking about actual costs.</seg>
<seg id="1225">I don't think it's appropriate for this Assembly or any other way.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Do you have any further questions, Ms. Towtongie?</seg>
<seg id="1227">Thank you for that clarification.</seg>
<seg id="1228">With respect to mental health contracts for 2017-18, $16.7 million, I believe it's $6.2 million. What is the status of that project?</seg>
<seg id="1229">That's my last question, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1230">Mr. Chairman, with respect to the $5.9 million that the member asked about, it is included in the $43.1 million.</seg>
<seg id="1231">The details of the $16 million and $10 million are there.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Perhaps Ms. Stockley can elaborate on the details of the $10 million.</seg>
<seg id="1233">That's very good news for Nunavummiut because they're asking for help.</seg>
<seg id="1234">The number of clients requiring treatment has increased.</seg>
<seg id="1235">I know that they have mental problems and addictions.</seg>
<seg id="1236">There are also costs outside of the Department of Health and Social Services that are covered by the Department of Justice and the Department of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Before we proceed to the Directorate, we will take a five-minute break.</seg>
<seg id="1238">&gt; &gt; Committee recessed at 18: 03 and resumed at 18: 10</seg>
<seg id="1239">I would like to call the committee meeting to order.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Total Health Care Service Delivery. $43,100,000.</seg>
<seg id="1241">On the out-of-territory care, you have identified a growing need for elder care.</seg>
<seg id="1242">We don't have a laboratory in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1243">That's good to hear.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Are they looking into this to make sure that we have a laboratory in Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="1245">It's part of the process, but it's not at the highest level.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Those are the types of things that we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1247">On the same page, out of territory-wide, the last paragraph, it says, "Finalize the Territorial Health Access Fund."</seg>
<seg id="1248">I almost woke up on the minister's notes that his department didn't include anything within the budget.</seg>
<seg id="1249">I'm just wondering if the department will be spending all of its money here.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Hon. David Simailak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On page 6, the first one is the $5.9 million that is not previously authorized.</seg>
<seg id="1251">We are requesting $5.9 million for the elders "group home.</seg>
<seg id="1252">My question was more directed to the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Perhaps through you if I make a mistake, the deputy minister can correct me.</seg>
<seg id="1254">I don't know what they're being used for, but I think that was the question that was posed by the member.</seg>
<seg id="1255">Hon. David Simailak (interpretation): Thank you for the clarification.</seg>
<seg id="1256">These funds haven't been spent within the department.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The remaining budget for the Department of Health is $49 million.</seg>
<seg id="1258">With respect to the letter that I just sent out today, it will be translated into Inuktitut and it will be translated today. It was sent in English on Friday and it's not included in the substantiation sheet.</seg>
<seg id="1259">That's a very small amount.</seg>
<seg id="1260">I'm glad that you mentioned the Schedule on duty travel, but I was trying to refer to a letter that I received from the minister on page 4.</seg>
<seg id="1261">I'm just wondering if they're looking at using that surplus.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The Department of Health has not done that.</seg>
<seg id="1263">The Department of Health and Social Services has not identified any surpluses.</seg>
<seg id="1264">On page 5 of the business plan, it indicates that health-related projects will require $49 million. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1265">The Department of Health doesn't have a regional breakdown.</seg>
<seg id="1266">I'm aware that in the Department of Health, there's a breakdown of the over-expenditures for the Nursing Recruitment and Retention Strategy, there's over $1 million left over in previous years.</seg>
<seg id="1267">Can the minister provide us with a list of all the programs that the Department of Health has in terms of surpluses?</seg>
<seg id="1268">I thank the minister for that information.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Mr. Akoak...</seg>
<seg id="1270">... Mr. Akeeagok, go ahead.</seg>
<seg id="1271">Hon. David Simailak (interpretation): Thank you for recognizing me.</seg>
<seg id="1272">We don't have that level of detail.</seg>
<seg id="1273">We can table it at a later date. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1274">If it's for elders "facilities, then it's for operations and maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="1275">In the second bullet, it indicates that "The current elders" facilities are operated through contract to non-profit Nunavut organizations.</seg>
<seg id="1276">I just want to say that this is a very good program for the people of Nunavut and organizations.</seg>
<seg id="1277">I'm hoping that contractors will be able to bid on many contracts.</seg>
<seg id="1278">I'll move on to a different topic. On the same page, the 24-hour elders "facility, it says that it's a 24-hour facility and it's a 24-hour facility.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The elders have to be governed under this legislation.</seg>
<seg id="1280">My question is: does the Department of Health have a minimum number of elders "facilities?</seg>
<seg id="1281">I responded to that question earlier.</seg>
<seg id="1282">They have received a new contract and they have increased the budget for the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="1283">If there is no compliance between the interpreters and the Department of Health, they meet with each other to make sure that they follow the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1284">Mr. Mire.</seg>
<seg id="1285">Can you clarify whether the elders "facilities are at the minimum level?</seg>
<seg id="1286">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1287">This is a new contract and we have increased it to $900,000.</seg>
<seg id="1288">The department's current business plan indicates that one of its priorities for the upcoming fiscal year is to "meet the needs of the three departments" and to "meet the needs of Nunavut's elders."</seg>
<seg id="1289">The minister indicated earlier that they're trying to keep up with the demand. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Mr. Netser: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1291">I'm angry now.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In regard to medical travel, they're requesting $50 million, and I have brought this up many times in the House about patients who are going to the hospital and they don't have an appointment, especially in my constituency, when they're going down to Winnipeg, they find that they don't have an appointment.</seg>
<seg id="1293">Does the Department of Health have a list of patients that were sent down to Winnipeg before they arrived and they were not informed about their appointments?</seg>
<seg id="1294">Hon. David Simailak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1295">The Minister of Health has committed to reviewing all medical travel clients who have not been seen or seen by patients.</seg>
<seg id="1296">That's one of the things that the government wants to look at.</seg>
<seg id="1297">The member has been asking questions about this and he has seen it. We would like to include that in our review.</seg>
<seg id="1298">I would like to thank the member for bringing this issue up and we can look into it together.</seg>
<seg id="1299">The review will be part of the review. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1300">Mr. Netser (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1301">At this time, $5.5 million was set aside for tuberculosis in Qikiqtarjuaq.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Has the government approached the Department of Health and Social Services or the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami to see if they can help us with the funding that we received from the federal government or has our government discussed this issue to see if they can pay for the cost of tuberculosis?</seg>
<seg id="1303">Hon. David Simailak: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1304">That is a very good question.</seg>
<seg id="1305">At this time, the federal government has announced that its 2018-19 main estimates will be included in the department's proposed capital estimates to address the issue of tuberculosis.</seg>
<seg id="1306">At this time, the advisory committee is comprised of representatives from Inuit communities, including the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="1307">At this time, I haven't seen any additional funding from the federal government, but as the Minister of Finance, I haven't seen any details.</seg>
<seg id="1308">I look forward to seeing the details. If Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami is doing a good job, they will have a good understanding.</seg>
<seg id="1309">That is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="1310">We will keep the minister informed as to what is happening.</seg>
<seg id="1311">I would like to ask another question in regard to medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="1312">It says here that there's no medical travel contract for foster parents.</seg>
<seg id="1313">Does the Department of Health understand why it's so expensive?</seg>
<seg id="1314">5.6 percent is expected to increase annually and what accounts for this increase?</seg>
<seg id="1315">Hon. David Simailak: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1316">With your permission, I would like my Deputy Minister, Mr. Stockley, to respond to that.</seg>
<seg id="1317">Medical travel and medivacs are increasing annually.</seg>
<seg id="1318">The number of patients travelling on medical travel is increasing and that's one of the good things that we have seen so far.</seg>
<seg id="1319">Tuberculosis is one of the most prevalent diseases in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1320">Let me use an example.</seg>
<seg id="1321">I think there were about 60 medevacs that had to be medevaced out in December.</seg>
<seg id="1322">We're always looking at the number of medevacs that are sent out every week.</seg>
<seg id="1323">The combination of medical travel and medivacs has increased.</seg>
<seg id="1324">Mr. Chairman, I'm not going to get into the details, but I'm trying to understand the reasons for the increase.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Are our population in Nunavut going to be healthy?</seg>
<seg id="1326">Can I get an update on this question?</seg>
<seg id="1327">I would like the deputy minister to respond to that.</seg>
<seg id="1328">It's unfortunate that we haven't been able to meet all of the national standards of health care, health care, food, and so on. There are a lot of overcrowding issues that cause health problems and we have made progress in that regard.</seg>
<seg id="1329">We've added some of those services to the Baffin Regional Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="1330">We try to reduce the cost of medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="1331">We are moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="1332">The other one is the telehealth system.</seg>
<seg id="1333">I'm sure you'll hear more about the budget when we're trying to get into operations and maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="1334">I thank the minister for that answer.</seg>
<seg id="1335">I look forward to reviewing the O M budget for this department.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In terms of mental health, it's $10.5 million and the other one is very encouraging.</seg>
<seg id="1337">In reviewing the substantiation sheets, it doesn't indicate what the reason is for the increase of $10.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="1338">I'm just wondering if the department has been given direction to increase the number of people with mental health problems.</seg>
<seg id="1339">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Both assessments and mental health assessments are done.</seg>
<seg id="1340">During the 4th Legislative Assembly, the issue of suicide was raised as an urgent priority.</seg>
<seg id="1341">When we're recruiting physicians, we're going to continue to provide services in our communities. We're going to continue to do that. We're going to continue to promote that.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The standing committee continues to encourage the minister to update the Legislative Assembly and the public on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="1343">My last question is in regard to mental health workers and mental health workers.</seg>
<seg id="1344">Hon. David Simailak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 64.</seg>
<seg id="1345">How does that change in the past?</seg>
<seg id="1346">We don't have that information in front of us, but if the member wants that information, we will certainly provide it to him.</seg>
<seg id="1347">I'll move on to something else.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In that statement, it says that "equipment and equipment will remain in the Department of Health" or will it be used for other communities? If it's too small, will it be in the communities?</seg>
<seg id="1349">Through you, I'll have Deputy Minister Stockley respond.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Will the property assessments be done through the capital estimates?</seg>
<seg id="1351">I am lost.</seg>
<seg id="1352">It's under capital estimates, so I would like to get clarification.</seg>
<seg id="1353">Through you, I'll have Deputy Minister Stockley respond.</seg>
<seg id="1354">These larger assets came from the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="1355">The funding that we received from the federal government, such as the furniture, the furniture, and so on, is used by the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Mrazek: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1357">My last question, I guess.</seg>
<seg id="1358">With the Department of Health's Nursing Recruitment and Retention Strategy, it says that you have agency nurses and contract nurses. Our department has been successful in reducing the services provided by agency nurses.</seg>
<seg id="1359">I would like to ask, in this year's expenditures over the past few years, what changes have been made to the funding formula for this program?</seg>
<seg id="1360">Hon. David Simailak: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1361">We're not using agency nurses instead of using agency nurses.</seg>
<seg id="1362">To date, we are using more agency nurses.</seg>
<seg id="1363">My final question.</seg>
<seg id="1364">If I get $8.6 million, I would appreciate it.</seg>
<seg id="1365">Broken down by fiscal year, for the 2017-18 fiscal year, there was a shortfall of $52.5 million for casual staffing, an overall budget of over $45.3 million overtime, overtime expenditures of $15.7 million, and agency nurses over $0.1 million, for a total of $8.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1366">I just have one question and I'll go through it clause by clause.</seg>
<seg id="1367">I don't have the details.</seg>
<seg id="1368">If there's an emergency in Sanikiluaq, if there's an emergency in the middle of the night, it's supposed to be overtime.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Hon. David Simailak: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1370">I know the minister answered today on what the department is doing to recruit nurses.</seg>
<seg id="1371">I will leave that one alone for now.</seg>
<seg id="1372">I would just like to say that when we're looking at the budget of the Department of Health, the staff, the doctors, the contract nurses, the mental health workers, and the travel costs are always ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="1373">The number for mental health and addictions has changed significantly from last year to $6.8 million. I believe it was $7.8 million last year.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Earlier in my Member's Statement on the budget process, the Minister of Finance indicated that they haven't made any changes at this time, but I believe that they have to make some changes because we always have to go back and get approval for supplementary appropriations.</seg>
<seg id="1375">I'm just wondering if the minister could give us an idea of how much of an over-expenditure that they're actually budgeting, if they're going to be able to come up with something that they're going to be spending instead of having to increase it.</seg>
<seg id="1376">That's just a comment, but I would like to hear from the minister on that.</seg>
<seg id="1377">I think that's exactly what we're looking at. I think it's something that's something that we're seriously looking at. I think it's been five years that we've been considering and we've had some discussions with some of the departments of Health and Social Services and Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1378">I'm very pleased that we're talking about the budget and I'm working closely with my colleagues on that.</seg>
<seg id="1379">Although I have answered some of the health related questions since I have been the Minister of Health, it has always been called the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="1380">I think that's something that we have to work on and we have to make sure that the budget is accurate and correct, and I'm sure it's going to be re-profiled without changing the budget process.</seg>
<seg id="1381">We can only make changes through the Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="1382">One of our colleagues at the Regular Members "Caucus made some very good observations.</seg>
<seg id="1383">I also feel that we have to work closely together as Members of the Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="1384">For 2017-18, we're facing some of the challenges that we're facing. I look forward to working with the Premier and the Members of this House to make sure that we're not in this House, even if we don't know how much money the department spent, we don't have to go back to our budget.</seg>
<seg id="1385">I just wanted to say that and thank you Mr. Chairman for giving me this opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="1386">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1387">I appreciate the minister recognizing the need for improvements.</seg>
<seg id="1388">I just wanted to reiterate, as the minister indicated, that the Department of Justice has been in regular meetings with our officials. The overtime, overtime, and everything else is going back and forth between the Department of Health and Social Services and the Department of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Again, I think that's something that should be recognized by the Minister of Human Resources.</seg>
<seg id="1390">As we move forward in developing our existing organizational structure, if we were to fill those positions, Mr. Maychruk talked about the challenges that the government faces in terms of staffing and staffing, we have to go back and look at how we can move forward with the government's positions where we have strengths and strengths.</seg>
<seg id="1391">In terms of overtime, I'm looking forward to finding out more about what the priorities are and what we're going to be expecting.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Just a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Mr. Mikkungwak, did you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1394">Mr. Mikkungwak: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1395">I just have one question in regard to mental health and contract services. In the fourth paragraph, it states that the Department of Justice will be paid for medical travel. Is that included in the $10.5 million?</seg>
<seg id="1396">I'll make it as brief as possible to the member.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Mr. Lysy, do you have any further questions?</seg>
<seg id="1398">My last question is to Mr. Ma and Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="1399">My last question is in regard to the hospital staffing of $8.6 million, which is a deficit. Just to clarify, you indicated $143 million to $151.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1400">Total Compensation and Benefits.</seg>
<seg id="1401">Hon. David Simailak: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Mr. Lyall: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1403">Is that $151 million 100 percent accurate?</seg>
<seg id="1404">The $25 million increase is for salaries.</seg>
<seg id="1405">I don't think the money was there 100 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1406">What we're trying to do is we're requesting $8.6 million under compensation and benefits.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Just recently, it listed a lot of things.</seg>
<seg id="1409">Moving on to the minister's opening comments on page 4, it talks about medical travel for $63.8 million for 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1410">I was wondering why the money was set aside for the 2016-17 fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="1411">Hon. David Simailak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I don't have that information in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1413">We're trying to deal with it in 2016-17, not under 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1414">I'll start off with 2016-17.</seg>
<seg id="1415">I was asking about the medical travel budget last year. What is the department going to be allocating for 2018-19?</seg>
<seg id="1416">Mr. Akeeagok doesn't have the figures for 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Hon. David Simailak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) I think it's early in May.</seg>
<seg id="1418">We have a voting budget for 2017-18. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1419">What I'm trying to say is that there's a problem within our fiscal framework and in regard to the minister's opening comments, there's a big difference between the main estimates and the main estimates.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Mr. Speaker, I don't want to see this Assembly continue to see supplementary appropriations every year.</seg>
<seg id="1421">I'm just wondering if that's the same process that the department used for O M.</seg>
<seg id="1422">That was just a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Chairman: Mr. Qirngnuq, do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1424">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1425">I have one more question on medical travel. I'll ask it in English so that I'll be able to understand it in English. It's the third bullet for April and April.</seg>
<seg id="1426">What he's referring to is the patients who have to be sent out for medical treatment. This has been increased for patients who have been sick for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1427">It's going up.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Mr. Mikkungwak, do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1429">I apologize, I thought you had your hand up.</seg>
<seg id="1430">We are on Health. Operations and Maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="1431">We are done with $43,100,000. If you go down to the bottom, Total Department. $49 million.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Not Previously Authorized.</seg>

<seg id="1442">Minister Akeeagok, do you have any closing comments?</seg>
<seg id="1443">Hon. David Simailak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) I appreciate the questions that were asked on the budget allocations for the upcoming fiscal year and the efforts of our staff to put together the best estimates that are in there.</seg>
<seg id="1444">We will be able to make changes to the budget.</seg>
<seg id="1445">Before we proceed to the next bill, we will move on to the next bill.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Thank you for your hard work and will now rise to report progress.</seg>
<seg id="1447">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the witness out.</seg>
<seg id="1449">Moving on, Bill 4.</seg>
<seg id="1450">Mr. Akeeagok, please proceed with your opening comments.</seg>

<seg id="1452">Hon. David Simailak: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1453">I am here to present Bill 4, Supplementary Appropriation (Capital) Act, No. 4, 2017-2018.</seg>

<seg id="1456">I would be pleased to take questions.</seg>
<seg id="1457">Do members have any general comments?</seg>
<seg id="1458">I would like to know why we need to do that.</seg>
<seg id="1459">Can the Department of Community and Government Services not find their own capital funding?</seg>
<seg id="1460">We're trying to be transparent and transparent.</seg>

<seg id="1520">As Speaker of the Legislative Assembly and Chairperson of the Order of Nunavut Advisory Council, I am extremely honoured to take this opportunity to announce this year’s recipients of the Order of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1521">On January 1, 2010, The Order of Nunavut Act came into force.</seg>
<seg id="1522">The objective of the order is to recognize individuals who have made outstanding contributions to the territory.</seg>
<seg id="1523">The order is the highest honour of Nunavut and takes precedence over all other orders, decorations, or medals conferred by the Government of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1524">As of today, a total of 15 individuals have received the Order of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1525">They have been recognized for their achievements and contributions in a variety of fields, including public service, the arts, education, language promotion, spiritual leadership, and economic development.</seg>
<seg id="1526">I am pleased to announce that two individuals have been chosen this year to receive the Order of Nunavut: Ms. Betty Brewster and Mr. Ludy Pudluk.</seg>
<seg id="1527">I am very glad that Mr. Pudluk is in the gallery right now.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Welcome, Mr. Pudluk.</seg>
<seg id="1529">As members will be very much aware, Betty Brewster is a renowned interpreter/translator whose career has spanned several decades.</seg>
<seg id="1530">In 2016 she was recognized by her peers for her lifetime of contributions to the profession with an Inuit Uqausinginnik Taiguusiliuqtiit Language Award.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Ludy Pudluk served as a Member of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories from 1975 to 1995.</seg>
<seg id="1532">During his many years of public service, Mr. Pudluk represented the communities of the High Arctic and was instrumental in the movement that led to the creation of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1533">I am pleased to announce that the investiture ceremony for Ms. Brewster and Mr. Pudluk will be held during the upcoming spring 2018 sitting of the Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="1534">The ceremony will be held here in the Chamber of the Legislative Assembly and will be televised live across the territory.</seg>

<seg id="1">Conspiracy-theorizing megachurch preacher visits Nunavut</seg>
<seg id="2">“The whole of the Arctic depends on what is happening here tonight”</seg>
<seg id="3">"Rodney Howard-Browne, an evangelical pastor from Florida, preaches in Iqaluit on Aug. 27."</seg>

<seg id="6">"A fundamentalist Christian evangelist known for conspiracy theories, climate change denial and marketing schemes brought his crusade to rid the world of the Antichrist to an Iqaluit church on Aug. 27."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Rodney Howard-Browne, a South African immigrant to the United States, told his congregation near Tampa Bay last year that those who rule the world worship Lucifer and drink the blood of human sacrifices."</seg>
<seg id="8">He preached for over an hour at an Iqaluit church to more than 100 people.</seg>
<seg id="9">But his message is not for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="10">“The whole of the Arctic depends on what is happening here tonight.</seg>
<seg id="11">"So if you want the fire [of the holy ghost], stand here [by the altar], otherwise you can leave."</seg>
<seg id="12">"The choice is yours,” Howard-Browne said at the end of the 2.5-hour event."</seg>
<seg id="13">About 50 people crowded the altar.</seg>
<seg id="14">“I didn’t fly thousands of miles to come play games here.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I didn’t come here to be liked either, and I didn’t come here for your approval. … Remember: When Jesus was raised from the dead, he had to ask people to leave the room.”"</seg>
<seg id="16">"The mostly Inuit audience included infants, youth and elders."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Inside the Christian Fellowship church in Iqaluit’s Road to Nowhere neighbourhood, kids ran around and played between the rows of folding chairs."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Outside, the church and mosque faced each other across a small parking lot, both overlooking Dead Dog Lake."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Howard-Browne’s sermon was part of an event organized by the Bill Prankard Evangelistic Association’s Arctic Hope Project, which is based in Ottawa."</seg>
<seg id="20">The association did not respond by Nunatsiaq News’ deadline to a request for comment.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The evangelist’s performance, number 119 on a tour of 300 one-night city stops he plans, began about one hour into the event."</seg>
<seg id="22">"First, a local Christian band opened the night followed by Iqaluit evangelist and singer Looee Arreak, who helped found the Christian Fellowship Church."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Eric Gonyon, an associate pastor with Howard-Browne’s Revival Ministries International, then held a 40-minute promotional session for his boss."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Looee Arreak, an Iqaluit evangelist and singer, performs before Rodney Howard-Browne speaks."</seg>
<seg id="25">(Image courtesy of Revival Ministries International)</seg>
<seg id="26">“God loves a generous giver”</seg>
<seg id="27">Gonyon asked the audience to provide their email address on registration cards and to follow Howard-Browne on Instagram.</seg>
<seg id="28">He gave out gift cards for Howard-Browne’s religious products.</seg>
<seg id="29">"And he plugged Howard-Browne’s upcoming book, Killing the Planet, which he said follows the history of corrupt economic institutions over the past 200 years."</seg>
<seg id="30">"“It’s really the spirit of the Antichrist, is what it comes down to,” Gonyon said."</seg>
<seg id="31">Gonyon then played an 18-minute promotional video of Howard-Browne’s evangelical career.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Towards the end of the video, Howard-Browne prayed that those who donate money to his ministry will get credit before God for the souls his ministry saves."</seg>
<seg id="33">"“God loves a generous giver,” Howard-Browne said in the video."</seg>
<seg id="34">Gonyon praised his boss when the video ended.</seg>
<seg id="35">"“One sows and one reaps and together we rejoice in the harvest, so that if you sow into this, whatever comes into this ministry’s account actually goes into your account."</seg>
<seg id="36">It’s really amazing.”</seg>
<seg id="37">"He then handed out offering envelopes and challenged people to do their “best gift for souls,” by either cash, cheque made out to RMI Canada, credit card or via smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="38">"“I always tell people, don’t let the biggest cheque you ever wrote be for a Sea-Doo or a new phone … let it be to revive the church and win souls."</seg>
<seg id="39">Amen?”</seg>
<seg id="40">Many people filled and sealed the envelopes and put them into blue plastic beach buckets passed around.</seg>
<seg id="41">Some looked at others and held the envelopes in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="42">One Inuk woman folded the empty envelope and put it in her purse.</seg>
<seg id="43">The call for donations comes in a city where poverty is widespread: Nearly half of Nunavut’s population relies on social assistance amidst long-standing crises in food security and housing.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Howard-Browne did not respond to an interview request from Nunatsiaq News, so how much money was raised is unknown."</seg>
<seg id="45">His net worth has been a closely kept secret but his website says he provides training sessions in 158 countries.</seg>
<seg id="46">It also says people who enrol in his Aircraft Donation Program will receive tax breaks.</seg>
<seg id="47">Gonyon told the audience to hold their offerings to Revival Ministries up in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="48">"“Father, we just thank you for this offering, and we thank you for representing souls, that whatever comes into our account goes to their account,” Gonyon said."</seg>
<seg id="49">Three one-foot-tall buckets of envelopes were collected.</seg>
<seg id="50">Rodney Howard-Browne preaches over a woman who he is about to lay hands on.</seg>
<seg id="51">Preacher counts Patterk Netser as a friend</seg>
<seg id="52">"Fundamentalist Christian evangelism already has deep roots in Nunavut, with followers in almost every community."</seg>
<seg id="53">"Bible conferences take place annually and, at least into the mid-2000s, were drawing bigger and bigger crowds."</seg>
<seg id="54">"One advocate and organizer of such conferences, Roger Armbruster, told Nunatsiaq News in 2004 that the conferences are powerful magnets for those whose lives have been torn apart by abuse and addictions."</seg>
<seg id="55">But Howard-Browne’s brand of capitalist and aggressive fundamental evangelism may be new to the territory.</seg>
<seg id="56">"Patterk Netser, a long-time defender of fundamentalist Christianity and current Nunavut minister of housing and Arctic College, is what Howard-Browne calls one of his “Eskimo friends” who tell him climate change is a hoax."</seg>
<seg id="57">"Netser declined an interview request by Nunatsiaq News but said, “Rodney is a friend of mine and we connect regularly.”"</seg>
<seg id="58">"When asked to respond to Howard-Browne’s many run-ins with the media, which includes saying a U.S. Supreme Court Justice should be shot for insulting the American Constitution, Netser said, “What goes on in the States is none of my business."</seg>
<seg id="59">My primary concerns are for my people and Nunavummiut.”</seg>

<seg id="61">“Tonight will be fire on ice”</seg>
<seg id="62">"One hour into the event, Howard-Browne—the main act—took to the altar."</seg>
<seg id="63">"“Tonight will be fire on ice,” the evangelist said to over 100 people, mostly Inuit, of all ages."</seg>
<seg id="64">"“If you don’t want the fire, you better make a run for the door now while you can.”"</seg>
<seg id="65">"Over the next hour, Howard-Browne’s voice rose and fell rhythmically."</seg>
<seg id="66">He paused for effect and shouted for emphasis at times. And he told jokes.</seg>
<seg id="67">"“I know I don’t look like I’m African, but it’s only because my parents kept me in the house most of the time, they never let me outside,” he said to scattered laughter."</seg>
<seg id="68">“Moses was the first one to use a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="69">He broke the first one and had to go out and get another one.</seg>
<seg id="70">And Adam and Eve were the first ones to use an Apple product.”</seg>
<seg id="71">"Howard-Browne rose to fame, in large part, for his laughing revival meetings where worshippers were seized with laughter for minutes at a time."</seg>
<seg id="72">"His granddaughter was visited by the Holy Ghost when she was two years old, laughing for 12 minutes straight, Howard-Browne said."</seg>
<seg id="73">Howard-Browne has been criticized by many in the international evangelical community.</seg>
<seg id="74">He has been called a false teacher who substitutes Christian teachings with frenzied laughter and hysterical emotionalism. Howard-Browne has responded to that criticism by saying those who insult him are insulting the Holy Ghost and are therefore bound for hell.</seg>
<seg id="75">"Arreak, the Iqaluit evangelist and singer who helped open the event, was the only member of the audience to be gripped by laughter during the sermon."</seg>
<seg id="76">"“This is not a funeral, why are people sad?”"</seg>
<seg id="77">Howard-Browne said.</seg>
<seg id="78">Arreak laughed.</seg>
<seg id="79">“We are serving Jesus and he is alive.”</seg>
<seg id="80">Arreak laughed loudly.</seg>
<seg id="81">"“I like this pastor,” he said to Arreak, whose sustained laughter grew even louder."</seg>
<seg id="82">Howard-Browne laughed with her as others in the audience laughed softly.</seg>
<seg id="83">“Such joy.</seg>
<seg id="84">"With joy shall you draw forth water, out of the wells of salvation.”"</seg>
<seg id="85">Arreak’s laughter hit a shrill pitch and echoed off the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="86">“This is legal.</seg>
<seg id="87">Nobody’s going to be arrested tonight.”</seg>
<seg id="88">"Arreak, who told Nunatsiaq News she refused to speak to media, whooped with more laughter."</seg>
<seg id="89">"Howard-Browne also spoke in tongues, which he claimed was once understood in the obscure native dialect of a Papua New Guinea pastor."</seg>
<seg id="90">“Man-gah-no-ra-pa-ta.</seg>
<seg id="91">"Ran-bum-go-pah-tah,” he said."</seg>
<seg id="92">Rodney Howard-Browne calls the audience around the altar to receive the fire of the Holy Ghost.</seg>
<seg id="93">Not all laughs</seg>
<seg id="94">But not everyone found Howard-Browne’s sermon captivating or funny.</seg>
<seg id="95">He lashed out at those who tried to leave before the end of his sermon.</seg>
<seg id="96">"Before he lay hands on a few audience members, Howard-Browne harangued two people as they left."</seg>
<seg id="97">“Where are you going brother?</seg>
<seg id="98">Hey.</seg>
<seg id="99">Hey!</seg>
<seg id="100">You leaving?”</seg>
<seg id="101">Howard-Browne said to one man as he quietly left the church.</seg>
<seg id="102">"“You come in here, you were filming with your phone and then you leave?"</seg>
<seg id="103">Are you the reporter for the daily newspaper here?”</seg>
<seg id="104">The audience laughed.</seg>
<seg id="105">"“I wonder what he would do if I would run and grab him and bring him back in…. Find out who he is and why he’s filming and why he left,” he said to one of his staff."</seg>
<seg id="106">"As he called the audience to the altar at the end of his sermon, Howard-Browne seized on two women sitting in the second row because he didn’t like the looks on their faces."</seg>
<seg id="107">“Are you guys born again?</seg>
<seg id="108">"What are you, Jehovah Witnesses?”"</seg>
<seg id="109">The audience laughed.</seg>
<seg id="110">“I’ve never seen people so indifferent sitting in the second row.</seg>
<seg id="111">"So you can either jump in with the rest, or you may be better than everybody else.”"</seg>
<seg id="112">The two women stood up and began walking out of the church.</seg>
<seg id="113">“I’m just asking a question.</seg>
<seg id="114">"I do this, you know, this is my job."</seg>
<seg id="115">I know what body language is.</seg>
<seg id="116">Don’t scoff at me.</seg>
<seg id="117">It’s not a joke.</seg>
<seg id="118">The whole of the Arctic depends on what is happening here tonight.”</seg>
<seg id="119">Event staff told the audience not to take pictures or recordings.</seg>
<seg id="120">"Meanwhile, they photographed the entire event."</seg>
<seg id="121">That included running up to people who were sobbing as Howard-Browne laid hands on them and taking close-up pictures.</seg>
<seg id="122">"A photo album on Revival Ministries International’s website shows pictures of nameless audience members at their most vulnerable—pained facial expressions, eyes closed, mouths wide open, or collapsing to the floor."</seg>
<seg id="123">A woman on whom Howard-Browne just laid hands lies crying on the floor beneath a thin blanket.</seg>
<seg id="124">"In front of her, Howard-Browne and his staff advance to lay hands on an Inuit couple."</seg>
<seg id="125">Event originally scheduled for St. Jude’s</seg>
<seg id="126">"The event was originally scheduled to be held at St. Jude’s Anglican Cathedral in Iqaluit, but was changed at the last minute."</seg>
<seg id="127">"That change came from those who invited Howard-Browne, a receptionist at St. Jude’s said."</seg>
<seg id="128">"David Parks, the Anglican priest of the Arctic, said that he didn't know that Mr. Hawker-Brown was going to be acting in St. Jude."</seg>
<seg id="129">"If he knew, he said he would have resigned because he said that he was going to do so much."</seg>
<seg id="130">"As a result, the Anglican Diocese did not meet the requirements for approval for the Bishop's event, Ms. Powers says.</seg>
<seg id="131">"The Anglican Church deals with something that knows respects, and deals with other churches, Passon says."</seg>
<seg id="132">"There's no" but there's respect for each other, and there's no way that you're doing things that don't care about religion and the churches. "</seg>
<seg id="133">It's a different project.</seg>
<seg id="134">"I'm not here to live up to the beliefs that they want.</seg>
<seg id="135">"If religion were to be held in the winter, what would happen in the north," it says attendance.</seg>
<seg id="136">"I don't come to the invitation.</seg>
<seg id="137">"If you have a good light, you have to be welcomed."</seg>

<seg id="7">"Before the Canada Election started, the Liberal Government, without a presence, initiated a long awaited northern and northern policy framework on September 10."</seg>
<seg id="8">"This document, introduced the first phase of the event, will replace the Prime Minister Stephen Harper's 2009 Northern Strategy and the Government of Canada's 2010 Northern Strategy.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is designed to guide the Government of Canada's policy up to 2030 but there is no implementation plan or political direction for future action.</seg>
<seg id="10">"These projects in the second phase of the project, action plans state"</seg>
<seg id="11">"Despite this, this initiative from Caroline Prentice, the Minister responsible for Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, indicated that this policy document has been produced" major changes to the federal government. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The tabling of this policy has been delayed as expected.</seg>
<seg id="13">"This winter, Patrick announced that this policy would be introduced in June."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CBC news release earlier this month indicated that a news release was scheduled to be issued in $ellowknife in August.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The Liberal Government's eight" goals "include" action plans, "and 10 (10)" Framework. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"It talks about a number of policies, including community and regional economic development, infrastructure, aboriginal rights, environmental protection, Canadian lawyers and wildlife policies."</seg>
<seg id="17">"The Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, on December 20, 2016 announced that the Government of Nunavut would be developing a new policy, which stated, and I quote," in consultation with the northern governments and aboriginal organizations. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"As a result, over 25 aboriginal groups, including the Government of Nunavut, the Northwest Territories, the Northwest Territories, the Northwest Territories, Manitoba, Quebec, and Newfoundland, participated in the decision making."</seg>
<seg id="19">"In co-operation with Canada's North and the Northern Policy Strategy, our partners assisted us in identifying and promoting non-existent rights and practices in various regions, responsibilities and residency rights across the north, she stated in her news release.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Some of the partners also wrote their actions, which have been developed in a separate manual document."</seg>
<seg id="21">Some comments do not refer to the Federal Government policy.</seg>
<seg id="22">"For example, the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the Government of Nunavut, the Government of the Northwest Territories and the three territorial governments have jointly provided their own language services."</seg>
<seg id="23">But there is some activity.</seg>
<seg id="24">These letters that have been given to the parties may not be able to represent the Federal Government policy.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is an indication that the federal government may be in a conflict of interest agreement with more than 31 partners.</seg>
<seg id="26">"While this action document is part of the process, it is not clear what the views are from the federal government or other partners," the action document states.</seg>
<seg id="27">The document also indicated that the approval process was difficult.</seg>
<seg id="28">"The theme, goals and objectives of the meeting reflects many ideas and ideas."</seg>
<seg id="29">What this means is that there was an agreement between the federal government and Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada. "</seg>
<seg id="30">I'm just wondering if you can find a solid waste management policy here because I see it here.</seg>
<seg id="31">8 objectives</seg>
<seg id="32">"There are eight goals of action, which demonstrates federal commitments."</seg>
<seg id="33">"A strong, sustainable, diversified and sustainable economy."</seg>
<seg id="34">Canada's North and the Arctic indigenous people can continue to apply and be healthy.</seg>
<seg id="35">In Canada's Arctic and the Arctic people live in a safe and secure environment.</seg>
<seg id="36">A stronger business environment than the rest of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="37">The Acts are based on northern experiences and opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="38">Knowledge and understanding strategies for decision making.</seg>
<seg id="39">I live in Canada's Arctic and the northern economy is healthy and sustainable.</seg>
<seg id="40">Achieving solutions is a step towards continuing and respecting aboriginal and non-aboriginal peoples.</seg>
<seg id="41">These goals begin with a variety of "initiatives" that have been identified.</seg>
<seg id="42">Ten major principles</seg>
<seg id="43">"These goals and objectives, policies which outline the principles under which they are designed to" continue to be guided by the implementation of the program. "</seg>
<seg id="44">"The decisions on the north will be made in co-operation and involving northern residents, the rights and the needs of northern businesses."</seg>
<seg id="45">"The rights and positions of federal, provincial, aboriginal and municipal governments will be respected."</seg>

<seg id="6">Cambridge Bay-GN agrees with the new polar bear management plan.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was a news release from the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board members at the Kitikmeot Wildlife Management Board meeting in Cambridge Bay last week.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The initial start of this new polar bear management plan is the TAH for male and female polar bear populations in Nunavut, which is the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board's chair, Mr. Dan Shewchuk, spoke to the delegates."</seg>
<seg id="9">"The meeting in Cambridge Bay is the first of three regional wildlife board meetings to take place and Jason Akeeagok, who is the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board's manager, to attend."</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Akeeagok stated that the polar bear management plan was "much work done."</seg>
<seg id="11">"We're going to do what we can to make sure that this is done before the hunting season is over."</seg>
<seg id="12">"This plan has been considered for nearly five years, and it has been announced that it will be developing a plan in March for the Iqaluit Wildlife Management Board."</seg>
<seg id="13">The plan is up to 2029.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a young woman who is watching the ocean near Arctic Bay.</seg>
<seg id="15">"In this new polar bear management plan, the polar bear threatening kills in three communities will reduce their voices."</seg>
<seg id="16">(x-rays)</seg>
<seg id="17">"In all circumpolar countries in 19 countries, polar bears, 12 times more than Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="18">Polar bear quotas have been established by region (e.g. male polar bears and the harvesting of polar bears have been included in the total allowable harvest for each community.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Although this new plan does not increase the total allowable harvest at this time, a new total allowable harvest may be considered as a result of the new quota system."</seg>
<seg id="20">"In the previous plan, Nunavut communities were allowed to harvest one female polar bear with two tags harvested through the annual polar bear tag system."</seg>
<seg id="21">"This was done only here in the Baffin Bay polar bear population, where the same number of females and males can be harvested.</seg>
<seg id="22">At least half of the tags would be issued.</seg>
<seg id="23">This new polar bear quota can be harvested if it is required.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The increase in polar bear populations has been a concern for Nunavut residents with the passing of two polar bears last fall in the Kivalliq region. However, under the current management plan, the protection of the polar bear, if this is a female, then there would be two tags used."</seg>
<seg id="25">Therefore some of the communities do not have any tags to protect the polar bears.</seg>
<seg id="26">"This new plan allows communities to reduce polar bear exports, as Mr. Shewchuk stated in Nunatsiaq News.</seg>
<seg id="27">"However, in the past he stated that polar bears are threatening the Inuit way of life and life, because they are destroying the cabins, the ears and seals."</seg>
<seg id="28">The delegates from Cambridge Bay welcomed the changes to the polar bear management plan.</seg>
<seg id="29">The community was also pleased that there will be five more posters for grizzly bears.</seg>
<seg id="30">There was a big mass that happened in August and it was shot and it's too close to the cabins here in Mittimatalik.</seg>
<seg id="31">"In other words, for the new polar bear management plan there may be other considerations."</seg>
<seg id="32">"The future of polar bears is unclear because of climate change, through the end of the 2018 report of the Special Committee on the States of Endangered Species in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="33">It means that polar bears are at risk and that they should be lost.</seg>

<seg id="2">"This is a tremendous commitment."</seg>

<seg id="4">Three federal candidates announced that they would be stopping Nunavut's coffers from purchasing our electricity by 2030.</seg>

<seg id="6">Wayne Taparti</seg>
<seg id="7">"During this federal election, three federal counterparts announced that Nunavut's use of December's diesel fuel will stop until 2030."</seg>
<seg id="8">"At present, all 25 communities in Nunavut currently have diesel generators that are operated by the Qulliq Energy Corporation, except the Power Corporation of Canada that does not only have an electrical generator in their community."</seg>
<seg id="9">Change of this nature would be significant and costly.</seg>
<seg id="10">"A much-needed commitment" is Martha Lloyd, Northern Recycling Program Officer for the World Wildlife Fund.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It might be possible, just to do a little bit more."</seg>
<seg id="12">Mr. Green's campaign promise is to "Implement renewable energy sources."</seg>
<seg id="13">"By 2030, all of Canada's renewable energy resources will be in place."</seg>
<seg id="14">This includes smaller communities such as Jet A-1 fuel distribution. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"The Liberal Government indicated that it would, and I quote," move forward with funding to ensure that residents of the communities are removed from petroleum products until such time as they are able to take advantage of clean, renewable energy sources like hydro, wind, and solar power after 2030. "</seg>
<seg id="16">The New Deloitte Touche "said, and I quote," aimed at providing Canada's alternative energy sources from non-renewable energy following the arrival of 2030... "This non-renewable energy is a community-based solution and creates job opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We will assist in applying for projects such as community-owned and controlled energy projects that will allow residents and qualified residents, and work with aboriginal and circumpolar communities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Through the Department of Environment and Climate Change Canada reports released earlier this year, Nunavut has less than 1 percent of this change.</seg>
<seg id="19">"In 2017, Nunavut was created with a total of 0.6 cents per litre of greenhouse gas emissions (carbon-diesel), such as 18,000 vehicles."</seg>
<seg id="20">"At the same time this year, Alberta, which is one of Canada's largest greenhouse gas emissions, was published here in Nunavut, which represents over 84 million vehicles."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Although that's the case, Nunavut has seen that greenhouse gas emissions have increased by 30 percent since 2005, the largest increase in Canada and Alberta has almost doubled, and this is the second increase in that same area."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Despite changing energy efficiency, these three lawyers are trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which would have an impact on Canada's greenhouse gas emissions."</seg>
<seg id="23">The communities have this equipment.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Nunavummiut pay the highest rate of electricity in every other jurisdiction in Canada, and the funding for energy will reduce this rate."</seg>
<seg id="25">"However, action on renewable energy projects may not only result in a balance between expenditures incurred by existing utilities."</seg>
<seg id="26">"Last month, the World Wildlife Board released a report which talks about how energy can be used in all 25 Nunavut communities."</seg>
<seg id="27">"It was noted that a reduction of 8 percent is primarily due to risk projects or other sources of revenue - Baker Lake, Coral Harbour, Iqaluit, and Rankin Inlet would result in savings if they moved 20 percent of the department's recycling program, including an immediate payment of approximately 15 years."</seg>
<seg id="28">The study also indicated that 16 other communities have subsidized 4 percent of the Qulliq Energy Corporation's borrowing limits - and that approximately $2 million could be used for subsidies and 20 percent of the cost of moving it.</seg>
<seg id="29">"However, the report only talks about the feasibility of these projects, simply deciding that moving more energy-efficient technology could be cheaper than current power rates."</seg>
<seg id="30">However, moving from community capacity to renewable and energy-related projects would be a significant undertaking.</seg>
<seg id="31">"It would require consultation, and it would have to start next year to meet the energy needs of all communities."</seg>
<seg id="32">"They would have to go to the communities, work with them on what they would like to do, and how the communities envision energy, to find out what their priorities would be and what their priorities are in regards to camping and hunting."</seg>
<seg id="33">"This does not include the development of such technologies as solar or wind power, which could be undertaken over a two-year period to collect, or projects undertaken by the Qulliq Energy Corporation to determine the feasibility of recycling of renewable energy."</seg>
<seg id="34">"The transfer of 100 percent of the community's renewable energy resources, while ensuring that the three lawyers who are trying to become lawyers will not only work on a long-term basis but will require significant investment."</seg>
<seg id="35">"In the case of New Brunswick and the Liberal Government, they haven't informed us how much money they would be giving to the transfer, but the Green Shield fans said last week.</seg>
<seg id="36">"As part of the campaign activity report, Mr. Green announced that he would be providing $150 million over the next five years for the decentralization of all the outpost camps and other northern communities, not just Nunavut-Deming Oil and Gas."</seg>
<seg id="37">It's not right.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Mr. Romanow indicated that if a community like Arctic Bay were to transfer or at least 60 percent of its energy infrastructure, operating costs would be about $27.8 million."</seg>
<seg id="39">"In this same report, for other communities such as 60 percent of the use of renewable energy, they would have to use a higher level."</seg>
<seg id="40">"In Iqaluit, the idea is that it would cost approximately $148 million."</seg>
<seg id="41">"Although it's clear that it's smaller than the $250 million to $500 million power rates that were considered by the city, this would apply to one community, Mr. Green's request."</seg>
<seg id="42">"Let's not expect the Federal Government to fully pay for these projects, but they also said that they would work on it and how it would be done and it would be very difficult."</seg>
<seg id="43">"Looking at the 2030 limit, it's not going to take too much time."</seg>
<seg id="44">"For solar power, I think it would be a two-year project."</seg>
<seg id="45">"For wind energy, it is anticipated that it will be a five to seven-year project," it states that it will be asked how much energy will be involved. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Looking at the deadlines and breaking them down by 25 communities and if they're going to be treated at the same time, the land is not always available.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" I think it's going to make a big difference.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Even if we don't reach 100 percent, there is a lot of interest."</seg>
<seg id="49">"Please note that this book refers to the federal candidates" essays: Roy Green, Ambassador Patsy and New Brunswick Debite. "</seg>
<seg id="50">"When this book was developed, the airlines still haven't made an announcement as to what they were running for, so they are not included in this report."</seg>

<seg id="2">We must recognize the importance of early childhood and child care workers in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Melanie Williamson, Chairperson of the Footprints Day Board, is seeking additional support from the Government of Nunavut for quality early childhood education and early childhood programs based on Inuit language and culture."</seg>
<seg id="4">Nunatsiaq News</seg>
<seg id="5">Correspondence to the Premier of Nunavut Joe Savikataaq and the Minister of Education, David Joanasie, and Minister of Education</seg>
<seg id="6">I am one of the people who are part of the Inuit traditional language and culture.</seg>
<seg id="7">"As the Chairperson of the Board of Directors of Tukivik, the only Inuktitut language school for early childhood education in Iqaluit and this is the only one in Iqaluit that provides daycare services to Nunavut children who already speak Inuktitut."</seg>
<seg id="8">"The Footprints Enterprises closed from August 21 to September 12, 2019 due to a lack of staff and as well, they have been operating with a shortage of staff for almost a year."</seg>
<seg id="9">"There are not very many applicants at the Foot High School (Iqaluit) with the highest rate of child care expenses, employees who do not have income support, who do not have housing because they are seen as having the highest rate of women working in the daycare as they are seen."</seg>
<seg id="10">"The day-care centre is open again, but it's a very urgent function; we lost our staff and a very good staff member who resigned."</seg>
<seg id="11">"We now have one full-time position, full-time child care worker, two full-time child care worker, and each of the parents work at the daycares on a case-by-case basis to determine whether or not every child has been charged with a full-time job, a full-time job, a certified position."</seg>
<seg id="12">"This process is not always normal, but as parents, we believe that our children should be safe and speak Inuktitut in order to keep the interview process open."</seg>
<seg id="13">It's still at risk to close it down.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Nunavut's day-care system can't make any money at this time because the daycare staff are expected to receive one of the most important child-related services for early childhood education, based on Inuit culture and language, despite the low cost of living and lack of support."</seg>
<seg id="15">The non-profit organizations rely on a wide variety of sources of funding each year, as well as a number of volunteers who run the day-care program.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The daycare workers are having a hard time getting paid and they don't have any benefits, they are not properly trained for their jobs and they are not provided housing for the staff."</seg>
<seg id="17">Daycare staff have now been asked to work under the requirements of their own financial or family maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="18">It's been very difficult for our daycares because of the unique needs of our staff to have the knowledge and skills to promote and preserve the Inuit language and culture of our children; Footprints hired only in Inuktitut.</seg>
<seg id="19">We have 100 percent Inuit employment.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, our staff turnover rate continues to be a challenge. We are faced with staffing shortages due to lack of competitiveness and benefits.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Whereas, it affects early childhood education and early childhood education."</seg>
<seg id="22">The Inuit have to be supported in this area and they should be able to teach our language and culture to our children.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Government of Nunavut should consider how they can better assist them in providing quality early childhood education and childcare facilities that are based on Inuit language and culture.</seg>
<seg id="24">"A valuable early childhood and childcare workers are paid to compete in public and social assistance, including housing, vacation, and education programs."</seg>
<seg id="25">Footprints' vision to expand the daycare facility to meet the needs of the public and provide more programs so that more Inuit children can be placed.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We're currently looking for a bigger daycare facility so that we can proceed with our vision and that's why we have raised approximately $80,000 for a new facility."</seg>
<seg id="27">The proposed amendments to the Government of Nunavut:</seg>
<seg id="28">"Combining early childhood and child care workers into the public service as part of the Government of Nunavut's collective agreement with the Government of Nunavut's Payroll Tax, based on the Government of Nunavut's 8 categories, which are used by employees of the Nunavut school system;</seg>
<seg id="29">into account the operations and maintenance costs of day-care facilities in Nunavut within the education system;</seg>
<seg id="30">"Provide benefits for early childhood and child care workers but not limited to short term measures including long-term sick leave, vacation, bilingual bonus, parental leave and housing."</seg>
<seg id="31">establish a society to support all daycares in Nunavut;</seg>
<seg id="32">In partnership with daycares, as soon as possible, to address some of the critical challenges we face, we will work together to develop a long-term strategy for the delivery of child care programs.</seg>
<seg id="33">We must recognize the value of early childhood and child care workers in Nunavut are valuable to the staff.</seg>
<seg id="34">We want to make sure that our daycares are fully staffed and that all staff are on income support.</seg>
<seg id="35">Since then we have to keep our daycares open.</seg>
<seg id="36">"The operations of the childcare system will be changed to ensure that Nunavut's early childhood and child care workers will be able to focus on their careers and will be able to move forward with early childhood education and childcare programs in order to achieve the best possible quality of life for children, including the ability to learn Inuktitut, build a strong foundation for Inuit culture, and participate fully in Canada."</seg>

<seg id="2">Responsibility</seg>
<seg id="3">"The operators who visit the Qikiqtani communities of Nunavut will now have to pay for tourism fees if they have access to the land, QIA announced its annual general meeting in Iqaluit from October 8 to 10."</seg>
<seg id="4">"The tourism operators are now required to pay for Inuit owned lands in the Qikiqtani region, where the Qikiqtani Inuit Association announced its annual general meeting in Iqaluit on Wednesday, October 9."</seg>
<seg id="5">The Qikiqtani region has the largest number of cruise ships visiting all of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Pond Inlet received 17 cruise ship passengers this summer, and Iqaluit was visited by four."</seg>
<seg id="7">"The Qikiqtani Inuit Association has been concerned about the increasing number of tourism activities in our territory, especially in the area of Inuit cruise ships."</seg>
<seg id="8">"The Qikiqtani Inuit Association established a tourism co-ordinator's compensation program to assist people in the communities affected by the cruise ship."</seg>
<seg id="9">A news release was issued by the Qikiqtani Inuit Association on the land use and renewable resources department announced new expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="10">New expenditures include:</seg>
<seg id="11">Aircraft in the Inuit home: $150</seg>
<seg id="12">Aircraft aircraft landing on Inuit lands: $100</seg>
<seg id="13">Inuit Circumpolar Conferences: $50 per day</seg>
<seg id="14">$25.00 in commercial services</seg>
<seg id="15">"Combined payments to hunters and trappers organizations will be the closest to tourism stakeholders available, the news release indicated that."</seg>
<seg id="16">The other one would go to Qikiqtani Inuit Association.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The cruise ship passengers that travel to Nunavut are approximately 150 to 400 people, Rosemary Despite, who is the President of the Qikiqtani Inuit Association's Lands and Resiliency Council."</seg>
<seg id="18">This $25-day fee would be for all passengers travelling to the communities if they're going to be going to their own communities or IOL.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Regardless of how many people are on cruise ship land, they would be charged according to the number of passengers on the ship."</seg>
<seg id="20">Debora said that the ships that transport passengers to the Belcher Islands will have to send them to Qikiqtani Inuit Association as to how many people will be flying every month or before they start boating.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If the ship delivers 350 people, we would charge 25 dollars per day per person."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Then the larger passengers would have to pay between $10,000 and $20,000 to land in their own community."</seg>
<seg id="23">"In many communities where cruise ships come in during the summer, as an example of Pond Inlet, the HTO would receive approximately $50,000 to $70,000.</seg>
<seg id="24">New funding will also assist the Qikiqtani Inuit Association with the use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="25">"As such, tourism operators will be informed of new costs when applying for access to Inuit owned lands."</seg>
<seg id="26">Debora said that the Qikiqtani Inuit Association set their rate according to other organizations that they pay for tourism.</seg>
<seg id="27">"For example, the Parks Canada pays 25 dollars per person to go to a national park."</seg>
<seg id="28">"Also the hamlets charge people to transport ships and tourism operators to their communities, Debora also states."</seg>
<seg id="29">"The cruise ships that transport passengers to their communities are charged for this but if people are actually going to our community," it says.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Joe Atagutaluk, QIA's Chief Financial Officer, asked if it would be possible to increase those costs in the future."</seg>
<seg id="31">"Terry said that it would be changed, but it would have to be discussed and established by the Qikiqtani Inuit Association."</seg>
<seg id="32">"This is an exciting event.</seg>

<seg id="9">"It is concerned that Baffinland's long-term plan to expand this project on page 2 of the department's business plan indicates that" Before the permits were approved, Baffinland issued two major ten-plexes that could be shipped to Prince Edward Island this summer. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"They also brought in two smaller buildings that could be built and large-scale vehicles that could be used when they were constructing, such as access roads and solar panels."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Baffinland, in November of 2018 indicated that the permits and co-operation of the Qikiqtani Inuit Association would be brought in, such as the records of the public signed by the Nunavut Impact Review Board and the Nunavut Water Board."</seg>

<seg id="14">When the people of Pond Inlet saw the ship near our community that was the first time that they had heard about the barge, there were two ships that transported the highway and they came in shortly and there were more ships that were going to be shipped in the summer of 2020.</seg>

<seg id="26">This project cannot be formally approved by the federal government until the final announcement of the Nunavut Impact Review Board was made on November 2 in Iqaluit and concluded on November 8 and 9 in Pond Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="27">"The Nunavut Impact Review Board, not consulted with stakeholders on this issue, indicated that they would be bringing in long-term vehicles that have been sent to Newfoundland on July 25."</seg>
<seg id="28">"The Nunavut Impact Review Board advised the companies that if this project is not approved, Baffinland would assume responsibility for the shipping, it may cost millions of dollars, out of the mineral exploration."</seg>
<seg id="29">It also indicated that the sealift schedule would not impact the Nunavut Impact Review Board's decision on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="30">"In his e-mail on October 17th, the Nunavut Impact Review Board's Director, Mr. Brian Ferris, indicated that legally the Nunavut Impact Review Board may approve or reject the sealift activities."</seg>

<seg id="35">"As a result of each unit, its families who have already been damaged from the contaminated site and the contaminated site, they are approximately at the 10-foot floor - maybe higher than the houses built in the Eastern Arctic."</seg>
<seg id="36">But Baffinland has not been approved to use them yet.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Faunaland will identify these items as" working on two-thirds of the project "but this project's two-year proposal will be considered at the end of its term. The company wrote a letter to the Nunavut Impact Review Board.</seg>
<seg id="38">Equipment shelters in Inuit owned lands</seg>
<seg id="39">"Based on the joint submissions made by the license holders, QIA and Baffinland wrote a letter stating that the equipment would be located in Inuit owned lands, as per the Qikiqtani Inuit Association's Development Partnership Agreement with the company."</seg>
<seg id="40">"In regards to Mr. Arreak and so on, what is being done is it seems like Baffinland has already approved the project."</seg>
<seg id="41">"Pond Inlet residents are unhappy.</seg>
<seg id="42">Is Newfoundland thinking that we don't know when the Nunavut Impact Review Board or the government will be approving the project?</seg>
<seg id="43">"I don't know."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Rosemary Dean, Technical Advisor of the Hamlet of Pond Inlet, was accepted by the Mayor of Pond Inlet, Joshua Star, who was able to speak to Nunatsiaq News on behalf of the Hamlet of Pond Inlet."</seg>
<seg id="45">"Fauna has been working to determine the approval of the project in phase 2," Denise said online.</seg>
<seg id="46">"If the Nunavut Impact Review Board or the Nunavut Impact Review Board had the authority to do so, the final impact will be on the decision-making process for the Nunavut Impact Review Board in relation to the management and approval of the proposal."</seg>
<seg id="47">"This is a concern," Dennis said he was representing the Hamlet.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Activities in this area, the Hamlet feels that this should not happen."</seg>
<seg id="49">"This has been an issue that has been dealt with in the financial and mental minds of Baffinland to approve the project on the 2nd," as well.</seg>
<seg id="50">"Our main concern is the wildlife, marine mammals and their destinations."</seg>
<seg id="51">We would be the most impacted in our community.</seg>
<seg id="52">That is our concern.</seg>
<seg id="53">"The money will not recover from wildlife", Mr. Joshua Arreak stated on behalf of the hunters and trappers organizations, saying that it has been an ongoing discussion in Pond Inlet for several years in regards to the marine transportation strategy for Baffinland.</seg>
<seg id="54">"In regards to non-governmental organizations such as Earth's North, they wanted to have an opportunity to hold a meeting with Baffinland's expansion plan, which indicated that they supported" responsible development "at the Mary River mine.</seg>
<seg id="55">"However, it also indicated that Baffinland's shipping system has not been able to take into account the major environmental impacts, and is satisfied that Baffinland's decision to ship large-scale balms from Baffinland to Arctic Bay, which was successful in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="56">"It is no secret that residents are dissatisfied with the volume of carry-outs of heavy equipment on the Mary River site prior to the legal approval of this expansion," it states that Chris Pickell, the Deputy Minister of Justice and the Department of Justice are responsible for the Arctic. "</seg>
<seg id="57">A pre-construction program that was inherited from Dianne River</seg>
<seg id="58">These assets are being shipped to Mary River's Katannilik Park, which is part of the existing heavy equipment acquisitions that Baffinland received from Texas for various locations in Nanisivik.</seg>
<seg id="59">"Two major buildings, first of all, were built in Prince Edward Island, this is the third one that has been built, it's a heavy equipment delivery facility, it's designed in St. John's, and it's in Frobisher Bay.</seg>
<seg id="60">"Baffinland and they also brought in a ship from the port, a plow truck and a lot of equipment to be used for heavy equipment."</seg>
<seg id="61">"The furniture listed at Baffinland's submission to the Nunavut Impact Review Board and the Nunavut Water Board included heavy equipment and roads, and metal waste and solid waste."</seg>
<seg id="62">"When I took over the first one that was sent to Baffinland, the ship called Blewins, contained 5,500 tonnes of equipment, and travelled to Prince Edward Island earlier this August."</seg>
<seg id="63">"A further two sealift re-supply ship arrived this summer, and a larger number will be delivered in the summer of 2020.</seg>
<seg id="64">"Through a partnership agreement with Qikiqtani Inuit Association, Baffinland agreed to invest an additional $18 million in the recovery of the Mary River project if the project stopped, the water board's letter indicated that."</seg>

<seg id="4">(Photo of Montreal City)</seg>
<seg id="5">"In Montreal, wherever they are located, they are able to begin the process of expanding the program that was initiated at the women's centre, the day home for women who are homeless, which is the land-based solution that was changed last year."</seg>
<seg id="6">"A resident's decision, which was announced on Wednesday, October 16, will provide an opportunity for the establishment of a new facility that is not too far away, so the emergency call centre for women to attend."</seg>
<seg id="7">The "Women's Day, Women's Day's Day's Day at 1430 cents in Montreal, is open every week for women with special needs."</seg>
<seg id="8">A lot of them are Inuit.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The Women's Centre is presently located in St. Therese's Road, which is not far away from Ottawa to the road and the immunization of the ice, such as Tasiujait."</seg>
<seg id="10">"The women's centre for many Inuit women is well known, with 15 percent of the facility."</seg>
<seg id="11">"It is designed to open in 2021" year, this facility was purchased with an allowance of $1 million from the Montreal businessman through Andrew Harper's s community foundation in Montreal.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Thank you very much for having a new facility, we are now able to accommodate 22 beds for women's shelters," it says Maureen-Buchan, who is the Director of the St. Theresa's Home, who said through the media about the events at the Women's Shelter. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"Currently, women are 25 percent of the population who are homeless in Montreal, but the benefits for women are inadequate."</seg>
<seg id="14">This project is a realistic start. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"It's good to hear that the drop-in centre was expanded in less than a week after this person used to stay at the hospice, Clara Nuliak, originally from Nunavik, following his passing on October 11th at the hospital."</seg>
<seg id="16">Bernadette-Friesen said in Nunatsiaq News that her daughter was in prison when she was in jail.</seg>

<seg id="18">"Many women go to the women's shelter on a day-to-day basis. There is a six-bed facility and then they stay overnight."</seg>
<seg id="19">There will be a new facility.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Currently, the women's shelter, which is about 100 women per day, provides services and activities to women's needs in the areas of homelessness, food security, mental health and addictions."</seg>
<seg id="21">Mr. Berger's report notes that the number of Inuit women in this program has remained unchanged since 2018.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nunavut does not have a Liberal system.</seg>
<seg id="2">"In many important questions, the Liberals did not have adequate access to information."</seg>
<seg id="3">Taparti's winner on October 21 is the release of the Liberal Government's policy for Nunavut and the North.</seg>
<seg id="4">Do you think about the Liberal news?</seg>
<seg id="5">They make reports in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="6">We can remember the majority of them.</seg>
<seg id="7">"That doesn't matter, because the majority of Nunavut's voters came up on October 21, so nothing came out."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Starting in 2015, Justin Trudeau and other Liberal Parties have published many reports."</seg>
<seg id="9">Some of the information came from new issues.</seg>
<seg id="10">"But at the end of the day, the people of Nunavut only said" no. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"However, at the end of the day, more focused on politics, since 1961, Canadians have been faced with the challenge of making changes: New Brunswick."</seg>
<seg id="12">"This elder's recovery at Qaqqalik's Qangualuk's victory demonstrates the displeasure of Mr. Trudeau's efforts in the North and the west, which includes the lack of consensus on the ongoing relationship between Inuit and the federal government."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Since 2015, Trudeau has been working with co-management partners such as Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, Qikiqtani Inuit Association and others."</seg>
<seg id="14">However, this week's election campaign shows Nunavummiut that the Inuit-federal partnership is not effective.</seg>
<seg id="15">"That's very disturbing, because at the end of the day if I became a politician they could not really respond."</seg>
<seg id="16">"It's well known by the majority of the people of Nunavut that one of the biggest concerns of the economy and social issues is the lack of housing, the lack of food in the stores, the high cost of food and the high cost of living, and this is the highest rate of tuberculosis and suicide which seems to be happening every day."</seg>
<seg id="17">"However, on the last day of Nunavut on October 8, Trudeau did not hear much about these issues."</seg>
<seg id="18">He talked about South Baffin talking about climate change and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Those are all Canadian issues, but I want to be able to vote this year, so Nunavummiut would like to hear their concerns about housing and the high cost of living."</seg>
<seg id="20">"What happened was that the Sylvia Grinnell River is on the map, not just Nunavut voters, but Southern Canada."</seg>
<seg id="21">"In doing this, he didn't respond to the people of Nunavut who worked very hard on behalf of the Liberal candidate, Megan Lyall, who wasn't very helpful.</seg>
<seg id="22">"In regards to the Food Mail Program and the lack of nutrition, the Liberals acted on, established a higher level of subsidy for the Nutrition North Canada Program, and provided additional funding, $12.5 million per year for aboriginal harvesters in Nunavut and in the west."</seg>
<seg id="23">However, hunter support programs must be established and no one can say why.</seg>
<seg id="24">"On August 1th, another major initiative was undertaken by the City of Iqaluit and Arctic Bay, when he signed an agreement on the establishment of a Lancaster Sound Marine Conservation Area and committed to initiating a new conservation plan called Devon Island."</seg>
<seg id="25">"As a result of this, a significant amount of funding has been allocated to communities in North Baffin for small craft harbours and protection of employment."</seg>
<seg id="26">He talked a lot about the protection of aboriginal peoples.</seg>
<seg id="27">"The inadequacies of this type of work are as follows: Poor TB in a overcrowded house," this "meet" does not make much sense. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"With that in mind, do you recall the Liberal Government's press release on tuberculosis?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"This was done earlier in 2018, when Jane Ottok, at that time the federal Minister of Health, indicated that tuberculosis would be stopped until 2030."</seg>
<seg id="30">But Mr. Barnabas, the federal minister said that he would deal with this because it is no longer there.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Trudeau's actions in Winnipeg to Winnipeg and the conflict of interest between SNC-Lauren who resigned at the conference."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Since then, if I was a Liberal, I have never heard anything about tuberculosis.</seg>
<seg id="33">"I think it's getting harder for the hunters when they're working with the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="34">"The public realizes that tuberculosis is a lack of food, food and housing."</seg>
<seg id="35">"However, in the area of housing, Mr. Trudy was also looking at the garbage and more of a comment last summer."</seg>
<seg id="36">"The Government of Canada and the Government of Canada's Inuit Housing Action Plan," which was developed by "Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, has not been much more recent."</seg>
<seg id="37">I would also like to congratulate Letia Qaqqalik for winning it.</seg>
<seg id="38">"As a member of the 4th Division of the Legal Services Board of the Legislative Assembly, she will need help in order to be heard."</seg>
<seg id="39">Let us give the people of Nunavut an opportunity and support.</seg>
<seg id="40">"Qaqqaq won two medals, Leona Aglukkaq and Megan Lyall."</seg>
<seg id="41">I wish them all the best in their future endeavours and continue to serve Nunavummiut and the north.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Looking at my colleagues", we can consider $80 million.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Joyce Tilley, MLA for Amittuq, was one of the Members of the Legislative Assembly asking the Government of Nunavut for this $80 million increase in the Iqaluit-Nuuk Arctic Winter Games."</seg>
<seg id="4">Some of Nunavut's lawyers are asking for unsolicited support for the expansion of the Nuuk-Iqaluit Western Arctic project.</seg>
<seg id="5">"In August, the federal government announced that it would provide $151 million for this project, which is targeted at 1,700 kilometres from North Bay to Nuuk, Greenland from the Baffin to Iqaluit."</seg>
<seg id="6">Then that would be brought to Kimmirut.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The Government of Nunavut will develop the framework and the project has begun, which will be completed in 2023."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Last year, the Legislative Assembly approved this project, which cost $126 million."</seg>
<seg id="9">"At the end of this year, we were informed that the cost of the project has increased to reflect the increased cost of living and that it is now estimated to be approximately $209 million," John Main, Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, who spoke to the Member on Wednesday, October 23. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"This is a $80 million difference."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Looking at my colleagues", we are able to make decisions on the $80 million. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The federal government's contribution to the Outpost Camps and the Northern Community Initiatives Program is the ICC Canada Plan.</seg>
<seg id="13">The project is now in the Legal Services Board's review of the main estimates for the year 2020-21.</seg>
<seg id="14">"At the appropriate time during question period, Joelie Tilley, MLA for Amittuq asked Mr. Quassa Kusugak, Minister of Community and Government Services, this $80 million increase in the government's plans for the future."</seg>
<seg id="15">"As part of this process, the identification of the Government of Nunavut's Strategic Investments Program," aims to ensure that this program is clearly defined, and that it has access to information regarding developments, appropriate cost estimates and timely work, prior to initiating the initial planning process. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"Have there been any preliminary plans, yes or no?"</seg>
<seg id="17">Asked of: Hon. Lorne Kusugak.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Planning has been completed and the feasibility study is still underway.</seg>
<seg id="19">"When we were informed, we found out that it would be more expensive," Ms. Kusugak said.</seg>
<seg id="20">"May, beside her is the Chairperson of the House of Commons, rises to ask another question from Ms. Kusugak."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Can the minister indicate how this huge project is increasing over the course of the year?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"Ms. Kusugak reiterates that once the proposed budget was approved last year, the department re-evaluated the scope of the project and the costs increased after its review."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Ms. Kusugak reiterated, in May 2019, the department thought that the funding request would be increased to $201.6 million" in order to access federal funding for this project. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"On Friday, October 24th, May rose again during question period to follow up with the Finance Minister George Hickes on the same issue."</seg>
<seg id="25">"As a result of the Financial Management Board's activities and activities, what were the results of the department's $80 million increase in funding for this initiative?"</seg>
<seg id="26">I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Mr. Hickes noted that the federal government's increased funding for this project, and included a significant contribution to the Fisheries and Sealing Division, the Government of Nunavut increased its contribution."</seg>
<seg id="28">"The Department of Community and Government Services re-handed it to the Financial Management Board for the purpose of determining that there is a shortfall."</seg>
<seg id="29">"Mr. Hickes also stated that the Government of Nunavut (25 percent) contributes to the project, while the federal government contributed 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="30">"As a Nunavut Government, we don't have to pay $80 million, so we would have to pay 25 percent."</seg>
<seg id="31">"What we're trying to do is trying to find something in the next few years to assist in completing this program."</seg>

<seg id="24">"In the Qikiqtani region, lung cancer was diagnosed in 2002 from 1,000 infants and in the Kivalliq, 230 from 1,000."</seg>
<seg id="25">This means that the Government of Nunavut spent approximately $5.9 million on medical travel for the Qikiqtani region and approximately $5.7 million for the Kivalliq Breast Cancer Program.</seg>
<seg id="26">"However, it was, Kivalliq's highest rate of lung cancer is $63,686."</seg>
<seg id="27">"For those of us, it's not as cost effective as it should be, because of lung cancer in the High Arctic."</seg>
<seg id="28">The head nurse in Ontario supports the registrar.</seg>
<seg id="29">"People's babies at 10 times require more specialized care at the health centres for lung cancer than" at risk "with infants and their illnesses are more sensitive to their health.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Although this is a major problem, Inuit infants in Nunavut don't get cancer," Brian wrote a letter.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Another area of expertise has been identified in the Western School of Health, the Canadian Health Association and the National Health Research Centre for Indigenous Peoples."</seg>
<seg id="32">However, healthy babies in Nunavut do not receive this type of illness - whether they are at risk in other communities outside of Iqaluit and they are more advanced to lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="33">The Auditor General is saying that is what they are doing.</seg>
<seg id="34">"I have worked very hard.</seg>
<seg id="35">I've shown them all the details for the public.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Caroline Bolt, Jane Webster, has seen my list and they have said that they're religion, it says,"</seg>
<seg id="37">In Nunavik, vaccinations are provided to all infants.</seg>
<seg id="38">"As a result, not only Nunavut, health professionals in Nunavik have submitted Pangaggujjiniq to all infants over the past three years."</seg>
<seg id="39">"On October 18, the Minister of Health, George Hickes, stated in response to questions asked by the Member for Iqaluit-Niaqunnguu, Ms. Pat Angnakak, that the Government of Nunavut review Nunavut's cases."</seg>
<seg id="40">"We are monitoring the program," it says Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="41">Ms. Angnakak said this is a very serious issue for families.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Not too long ago, I know that the baby had to be sent down to the hospital and it has an impact on the family, especially when the baby is too young."</seg>
<seg id="43">But Mr. Hickes protected the Government of Nunavut's current practice and doesn't say that the government is spending money on people but they provide this.</seg>
<seg id="44">"This is not a legal decision.</seg>
<seg id="45">"It is consistent with the best practices of health care delivery," which Mr. Hickes says.</seg>
<seg id="46">Mr. Patterson touched up on Nunavik's successes over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="47">"We're still waiting for this figure, and once we find out that there are savings in using the Pallium, then we will implement it as soon as possible."</seg>
<seg id="48">"However, in my view, there is still not enough certification for the use of Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="49">"There are two things that I don't agree with in trying to sign off on and one of the things that I am bringing up is that it hasn't been completed yet, or whether it's scientific information."</seg>
<seg id="50">"There are still a lot of people who still have questions."</seg>
<seg id="51">The performance of Paxcil in Nunavut has been a long time.</seg>
<seg id="52">"In 2008, the Government of Nunavut refused to participate or participate in the Pan-territorial inquiry concerning the hakapik, or the professionals of Greenland, Nunavik and the Northwest Territories."</seg>

<seg id="3">"A model tiny house, from Nunavik Building, was shipped up to Kuujjuaq on the sealift this summer."</seg>
<seg id="4">(Photo courtesy Nunavik Building)</seg>
<seg id="5">The first of a series of tiny homes developed for Nunavik arrived on the sealift in Kuujjuaq this summer.</seg>
<seg id="6">"“I wanted to show people what kind of quality of house we are building for the North,” said Willie Gadbois, co-founder of Nunavik Building, a home designer and developer with offices in Kuujjuaq and Napierville, Quebec."</seg>
<seg id="7">"About a decade ago, Gadbois, a Kuujjuaq-based plumber, furnace repairman and housebuilder, met building expert Claude Jannelle."</seg>
<seg id="8">"“We started talking about affordable housing in the North,” Gadbois said."</seg>
<seg id="9">“Housing in the North is so expensive.</seg>
<seg id="10">That’s where it started.”</seg>
<seg id="11">"From that, they’ve developed designs for tiny homes that take the northern elements into consideration."</seg>
<seg id="12">The houses have metal siding and roofing to withstand high winds and last longer than other commonly used materials.</seg>
<seg id="13">"They have been built with octane packages that have been made up of tips, roofs and roofs and three walls of windows to keep the heat warm."</seg>
<seg id="14">"They have mild furnaces, such as wall hangings that need to be replaced with furnaces, heating systems, and so on."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I don't think that's the only way we can do it in the north," it says, "Oh, no."</seg>
<seg id="16">"There are a lot of problems with heating and heating fuel and it's too much for some people.</seg>
<seg id="17">People are saying that their feet are getting frozen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Their houses are insulation but they're on the feet. "</seg>
<seg id="19">The design is organized by Nunamiut Construction in one bedroom.</seg>

<seg id="21">"As a result of the repair of furnaces and plumbing in all of Nunavut, Mr. Galbraith is responsible for ensuring that buildings are built on a standard design, everything is properly repaired and maintained."</seg>
<seg id="22">"The Nunavik Housing Association has various designs for small units, four bedrooms, and other materials that are available for them."</seg>
<seg id="23">"They can add additional rooms and can be expanded, for example, if they are bigger than their children."</seg>
<seg id="24">"The building is being displayed in Churchill with only one bedroom, a size of 5 metres away and 10 metres of head."</seg>
<seg id="25">It's a walk-in room at the end of the day for the cooking room and so on.</seg>
<seg id="26">It's behind the room and beyond that.</seg>
<seg id="27">The power plant in another building is over there.</seg>
<seg id="28">Over the past two hours the building was trying to complete the lot and the electrical and plumbing was put in.</seg>
<seg id="29">"This building can be purchased for $228,000, for the sanitation and everything in it, it says Garry."</seg>
<seg id="30">"The Nunavik building cost about $500,000 and $600,000, it says.</seg>
<seg id="31">"We're trying to build houses that can afford to pay for lack of space and problems with the water roads," it says Garry.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I'm a plumber, I've been an electrician for many years and I think a lot of the work that is being done is done properly, the pipes are not adequate, they're not in good shape."</seg>
<seg id="33">I have been working on this for many years and now we have a better system for the north. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"The buildings that are built in Montreal, Quebec, and during the month when they were built, Gilbert said, and the trucks were delivered by ship."</seg>
<seg id="35">"After we ordered the materials and the time is up for the sealift, this facility can be located in the next summer."</seg>
<seg id="36">"In the future, if this goes ahead, we are looking at building a facility in the north."</seg>
<seg id="37">"However, this requires significant investment."</seg>
<seg id="38">He said that all the houses in the north would be adequate and would be very happy to order from Nunavut or from Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="39">"We're open and we're just waiting for the payments from interested parties and they're planning to build houses," it's saying Garry. "</seg>

<seg id="4">"However, recently, beds have been seen at the Tammaativvik Boarding Home when patients from Nunavik go to the city."</seg>
<seg id="5">Chronic conditions at the Nunavik Boarding Home are a major concern for the patients and their families.</seg>

<seg id="9">"Quaraq's view of the bathroom indicated that patients travelling from Nunavik to guard at the Larga boarding home, where they have rooms, 39 bedrooms, the first floor is full."</seg>

<seg id="45">"Although the Qikiqtani Inuit Association says that they can't help with the work on 2, Mr. Akeeagok stated that they will continue to work towards keeping people informed about the project and that the project's economic potential will not be limited."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Against Mary River.</seg>
<seg id="47">We are working with them.</seg>
<seg id="48">We own the Inuit land.</seg>
<seg id="49">"We support Inuit employment."</seg>
<seg id="50">"We have spent a lot of money and effort to make this project economically viable for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="51">"Given that, we must find a balance."</seg>
<seg id="52">However, there is nothing at this time. "</seg>

<seg id="6">"This means that taxpayers will receive more than $3,000 per year than the Nunavut Income Tax."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Another change is to increase the living allowance from $1,200 to $1,500."</seg>
<seg id="8">"This means that taxpayers who pay more than $60,000 will receive an additional $300 tax credit."</seg>
<seg id="9">As well, the Nunavut business tax rate for small businesses has decreased by 4 percent to 3 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Our government is committed to addressing the issue of food tax rebates."</seg>
<seg id="11">"The Government of Canada's Fuel Tax Rebate Program came into effect on July 1st, with a fuel price increase that would have been 5 cents per litre, the Government of Nunavut introduced a fuel rebate program, which is a fuel price increase, which is a fuel price increase."</seg>
<seg id="12">"During discussions on income tax reforms, Nunavummiut agreed that the corporate income tax should be returned to Nunavummiut."</seg>
<seg id="13">But they couldn't agree on how best to do that.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Adam Lyall, Member of the Legislative Assembly for Iqaluit-Manirajak, expressed concern that, and I quote," with the reduction of the income tax rates, the government will require a tax credit for government operations. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"It is my understanding that the current federal contribution that we desperately need and our own source revenues from 10 to 15 percent of our total contribution.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We have to spend a lot of money on our own revenues that we have to operate," it says licences.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Why is the government attempting to use Calm Air to help the government operate?"</seg>
<seg id="18">"The" comprehension of the tax revenues that we're getting from a small portion of the Government of Nunavut and Carmen tried to make it acceptable to our own businesses. "</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr. Lyall also indicated that this amendment to the Income Tax Act would be most appropriate for returning Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="20">"It also indicated that this company tax credit will go to the Government of Nunavut for its purpose of reducing Nunavut's dependence on such services."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Climate Change is a major concern and it needs to be addressed now and for the future.</seg>
<seg id="22">"As I noted in my Member's Statement, I have brought forward suggestions for our government to develop or address the issue of energy conservation in Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Why hasn't these ideas been considered and proposed to be used for corporate taxes?"</seg>
<seg id="24">Mr. Hickes responded by saying that each department - responsible for detailed projects - hearings.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Some departments have been working with departments, including the Qulliq Energy Corporation, which are responsible for developing energy-efficient street lights for all Nunavut communities, which were approved during the previous sitting."</seg>
<seg id="26">"In 2019-20, the Government of Nunavut feels that it will raise approximately 12 million dollars in taxes."</seg>
<seg id="27">It would be broken down as follows:</seg>
<seg id="28">2 million dollars for government wide capital projects for public housing and government buildings such as schools and health centres.</seg>
<seg id="29">3.6 million dollars for the new Nunavut Electricity Subsidy Program.</seg>
<seg id="30">6.2 million dollars will be returned to Nunavummiut and Nunavummiut working this year in the development of amendments to the Income Tax Act.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, with respect to the licence plate, he stated that they weren't getting together properly.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Looking at the 50 percent recovery of the tank and another 50 percent of the payroll tax, why is it so small for energy saving measures?"</seg>
<seg id="33">"Mr. Hickes responded by saying that the federal government's share of the corporate tax will increase annually in the next five years, and this 50 percent reduction in the importation of petroleum products until next year's increase in tax revenues will result in additional revenues for other projects."</seg>
<seg id="34">The Act received second reading was passed on November 6 and third reading on the evening.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Although this is the first time, Mr. Lyall, yesterday's new son said to the Legislative Assembly that he only had three hours left."</seg>
<seg id="36">"Shortly after the e-mail from Nunatsiaq News, Mr. Lyall indicated that he was not satisfied with the vote on the Act."</seg>
<seg id="37">"I don't agree with the intent of Bill 26, I don't think it's a proper year's policy, it's written by Mr. Lyall and he was going to make that statement in the House.</seg>
<seg id="38">"The purpose of kN tax reduction is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Does this Act include any power tax credits for individuals who wish to help, or did the Government of Nunavut establish a mechanism to assist people in purchasing and developing energy conservation measures so I was very pleased to have concurred with the legislation."</seg>
<seg id="40">Although they were not satisfied with the passage of this bill.</seg>
<seg id="41">Mr. Hickes said that he would be able to listen carefully to the ideas on how to use the corporate taxes that are being collected in Nunavut to reduce the amount of dollars that are coming from Calgary.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I strongly urge the public to write a letter to the MLAs or to the government concerning its actions in this area."</seg>

<seg id="7">"The same people who came here spent $271,383,000 on travel and transportation costs."</seg>
<seg id="8">The report does not provide a detailed breakdown of how much was spent on travel.</seg>
<seg id="9">"By contrast, there were approximately 16,750 visits from non-Nunavut residents from May to October 2015, following the following year's visits to Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Baffin and Kivalliq are among the most visited communities from July to September of 2018."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Qiqirtaq was visited by 95,600 residents of nearly half (53.2 percent) went to Iqaluit with a budget of $75.1 million."</seg>
<seg id="12">Pond Inlet and Pangnirtung were second and third communities visited here in the Baffin region.</seg>
<seg id="13">"In the Kivalliq region, Rankin Inlet received 33,600 visitors and $68 million, near Baker Lake and Arviat."</seg>
<seg id="14">Cambridge Bay was one of the most visitors from the Kitikmeot.</seg>
<seg id="15">The water for Washington's research vessel is from Alaska to Kimmirut in August 2019.</seg>

<seg id="17">"The sealift operators spent $388,351 for municipal services, the report also states."</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the weather and ice conditions affected half the cruise ships that wanted to visit Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The Department was provided with an update of eight Inuit carrier operators travelling 23 Nunavut communities from July to September of 2018."</seg>
<seg id="20">"The vessel received 3,404 passengers together."</seg>
<seg id="21">"More than half, or 59 percent of the cargo that was shipped to Pond Inlet came from Nunavut."</seg>

<seg id="24">"Cambridge Bay, Gjoa Haven, Kimmirut, and Kugluktuk were not visited by sealift in 2018."</seg>

<seg id="29">"In its report, the Government of Nunavut consulted with organizations such as the Arctic Winter Games Research Group and all of the cruise ship operators to avoid going through this process."</seg>
<seg id="30">"It also indicates that" Tourism is a separate development, with the government's support for development. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"In Nunavut, this means building capacity and employing Nunavummiut in the tourism sector."</seg>
<seg id="32">"There is always a lack of dedicated and skilled tourism sectors.</seg>

<seg id="36">"In the report, both the Government of Nunavut Tourism Research Institute are Inuit."</seg>
<seg id="37">"In the past, tourism industry has not been collected much, which leads to confusion about the size and benefits of Nunavut's economy," the report states.</seg>

<seg id="1">"The Mary River project, if it's a commercial purpose, let's actually table it."</seg>
<seg id="2">Members strongly encourage Baffinland's investment in this sector.</seg>
<seg id="3">Members sit on the Iqaluit Rotary Club's fourth day of the Nunavut Impact Review Board's public hearings concerning the Mary River mine's proposed road expansion project at Mary River.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Nunavut's process of complying with the law industry development, which began in 1993 with the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, has not played a role in such areas as regulatory, environmental and social assessment of the Mary River project over the past ten years."</seg>
<seg id="5">"This was advertised in Iqaluit earlier this month, when the Nunavut Impact Review Board held its final public hearings on the $900 million for a highway expansion proposal from Baffinland's Meadowbank mine.</seg>
<seg id="6">The last two days meeting that was scheduled for Pond Inlet was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="7">"At the same time, Baffinland has paid hundreds of billions of dollars, for various minerals that are at risk."</seg>
<seg id="8">"During the document, the Nunavut Impact Review Board still decided to make a recommendation to the Government of Nunavut that, if approved, delay the process from eight to twelve months."</seg>
<seg id="9">"The Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation, Qikiqtani Inuit Association, indicated that they were not in a position to support or approve a long-term expansion of the highway."</seg>
<seg id="10">"However, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association's activities, the Qikiqtaaluk Corporation has expressed its support for this initiative."</seg>
<seg id="11">We also have Arctic Co-operatives Limited.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is a very complex program.</seg>
<seg id="13">"On behalf of Baffinland, the Deputy Minister of recycling, Megan Lodge-Wong, announced that these companies were just worried about the possibility of this project," "we will do our best to protect and protect Canadians with over 3,000 jobs, which are Inuit."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Last week, Baffinland announced in Nunatsiaq News that they had cancelled 490 southern contractors and 96 contractors."</seg>
<seg id="15">That's why we're getting to the biggest question that hasn't been answered on the project: the Mary River funding.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Baffinland has expressed its potential for mineral development, but it is unclear if the regulatory bodies are allowed to build 110 kilometres long-term road between Baffinland and the development of an increase of approximately 12 million tonnes per year, and they would also be able to do this with 176 trips on a regular basis."</seg>
<seg id="17">"The problem is, they have not yet published a public report on this program."</seg>
<seg id="18">"In the past, more professionals were no longer asking for this."</seg>
<seg id="19">"It was last year, although they didn't have anything to do with what the stakeholders said."</seg>
<seg id="20">"For example, during the summer and fall of 2018, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association challenged with Baffinland to protect the Nunavut Impact Review Board."</seg>
<seg id="21">"On August 31 of this year, the Nunavut Impact Review Board decided that the Government of Canada would reject prior and smaller initiatives from 4.2 million to 6 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="22">"So Newfoundland and their partner, QIA, started a lot of work."</seg>
<seg id="23">"A few weeks ago, they wrote a letter to the Chief Electoral Officer, Mr. Danny Leblanc, who was the former federal minister of the Arctic, requesting that the Board's decision be amended."</seg>
<seg id="24">Why is that?</seg>
<seg id="25">To the money.</seg>
<seg id="26">"The Inuit Association has indicated that they have recently frozen the Mary River mine's capacity, which will require significant grants and contributions, in excess of $20 million in the new IIBA."</seg>
<seg id="27">Ottawa agreed.</seg>
<seg id="28">"The focus of the Qikiqtani Inuit Association's concerns about the potential for funding for the mine, the federal government agreed to the Baffinland proposal last year."</seg>
<seg id="29">"We are also concerned about the long-term viability of the Mary River mine and we will be aware of the Qikiqtani Inuit Association's concerns regarding the economic development project that would be based on the RFP," from Labrador's September 30, 2018 letter signed by the federal-provincial-territorial minister. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"Let's say, it's going to be very important for this Assembly to have a public-federal-provincial-territorial commitment to economic development that is important and valuable in this regard."</seg>
<seg id="31">And they did that even though they didn't show up in the budget.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Because if it's true that this project doesn't generate any revenue, the Member for Baker Lake may want to see what he says is true."</seg>
<seg id="34">"In all aspects of the Mary River project, Baffinland's staff -- should be establishing a number of benefits for the following environmental impact statement."</seg>
<seg id="35">"However, with respect to program financial success, I don't think the Nunavut Impact Review Board is interested in creating a public registry."</seg>
<seg id="36">"For example, the Nunavut Impact Review Board has recommended that a lengthy financial statement received from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans" be used "and that it not be tabled in the Legislative Assembly in a public document."</seg>
<seg id="37">(E-mail is still on the website.</seg>
<seg id="38">The Nunavut Impact Review Board's recommendation was to adopt this document after its release in 1999 and it was removed from Baffinland's request.</seg>
<seg id="39">"In this case, Baffinland wanted to submit, on its own, a shorter financial statement saying why Mary River could generate more revenue through a larger development."</seg>
<seg id="40">If you want to become an independent body, it may cause problems.</seg>
<seg id="41">In fact, Baffinland has made some improvements.</seg>
<seg id="42">"In response to this, the Nunavut Impact Review Board made a different decision, which does not make sense."</seg>
<seg id="43">"If the federal government is going to be able to generate revenue, then the federal Income Support Board is required."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Definitely, the Nunavut Impact Review Board and other regulatory bodies must pursue additional measures in this area."</seg>
<seg id="45">They deserve it.</seg>
<seg id="46">"As well as the Baffinland Business Credit Corporation, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association."</seg>
<seg id="47">"In addition to addressing these types of issues, the federal government is amending the federal legislation to govern the Nunavut Impact Review Board's processes, the Nunavut Planning Commission and the Program Review Act to ensure that financial information is provided in the future."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Of course when they've said that, there are still a lot of questions that have not been answered by Baffinland's final proposal, related to the long-term road impact of the caribou, the impact of the cruise ships, the lack of Inuit employment, and so on."</seg>
<seg id="49">"A number of questions have been brought to my attention regarding the proposed new deep-sea port project in Arctic Bay, which has been approved by Baffinland in 2013, and is able to produce approximately 18 million tonnes of quota for next year.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is not clear why Baffinland has not completed this plan.</seg>
<seg id="51">But the biggest question is how can this program continue.</seg>

<seg id="18">"I look forward to meeting with you, and supporting our efforts to support businesses and initiatives such as the implementation of the Jonah Amitnaaq Program," in Fort Smith.</seg>
<seg id="19">In consultation with Inuit leaders it would assist in their work to assist Makivik in their efforts to develop their own business.</seg>

<seg id="21">"The two different Acts that he replaced, Ontario Member Romanow Sharks."</seg>
<seg id="22">"When this Act was introduced in 2018, Bill C-262 was put on hold by the Hudson's Bay Company last spring but the Liberal Government representative from the Hudson's Bay Company, Mr. Peter Hamilton, indicated that when he was re-elected that the Liberal Government would have to implement the legislation."</seg>
<seg id="23">"It is important for me to continue to deal with Bill C-262 when complying with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms of Indigenous Peoples and the work of my predecessor Ruth Constituencies."</seg>

<seg id="1">Mr. Trudeau: No surprise.</seg>
<seg id="2">"If you have a good idea, don't expect it."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Jane Watt-Cloutier, who was the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development on March 23, 2018, along with the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami President Nathan Fleming, announced that the Government of Canada would dissolve the Inuit Circumpolar Conference until 2030."</seg>
<seg id="4">It was less than a year since he resigned as a Member of Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="5">I'm just wondering if you have found out during the federal elections or which leaders weren't really talking about the importance of Nunavummiut and the northern territories.</seg>
<seg id="6">That is no secret.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The more important lawyers seem to be thinking more about the rest of Canada, because in the south, there are not enough people who would be voting even though they're talking about northern people that the majority of Canadians have never heard about."</seg>
<seg id="8">"The Liberal Government made this known. When they went bankrupt, they left behind because they were so late in the north and they were able to set up a northern policy prior to the election."</seg>
<seg id="9">"During the time of the campaign, most aboriginal issues, many northerners raised concerns, without much attention."</seg>
<seg id="10">"As a result of the new decrease in Justin's focus on the new government, and that the Board was sworn in on November 20th, it appears that they will continue to do so without too much attention."</seg>
<seg id="11">That is one example.</seg>
<seg id="12">The primary purpose of this increase is to eliminate or eliminate 50 percent of the H1N1 cases in the Inuit homeland up to 2025 and to reduce it by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="13">"This included initiatives to provide $27.5 million over five years, to" establish a "four members of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami."</seg>
<seg id="14">"However, it was stated that it seems like it's smelling like it's going to be broken.</seg>
<seg id="15">He resigned from Trudeau's legal counsel on March 4th with the dissatisfaction of Mr. Trudeau's unwelcome work in Winnipeg.</seg>
<seg id="16">He did this within four days when Trudeau first came to Iqaluit and apologized for the fact that Canada had treated people with tuberculosis in the 1950s and 1960s.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Since then, they kept the voice in the north about tuberculosis."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Although they ran for office, this was not done much."</seg>
<seg id="19">"To date, tuberculosis has just dropped."</seg>
<seg id="20">"For example, in the Northwest Territories, tuberculosis rates between 2006 and 2016 have been recorded and documented in 248.5 individuals, the Department of Health has conducted only one community survey."</seg>
<seg id="21">"This happened in Naimee, 2018, when there was a flu outbreak and a young boy 14 years old passed away by this patient while she was at the hospital, Jane Johnson."</seg>
<seg id="22">"In Nunavik, 313 people were diagnosed with tuberculosis between 2006 and 2016, along with tuberculosis in the Inuit homeland, 234 cases were diagnosed."</seg>
<seg id="23">"However, no community-based surveys have appeared to have been conducted in Nunavik since 2018, since the Bathurst Mandate."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Despite the fact that Nunavut recently experienced high rates of tuberculosis, Mr. Stephen Harper and Mr. Dryden were shortly elected."</seg>
<seg id="25">"In Nunavut, there have been approximately 670 cases of tuberculosis cases between 2006 and 2016, with 171.8 out of 100 thousand and active cases in this case."</seg>
<seg id="26">(interpretation ends) No one has been affected by the Inuvialuit.</seg>
<seg id="27">"In that case, there were no serious cases of TB between 2007 and 2016."</seg>
<seg id="28">TB is a serious illness due to lack of resources.</seg>
<seg id="29">This has been brought to my attention.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it is true.</seg>
<seg id="31">"When people don't have enough food and if they don't have adequate housing, TB can develop."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Also in light of this, the poor situation in Cape Dorset, during the 12 weeks of tuberculosis testing expired in May."</seg>
<seg id="33">The 2016 unemployment rate was approximately 27.3 percent.</seg>
<seg id="34">"In 2015, over 15 years of income was $18,933."</seg>
<seg id="35">"From the 370 units, 120 units required major repairs."</seg>
<seg id="36">"As a result of the Canada Overcrowding, the 140 units from the 370 units were referred to as" homeless "from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation's regulations.</seg>
<seg id="37">This means that there are not enough bedrooms per capita.</seg>
<seg id="38">There are a few people in Canada who are lacking housing.</seg>
<seg id="39">"It is no secret that over the last 20 years, tuberculosis is a crisis in Nunavut and other circumpolar countries."</seg>
<seg id="40">And it doesn't seem that tuberculosis can be stopped in those communities unless major changes are made to houses and better.</seg>
<seg id="41">"However, during the last election campaign, Trudeau's legal counsel did not provide any public housing units, but they reiterated their 2016 and 2017 operations commitments."</seg>
<seg id="42">"In this case, they were not allowed to reprimand their language, nor did they have any concerns about this."</seg>
<seg id="43">"This is also reflective of the results of Canada's national emergency cases, where tuberculosis rates in the Inuit homeland are over 300 times higher than non-aboriginal Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="44">"In Nunavut, it may be worse."</seg>
<seg id="45">Last year's report revealed that one hundred infants in Nunavut may have this disease.</seg>
<seg id="46">"Given that they are not overly concerned with the issue of emergency management, what are the concerns of the Liberal Government with respect to other issues such as mental health, community housing, training, and so on?"</seg>
<seg id="47">"If you have a good idea, don't expect it."</seg>
<seg id="48">"If you don't do that, prepare for it to go down."</seg>
<seg id="49">"Please note that the statistics of tuberculosis are ongoing from the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami's" Inuit Tuberculosis Program, "which was released in November 2018.</seg>
<seg id="50">The Cape Dorset statistics are the results of Statistics Canada's final report on the 2016 census.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nunavut's adjacent waters are talking about renewable energy management in the Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="2">"Representatives from Northern Quebec, Canada and Jonah Stace are discussing options and findings."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Bernard Perform, President of the Qulliq Energy Corporation established this year's Northern Strengthening and Community Conference in Iqaluit, November 22, 2019."</seg>
<seg id="4">(photo of the American Contest)</seg>
<seg id="5">The renewable energy experts in the Arctic met in Iqaluit on November 21 and 22 to consider and learn from their experiences in the Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Witnesses from Nunavut, the Northwest Territories, Northwest Territories, Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, Kalaallit Nunavumiut and Jonah Street addressed the challenges facing different communities."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Meetings," M'Clintock Channel "and the Enterprises" Enterprises (improving the management, including new programs and stakeholders), were organized by the American Presidents of the Government of Nunavut and the Qulliq Energy Corporation. "</seg>
<seg id="8">"Bernard Peryouar, President of the Qulliq Energy Corporation, announced that meeting with them was a communication link."</seg>
<seg id="9">"In this area of renewable energy in our communities, we would really like to know what other jurisdictions do, and find out how they have achieved their mandate or their deficits," Premier is saying.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Pereira also stated that although it is important that representatives meet to discuss the issue of fuel conservation, there is a Nunavut event here in Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Some communities have access roads so they don't have too many people in Nunavut communities.</seg>
<seg id="12">"However, they are faced with the same challenges, such as space, to deal with issues at the community level, so we can see similar problems."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Chris Rose, the Director of renewable energy in Alaska, stated that the Alaska Energy Subsidy Program helps to support renewable energy development."</seg>
<seg id="14">"We were able to build 80 communities that have been able to take advantage of renewable energy in addition to diesel fuel.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We feel that we are aware of how this has benefited," Ross says.</seg>
<seg id="16">"This subsidy program, designed to promote renewable energy projects, and helps Alaska greatly in the area of lower energy costs."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Ross said this morning in South Baffin, that five communities are working together to develop wind energy and they are using this technology."</seg>
<seg id="18">"There is an integrated knowledge of how to operate and maintain windmills and they can help each other in resolving the problem," the Rotel says.</seg>
<seg id="19">"In Alaska, like Nunavut, the power bills are very expensive."</seg>
<seg id="20">Rosemary said that the communities use windmills not just for electricity but also for heating.</seg>
<seg id="21">"What they've done is they've put small furnaces in people's houses and they're covered under diamonds that seem to be stuck on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="22">"When the winds get stronger, they go into the heating system, and they set up a very small information package for furnaces and electrical inspectors."</seg>
<seg id="23">"The" wall hangings due to heat-free, this can continue to warm up. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"It can be turned off or burned off in a home that's accepted, and if they can't do it they can have another heater."</seg>
<seg id="25">"However, in the Kalaallit Nunaat area, the installation of windmills has been a challenge, especially for News North and Eric Hamilton, the technology of recycling in Nuuk."</seg>
<seg id="26">"The issue of cold temperatures and solar panels is not an easy task for producing windmills from the south that are produced in the north, it says (interpretation ends) Halloween."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Mr. Hawker also indicated that two wind generators were installed in other parts of the north, but were unable to."</seg>
<seg id="28">"We can say that in Greenland we have chosen more to deliver programs.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Even two windmills were installed in 200 different locations and one of the 150 communities was tested."</seg>
<seg id="30">"One of the windmills collapsed, for the other one, the drain was too cold for the cold and the engine broke down, he said."</seg>
<seg id="31">"In 2019 during the federal election campaign, three territorial governments announced that the selection of Nunavut's Texas fuel will be eliminated by 2030."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Although it may take a while to develop recycling projects that could be used in the north, Mr. Hawker said that the use of fuel is an urgent matter."</seg>
<seg id="33">"We have to do something about the fuel that we can no longer use, because of climate change, because we already have a problem."</seg>
<seg id="34">This is for legal purposes because it's not going to be used for petroleum products there should be equipment but there's no funding.</seg>
<seg id="35">"To be fiscally responsible, it says,"</seg>
<seg id="36">Mr. Pereira spoke about the importance of consulting with Nunavut residents in the Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="37">"I think that's something that should be considered other than how to start working on recycling."</seg>
<seg id="38">Some people have been using the tools and they have had problems in the south even though they are capable but they can't live in the north.</seg>
<seg id="39">"If we have the financial capacity we will be able to track the problems," it states, "Barbara."</seg>
