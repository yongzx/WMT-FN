<seg id="67">Speaker (Hon. Joe Enook) (interpretation): Mr. Quassa, can you say the opening prayer, please.</seg>
<seg id="68">Speaker (interpretation): Good afternoon, Premier, members, Nunavummiut who are listening to the radio broadcast and watching the televised proceedings. Welcome to your committee.</seg>
<seg id="69">We will proceed immediately to the orders of the day.</seg>
<seg id="70">Premier of Nunavut, (interpretation ends) Premier Quassa.</seg>
<seg id="71">046 – 5(1): Nunavut’s 2018 Youth Achievement Award (Quassa)</seg>
<seg id="72">Hon. Paul Quassa (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="73">Good day to my fellow residents of Igloolik, my colleagues, and all Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="74">I would also like to congratulate my colleague, Donna Main-Kimaliarjuk, who will be receiving the 2018 Youth Abroad Award in Winnipeg.</seg>
<seg id="75">This is the first time that this individual has become a medical professional.</seg>
<seg id="76">Dr. Kimmaliardjuk was born in Chesterfield Inlet and is the first Inuk to have a heart attack...</seg>
<seg id="77">This is the fourth year of a six-year program at the University of Ottawa.</seg>
<seg id="78">Mr. Speaker, Lucie Kimmaliardjuk was able to be admitted in 2014 and she is the only one to have a physiotherapist in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="79">In 2016, he became a member of the Aboriginal Affairs Council for HIV/AIDS, which represents Inuit.</seg>
<seg id="80">When he was a member of the Standing Committee on Social Wellness, he promoted Inuit societal values.</seg>
<seg id="81">Mr. Speaker, the Order of Nunavut represents the highest honour for indigenous peoples.</seg>
<seg id="82">The Beneficiaries celebrate 25 years in 2018 and celebrate 350 indigenous peoples, Inuit, and Métis who promote success.</seg>
<seg id="83">The award celebrates the cultural diversity of aboriginal peoples in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="84">This year’s awards ceremony will take place on March 23 in Winnipeg.</seg>
<seg id="85">I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Lucie Kimmaliardjuk on her recognition.</seg>
<seg id="86">She has worked very hard to make sure that Inuit and health care professionals are able to take advantage of this opportunity to demonstrate to our youth in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="87">I know that while I'm making my statement, I'm very proud of Dr. Kimmaliardjuk and I'm sure that he will work on this very important issue for us.</seg>
<seg id="88">Minister of Justice, Ms. Elliot.</seg>
<seg id="89">047 – 5(1): Rankin Inlet Healing Facility Sewing (Cambridge Bay)</seg>
<seg id="90">Hon. Jeannie Iqaqrialu (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) I rise today to speak about the cultural sewing program for the men at the Rankin Inlet Healing Facility.</seg>
<seg id="91">These inmates are involved in the sealskin, sealskin, and other items such as pelts, sealskin pelts, pelts, pelts, pelts, pelts, and cookies.</seg>
<seg id="92">Rosemary is a guy who is run by Sandy, a respected elder, and a seamstress who is world-renowned.</seg>
<seg id="93">He recently travelled to Norway to teach about seal skins.</seg>
<seg id="94">He was a student of Nunavut Arctic College’s Fur Production and Design Program and initiated the Fur Pricing Program with the Literacy Council of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="95">Rosemary assisted inmates in providing culturally appropriate physical, safe, Inuit language and cultural healing programs.</seg>
<seg id="96">The sewing program will work with and support the on-the-land programs. The inmates will learn how to hunt and how to prepare skins and meat properly.</seg>
<seg id="97">The Fur and Sealskin Program will be used for the sewing program.</seg>
<seg id="98">Programs such as this provide assistance to inmates in the community to reintegrate into the community at the end of their sentences and encourage them to take advantage of non-violent practices.</seg>
<seg id="99">I recently visited the Rankin Inlet Healing Facility and I was very pleased to see the positive impact of the cultural programs, especially for the community elders like Rosemary Shawn.</seg>
<seg id="100">Minister of Family Services, Mr. Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="101">048 – 5(1): Red Ribbon Program Course (Savikataaq)</seg>
<seg id="102">Hon. Joe Savikataaq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I say "good day" to the people of Arviat and to the people of Arviat. Please be on time for the school.</seg>
<seg id="103">Mr. Speaker, these are certified heavy equipment operators, heavy equipment operators, and mechanics.</seg>
<seg id="104">In September 2016 the Heavy Equipment Operator Training Program consists of three components that were identified in the Nunavut Gazette.</seg>
<seg id="105">This gives Nunavummiut the opportunity to take on the Nunavut Apprenticeship Program and certification programs that are known as the Apprenticeship Program.</seg>
<seg id="106">In November of 2017, Nunavut was granted the certification of red tape for heavy equipment operators and heavy equipment operators.</seg>
<seg id="107">As part of the Heavy Equipment Operator Program, this achievement demonstrates regional recognition and demonstrates their knowledge and ability to work in all parts of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="108">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to announce that we have been able to promote Nunavut’s National Award for Excellence in Diplomatic Excellence in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="109">Minister of Education, Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="110">049 – 5(1): New Funding for Early Childhood Programs (Joanasie)</seg>
<seg id="111">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon, my colleagues, residents of Cape Dorset and Kimmirut, as well as Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="112">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to announce today that the Department of Education will be providing O&amp;M funding to eligible daycare facilities.</seg>
<seg id="113">Mr. Speaker, there has been an increase in the results of the three-year action plan that my staff developed for early childhood education and child care, which was a two-phase agreement signed in September 2017 with the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="114">Mr. Speaker, in the current fiscal year, we will see qualified childcare providers receive an increase in funding at a minimum price of $1,918.80, which is a maximum of $45,494.80, depending on the number, condition, and location of daycare centres.</seg>
<seg id="115">As long as day cares do not increase the cost of childcare and additional costs, they will be eligible for similar funding in the next fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="116">Mr. Speaker, this funding will not only help the daycare operators to cover their costs, it will also help to address family day care costs without increasing the costs.</seg>
<seg id="117">Mr. Speaker, we are proud to be able to make this funding available to support daycares and families.</seg>
<seg id="118">I also believe, and I am sure that we also believe that this funding will have a positive impact without changing all the funding and all the daycare costs.</seg>
<seg id="119">Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="120">050 – 5(1): Nunavut Mining Symposium (Chief)</seg>
<seg id="121">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik (interpretation): Good day, Nunavummiut and my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="122">Mr. Speaker, the mining sector plays a key role in Nunavut’s economic development.</seg>
<seg id="123">My department is committed to supporting the mining sector to ensure that Nunavut benefits from these activities.</seg>
<seg id="124">Mr. Speaker, Canada will soon be in Iqaluit for the 21st Annual Nunavut Mining Symposium on April 9-12, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="125">This conference provides an excellent opportunity for people to explore the new territory of Nunavut’s mineral exploration and mining sector to ensure that our communities are aware of and involved in the mining and exploration activities in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="126">We are hopeful that this year’s mining symposium will continue to attract all Nunavummiut and we expect more than 400 participants.</seg>
<seg id="127">Mr. Speaker, I look forward to welcoming mines, Inuit organizations, exploration companies, community members, and other stakeholders to this important meeting.</seg>
<seg id="128">Finally, Mr. Speaker, I encourage all members and the public to take part in this important public forum on April 11.</seg>
<seg id="129">It’s not just an opportunity to get good results, but it has an impact on the search and rescue. Please respond to the question.</seg>
<seg id="130">Members’ Statements. Member for Hudson Bay, Mr. Rumbolt.</seg>
<seg id="131">096 – 5(1): Happy Fifth Birthday to Granddaughter (Rumbolt)</seg>
<seg id="132">Mr. Speaker, it has been five years since the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly rose to recognize my first grandchild. This is my first five years of grandchild.</seg>

<seg id="134">Member for Netsilik, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="135">097 – 5(1): Empowerment of Kitikmeot Youth (Qirngnuq)</seg>
<seg id="136">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="137">What I'm going to say is that it’s very good for the young people to think about the future and how they can work for the future.</seg>
<seg id="138">I rise today to share some good news with my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="139">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to inform the House that the Inuit youth from the Kitikmeot region will be meeting in Cambridge Bay next week to bring the 2018 Kitikmeot Youth Abroad together.</seg>
<seg id="140">Mr. Speaker, this gathering provides an opportunity for Kitikmeot youth to come together and discuss their priorities, concerns with youth.</seg>
<seg id="141">It includes:</seg>
<seg id="142">Mental Health;</seg>
<seg id="143">Youth Centres;</seg>
<seg id="144">Utilization;</seg>
<seg id="145">The importance of Inuit experience in education, residential schools, reconciliation, and reconciliation; and</seg>

<seg id="160">Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, Mr. Lighthizer.</seg>
<seg id="161">098 – 5(1): Substance Abuse Legislation (Letters)</seg>
<seg id="162">Mr. Lightning: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="163">I rise today to raise concerns that have been brought to my attention by my constituents regarding the harmful effects of antibiotics legislation.</seg>
<seg id="164">I just recently received a letter saying, "All of us here in Iqaluit are in a public housing unit this year.</seg>
<seg id="165">Over the last couple of years, we have had to move smokers, the smell, the smoke coming into my house, and it’s very strong."</seg>
<seg id="166">This letter reaffirms that, and I quote, “I am deeply concerned about the impact of the jet on their children. I put my children first and others in that situation."””</seg>
<seg id="167">Mr. Speaker, as residents of Iqaluit and my family, we live in apartments.</seg>
<seg id="168">Mr. Speaker, the smoke affects other people who don’t smoke.</seg>
<seg id="169">For a long time, the anti-smoking campaign has been well known by the government and has been legislated to address the issue of non-smoking.</seg>
<seg id="170">As a father, when we have children, I don’t want them to be affected by these types of diseases that include tobacco and antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="171">As my colleague from Pangnirtung noted, the member asked the Minister of Health about the potential health risks associated with antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="172">I have spoken to many of my constituents who share the same concerns.</seg>
<seg id="173">Mr. Speaker, I recognize that in situations like this, we have to try and balance out.</seg>
<seg id="174">The federal government will be banning the use of anti-smoking in the next few months.</seg>
<seg id="175">I would like to seek unanimous consent to conclude my statement.</seg>
<seg id="176">The member is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statement. Are there any nays?</seg>
<seg id="177">Mr. Lighthizer, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="178">Thank you, Members.</seg>
<seg id="179">Under this legislation, elders will be able to possess and smoke antibiotics. However, the government will have to decide how it will regulate the use of antibiotics in the community.</seg>
<seg id="180">Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet also noted last week that the government’s own research and results indicate that there are concerns about the agricultural and accessibility of public housing units and condominium units.</seg>
<seg id="181">Mr. Speaker, I believe that when this legislation is introduced in the Legislative Assembly, it will be necessary to clarify these concerns and I look forward to reaching the best possible solution for my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="182">Before we proceed, you are aware that our colleague, Mr. Akoak, is not here due to illness.</seg>
<seg id="183">Mr. Akoak, I hope you have a speedy recovery.</seg>
<seg id="184">Member for Baker Lake, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="185">099 – 5(1): Increase in Training Opportunities in Baker Lake (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="186">Mr. Mikkungwak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="187">I say "hello" to the people of Baker Lake and all Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="188">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage our government to increase training opportunities in the community of Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="189">Mr. Speaker, Baker Lake is a rapidly growing community and it will be very important that they take the time to provide more training and employment opportunities to support the community of Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="190">Mr. Speaker, Piqqusilirivvik runs programs in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="191">This program can be expanded so that the public is more aware of and more aware of Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit.</seg>
<seg id="192">Mr. Speaker, the idea of establishing a university in Nunavut has been expressed, and Agnico Eagle Mines has stated that they would be willing to provide such support if it were to go ahead.</seg>
<seg id="193">I think the best way to put it in the middle of Nunavut is to put it in the middle of Canada as well.</seg>
<seg id="194">Mr. Speaker, one of my colleagues stated that it’s very important that we take these things as soon as possible before they pass.</seg>
<seg id="195">The government’s wheels rotate very slowly, but in spite of that, we need to encourage and encourage whenever anything comes up that’s available in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="196">Mr. Speaker, this is the beginning of the fifth Assembly, and I, too, would like to see us move forward as we move forward.</seg>
<seg id="197">Expanding training opportunities in communities such as Baker Lake would be a positive step forward.</seg>
<seg id="198">Member for Kugluktuk, Ms. Kamingoak.</seg>
<seg id="199">100 – 5(1): Concerns about Larga Boarding Home</seg>
<seg id="200">Mr. Kamingoak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="201">Good afternoon, colleagues, Kuglukturmiut, and Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="202">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage the government to improve oversight of the day-to-day operations of medical boarding homes.</seg>
<seg id="203">Mr. Speaker, my constituents have brought forward a number of concerns and it seems to have been a long time ago.</seg>
<seg id="204">There are food problems and disposable waste that have been damaged for months.</seg>
<seg id="205">Mr. Speaker, it is important that the government ensures that the services that are paid to Nunavummiut are actually delivered.</seg>
<seg id="206">I understand that the boarding homes have to have a lot of billets every day but it is also very important that even though that is the case they have to be comfortable and well taken care of.</seg>
<seg id="207">Mr. Speaker, it is unclear if boarding homes will be included in the review of the Medical Travel Policy.</seg>
<seg id="208">I look forward to seeing the results of the review and recommendations to improve the quality of services and the status of the boarding homes.</seg>
<seg id="209">Member for Aivilik, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="210">101 – 5(1): Congratulations to Rosalee Ejangiaq</seg>
<seg id="211">Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation) I rise today to congratulate Rosalee Ejangiaq of Repulse Bay.</seg>
<seg id="212">He has already completed a young person’s education, but he has worked very hard. He has been recognized and awarded the Horizon Elder’s National School Award.</seg>
<seg id="213">Mr. Speaker, the Horizon Senior Citizen of Canada’s Guarantee Scholarship, or Scholarships, or Scholarships, or Scholarships, or Scholarships, or Scholarships, or Scholarships.</seg>
<seg id="214">Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize Ms. Ejangiaq for her courage and commitment to continuing her education.</seg>
<seg id="215">Many of our young people are struggling and facing challenges in completing their post-secondary education.</seg>
<seg id="216">I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating him on his achievement. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="217">Member for Pangnirtung, Ms. Nakasuk.</seg>
<seg id="218">102 – 5(1): Possie Mike’s Recognition under 150 Canada</seg>
<seg id="219">Mr. Nakasuk: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="220">Good afternoon, my colleagues, my family, and the people of Pangnirtung.</seg>
<seg id="221">I rise this afternoon to congratulate a constituent of mine from Pangnirtung who was recognized by Dennis Patterson.</seg>
<seg id="222">I would also like to pay tribute to the 18 years of volunteer search and rescue service in Pangnirtung, Bosie Mike, who has been working for the search and rescue team for 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="223">The last name on my list is the Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="224">103 – 5(1): Budget Reflections (McLean)</seg>
<seg id="225">Ms. Main: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="226">I say "good day" to the people who are watching the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="227">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer some observations and recommendations regarding the government’s financial management practices.</seg>
<seg id="228">Mr. Speaker, those of us who are new to this House over the last couple of weeks have learned a lot from them.</seg>
<seg id="229">Mr. Speaker, as the Chair of the Regular Members’ Caucus of the Legislative Assembly, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of my colleagues for the opportunity to work together since the beginning of the new Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="230">Mr. Speaker, I am very proud of the fact that we made a strong public statement on Friday that the Legislative Assembly will no longer accept the need for the government to respect its own procurement rules.</seg>
<seg id="231">Ms. Main (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My colleague from Iqaluit-Tasiluk made a very important motion on Friday and we will resume the session of the Legislative Assembly at the spring sitting.</seg>
<seg id="232">Mr. Speaker, although we are a territorial government, this is not always working, it has the strength to do so.</seg>
<seg id="233">For example, as I noted in my opening comments last week during the review of Nunavut Arctic College’s capital estimates, the government listened to our concerns and even made significant changes to the budget.</seg>
<seg id="234">I look forward to seeing more of this happening in the coming weeks and years, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="235">Mr. Speaker, over the past few weeks, members have asked a lot of questions on a daily basis.</seg>
<seg id="236">I think it’s quite obvious that we need to do more research on government spending.</seg>
<seg id="237">It’s not enough if we just audit the amount of money that is going out.</seg>
<seg id="238">I would like to ask for unanimous consent to conclude my statement, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="239">The member is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statement. Are there any nays?</seg>
<seg id="240">Mr. Main, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="241">Ms. Main: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="242">Mr. Speaker, I'm talking about examples of these trends.</seg>
<seg id="243">Mr. Speaker, this information needs to be made public in the Legislative Assembly so that we, as elected officials, can make informed decisions on whether or not any of the funds that are required should be increased, reduced, or disposed of, or removed from the program because of the lack of other sources of funding.</seg>
<seg id="244">Mr. Speaker, I will give you some examples.</seg>
<seg id="245">I think we can all agree that the government’s administration of the tax credit for hunters is lacking in the support that is provided to hunters.</seg>
<seg id="246">The Department of Environment, which administers the government’s Harvester Support Program, needs to carefully review its programs and how it can improve its targets for harvesters to support the cost of fuel.</seg>
<seg id="247">Mr. Speaker, I will also use another example of the government’s grants and contributions program.</seg>
<seg id="248">We know that the government has spent a lot of money on promotion and promotion.</seg>
<seg id="249">We know how much money has been borrowed from commercial enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="250">We know who received the funding.</seg>
<seg id="251">We don’t know what the actual purpose of this money was.</seg>
<seg id="252">We don’t know how many Inuit were hired from that fund and we don’t know what that money was used for.</seg>
<seg id="253">Mr. Speaker, as you know, I can’t speak for a long time, but I will stop there.</seg>
<seg id="254">I would like to add that I look forward to the budget process in the Legislative Assembly and I would like to take this opportunity to work closely with all of my colleagues to strengthen our budget in support of all communities and constituents.</seg>
<seg id="255">Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="256">104 – 5(1): Two More Elders Survivors for Care (Tootoo)</seg>
<seg id="257">Mr. Towtongie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="258">The residents of Rankin Inlet North and Chesterfield Inlet, I rise today to pay tribute to our oldest elder, Annie Tatty, who is travelling to Ottawa on scheduled flights.</seg>
<seg id="259">As well, one of our oldest elders, Amarok, when I stood up in the House today, is being sent to Gjoa Haven because there is no elder in Rankin Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="260">I would like to inform the people of Rankin Inlet North and Chesterfield Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="261">When I was elected in November, I was looking at the business plan and I asked a question on the top of health. Where are the plans for the implementation of an elders facility in Rankin Inlet or in Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="262">I was told by the Minister of Health and Social Services that all of us as Members of the Legislative Assembly feel very strongly about our elders.</seg>
<seg id="263">During the Pond Inlet session, this issue will be brought up.</seg>
<seg id="264">I'm waiting.</seg>
<seg id="265">A couple of days ago, I rose in the House to talk about the capital estimates and I didn’t see it. It’s set aside for elders’ facilities.</seg>
<seg id="266">I was told that I don’t have to talk about this because I have to stop.</seg>
<seg id="267">However, I was grateful to our chairperson, Allan Rumbolt, for allowing me to continue to express my feelings towards the elders’ facility.</seg>
<seg id="268">I rise today as an elected official to express my dissatisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="269">Sending elders out of the territory is not acceptable.</seg>
<seg id="270">In order to be a good MLA, we want to be a good government and we have told the elders that we should be proud of them, and we send them out of the territory.</seg>
<seg id="271">Member for Amittuq, Mr. Kownirk.</seg>
<seg id="272">105 – 5(1): Acknowledgement of Hall Beach and Igloolik Volunteer Search and Rescue (Health)</seg>
<seg id="273">Knowing (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thought I was forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="274">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to again express my pride in my fellow residents.</seg>
<seg id="275">The search and rescue teams work very hard when there is a search and rescue operation.</seg>
<seg id="276">They only use their own mode of transportation.</seg>
<seg id="277">I rise today to congratulate the community of Hall Beach’s search and rescue team: Chair Kyle Issigaitok, vice-chairperson George Innuksuk, and Director Martha Gibbons Tupik, when they have to go out on the land, Daniel Qaunaq.</seg>
<seg id="278">Our elder, Abraham Ullulaq, is an elder.</seg>
<seg id="279">He is the first person to go out on the land to do search and rescue. He is an elder and I am young.</seg>
<seg id="280">We should continue to provide support to our youth because our elders tell us the truth.</seg>
<seg id="281">We don’t think they’re going to be the future.</seg>
<seg id="282">Now I'm here. I'm always disappointed, but if I'm listening again.</seg>
<seg id="283">If you’re going out on the land, make sure that you have a safe trip.</seg>
<seg id="284">Mr. Speaker, I would also like to recognize the people of Igloolik who had a search and rescue meeting this week in Hall Beach and I would like to wish them a safe trip.</seg>
<seg id="285">With that being the case, Mr. Speaker, if you’re going to be travelling on a SPOT device, please ask the elders if I go anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="286">Things like that.</seg>
<seg id="287">The reason why I rise today is to reiterate that the search and rescue organizations have one snowmobile and they have repeatedly requested to the Department of Community and Government Services and they have never received a response.</seg>
<seg id="288">I would like to urge the search and rescue organizations to provide more support.</seg>
<seg id="289">That’s it.</seg>
<seg id="290">The last name on the list, Member for South Baffin, Mr. Joanasie.</seg>

<seg id="293">In Cape Dorset, they will be using the Sam Pudlat School and anyone will be welcomed to learn how to play music or to write songs.</seg>
<seg id="294">I would like to recognize the choir for their excellent singing, and I would like to thank them for allowing me to go to Cape Dorset, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and the Hamlet of Cape Dorset.</seg>
<seg id="295">There are none.</seg>
<seg id="296">Member for Quttiktuq, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="297">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="298">I would like to recognize four individuals in the Gallery.</seg>
<seg id="299">First of all, I would like to recognize the Director of National Parks in Nunavut, Jenna Burn, and her staff, and also my wife, Carol Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="300">I would like to take this opportunity to thank my sister, Naomi Kirkuk.</seg>
<seg id="301">I would also like to recognize an employee who is here for the students that are here. She is our daughter and she is always attending school in our daughter. I am very proud of her and I would like to welcome Jayden Natanine.</seg>
<seg id="302">I would like to give a brief overview.</seg>
<seg id="303">When I was a child, I was still a child...</seg>
<seg id="304">...It was my first time in a lake.</seg>
<seg id="305">I don’t think there were too many seals that were caught in the lake, but we were there on a very small island.</seg>
<seg id="306">They were very helpful and they were my grandparents.</seg>
<seg id="307">I would like to thank them for being able to come here.</seg>
<seg id="308">Mr. Uttak and your officials, welcome to your Legislative Assembly.</seg>

<seg id="310">Mr. Towtongie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="311">My parents in Ukkusiksalik, although my mother is now a park, were given pictures. I recognize all of you and we are grateful to our eldest.</seg>
<seg id="312">Also, from Igloolik, I used to stay with Teresa Uttak, who gave me a tea room, and Louie Uttak. Thank you for providing a very good food and I will be staying with you again.</seg>
<seg id="313">Thank you very much.</seg>

<seg id="316">Mr. Kamingoak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="317">I would like to recognize Naomi Kirkuk Kudluarok and Carol Akeeagok, they are my relatives.</seg>
<seg id="318">From Naomi from Grise Fiord, I don’t have relatives all day long.</seg>
<seg id="319">Please feel welcome to your Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="320">Member for Pangnirtung, Ms. Nakasuk.</seg>
<seg id="321">Mr. Nakasuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would also like to recognize and congratulate my husband, Andrew Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="322">Please welcome him to the Gallery.</seg>
<seg id="323">Mr. Nakasuk, welcome to our Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="324">Recognition of Visitors in the Gallery. I have no more names on my list.</seg>
<seg id="325">We will move on in our orders of the day.</seg>
<seg id="326">We will start with the Hon. Member for Iqaluit-Tasiluk, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="327">123 – 5(1): Private Sector Legislation (Hickes)</seg>
<seg id="328">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="329">My questions are for the Minister of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="330">Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask my colleagues to join me in the last two weeks and weeks to encourage our guardians to receive training in a more consistent manner.</seg>
<seg id="331">I would like to ask the minister if this government will be introducing legislation to deal with the issue of seismic testing.</seg>
<seg id="332">Minister of Justice, Minister Iqaqrialu.</seg>
<seg id="333">Hon. Jeannie Iqaqrialu (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker and I thank Mr. Hickes for the question.</seg>
<seg id="334">To date, the Government of Nunavut does not have a code of conduct for the intelligence officer.</seg>
<seg id="335">Our department is aware of the need for companies to provide security services in our communities, such as health centres.</seg>
<seg id="336">We are currently evaluating the policy development of the Nunavut Business Credit Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="337">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="338">As the minister is saying, one of the last jurisdictions in Canada that doesn’t have a private vest, we want to make sure that they have the right to be accountable to the private sector.</seg>
<seg id="339">All of the departments have brought forward legislation on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="340">My next question is: when they’re reviewing the policy, will there be a legislative proposal brought forward to the House?</seg>
<seg id="341">Mr. Iqaqrialu.</seg>
<seg id="342">Hon. Jeannie Iqaqrialu (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Mr. Hickes, yes, we can work on developing policies or regulations for the Business Incentive Policy.</seg>
<seg id="343">Your final supplementary, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="344">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="345">I thank the minister for his commitment.</seg>
<seg id="346">Mr. Speaker, at this point in time, I would just like to say that the Department of Justice is monitoring the enforcement of the RCMP and the enforcement of the guards. Does the Department of Community and Government Services work with the Department of Community and Government Services to coordinate the contract?</seg>
<seg id="347">Hon. Jeannie Iqaqrialu (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Policies or policies are prepared by the Department of Justice or any other department. When they draft policies, our department tries to involve them from the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="348">I don’t have that information in front of me, but I will look into it and get back to you.</seg>
<seg id="349">Question 124 – 2 (1): Status of Remediation Project in Baker Lake (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="350">Mr. Mikkungwak: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="351">My questions are for the Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="352">I have asked these questions to the minister last week in regard to not cleaning up the contaminated site in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="353">In one of the answers that we didn’t provide to me, the minister indicated that the “final report” was prepared and submitted to the Qulliq Energy Corporation.”"”</seg>
<seg id="354">Will the minister commit to providing a copy of this report to both the Hamlet Council of Baker Lake and as the MLA for the community?</seg>
<seg id="355">Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation, Minister Iqaqrialu.</seg>
<seg id="356">Hon. Jeannie Iqaqrialu (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Yes, Mr. Mikkungwak, I can commit to doing that.</seg>
<seg id="357">Your first supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="358">I thank the minister for that commitment.</seg>
<seg id="359">One of the things that the minister has brought up is the possibility of working with the Baker Lake Hamlet Council to clean up the remaining one. Mr. Speaker, I would be pleased to share that good news with the Hamlet of Baker Lake when I return to the community next week. I will encourage the hamlet staff to meet with the Qulliq Energy Corporation officials.</seg>
<seg id="360">Mr. Speaker, I don’t think it would be possible to do that because the Qulliq Energy Corporation’s storage facility is located in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="361">The minister indicated that the Qulliq Energy Corporation has already spent $1.68 million to date on the clean-up.</seg>
<seg id="362">Can he clarify how much it would cost to clean up the remaining one?</seg>
<seg id="363">Minister Iqaqrialu.</seg>
<seg id="364">Hon. Jeannie Iqaqrialu (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) The total cost of the clean-up would be approximately $10 million. The Power Corporation, as I mentioned earlier, is responsible for the damage caused by the creation of Nunavut and the federal government is responsible for the clean-up.</seg>
<seg id="365">We are committed to working with the Hamlet of Baker Lake to clean up the contaminated site.</seg>
<seg id="366">Your final supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="367">Mr. Speaker, in my last question last week, the federal government or the Government of Nunavut hasn’t finalized the rates yet.</seg>
<seg id="368">Mr. Speaker, I support the fact that the Qulliq Energy Corporation’s position on the issue of damages occurred during the time it was under the jurisdiction of the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="369">Will the Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation commit to working with the Minister of Justice to review and clarify the legal options that may be open to this issue?</seg>
<seg id="370">Hon. Jeannie Iqaqrialu (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Yes, as the Minister of Energy and the Department of Justice, we will work together to resolve this issue.</seg>
<seg id="371">Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, Mr. Lighthizer.</seg>
<seg id="372">125 – 5(1): School Leave Policy</seg>
<seg id="373">My questions are for the Minister responsible for the Public Service Act.</seg>
<seg id="374">In previous years, the most recent annual report of the Public Service of Nunavut indicated that a significant number of individuals took advantage of the attendance leave program.</seg>
<seg id="375">Unfortunately, the 2016-17 annual report did not include this information.</seg>
<seg id="376">Will the minister commit to providing this information to the House?</seg>
<seg id="377">Minister of Finance, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="378">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="379">It seems like he wants us to go through that annual report and I'm sure that it will be tabled throughout the year.</seg>
<seg id="380">I will look into the member’s request to see if it’s going to be there.</seg>
<seg id="381">Your first supplementary, Mr. Lighthizer.</seg>
<seg id="382">I would just like to ask the minister if he could provide that information to the House as to how many employees took advantage of the 2016-17 school year.</seg>
<seg id="383">Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="384">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you. (interpretation ends) The question has been taken as notice.</seg>
<seg id="385">Member for Pangnirtung, Ms. Nakasuk.</seg>
<seg id="386">126 – 5(1): Status of Old Pangnirtung Health Centre</seg>
<seg id="387">Mr. Nakasuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="388">My questions today are for the Minister of Community and Government Services.</seg>
<seg id="389">I have asked the minister about the old Pangnirtung Health Centre that is no longer in use after the new health centre was opened.</seg>
<seg id="390">The old health centre has not been used for a long time, but it has been closed for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="391">My question to the minister is: does the minister know what’s going to be happening with the old health centre?</seg>
<seg id="392">Minister responsible for Community and Government Services, Minister Kusugak.</seg>
<seg id="393">Hon. Lorne Kusugak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="394">I thank my colleague for asking that question.</seg>
<seg id="395">When the old buildings that were occupied by the government are no longer being used, it becomes a question to the department that manages the buildings and whether they want to use them for other government departments.</seg>
<seg id="396">The old health centre was built in 1975 in Pangnirtung and it went through that process.</seg>
<seg id="397">The Health Department doesn’t want to use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="398">We did consult with different government departments and we didn’t hear any requests for that.</seg>
<seg id="399">Based on the government’s procedures, we are now in the process of making plans for the hamlet council to see if they would like to see a correctional facility.</seg>
<seg id="400">If they didn’t want it, then we would go back to the non-profit communities.</seg>
<seg id="401">That’s the route that the government uses.</seg>
<seg id="402">That’s where we’re at right now.</seg>
<seg id="403">Your first supplementary, Ms. Nakasuk.</seg>
<seg id="404">If I understand correctly, they have been asked if the communities would like to take over. What is the status of that?</seg>
<seg id="405">Hon. Lorne Kusugak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="406">We haven’t heard from the government that they want it.</seg>
<seg id="407">At this time, we are in the planning stages to see if the hamlet would like to get that funding. We have reached that stage and we are planning to see if the hamlet would like to get that funding.</seg>
<seg id="408">That’s where we’re at right now.</seg>
<seg id="409">Your final supplementary, Ms. Nakasuk.</seg>
<seg id="410">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="411">I don’t know if the hamlet would be interested, but if it couldn’t go from there, what happens to the government’s buildings that are no longer being used?</seg>
<seg id="412">Thank you for asking that question.</seg>
<seg id="413">There are over four obstacles that we face.</seg>
<seg id="414">For example, the old Pangnirtung Health Centre was no longer wanted by the Department of Health and Social Services. We asked if it was wanted by other government departments.</seg>
<seg id="415">We will look into it to see if the hamlet wants it.</seg>
<seg id="416">That is what we use when we go through that process.</seg>
<seg id="417">Member for Aivilik, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="418">127 – 5(1): Department of Family Services Client Travel Policy</seg>
<seg id="419">Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I'm a seal.</seg>
<seg id="420">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="421">I would first like to say "good afternoon" to my constituents. Since I have been here since I haven’t had a good afternoon, I say "good afternoon" to them.</seg>
<seg id="422">We will be going home very soon.</seg>
<seg id="423">Mr. Speaker, it is regrettable that some of Nunavut’s most vulnerable individuals have to travel south for treatment while they are strangely away from their families.</seg>
<seg id="424">I agree with you that when you visit a family, it changes drastically.</seg>
<seg id="425">The Department of Family Services’ Client Travel Policy is on the government’s website dated June 2013 and came into effect on March 31, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="426">It has come to my attention that the former Minister of Family Services has committed to making changes to the department’s Client Travel Policy.</seg>
<seg id="427">Can the minister indicate if any changes to the department’s Client Travel Policy have been made since 2013 and, if not, will they make changes beyond March 31 of this year?</seg>
<seg id="428">Minister of Family Services, Minister Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="429">Hon. Joe Savikataaq: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="430">Mr. Speaker, I can’t speak to the former minister, but I can say that the policy will be in place until the end of March 2018 and it will remain in place until a new policy is changed.</seg>
<seg id="431">I haven’t heard from any of the officials in the Department of Family Services that they’re looking at changing the policy.</seg>
<seg id="432">If there are any changes that need to be made, we can look at it, but we can’t make any changes to the recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="433">If there seems to be a need for a change that is going to be beneficial to the clients and the government we can look into it.</seg>
<seg id="434">Your first supplementary, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="435">Mr. Netser (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker and thank you, Minister.</seg>
<seg id="436">The Department of Family Services’ Client Travel Policy states that an elder who is in the care of a social worker can visit two family members or their caregivers on an annual basis.</seg>
<seg id="437">Can the minister clarify whether or not this policy has been amended to allow for two visits per year to be conducted on a regular basis?</seg>
<seg id="438">Two return tickets, two trips at the same time or one visit twice.</seg>
<seg id="439">Just to be clear on the two returns one, two return tickets per year per possession.</seg>
<seg id="440">Your final supplementary, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="441">Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Will the minister commit to considering changes to the family travel for adults who are in foster care?</seg>
<seg id="442">The policy will be expiring very soon and at the end of the day, I can’t commit right now until we review the whole policy.</seg>
<seg id="443">I'm sure there will be a review done on all the travel costs that are paid by the Department of Family Services for medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="444">We will have to work with the Department of Health to make sure that the policies are being adhered to, but at this time, I can’t commit to anything else because the travel policy is going to be expiring.</seg>
<seg id="445">Member for Netsilik, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="446">128 – 5(1): Consultation with Patient Relations Office (Qirngnuq)</seg>
<seg id="447">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="448">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Health.</seg>
<seg id="449">Mr. Speaker, from time to time, a number of my constituents have come to my office in my community to seek assistance in dealing with their health issues.</seg>
<seg id="450">The minister often told me and even this week, he made a phone call that Nunavummiut can call the patient relations office if they have any concerns.</seg>
<seg id="451">Mr. Speaker, the language and where you live is the language, it creates barriers.</seg>
<seg id="452">Can the minister tell us what other avenues the patient relations office can be consulted?</seg>
<seg id="453">Minister of Health, Ms. Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="454">Hon. Pat Angnakak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="455">I understand your concern and we try to encourage people to call the toll-free number so that you can get a quick response.</seg>
<seg id="456">At this time, I don’t have the information in front of me, but it also has an electronic case management system.</seg>
<seg id="457">Your first supplementary, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="458">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) I don’t know if he answered my question, so I'll rephrase my question.</seg>
<seg id="459">Mr. Speaker, the Information and Privacy Commissioner has raised a number of concerns with respect to privacy issues, and I understand that there is a need to carefully address the issue of access to information in the event of a criminal offence.</seg>
<seg id="460">The ombudsman has a form that outlines complaints or concerns.</seg>
<seg id="461">However, if you don’t have a fax machine, you can’t send them on their own, and they don’t have all the computers to take pictures that will be sent on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="462">Can the minister clarify why the patient relations office is not allowed to receive faxes?</seg>
<seg id="463">An Hon. Member: Good question.</seg>
<seg id="464">Ms. Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="465">That’s a very good question.</seg>
<seg id="466">I think it’s because the bandwidth is decreasing out there as we move forward with the technology as a government, we’re using more computer hardware than the papers.</seg>
<seg id="467">According to my substantiation sheet, the government has a website that can be seen at www.patientrelations@gov.nu.ca. They all have health centres.</seg>
<seg id="468">If you want to fax out forms, you can send them out and the government liaison officers have staff in all the communities.</seg>
<seg id="469">They can be faxed to our headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="470">If the patient relations office didn’t have faxes, I would be able to find out why.</seg>

<seg id="473">Towtongie: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="474">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="475">Mr. Speaker, I would like to follow up on some of the questions that were asked by the Member for Kugluktuk in regard to income support.</seg>
<seg id="476">The minister indicated that the Income Support Program that the department will be signing a program application, is part of a successful program selection process.</seg>
<seg id="477">Can the minister clarify how the search for a proper selection process would be directed without a mandate?</seg>
<seg id="478">Minister of Family Services, Mr. Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="479">In regard to the report that the minister made on improving the selection process, I would think that if there’s no job available, yes, it doesn’t matter, but sometimes they have a very short job to do.</seg>
<seg id="480">If it’s appropriate for the department to go to the appropriate department, then they can get a job.</seg>
<seg id="481">Your first supplementary, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="482">Income support is a policy and not a policy of the Government of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="483">If it was a policy like a carving we wouldn’t be able to change it as Members of the Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="484">What I see is that when there’s no workload for a young person and they want them to sign an unemployed person on a monthly basis, they’re doing that on a monthly basis and they’re doing that on a monthly basis and they’re doing that on a monthly basis, so it’s embarrassing and it’s very embarrassing, even though the income support recipient has pulled out on top of the job.</seg>
<seg id="485">Can the minister clearly describe what kinds of Nunavut-specific policies can be developed for the smaller communities?</seg>
<seg id="486">He is acting like a model that doesn’t apply to Nunavut in the north.</seg>
<seg id="487">The policy is for Nunavut only.</seg>
<seg id="488">This program is only used outside of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="489">The Income Support Program was reviewed and the policy was changed.</seg>
<seg id="490">At this time, there is a lot of money available for income support recipients and the Child Benefit Supplement that is taken out of the Nunavut Income Support Program was reviewed and changed.</seg>
<seg id="491">They signed the contract and they will be looked at again and I share their feelings.</seg>
<seg id="492">If you don’t have a job, you won’t be able to get a job. However, we have to make sure that the benefits are properly selected. However, we will look into this issue.</seg>
<seg id="493">130 – 5(1): Mine Training</seg>
<seg id="494">Knowledge (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="495">I rise today to direct my question to the Minister of Economic Development and Transportation.</seg>
<seg id="496">Mr. Speaker, I firmly believe that when mining companies are trying to create jobs and if they are responsible for the environment, they create economic opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="497">I would like to direct my question to the minister. I would like to direct my question to the minister in regard to the apprenticeship program.</seg>
<seg id="498">Last year, you tabled the 2017-18 main estimates for the Department of Economic Development and Transportation, which included $200,000 in funding for the Nunavut Mine Training Program.</seg>
<seg id="499">Can the minister provide an update on how much funding has been expended for the 2017-18 fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="500">Mr. Speaker, I hope I was understandable.</seg>
<seg id="501">Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="502">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="503">I also thank the member for his question.</seg>
<seg id="504">What I can say is that it doesn’t list all of the mine training.</seg>
<seg id="505">The department is working with the Department of Family Services, Nunavut Arctic College, the federal government, our mining industry, and Inuit organizations to develop a number of programs to prepare Nunavummiut for opportunities in the mining sector. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="506">Your first supplementary, Mr. Knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="507">Kownirk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="508">I thank the minister for that answer.</seg>
<seg id="509">I wonder if the Department of Finance will be increasing or decreasing the budget for the 2018-19 fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="510">Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="511">I can’t respond to that question at this time, but I'm sorry if I can go back to the member’s question about how the $200,000 has been spent.</seg>
<seg id="512">The Kitikmeot Corporation received $61,000 for this project, as well as the Qikiqtani Inuit Association Literary Program for the Baffin region, $60,000, and the Arviat Hamlet Employment Preparedness Program, $78,000 for heavy equipment training.</seg>
<seg id="513">Thank you for clarifying my question.</seg>
<seg id="514">Mr. Speaker, as you may have noted last week, a group of mines named Arctic Eric Mines brought me to the table.</seg>
<seg id="515">They are going to be doing a drilling near Hall Beach this spring.</seg>
<seg id="516">I wonder if the minister and the Department of Economic Development and Transportation can work with Arctic Air, not just the mining companies, to see what kind of training opportunities they can provide to the people of my community or the High Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="517">Mr. Speaker, I would like to add that Hall Beach is a small community and there is going to be a lot of money spent on mining. I would like to thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="518">You also stated that you will be providing support to the mining companies.</seg>
<seg id="519">Mr. Speaker, what I'm trying to ask is: will you be able to ensure that the funding that you mentioned, for example, for the Mary River project?</seg>
<seg id="520">There is the Mary River project in the Baffin region, Kivalliq region, gold projects, and in the Kitikmeot region, they’re dealing with gold projects.</seg>
<seg id="521">Will these be properly addressed?</seg>
<seg id="522">For example, as an Inuk, if I want to get a higher education, how can I be trained and how can the Department of Economic Development and Transportation provide assistance?</seg>
<seg id="523">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would like to thank the member for asking a very good question because the Department of Economic Development and Transportation is not responsible for that.</seg>
<seg id="524">I think it’s important to recognize that the mining industry varies from industry to industry. I think it’s important to recognize that there are different types of mining that are being developed.</seg>
<seg id="525">Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="526">Oral Questions.</seg>
<seg id="527">Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Maine.</seg>
<seg id="528">131 – 5(1): Support for Hospital Staff</seg>
<seg id="529">Ms. Maine (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="530">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Health.</seg>
<seg id="531">Let me start by saying that my question is related to many communities, not just my community.</seg>
<seg id="532">I think it’s a Nunavut-wide issue, especially for our nurses and the people who work at the health centres.</seg>
<seg id="533">Mr. Speaker, if the nurses know that they’re overworked, it’s one of the reasons why they’re overworked in English because there’s too much work to be done by the nurse.</seg>
<seg id="534">The reason why we don’t have enough staff is because we don’t have enough staff and we don’t have enough staff to fill those positions.</seg>
<seg id="535">It’s quite obvious that this causes a lot of problems.</seg>
<seg id="536">I hope I was understandable because I'm speaking in Inuktitut and I hope you understood me.</seg>
<seg id="537">Let me say it in English. (interpretation ends) Mr. Speaker, the number of positions in the department is increasing due to a lack of staff and the number of positions in the department is increasing.</seg>
<seg id="538">My question for the minister: can the minister tell the House what steps his department has taken to provide additional support to health centre staff in the communities who have a lot of work to do?</seg>
<seg id="539">Minister of Health, Ms. Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="540">I thank the member for that very important question.</seg>
<seg id="541">The issue of staffing at the health centre is very important and we have been working very hard as a department to make sure that we don’t have enough staff at the health centre.</seg>
<seg id="542">I hope that’s the case, but we don’t have enough.</seg>
<seg id="543">I know that there is a lot of arms on the nurses.</seg>
<seg id="544">Our department does what it can and does what it can.</seg>
<seg id="545">We just did that in the community, when the nurse was tired, we sent additional nurses to support them.</seg>
<seg id="546">With that information, the nurse sends a nurse out if there is too much work to be done.</seg>
<seg id="547">In the case of nurses, whether it’s vacation or sickness, when the nurse is in that situation, we look at where they can get an escort from one community to another.</seg>
<seg id="548">In terms of the recruitment of nurses, we don’t want to see a decrease in the number of nurses that are providing health care in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="549">Your first supplementary, Mr. Maine.</seg>
<seg id="550">Ms. Main: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="551">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="552">I think we’re all concerned about the department’s staffing statistics. For example, in my two communities, it’s obvious that there are too many vacant positions in the health centres.</seg>
<seg id="553">We have a vacancy rate of 70 percent in Arviat of 44 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">I know that it’s a challenge and it’s a challenge.</seg>
<seg id="555">I would now like to ask the minister if he could describe some of the challenges that his department faces in ensuring that there are adequate staff at community health centres that are always very busy.</seg>
<seg id="556">Minister Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="557">After 30 months, we can’t take care of them when they’re trained and it’s not new. It’s very hard to be a nurse in the community.</seg>
<seg id="558">We have to look at how we provide support to the communities. We have been working very hard to resolve this issue.</seg>
<seg id="559">Your final supplementary, Mr. Maine.</seg>
<seg id="560">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="561">In other words, Mr. Speaker, we know that there are problems in the communities. There is always a lot of work to do and there is always a shortage of staff at the health centres.</seg>
<seg id="562">I would like to get clarification on exactly what is being done to address the problems in the communities. What is being done and what is the view of the people who are experiencing these problems in the communities?</seg>
<seg id="563">What measures are being taken to ensure that our nurses and other health care professionals are being supported by the department?</seg>
<seg id="564">Hon. Pat Angnakak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="565">Just to be clear but I don’t have a list of operations.</seg>
<seg id="566">For example, if we’re open for emergencies, they can’t make appointments when they’re too busy or if there’s too many nurses that have gone out for whatever reason.</seg>
<seg id="567">In our department, as I said earlier, we’re trying to fill all the positions and it’s very challenging because we’re competing with the rest of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="568">That’s what we’re trying to do. I know that they work with people from the north who have experience in the north, not just in the north but in northern Manitoba.</seg>
<seg id="569">I know that the Department of Health and Social Services is well aware of what our nurses are doing.</seg>
<seg id="570">It’s not an easy thing to do, but I have to work on it and if you have any ideas, please let me know.</seg>
<seg id="571">132 – 5(1): Insurance Policy on Government Assets (Hickes)</seg>
<seg id="572">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="573">My questions are for the Minister of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="574">As we all know, Mr. Speaker, every community in Nunavut has a wide range of infrastructure, such as airport terminals, health centres, schools, and office space.</seg>
<seg id="575">My question to the minister is: when it comes to insurance, is that infrastructure one-on-one or is it on a case-by-case basis based on needs?</seg>
<seg id="576">Minister of Finance, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="577">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Our insurance premiums vary depending on what the infrastructure is.</seg>
<seg id="578">Each of our infrastructure has different policies and some of them don’t even have policies. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="579">I recently saw on the news that some of our communities were trying to get another school burned down.</seg>
<seg id="580">The Department of Finance and the Department of Finance are trying to resolve the issue of infrastructure with adequate insurance coverage. We learned that our own bill for Arctic Bay is $10 million.</seg>
<seg id="581">What impact will it have on the insurance industry if there is another fire in the school? (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="582">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Today, for insurance, there’s a $10 million increase to $20 million for schools that have experienced fires.</seg>
<seg id="583">We continue to encourage the Department of Education and all of us to make sure that these things are very expensive and it’s unfortunate that they’re trying to burn them.</seg>
<seg id="584">I think we all have to try and show that we can continue to work on safety issues. We have to make sure that we’re doing a better job because we have to show that our own expenses are increasing and that we have our own insurance coverage. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="585">Yes, I understand that I'm scared of the fact that there are communities that have insurance coverage for half of the costs.</seg>
<seg id="586">I asked a question.</seg>
<seg id="587">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="588">This new $20 million is for school fires.</seg>
<seg id="589">Schools and other buildings have to pay $1 million themselves.</seg>
<seg id="590">There are different things.</seg>
<seg id="591">I cannot say how many schools would have to be burned down, they are no longer insured.</seg>
<seg id="592">I hope that we don’t have a fire in this government and I appreciate the fact that all Members of the Legislative Assembly have to keep pushing for it because it’s a school for our children and the public...</seg>
<seg id="593">Not only for the schools, but also for the health centres, these are very important services that we provide.</seg>
<seg id="594">Any damage is a challenge to our clients and I would like to continue to push for these buildings.</seg>
<seg id="595">So, Mr. Speaker, a reminder.</seg>
<seg id="596">It’s a public building. It’s a public building. It’s a public building. It’s a public building. It’s a public building. It’s a public building.</seg>
<seg id="597">I applaud the member for bringing this issue to the House. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="598">133 – 5(1): Expansion of Training Opportunities in Baker Lake (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="599">I would like to direct my questions to the Minister responsible for Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="600">Mr. Speaker, as I noted in my Member’s Statement, the fifth Legislative Assembly of Nunavut has the opportunity to take a new step towards a brighter future for Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="601">Can the minister tell the House if he would be willing to reopen the idea of establishing a university in your community in partnership with the private sector and others?</seg>
<seg id="602">Minister responsible for Nunavut Arctic College, Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="603">I thank the Member for Baker Lake for his question.</seg>
<seg id="604">With respect to Nunavut Arctic College, we put out a request for proposals from different universities outside of Nunavut to see how we can work together.</seg>
<seg id="605">We have heard from various organizations, such as Agnico-Eagle, that they want to establish a university for Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="606">We have wanted this to go ahead, but to date, we have been trying to come up with an agreement with other entities outside of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="607">I believe that we need to provide funding for education and training to increase the number of Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit in the Piqqusilirivvik Cultural School.</seg>
<seg id="608">I feel that Baker Lake would be a great place for expansion.</seg>
<seg id="609">Can the minister clarify whether she and her officials have had discussions with the board of governors of Nunavut Arctic College to focus on opportunities for higher education to be delivered in Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="610">Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="611">At Nunavut Arctic College, we would like to see more opportunities for Nunavummiut to take post-secondary education in their communities. One of the things that we have been increasingly aware of is the Internet access program.</seg>
<seg id="612">One of the things that the member mentioned is how we can expand the programs that we can offer at that time.</seg>
<seg id="613">Yes, the college’s board of governors will be involved, along with my staff, the president of Nunavut Arctic College, and the vice-president of the college. They will be preparing their plans to move forward on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="614">Your final supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="615">Mr. Mikkungwak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation) I recognize that the previous government approved a recommendation that Nunavut Arctic College should not be tabled at that time.</seg>
<seg id="616">Will the minister commit to revisiting this issue and report back to the House on his findings?</seg>
<seg id="617">Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="618">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thank Mr. Mikkungwak for the question.</seg>
<seg id="619">The option of building a university in Nunavut is widely considered by the public.</seg>
<seg id="620">Agnico Eagle has also been able to come up with $5 million to build a new university if there is a demand here.</seg>
<seg id="621">I think the discussions are still ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="622">In the next four years, I don’t know if we’re going to want to go through that route. Once the feasibility study is done, that would be part of the review.</seg>
<seg id="623">Members will note that the time for question period has expired.</seg>
<seg id="624">Mr. Maine.</seg>
<seg id="625">015 – 5(1): Extension of Question Period (McLean)</seg>
<seg id="626">Pursuant to Rule 39 (7), I move, seconded by the Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, that question period be extended. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="627">The motion is in order and the motion is not debatable.</seg>
<seg id="628">All those in favour of the motion, please raise your hand.</seg>
<seg id="629">Opposed.</seg>
<seg id="630">As a result, we have extended oral questions for 30 minutes starting from now.</seg>
<seg id="631">Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Maine.</seg>
<seg id="632">134 – 5(1): Grants and Contributions</seg>
<seg id="633">Ms. Main: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="634">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Environment.</seg>
<seg id="635">I rise today to talk about the Department of Environment’s support programs for hunters and I would like to know how they benefit our hunters.</seg>
<seg id="636">In reviewing the government’s main estimates for 2017-18, there are three main items.</seg>
<seg id="637">Let me speak in English so that I can make it clear that there are three grants that the Department of Environment administers for disaster compensation, the Wildlife Damage Compensation Program, and the Fur Pricing Program.</seg>
<seg id="638">The department has been allocated $150,000 for this year.</seg>
<seg id="639">Mr. Speaker, I would first like to ask if the minister can describe how his department evaluates the effectiveness of its programs in managing these programs.</seg>
<seg id="640">Minister of Environment, Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="641">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="642">It’s three times a year and you just recently put out a tender at the beginning of March. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="643">Your first supplementary, Mr. Maine.</seg>
<seg id="644">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="645">Mr. Speaker, the information that has been provided to the House in recent years is something that I really wanted to see, and I think it’s something that the hunters and trappers need to see.</seg>
<seg id="646">In 2011, the Department of Environment reported that the Fur Pricing Program went to an auction of $800,000.</seg>
<seg id="647">In 2012, it was $1.1 million and in 2013, it was $1.04 million.</seg>
<seg id="648">Mr. Speaker, can the minister provide us with an update on the sealing strategy this year? I would like to get the latest information from this year or last year to see if it’s still a good investment.</seg>
<seg id="649">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation) I have a copy of your reading.</seg>
<seg id="650">I can’t say where they are at right now because I don’t have the latest bids.</seg>
<seg id="651">I can tell you that after the Aqsarniit Middle School sales have increased, I'm sure that will be the case, and at that time, we will be able to find out when the auction of sealskins is going to be held. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="652">Your final supplementary, Mr. Maine.</seg>
<seg id="653">I also thank the minister.</seg>
<seg id="654">This will be my final question, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="655">I wonder if the Department of Environment can consider providing more funding to our hunters so that they can provide more support.</seg>
<seg id="656">With respect to fox pelts, we are well aware of that as Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="657">I believe that the funding that is used for one year is too small, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="658">I think it’s too small.</seg>
<seg id="659">I would like to ask the minister if he agrees with me and if he can look into this in the coming months.</seg>
<seg id="660">I agree with you and I look forward to tabling that increase in the House if you will support it.</seg>
<seg id="661">135 – 5(1): Compensation for Damage to Hunters and Trappers (Keyootak)</seg>
<seg id="662">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Environment.</seg>
<seg id="663">Mr. Speaker, as we are all aware, in Nunavut, hunters are very damaged, especially by polar bears. They destroy their cabins and their equipment is totally obsolete and their snowmobiles are destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="664">Mr. Speaker, there is usually a compensation program for damages, but it’s very difficult to replace the damaged equipment.</seg>
<seg id="665">Has the funding for damaged property been depleted this year?</seg>
<seg id="666">Minister of Environment, Ms. Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="667">I'm sorry, I didn’t hear all of them.</seg>
<seg id="668">Can he repeat his question?</seg>
<seg id="669">Speaker (interpretation): Please rephrase your question, Mr. Keyootak.</seg>
<seg id="670">Our equipment, snowmobiles, and cabins are damaged by polar bears, especially when we are away from them.</seg>
<seg id="671">We all know that there are compensation programs for damages that have occurred during our abandonment.</seg>
<seg id="672">My question was have these current year’s budget for damages already been expended?</seg>
<seg id="673">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you for clarifying that.</seg>
<seg id="674">Minister of Environment, Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="675">Your first supplementary, Mr. Keyootak.</seg>
<seg id="676">The minister said that he would respond once he has that information.</seg>
<seg id="677">Can the minister indicate which communities in the Baffin, Kivalliq, and Kitikmeot regions have been used for this program?</seg>
<seg id="678">Yes, I will provide the breakdown.</seg>
<seg id="679">136 – 5(1): Early Childhood and Early Childhood Development (Hickes)</seg>
<seg id="680">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Education.</seg>
<seg id="681">This afternoon, the Minister of Education indicated that all licensed childcare facilities will be able to receive additional licences based on their location.</seg>
<seg id="682">I'm just wondering how much they’re looking at providing to licensed daycare facilities.</seg>
<seg id="683">Minister responsible for the Housing Corporation, Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="684">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="685">I thank Mr. Hickes for the question.</seg>
<seg id="686">The Department of Education’s cabinet approved a multi-year agreement for a three-year term. Three years later, it’s broken down into four different categories.</seg>
<seg id="687">If I'm asking you to be clear on how much it costs, operations and maintenance in the amount of $1.1 million per year, it’s broken down by that year.</seg>
<seg id="688">That’s the numbers that I have.</seg>
<seg id="689">I thank the minister for that explanation.</seg>
<seg id="690">Mr. Speaker, when I look at the Child Day Care Act in Nunavut, section 17 of the Early Childhood Education Act, it states that all employees who provide day-to-day child care services must be fully trained. This is one of the expectations that I have.</seg>
<seg id="691">Mr. Speaker, I know that the Early Childhood Education Program is being delivered by Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="692">I'm just wondering: are they monitored to see if they’re doing their job properly?</seg>
<seg id="693">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also thank Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="694">Training is part of the agreement for a three-year term.</seg>
<seg id="695">The $1.1 million is outside of the O&amp;M budget.</seg>
<seg id="696">We would like to get more certified teachers in the early childhood education program.</seg>
<seg id="697">We want to increase the number of apprentices and we will be looking forward to that in the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="698">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="699">I look forward to getting that information to the House on a regular basis.</seg>
<seg id="700">When I look at the daycare staff and the curriculum that is available, I keep hearing that when the staff are trained, it seems like they are more effective in training.</seg>
<seg id="701">Mr. Speaker, I also hear concerns about the low-income child care workers who work in daycare centres.</seg>
<seg id="702">When it comes to providing the same level of education to our children in early childhood, it is very important to ensure that there is no such thing as a stable workforce.</seg>
<seg id="703">The purpose of the grants and contributions is to help the daycare workers make better wages so that they can work there as full-time employees, rather than working there.</seg>
<seg id="704">I agree wholeheartedly with Mr. Hickes and I understand and agree with him that we want children to be well prepared. We want them to have a good education and to succeed in life before they enter the school system.</seg>
<seg id="705">That’s what we’re trying to do and that’s what we’re trying to do to provide support to daycare workers.</seg>
<seg id="706">One of the agreements that we have with the parents is that as long as they don’t increase the cost of providing daycare services, I think we can do what we can to make sure that the staff at the daycare are paid effectively to meet their needs.</seg>
<seg id="707">What we’re trying to do right now is to have daycare workers in all of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="708">Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Maine.</seg>
<seg id="709">137 – 5(1): Inuit Employment Requirements for Government Contracts (McLean)</seg>
<seg id="710">On Friday, March 16, I asked the Minister of Community and Government Services about this issue and I also asked the minister for more information on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="711">The Inuit employment rate is the highest in the government.</seg>
<seg id="712">Mr. Speaker, the minister and I seem to agree that he was in support of increasing Inuit employment.</seg>
<seg id="713">Is this 20 percent related to the work that was done on the Baffin Correctional Centre and the docking facilities in Iqaluit and Pond Inlet?</seg>
<seg id="714">If I understood you correctly, Mr. Speaker, these are 20 percent and 15 percent.</seg>
<seg id="715">Can the minister provide an update on how the department can change the number of bids to increase the number of bids and whether or not the department has the authority to do so?</seg>
<seg id="716">Minister responsible for Community and Government Services, Minister Kusugak.</seg>
<seg id="717">I think the member understands that when it’s being dealt with by the Department of Community and Government Services, the Department of Community and Government Services assists the departments that are going to be doing the tendering.</seg>
<seg id="718">If it’s going to be a docking facility, the Department of Economic Development and Transportation, if we’re talking about a correctional facility, the Department of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="719">We work with the contractors to make sure that the contracts are adhered to. We provide assistance to them because we don’t have any control over that.</seg>
<seg id="720">We work with the client departments and they try to determine how many Inuit can be employed.</seg>
<seg id="721">We try to make sure that we don’t over-expenditures because we try to make sure that we don’t over-expenditures and we work with the departments.</seg>
<seg id="722">At this time, I can’t say that after the tender has been released, I don’t think it’s possible to change it, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="723">That’s my question.</seg>
<seg id="724">If there’s a change in the tendering process, if it’s impossible, then I wonder if there’s going to be other programs that will be made available to Inuit.</seg>
<seg id="725">Can the Department of Community and Government Services work on this?</seg>
<seg id="726">I hope I was understandable, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="727">Can the minister tell me, perhaps, and tell the House why employees from other communities, when they want to work in the construction of a new public housing unit, can employees from Nunavut also receive the same benefits as employees from outside of Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="728">Hon. Lorne Kusugak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="729">I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="730">Mr. Speaker, the NNI Contracting Appeals Board conducts an evaluation of the issues and sets out the Inuit labour content requirements:</seg>
<seg id="731">the scope of work;</seg>
<seg id="732">Inuit available to work on the basis of their qualifications;</seg>
<seg id="733">There are other community-based programs that could affect the availability of Inuit employment.</seg>
<seg id="734">Mr. Speaker, we encourage contractors in the communities to hire local workers from the regions before they can hire outside of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="735">That’s why we encourage people who come to Nunavut to look for staff.</seg>
<seg id="736">We encourage that.</seg>
<seg id="737">As well, we work very closely with our client departments to achieve these goals.</seg>
<seg id="738">Your first supplementary, Mr. Maine.</seg>
<seg id="739">Ms. Main: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I thank the minister for that answer.</seg>
<seg id="740">This will be my last question. I would like the minister to commit to working with his department on major projects.</seg>
<seg id="741">Will the minister commit to working with the service providers in those departments to ensure that job opportunities are created and that Inuit are able to apply for employment in construction projects from outside of the communities, from the regions, from Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="742">Will the minister commit to ensuring that this option is taken into consideration in order to ensure that Nunavut residents are included in the contracting process?</seg>
<seg id="743">I believe that the Government of Nunavut as a whole encourages the public to find employment in Nunavut first.</seg>
<seg id="744">That’s what we always have in place and that’s what we will continue to do.</seg>

<seg id="789">Moving on, Mr. Akeeagok, do you have witnesses that you would like to bring to the table?</seg>
<seg id="790">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Yes, if I can, I would like to have my officials with me at the witness table.</seg>
<seg id="791">Chairman (interpretation): Does the committee agree to bring in the witnesses?</seg>
<seg id="792">Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the witnesses in.</seg>
<seg id="793">Mr. Akeeagok, for the record, please introduce your officials.</seg>
<seg id="794">On my left is my Assistant Deputy Minister, Don Carroll.</seg>
<seg id="795">Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to appear today to present Bill 2, Interim Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, 2018-19.</seg>
<seg id="796">This bill will come into force. As a government, we are requesting your department to spend $491,804,000 between April 1, 2018 and June 30, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="797">Mr. Chairman, over the past year, the Minister of Finance has been here for a full fiscal year. However, as the fifth Legislative Assembly of Nunavut, we are still preparing our business plans.</seg>
<seg id="798">With that being the case, at this time, the 2018-19 budget that we’re planning for, what we’re going to be doing for the fiscal year 2018-19, when we’re planning the budget, we’re going to be going to Eyeloo in the spring sitting in May and June.</seg>
<seg id="799">To that end, Mr. Chairman, the interim appropriations will allow the department to fulfill its mandate to provide services to Nunavummiut over the coming months.</seg>
<seg id="800">The issue of attendance is the need to allocate funding after this year’s general election.</seg>
<seg id="801">Mr. Chairman, all of our departments and territorial corporations have had an opportunity to review these interim appropriations. Our calculations are based on departmental expenditures and expenditures over the past four years.</seg>
<seg id="802">Mr. Chairman, we are satisfied that this amount will be sufficient for the operations of the Legislative Assembly after the review of the department’s review and passage of the annual budget.</seg>
<seg id="803">These are the two pieces of legislation that we are proposing to fund:</seg>
<seg id="804">$8.62 million for the Office of the Legislative Assembly;</seg>
<seg id="805">$11.66 million for the Department of Executive and Intergovernmental Affairs;</seg>
<seg id="806">$29.08 million for the Department of Finance;</seg>
<seg id="807">$49.1 million for the Department of Family Services;</seg>
<seg id="808">$32.44 million for the Department of Justice;</seg>
<seg id="809">$10.77 million for the Department of Culture and Heritage;</seg>
<seg id="810">$64.1 million for the Department of Education;</seg>
<seg id="811">$85.77 million for the Department of Health’s Additional Offices;</seg>
<seg id="812">$8.32 million for the Department of Environment;</seg>
<seg id="813">$82.73 million for the Department of Community and Government Services’ Old Government Services;</seg>
<seg id="814">$23.29 million for the Department of Economic Development and Transportation’s headquarters;</seg>
<seg id="815">$73.39 million for the Nunavut Housing Corporation; and</seg>
<seg id="816">$12.54 million for Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="817">Mr. Chairman, that concludes my opening comments.</seg>
<seg id="818">At this time, we are open to any questions or comments.</seg>
<seg id="819">Do members have any general comments?</seg>
<seg id="820">Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="821">Mr. Towtongie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="822">I was reading the Inuktitut version. $32.44 million for the Department of Justice in Inuktitut, $32.44 for the Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="823">There is a difference in the Inuktitut version of $8.62 million. Is that $8.62 million for the Office of the Legislative Assembly or is that for the Department of Justice?</seg>
<seg id="824">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Just for clarification, the Office of the Legislative Assembly is requesting an interim appropriation of $8.62 million and the Department of Justice is seeking $32.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="825">I apologize if the translation wasn’t correct, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="826">The English version is correct.</seg>
<seg id="827">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="828">It’s just a question on the interim appropriation. We’re not in percentages, so we’re looking at the expenditures and the allocation of funds for elections.</seg>
<seg id="829">Mr. Speaker, I know that there was a lot of debate on financial management and the minister has indicated that there are some fundamental changes that need to be made in order to provide accurate departments with the services that they need to deliver to Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="830">It’s not directly related to this bill, Mr. Chairman, but it’s very relevant to this bill.</seg>
<seg id="831">Has there been any change in the way the money is allocated to the next budget?</seg>
<seg id="832">Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="833">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you for the question.</seg>
<seg id="834">To date, there has been no real change in the operations and maintenance budget, but I'm sure that we will see the capital budget process in the fall. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="835">Are there no more general comments?</seg>
<seg id="836">If members have any questions on the minister’s opening comments, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="837">If not, we will proceed with the clause-by-clause review.</seg>
<seg id="838">Go to Bill 2 in your white legislation binder.</seg>
<seg id="839">Bill 2, Interim Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="840">Chairman: Clause 2. Agreed?</seg>
<seg id="841">Chairman (interpretation): Go to Schedule on page 2 in Inuktitut. Schedule. Interim Appropriation for April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="842">Vote 1: Operations and Maintenance. Interim Appropriation. $491,804,000.</seg>
<seg id="843">Thank you, Mr. Main, do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="844">Ms. Main: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="845">I should have brought this up earlier, but I have a question on departmental grants and contributions.</seg>
<seg id="846">It’s my understanding that the numbers are based on a percentage of the annual budget, but some of the grants and contributions that are used are already used for the whole year. As soon as April 1st, they will be depleted.</seg>
<seg id="847">I just want to get some clarification on the grants and contributions. Is it Economic Development and Transportation or the Nunavut Housing Corporation? How do you deal with that when the money is not for a whole year, but some of the programs are administered annually?</seg>
<seg id="848">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="849">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): That’s a very good question.</seg>
<seg id="850">Under the budget allocation process, as I indicated in my opening comments, over the last four years, the department has been looking at some of the three-month first and foremost grants and contributions.</seg>
<seg id="851">I can say that the Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation are one of the largest departments. You see in here that their grants and contributions are for operations.</seg>
<seg id="852">When it comes to requests, if they have to go through a proposal process, then the departments have different processes and that’s what we’ve been doing over the last four years in each department. The expenditures are reviewed quarterly and the Department of Finance agrees with each department on how the grants and contributions are done.</seg>
<seg id="853">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="854">I guess my follow-up question would be: can the minister indicate if there has been an ongoing process for these programs or are there any suspensions that have been put on hold or are they just going to follow the normal procedures?</seg>
<seg id="855">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="856">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) The departments are operating the same way.</seg>
<seg id="857">Tomorrow, hopefully, with the work that we have to do to look at the future budget, we were able to set up the Fifth Legislative Assembly. We have been given direction by the departments. For the next three months, it will be the same. In May, we will be looking at those projects again.</seg>
<seg id="858">Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="859">I'm sorry. Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="860">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome, minister and your officials.</seg>
<seg id="861">In the main estimates, there is $491,804,000 above that.</seg>
<seg id="862">First of all, for clarification purposes, in the bill, $8,623,000 and in the minister’s opening comments, it states $8,262,000.</seg>
<seg id="863">The $3,000 didn’t say anything, but the total amount seems to have been $54,000.</seg>
<seg id="864">Why is that the case?</seg>
<seg id="865">That’s my question.</seg>
<seg id="866">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="867">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="868">The bill is page three in Inuktitut and we’re trying to get the actual numbers approved.</seg>
<seg id="869">Those are the actual numbers.</seg>
<seg id="870">As I stated in my Member’s Statement, I have reduced the numbers in English to the main estimates. That’s what I have stated. I don’t want to say all of the decreases.</seg>
<seg id="871">The numbers that we’re looking at in the bill are accurate, but they don’t always mention them.</seg>
<seg id="872">Total Interim Appropriation. $491,804,000. Do you agree?</seg>
<seg id="873">Clause 5. Do you agree?</seg>
<seg id="874">Chairman: Do members agree to Bill 2 as a whole?</seg>
<seg id="875">Do members agree that pursuant to Rule 62 (2) that Bill 2 can immediately be placed on the orders of the day for third reading?</seg>
<seg id="876">Mr. Akeeagok, do you have any closing comments?</seg>
<seg id="877">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to thank my officials for preparing this so that they can keep our government operational until June.</seg>
<seg id="878">I thank all Members of the Legislative Assembly for their support in approving this budget. I look forward to sitting in this House when we’re dealing with all of our budget in May and June.</seg>
<seg id="879">I thank you all.</seg>
<seg id="880">That’s it for Bill 2.</seg>
<seg id="881">I would now like to ask the minister if he can proceed with his opening remarks on Bill 3.</seg>
<seg id="882">Bill 03 – Supplementary Appropriation (Operations &amp; Maintenance) Act, No. 3, 2017-2018 – Consideration in Committee</seg>
<seg id="883">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="884">I will keep my officials here, and I would like to let you know that when we go to other areas, I have additional staff available. When we need to, I would like to invite them, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="885">Mr. Chairman, can I begin with my opening comments?</seg>
<seg id="886">I am here to present Bill 3, An Act to Amend the Operations and Maintenance Act, 2017-2018, No. 3. Through this bill, the government is seeking to increase its budget by $56,602,000 for the following purposes:</seg>
<seg id="887">$49 million for the Department of Health to cover over-expenditures in the areas of health care, medical travel, mental health, treatment, elder care, long-term care, medical care, and tuberculosis surveillance;</seg>
<seg id="888">$6.2 million for the Department of Justice to address over-expenditures in the areas of law enforcement, corrections, and justice; and</seg>
<seg id="889">$1,422,000 in over-expenditures for child and family services and banking services.</seg>
<seg id="890">Mr. Chairman, that concludes my opening comments. I would be pleased to answer any questions or comments that members may have.</seg>
<seg id="891">Are there any general comments?</seg>
<seg id="892">Supplementary Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) 2017-18, No. 3, Family Services. Not Previously Authorized.</seg>
<seg id="893">Total Children and Family Services. $1,402,000.</seg>
<seg id="894">I just saw the number in the substantiation sheet, but it still doesn’t give me a good idea as to where you’re focusing on.</seg>
<seg id="895">Mr. Savikataaq, can you answer that question?</seg>
<seg id="896">Hon. David Savikataaq: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="897">I don’t have the breakdown of the numbers in front of me, but there are two of them. We do send more people out of the territory to care for them. We also have more visits outside of the territory.</seg>
<seg id="898">For example, there is an elder from Igloolik, somewhere in Gjoa Haven, who is in Ottawa so that the ticket can visit, so that they can visit.</seg>
<seg id="899">They don’t get assistance from the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="900">There are a lot of elders who are sent out of the territory because they can’t be assisted in Nunavut. As I stated earlier, there are more people visiting the communities.</seg>
<seg id="901">When you’re combining some of the elders’ programs that the Department of Family Services has to deal with since the elders’ programs were transferred back to the Department of Health, are you still working on elders programs under the Department of Family Services?</seg>
<seg id="902">Some of the things that the minister mentioned are not specifically under Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="903">Some of them are in the care of the Department of Health and Social Services, some of them are in the care of the elders, and when they want to visit them, there is money available through the Department of Family Services for medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="904">That’s one of the examples I was using. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="905">I understand that some of the clients that are in foster care are in the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="906">My question is: are there still elders who are receiving social services that have not been transferred to the Department of Health?</seg>
<seg id="907">Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="908">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) According to the information that I have, the transfers that were supposed to be made to the Department of Health have been transferred to the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="909">It’s still under the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="910">Looking at the information and looking at our business plan, I believe all of them have been transferred to Family Services. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="911">Maybe I'm a little confused, but if the Minister of Family Services can clarify that, I would appreciate it.</seg>
<seg id="912">It’s up to Mr. Akeeagok if he wants to redirect the question.</seg>
<seg id="913">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): I'll try and explain it.</seg>
<seg id="914">I thought the question was: are there still people in the Department of Health and Social Services who have to be in the Department of Family Services?</seg>
<seg id="915">My response was that the Department of Health and Social Services is here right now, the elders’ programs are there.</seg>
<seg id="916">They are in Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="917">The supplementary appropriation request is specific to the Department of Family Services. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="918">I thank the minister for that clarification.</seg>
<seg id="919">Now I understand better.</seg>
<seg id="920">Maybe I'll rephrase my question in a more understandable way.</seg>
<seg id="921">Does the Department of Family Services still have anything to do with elders?</seg>
<seg id="922">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): There is still some work to be done on elders, so I would like the Minister of Family Services to clarify that.</seg>
<seg id="923">I am aware of the government’s programs, such as the Senior Fuel Subsidy Program, the Income Assistance Program, the Senior Fuel Subsidy Program, and the Income Support Program. I'm sure that the Department of Family Services is responsible for over 60 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="924">If I missed anything, Minister Savikataaq can assist me in responding to the question. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="925">I thank both ministers for clarifying that.</seg>
<seg id="926">My last question.</seg>
<seg id="927">When people are sent outside of Nunavut, do they still receive income support from outside of Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="928">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Through you, I would like Minister Savikataaq to respond to that question. (interpretation) Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="929">Chairman: Thank you, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="930">It varies depending on the situation.</seg>
<seg id="931">In some cases, they are eligible for income support, but I can’t say that they’re all the same.</seg>
<seg id="932">I have detailed questions for the department.</seg>
<seg id="933">They have indicated that they will be giving out surplus funds from other departments.</seg>
<seg id="934">As it is right now, does the other departments that are here support all of Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="935">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): It has nothing to do with the regions.</seg>
<seg id="936">As well, in the Department of Family Services, most of that was transferred to the Department of Health and Social Services for income assistance.</seg>
<seg id="937">They don’t get a lot of income support. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="938">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="939">If you’re going to be transferring funds from different departments, when do you identify potential debts and how do you deal with the debt?</seg>
<seg id="940">I'm not sure if that has an impact on our meeting, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="941">The department reports on a monthly basis and at the end of the fiscal year, it’s a little over-expenditure for the departments to re-establish their budgets. If they can’t do that, then we have to go through the supplementary appropriation process.</seg>
<seg id="942">We’re on page 4.</seg>
<seg id="943">Mr. Maine.</seg>
<seg id="944">The paper in front of us states that they are in residential care according to the growth of the population. There were 189 people in residential care, 243.</seg>
<seg id="945">Do you think the numbers will continue to increase?</seg>
<seg id="946">What accounts for the increase in the number of clients requiring care?</seg>
<seg id="947">Are you aware of the reasons for the increase in the number of clients?</seg>
<seg id="948">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) The number of clients is increasing in 2013 and that’s why we’re following the increase.</seg>
<seg id="949">I'm just wondering if that’s going to be included in the budget right now, starting from last year’s budget. I don’t want to be in a position to approve a supplementary appropriation so that you can have a accurate budget.</seg>
<seg id="950">Will that be included?</seg>
<seg id="951">It’s going to be obvious that when we go page by page, it’s going to be obvious that we’re going to be talking about changes and if we don’t keep up with our budget, then we look at our budget.</seg>
<seg id="952">Those are some of the questions that we will be asking during the main estimates. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="953">In your information provided by your department, it says that there is a surplus.</seg>
<seg id="954">It also mentions the department’s recent income assistance reform.</seg>
<seg id="955">I'm just wondering if the minister could indicate where the surplus was spent in the Department of Executive and Intergovernmental Affairs. Is it the income support worker’s office that was depleted or is it going to be more money that is going to be given to the income support workers?</seg>
<seg id="956">What was the increase for?</seg>
<seg id="957">I'm trying to understand where the surplus went, where was it spent?</seg>
<seg id="958">Is the income support money going to be repaid or is it going to increase the income support money? Where did the surplus go?</seg>
<seg id="959">Chairman: Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="960">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) There are a number of issues with the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="961">They have been hired to administer all of their functions from one department to another and some of these people started working on what they’re doing and how they work.</seg>
<seg id="962">Under the Income Support Reform Program, there was funding for that program and the government’s response was that residential care clients are sent out of the territory for different types of care.</seg>
<seg id="963">There are a number of factors that contribute to how the Department of Family Services has arrived at its budget shortfall for the current fiscal year. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="964">I'll leave it at that.</seg>
<seg id="965">Information provided by the department indicates that the department spends a significant portion of its budget on income support, which indicates that it spends more money on income support.</seg>
<seg id="966">Will the money that is requested be used for staff or will it be used for income support?</seg>
<seg id="967">My colleague, Mr. Savikataaq, can respond to that question better.</seg>
<seg id="968">Mr. Savikataaq, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="969">The Income Support Program has a significant impact on the funding that is available.</seg>
<seg id="970">The Child Benefit Supplement was deducted from the income support payments.</seg>
<seg id="971">The Child Benefit Supplement will no longer be the case now. The income support recipients will receive more money than the income support recipients and the families will no longer be deducted from their child tax benefits.</seg>
<seg id="972">We are on Total Children and Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="973">Not Previously Authorized. $1,402,000.</seg>
<seg id="974">Justice. Operations and Maintenance. Not Previously Authorized.</seg>
<seg id="975">Total Justice. $2,600,000.</seg>
<seg id="976">Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="977">Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="978">Welcome, Madam Minister.</seg>
<seg id="979">It states here that the purchase of new drugs will be made under the Act to Amend the Pharmacy Act from the federal government. Is that in the plans for this coming summer?</seg>
<seg id="980">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Like you, Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask that my witness be replaced by the Deputy Minister of Justice to go to the witness table and remove my deputy minister, so I'll take that out first and respond to the member’s question.</seg>
<seg id="981">Does the committee agree to bring in the witness?</seg>
<seg id="982">Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the other witness in.</seg>
<seg id="983">For the record, Mr. Akeeagok, please introduce your witness.</seg>
<seg id="984">On my left is the Deputy Minister of Justice, Bill MacKay.</seg>
<seg id="985">If it’s okay with you, I can respond to the question.</seg>
<seg id="986">Mr. Chairman, that’s a very good question on the Department of Justice with respect to the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="987">This has nothing to do with marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="988">We don’t want the pharmaceuticals that are prescription drugs in Canada to come to Nunavut, but these are new drugs that we need to learn and implement.</seg>
<seg id="989">During the December finance ministers’ meeting, this funding will be provided through the Non-Insured Health Benefits Program. Approximately 25 percent of the funding from the federal government will be directed to the RCMP to monitor drug use.</seg>
<seg id="990">There are two parts to that.</seg>
<seg id="991">I thank the minister for that response.</seg>
<seg id="992">My next question is in regard to the high cost of housing in the communities.</seg>
<seg id="993">I'm just wondering if the minister could explain why it’s in there.</seg>
<seg id="994">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="995">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) This relates to the fact that the RCMP hired nine additional RCMP officers in different communities and that’s why they provide staff housing.</seg>
<seg id="996">When there is an additional RCMP member, we have to go through a contract with the government to get housing. The additional costs were $300,000. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="997">Mr. Maine, did you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="998">Ms. Main: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="999">The minister talked about the $2.6 million in the breakdown of the $300,000 for housing.</seg>
<seg id="1000">Could you break it down a little bit more detail?</seg>
<seg id="1001">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation) Maybe I might be missing a number.</seg>
<seg id="1002">I will ask my officials to answer that question.</seg>
<seg id="1003">Those are the numbers that we have.</seg>
<seg id="1004">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1005">I would like to thank the minister for his response. (interpretation ends) The $1 million is going to be used for vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1006">Why didn’t you expect these vehicles to be purchased?</seg>
<seg id="1007">I think it should have been included in this budget.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Was the reason for the purchase of new vehicles?</seg>
<seg id="1009">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. That’s a very good question.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This $1 million is for vehicle replacements.</seg>
<seg id="1011">We have a contract with the RCMP and they deal with different needs.</seg>
<seg id="1012">Last year, the department’s vehicles did not receive much replacement due to a lack of funding.</seg>
<seg id="1013">They were trying to prevent that, but this year, the vehicles were damaged because they had to purchase what they needed.</seg>
<seg id="1014">That’s why there’s a significant increase this year.</seg>
<seg id="1015">They didn’t buy too much, but their equipment is deteriorating all the time.</seg>
<seg id="1016">With respect to the RCMP contract, if you purchase a product, we don’t buy one another.</seg>
<seg id="1017">When we talk to them about funding, they come to an agreement and that’s why it seems like it’s going up too much.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Ms. Main: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1019">It also states here that my colleague is talking about this.</seg>
<seg id="1020">These are new drugs that are probably the most dangerous drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1021">Will the equipment that is going to be used for studies be made available to all the communities or just some of them?</seg>
<seg id="1022">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Yes, all the RCMP officers will be getting this equipment for all the communities.</seg>
<seg id="1023">Those are the new positions that we’re looking at for the RCMP and the general public. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1024">In regard to the drugs that are most dangerous, if there are new drugs that are available in English, when they start finding tea in our communities, has this been planned or if there are no drugs available in any of the communities? Where have the RCMP been located to date?</seg>
<seg id="1025">It’s very disappointing to see people coming into our communities and I hope that they will stop.</seg>
<seg id="1026">However, the communities have been impacted twice and the emerging nations are going to be coming up here in the Northwest Territories.</seg>
<seg id="1027">It’s very dangerous and I'm afraid that they’re going to be trying to get drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1028">If you don’t get those things, it’s a lot easier to do but these emergences are dangerous and I'm very pleased that the RCMP are in the planning stages.</seg>
<seg id="1029">Ms. Main: I thought I was done.</seg>
<seg id="1030">That’s my last question.</seg>
<seg id="1031">I'm just wondering if you could clarify the lack of housing in the communities in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1032">According to the documents that we have provided, there are nine additional RCMP officers in nine of the six communities in Nunavut that have been decentralized. There have been different needs for housing.</seg>
<seg id="1033">That was just a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1034">Moving on, Mr. Hickes, do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the $2.6 million that you’re requesting, it talks about interpreters going to court and seven judges. Did you also need interpreters from the courts?</seg>
<seg id="1036">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation) No, at this time, there are quite a few more interpreters when it comes to hiring. I think it’s important that we have trained interpreters in the Department of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1037">I'll leave it at that. In the minister’s opening comments, he talks about the need for new telephone systems to be maintained.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Knowing that they’re going to have to replace their current telephone system, will they be allocating new funds or will they be asking for additional funding once they know the number from the RCMP?</seg>
<seg id="1039">Yes, it’s in the planning stages for the department and we will be requesting funding for that. That’s what we’re planning on doing.</seg>
<seg id="1040">The business plan for the Department of Finance was there as well as the Public Service Ministers, but if the RCMP's plan is to pass the Pharmacy Act, as my colleague has mentioned, for driver’s licences, it’s in the planning stages, but there’s nothing in here that’s going to provide additional funding for marijuana. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Under the other correctional facilities, overtime and overtime, as the member is referring to, there’s a full-time staff at the Baffin Correctional Centre. What is the total number of staff at the Baffin Correctional Centre?</seg>
<seg id="1042">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1043">Did he say that there were eight?</seg>
<seg id="1044">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to ask another question. Under the information that I have on overtime, it states that when the Baffin Correctional Centre is struggling, it costs $180 thousand. I'm just wondering if that’s a mistake in the job description, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Can the minister clarify that?</seg>
<seg id="1046">Through you, I would like Deputy Minister MacKay to respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1047">Mr. MacKay: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1048">The nurse in charge, the guardians, there are a lot of people who work in other areas. If it’s bad weather, they have to stay there, so it adds to the overtime.</seg>
<seg id="1049">When there’s a blizzard, they can’t go home. The staff said that there’s going to be another employee coming to work. Do they double their staff when there’s a blizzard?</seg>
<seg id="1050">Mr. MacKay, can you please clarify that?</seg>
<seg id="1051">Yes, there are two types of blizzards. If there is a blizzard, they are sent right away and there are two types of employees who work in the blizzard.</seg>
<seg id="1052">Mr. Lighthizer.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Mr. Lighthizer (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1054">My questions are for the Minister of Justice. First of all, the RCMP has indicated that you will need housing for nine new RCMP officers.</seg>
<seg id="1055">When they hire RCMP officers, do they get housing separately?</seg>
<seg id="1056">I'm happy to say that one of my staff, just playing hockey on Friday with one of his colleagues, I'm sure it’s going to be fine, so my deputy minister can’t write a letter.</seg>
<seg id="1057">It’s going to have to be whispered.</seg>
<seg id="1058">My question is in regard to the nine RCMP officers. The RCMP receives housing from the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="1059">As I stated earlier, we work with the RCMP through contracts.</seg>
<seg id="1060">I would like to make it clear that 70 percent of the RCMP costs are paid by the Government of Nunavut and 30 percent is paid by the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="1061">The RCMP is contracted to the federal government. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1062">Mr. Lighthizer (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1063">I'm just wondering if the RCMP is going to provide housing for all the RCMP officers.</seg>
<seg id="1064">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) When the RCMP sends an employee to a community, how long does it take for them to be in the community?</seg>
<seg id="1065">They don’t keep their officers on the land because they’re out on the land.</seg>
<seg id="1066">They don’t think they’re going to get their own housing in the communities at any given time, depending on how many RCMP members they’re going to need, they’re provided housing in the communities.</seg>
<seg id="1067">The RCMP operates on a case-by-case basis.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When a community identifies a need for a new RCMP member, the community tries to include all 25 communities as soon as possible. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1069">It’s unfortunate that the RCMP doesn’t make it a part of the community.</seg>
<seg id="1070">When the RCMP receives their own home, how does the RCMP provide assistance?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Lynch.</seg>
<seg id="1072">I don’t think anyone should be asking that question here.</seg>
<seg id="1073">I don’t think we should expect them to own their own homes and that’s why they are provided with housing.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Mr. Akeeagok, if you would like to make a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1076">Those were very good comments, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Yes, the RCMP, even though they only stay in the community for three years, is involved in raising the community.</seg>
<seg id="1078">If an RCMP officer wants to get housing, they are asking the federal government for housing.</seg>
<seg id="1079">It’s not through our federal government. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1080">This will be my last question with respect to the RCMP, how much of that contract is for the RCMP?</seg>
<seg id="1081">Schedule of the bill. Page 5. Total Operations and Maintenance. $40,071,000.</seg>
<seg id="1082">If approved, it will be $42,671,000 for this contract. (interpretation) Thank you. (interpretation ends) For the 2017-18 fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="1083">Thank you for that information.</seg>
<seg id="1084">The third item is the Corrections Division’s overtime and casual staffing.</seg>
<seg id="1085">Chairman (interpretation): Mr. Lynch, we’re just on Law Enforcement. We haven’t gotten there yet. Can you wait for your questions?</seg>
<seg id="1086">We’re on Law Enforcement. (interpretation ends) Are there any further questions on Law Enforcement?</seg>
<seg id="1087">Mr. Lighthead: Yes, last one for Law Enforcement.</seg>
<seg id="1088">According to the minister’s letter, there was a total of $40 million in legal fees, $30 million, which is expected to be $42 million.</seg>
<seg id="1089">How is the $42 million projected to be spent by the end of the fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="1090">Perhaps if I could ask my colleague which figures he is looking at.</seg>
<seg id="1091">If there is a figure, I would like to get some assistance. I sent a letter on Friday, I think I found $30 million, but if he could elaborate further on that.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The letter dated March 16 addressed to the Chair of the Regular Members’ Caucus, which the Minister of Finance provided to me.</seg>
<seg id="1093">The letter that I'm referring to is on page 4 and it’s on page 4.</seg>
<seg id="1094">I would also like to thank the member for asking that question.</seg>
<seg id="1095">The $30 million has been spent to date and the plan is $42 million.</seg>
<seg id="1096">The RCMP has a report on their expenditures and how much they’re going to spend. The $2.6 million that we’re requesting is based on the numbers that we have in the RCMP. That’s what I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1097">I'm looking at $2.6 million for Project 1 in the member’s substantiation sheet, it indicates that the RCMP operates on a long-term basis with audiovisual equipment. At the top, it also indicates that in the past, it’s requested.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The Legislative Assembly is proposing to improve the administration of the program. However, due to the unique nature of the operation, it is required to provide an additional $2.6 million to cover the costs of staff training in the area of employee training, recruitment and retention, and industrial industries.</seg>
<seg id="1099">It talks about $2.6 million for additional staff and casual wages. On the same page, $2.6 million is being announced that they have a newer radio station.</seg>
<seg id="1100">Can you clarify that, Mr. Chairman?</seg>
<seg id="1101">This question was already asked by one of my colleagues, but Mr. Akeeagok, if you would like to elaborate further, it’s up to you.</seg>
<seg id="1102">If you look at the other paragraph, Program 3, it states $2.6 million for Corrections.</seg>
<seg id="1103">There are two separate items. It says $2.6 million, but it’s separate.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It’s in regard to the RCMP radio stations, the need for housing, the need for vehicles, and the various emergency situations that were there. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1105">I also thank Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="1106">If we’re talking about $2.6 million, what’s the total amount? I don’t understand that. Could the minister clarify that for me?</seg>
<seg id="1107">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="1108">On page 5 of our business plan, we’re dealing with law enforcement, $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1109">In addition to that, there’s $2.6 million for Corrections. We’re not dealing with the whole issue at this time. We’re dealing with $2.6 million for law enforcement.”"”</seg>
<seg id="1110">Do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1111">Mr. Towtongie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for clarifying that.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Looking at the Inuktitut version, in English, it’s the main estimates. In Inuktitut, it seems like it’s an estimate.</seg>
<seg id="1113">Can the minister clarify what this means in the main estimates for 2017-18?</seg>
<seg id="1114">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) To my left is talking about the $40 million Law Enforcement Branch, $11 million. (interpretation) That’s what we’re talking about.</seg>
<seg id="1115">To my right is not previously authorized and we’re still in the 2017-18 fiscal year. You’re projecting that to be able to go over that amount and that’s why we’re trying to get approval from the Legislative Assembly for the supplementary appropriation for the Department of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1116">A total of $6.2 million is for the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="1117">That’s what we’re requesting from the Legislative Assembly. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1118">I just got confused because it sounds like they’re guessing in Inuktitut, they’re estimates.</seg>
<seg id="1119">I'm almost understanding my question, so I'm done.</seg>
<seg id="1120">We’re on Law Enforcement. $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Next we have Total Registries and Court Services, $1 million.</seg>
<seg id="1122">Total Corrections, 2 million 600 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Mr. Lighthizer: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1124">My question is in regard to corrections and it’s an annual over-expenditure. If memory serves me correctly, it’s just overtime for the Baffin Correctional Centre.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Is that correct?</seg>
<seg id="1126">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1127">The member is correct. The majority of the overtime is for casuals and casuals.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Mr. Lighthizer: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Now, if memory serves me correctly, the correctional facilities are 12 hours a year. Is that correct?</seg>
<seg id="1130">Given the fact that the current facilities are always full and overtime, has the department considered three or eight hours of work, and would it not be possible to make that adjustment?</seg>
<seg id="1131">Perhaps through you, Mr. Chairman, I'll have Deputy Minister MacKay respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The member is correct that there are 12 hours of work.</seg>
<seg id="1133">That’s how it’s set up. It’s a two-hour, 42 hours a week, and it’s going to be overtime after 42 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1134">Under the collective agreement, the overtime was reduced to $4 million and now it’s $2.49 million.</seg>
<seg id="1135">As a result, the Corrections Division’s deficit was $4.5 million and now it’s $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1136">We are moving forward with the overtime and we will continue to do that.</seg>
<seg id="1137">I remind all members to turn off your cellphones and silence them.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Mr. Lighthead: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1139">It’s overtime and it’s 42 hours a week.</seg>
<seg id="1140">Do employees work 50 or 60 hours a week?</seg>
<seg id="1141">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This is quite detailed and we have to provide it to the House and we will provide it in writing.</seg>
<seg id="1143">My deputy minister can’t answer that question.</seg>
<seg id="1144">We don’t have that information.</seg>
<seg id="1145">I don’t think I know how much information is required for the operation of the facility.</seg>
<seg id="1146">I would like to ask these questions.</seg>
<seg id="1147">What kind of training do they receive?</seg>
<seg id="1148">Through you, Mr. Chairman, I would like Deputy Minister MacKay to respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1149">I think that answers the member’s question. There is training and development in supplementary expenditures under the court system.</seg>
<seg id="1150">At this time, we don’t provide training.</seg>
<seg id="1151">We have a training contract with a contractor and it costs a lot of money to replace the overtime and that’s why we’re putting an increase in the cost of training.</seg>
<seg id="1152">We are also looking at other ways to better plan the budget so that the staff at the correctional facilities and the courts can be better trained so that we don’t have less contractors.</seg>
<seg id="1153">Ms. Nakasuk.</seg>
<seg id="1154">I wanted to know when the $2.6 million was being talked about and the training of staff.</seg>
<seg id="1155">What kind of training are you going to provide to the staff and the casual employees?</seg>
<seg id="1156">Both the corrections division and the court system provide excellent training for casuals and staff.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The casuals are hired on a contract basis, but they’re going to be trained for a number of weeks and they’re trained by the corrections officers, for example, to deal with disputes with the employees. They teach them what to do.</seg>
<seg id="1158">Can the minister indicate what kinds of programs the Corrections Division has in place or should I not be asking questions about it?</seg>
<seg id="1159">I don’t know if they have that level of detail, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="1160">I would like Deputy Minister MacKay to elaborate on what’s happening in the High Arctic, if you will allow me.</seg>
<seg id="1161">Ms. MacKay.</seg>
<seg id="1162">I don’t have the numbers in front of me, but I can get back to the member on what kind of training is provided to inmates.</seg>
<seg id="1163">Depending on which of the low-risk inmates, including the Iqaluit International Airport, are receiving pre-employment training to enable them to work in correctional facilities and provide training to inmates so that they can complete their sentences.</seg>
<seg id="1164">The Akausisarvik facility provides programs based on the needs of each inmate, addictions counselling, and so on, and so forth, and so forth, depending on what the offender needs are and what the sentence is for.</seg>
<seg id="1165">Even though they can’t leave the prison, they are given training so that they can work after the prison, so that they can complete their high school education, and they also receive trades training at the correctional facility.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The community of Rankin Inlet does provide support to inmates.</seg>
<seg id="1167">There are different types of programs that we provide.</seg>
<seg id="1168">Mr. Nakasuk: I'm done.</seg>
<seg id="1169">We are on page 5.</seg>
<seg id="1170">Justice. Operations and Maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="1171">Total Department. Not Previously Authorized. $6,200,000.</seg>
<seg id="1172">Turn to page 6.</seg>
<seg id="1173">Department of Health. Operations and Maintenance. Not Previously Authorized.</seg>
<seg id="1174">Mr. Akeeagok, would you like to make a comment?</seg>
<seg id="1175">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): It’s not a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1176">If it’s okay with you, we will move on to another department. The witnesses are available to answer questions. I would like to take a moment to change my witnesses before any questions are asked. (interpretation ends) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1177">I was going to give you an opportunity, but at this time, if you would like to do so, it’s okay.</seg>
<seg id="1178">Sergeant-at-Arms, at this time, you can change the officials.</seg>
<seg id="1179">Does the committee agree to bring in the witness?</seg>
<seg id="1180">Chairman (interpretation): Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort one witness out.</seg>
<seg id="1181">For the record, Mr. Akeeagok, please introduce your new witness.</seg>
<seg id="1182">He just walked in, on my left, the Deputy Minister of Health, Colleen Inuujaq Stockley.</seg>
<seg id="1183">Operations and Maintenance. Not Previously Authorized. Total Directorate. $5.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Mr. Netser: My mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1185">I will be asking questions when it comes to travel.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1187">Are there any questions under the directorate.</seg>
<seg id="1188">I don’t have too many questions, but when we’re talking about elders’ facilities in Nunavut, there are three facilities that will be funded by various elders.</seg>
<seg id="1189">A couple of days ago, when I was asking questions about the pre-feasibility study in Igloolik and Gjoa Haven, they’re looking at the possibility of expanding the elders’ facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1190">At that time, the minister didn’t know how many beds there would be for the study.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Can the minister update us today on the status of increasing the number of elders’ care facilities in Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="1192">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you for the question.</seg>
<seg id="1193">This year, it’s under the preplanning stage. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1194">What is the status of this preplanning and what is the status of it now?</seg>
<seg id="1195">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): With your permission, Mr. Chairman, I would like the Deputy Minister of Health to respond because he knows more about the capital estimates.</seg>
<seg id="1196">The Department of Health had already planned for last year’s capital estimates for 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1197">I would like to ask the minister if they can proceed with the expansion of the Igloolik facility.</seg>
<seg id="1198">Just to keep that in mind, after the election, I'm sure that the government had a new mandate, so I'm just wondering if there would be an option for expansion in Igloolik.</seg>
<seg id="1199">It hasn’t gone very far, but we expect that further action will be taken once we know what the government’s mandate is.</seg>
<seg id="1200">In conclusion, when we talk about the use of government resources to identify deficiencies in our infrastructure, I would like to emphasize that the department is responsible for the delivery of the government’s programs in the area of elder care.</seg>
<seg id="1201">I am optimistic that progress is being made in revitalizing the existing facility and identifying opportunities across the territory to provide a wide range of opportunities for new infrastructure to address current waiting lists.</seg>
<seg id="1202">It’s more of a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1203">I would like to follow up on my colleague’s question about the operations of the elders’ homes.</seg>
<seg id="1204">I would be interested to know the breakdown of the $900,000.</seg>
<seg id="1205">What infrastructure will be allocated to each of these communities?</seg>
<seg id="1206">The $900,000 is divided into three regions, with a total of $300,000 each for the three elders’ facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1207">Ms. Main: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation) I'm just wondering, as it states here, these units are for non-profit Nunavut organizations.</seg>
<seg id="1208">What is the process by the Department of Health and Social Services to inform them if they’re going to be over-expending?</seg>
<seg id="1209">The three communities that are run by the government, not by the government, have just recently issued new contracts and that has been part of that process.</seg>
<seg id="1210">If there is a need to increase or decrease, the Department of Health and Social Services meets with the organizations.</seg>
<seg id="1211">When they have to come up with solutions, they work together.</seg>
<seg id="1212">They are complying with federal and territorial laws.</seg>
<seg id="1213">It states here that the three newly opened homes, 2 and 3, require high-level residential care. There are a number of factors that indicate that the majority of these homes require more care and aging.</seg>
<seg id="1214">Going back to the budget, are there any projections over the next few years that the cost of operating the facility will continue to increase or are we going to have a limited amount of money now?</seg>
<seg id="1215">At the beginning of the contract, three of them were dealt with by the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="1216">The Department of Health’s contract only took over in April 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1217">One of the things that we brought to the attention of the Department of Health and Social Services was that it wasn’t the same as the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="1218">One of the recommendations was the Nutrition North Canada Program.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When we looked at the contract, the elders’ facilities weren’t able to meet the needs of the elders.</seg>
<seg id="1220">So we’re looking at a deficit of $855,000 last year and that’s why we’re asking for nearly $900,000 right now. That’s why we’re doing that.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Please correct me if I'm wrong, when I look at the funding for mental health services across Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1222">At this time, we have traumatic situations.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Is there any talk about setting aside some money for mental health treatment?</seg>
<seg id="1224">We’re here, we’re just talking about additional funding for operations and maintenance. We’re not talking about actual costs.</seg>
<seg id="1225">I don’t think it’s appropriate to have this House or any other way.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Do you have any further questions, Ms. Towtongie?</seg>
<seg id="1227">Thank you for clarifying that.</seg>
<seg id="1228">With respect to the mental health contract for 2017-18, $16.7 million, I believe it’s $6.2 million. What is the status of that?</seg>
<seg id="1229">That’s my last question Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1230">Mr. Chairman, we’re dealing with $5.9 million and the amount that the member is asking about is included in the $43.1 million.</seg>
<seg id="1231">That’s the details of the $16 million and $10 million that’s in there.</seg>
<seg id="1232">I would like the deputy minister, Mr. Stockley, to explain the details of this $10 million increase. I would like him to respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1233">It’s very good to hear that Nunavummiut are asking for help and that information is to call your health centre and ask each other online.</seg>
<seg id="1234">There is an increase in the demand for treatment and that’s why there’s an increase in the number of people going to treatment centres.</seg>
<seg id="1235">I know that they have mental health problems and addictions.</seg>
<seg id="1236">There are also costs that are outside of the Department of Health and Social Services. The Department of Justice is responsible for the court circuit for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Before we proceed to the Directorate, we will take a five-minute break.</seg>
<seg id="1238">&gt;&gt;Committee recessed at 18:03 and resumed at 18:10</seg>
<seg id="1239">I would like to call the committee meeting back to order.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Total Health Care Service Delivery. $43,100,000.</seg>
<seg id="1241">Out-of-territory long-term care, you have identified a need for dementia care.</seg>
<seg id="1242">I believe that would increase because we don’t have a dementia monitoring centre in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1243">That’s what I'm interested in.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Are they looking at doing this to have a dementia research centre in Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="1245">It’s one of them right away, but it’s not at the top of the list.</seg>
<seg id="1246">They are working on mental health issues and they have been larger than they are at this time.</seg>
<seg id="1247">On the same page, outside of Nunavut, the last paragraph in regard to out-of-territory hospitals, the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="1248">I was a little appalled by the minister’s letter that the breakdown of his department didn’t include in the budget the over-expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Is his department going to be spending all of its money in this area?</seg>
<seg id="1250">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On page 6, the first item is $5.9 million. It’s not previously authorized. It’s for out-of-territory long-term care for elders in the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The Department of Health has identified that as part of this year’s adult care program, we are requesting $5.9 million for the adult care program to be delivered to the appropriate facilities. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1252">My question is more related to the Department of Health’s over-expenditures in other areas of the budget.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Perhaps through you, if I make a mistake, Deputy Minister Stockley will correct me.</seg>
<seg id="1254">However, with respect to what is being carried over from the Department of Health and Social Services, I don’t know what is being used for, but I can respond by saying that the over-expenditures have not been taken out of the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="1255">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you for the clarification.</seg>
<seg id="1256">These funds have not been used within the department, so we transfer the funds that have not been used.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The balance for the Department of Health is $49 million.</seg>
<seg id="1258">The letter that I just sent today will be translated today in English which was sent out on Friday and the appendix doesn’t have any numbers on the over-expenditures and savings. If you look at the substantiation sheets, which ones are being planned.</seg>
<seg id="1259">That’s a very small amount and looking at the over-expenditures that we’re asking for in this supplementary appropriation. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1260">I appreciate the fact that you mentioned the appendix within the department, but I was referring to the letter that we received from the minister on page 4. There is a breakdown of the various programs and funding.</seg>
<seg id="1261">Under Family Services, they are showing a surplus that they will be able to use.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The Department of Health hasn’t done that, so I'm wondering why.</seg>
<seg id="1263">The Department of Health and Social Services has not identified any surpluses.</seg>
<seg id="1264">On page 5, it indicates that the Department of Health will require $49 million. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1265">The member is not referring to the regional operations of the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="1266">I know that in the Department of Health, there has been a regional surplus in the Nursing Recruitment and Retention Strategy and IT. There has been over $1 million in savings over the last few years.</seg>
<seg id="1267">Can the minister provide us with a breakdown of all the Department of Health programs that are left over when there is a deficit?</seg>
<seg id="1268">You’re asking for very detailed information that may not be available at this time.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Minister Akoak...</seg>
<seg id="1270">...Mr. Akeeagok, please.</seg>
<seg id="1271">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for recognizing me.</seg>
<seg id="1272">We don’t have that level of detail with us.</seg>
<seg id="1273">We can table it in the House at a later date. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1274">I'll move on to the elders’ facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1275">In the second bullet, it indicates that the current elders facilities are operated under contract with non-profit Nunavut organizations.</seg>
<seg id="1276">I would just like to say that this is a very good tool for any Nunavut organization.</seg>
<seg id="1277">I hope that they can contract as many contracts as possible.</seg>
<seg id="1278">I'll move on to something else. Turning to the pie chart, the 24-hour elders care, it states that the Department of Health provides 24/7 housing in accordance with the Department of Health and Social Services’ policies.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The elders have to be governed according to the legislation, as the minimum standards are outlined.</seg>
<seg id="1280">My question to the Minister of Health is: are the elders’ facilities meeting minimum standards?</seg>
<seg id="1281">I responded to that earlier.</seg>
<seg id="1282">There has been an increase in the number of contracts that the Department of Health has issued with respect to compliance requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1283">If there is a non-compliance, the interpreters and the Department of Health meet with each other to make sure that they’re following the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1284">Mr. Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="1285">Can you clarify whether or not these elders’ facilities should meet the minimum level of care?</seg>
<seg id="1286">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1287">This is a new contract and we have increased it by $900,000 to $5.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="1288">They have indicated that they’re going to be trying to keep up with the needs of the elders, but they haven’t really reached the level of care that they need.</seg>
<seg id="1289">As the minister indicated, they’re trying to catch up with that. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Mr. Netser: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1291">The glass is getting too quiet now.</seg>
<seg id="1292">With respect to medical travel, they are requesting $50 million and I have mentioned this many times in the House for medical patients who don’t have an appointment, especially in my constituency, when they go to Winnipeg, they find out that they don’t have an appointment.</seg>
<seg id="1293">Does the Department of Health have a list of patients that went down to Winnipeg that were cancelled because they weren’t informed about their appointments, does the Department of Health have a list of those costs and how much it cost for the patients that didn’t have an appointment, the tickets, the accommodations, and the costs of that? (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1294">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman and I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="1295">The Minister of Health has committed to reviewing all of the patients that have not been seen or changed in terms of appointments.</seg>
<seg id="1296">That’s one of the things that the government wants to do. It’s something that has been identified and we’re going to try and find out where people have gone wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1297">The member has raised a number of questions and he has seen those types of things. We would like to include those in the review.</seg>
<seg id="1298">I would like to thank the member for raising this issue and we can look into it together.</seg>
<seg id="1299">That will be part of the review and the patients that were going to see the doctor don’t have an appointment. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1300">Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation) Yes, I look forward to seeing the results of the review.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Right now, $5.5 million was set aside for TB in Qikiqtarjuaq and just recently on February 26, I believe the federal government made a huge amount of money for ITK, I believe it was $82 million, and $80 million was set aside for the TB study.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Has the government made a request or has the Department of Health and Social Services made a request to Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami to help us out with the funding that was given to us by the government or has our government talked to them to see if they can afford to pay for TB?</seg>
<seg id="1303">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1304">That’s a very good question.</seg>
<seg id="1305">At this time, the federal government announced that the 2018-19 budget will be in place to support Inuit-specific initiatives related to tuberculosis, and at the same time, it states that Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami will be allocated five-year funding for the Inuit Circumpolar Conference.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Currently, the working group has a committee comprised of representatives from Inuit owned lands, including the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="1307">At this time, the additional funding was going to be provided by the federal government and I, as the Minister of Finance, have not seen any details.</seg>
<seg id="1308">I look forward to seeing the details of the work that ITK is doing and they have a very good understanding of us.</seg>
<seg id="1309">That’s where it stands.</seg>
<seg id="1310">We will be kept informed by the minister in regard to your very good question.</seg>
<seg id="1311">I would like to ask another question regarding medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="1312">In here, it states that there is no control over the cost of living and the contract increases.</seg>
<seg id="1313">Does the Department of Health and Social Services understand why the cost of living is going up?</seg>
<seg id="1314">At 5.6 percent, it’s projected to increase every year, so what are the main reasons for this increase?</seg>
<seg id="1315">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Through you, I would like my Deputy Minister, Mr. Stockley, to respond to that.</seg>
<seg id="1317">Medical travel and medical evacuations are increasing each year.</seg>
<seg id="1318">There are more and more people going on medical travel and that’s another good thing that they’re diagnosed early enough and that’s why they’re sent out.</seg>
<seg id="1319">Tuberculosis has been a very difficult issue. In the rest of Canada, we have the highest rate of influenza vaccination in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1320">I'll give you an example.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Approximately 60 times medical evacuations were required in December.</seg>
<seg id="1322">There are more and more medivacs that are sent out on an emergency basis every week, but at the end of the year, in the springtime, the lungs that are suffering from lungs and breathing problems have to be dealt with as a matter of urgency.</seg>
<seg id="1323">The condominiums for medical travel and medical evacuations have increased.</seg>
<seg id="1324">Mr. Chairman, I'm not going to go into the details, but I'm trying to understand what the reason is for the increase.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Do we think our population in Nunavut is going to be good for the health of our people?</seg>
<seg id="1326">I'm just wondering if I could get an explanation. My question is: are we catching up or are we getting left behind?</seg>
<seg id="1327">I'll ask Deputy Minister Stockley to respond.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Fortunately, in Canada, Nunavut has the highest rate of food insecurity. Overcrowding causes serious health problems, but we have made progress, but I hope that if there is no shortage of housing, it will improve.</seg>
<seg id="1329">We also added to the boarding home that has been added to the Baffin Regional Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="1330">We have to reduce the amount of medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="1331">We are moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="1332">The other one is the telehealth system that we’re going to be using in the three regions.</seg>
<seg id="1333">You will be hearing more about the budget when we want to apply for O&amp;M.</seg>
<seg id="1334">I thank the Premier for that answer.</seg>
<seg id="1335">I look forward to getting into the main estimates.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Based on the mental health deficit of $10.5 million, the other one is to hear that it’s very important.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Looking at the list, it doesn’t say what the reason is for the $10.5 million increase.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Is your department being encouraged to increase the number of people with mental health problems, and what is the reason for that?</seg>
<seg id="1339">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Both diagnosis and mental health.</seg>
<seg id="1340">During the Fourth Session of the Legislative Assembly, the issue of suicide was raised as a matter of urgency for the government to take action.</seg>
<seg id="1341">We will continue to do that and we will continue to promote that. We don’t have any training programs in place to make sure that they’re identified by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1342">It’s going to change the way our people and the members keep bringing it up in the House and the public on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="1343">My last question is in regard to mental health and mental health workers, how many services are we providing to people who are in care outside of Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="1344">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 64.</seg>
<seg id="1345">How is it 64 more or less? How is it changing in the past?</seg>
<seg id="1346">We don’t have that kind of information in front of us, but it’s increasing and if he wants that information, we can provide it to him, perhaps in the main estimates.</seg>
<seg id="1347">I'll move on to a different topic, the Qikiqtarjuaq TB study. I'm sure all of us agree that it’s very encouraging to hear that.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Will the equipment and equipment be kept by the Department of Health and Social Services in other communities for research purposes or, if it’s too small, will it continue to be in the community?</seg>
<seg id="1349">Through you, I'll have Deputy Minister Stockley respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Will the property assessment be done through the capital estimates?</seg>
<seg id="1351">I'm lost.</seg>
<seg id="1352">Assets, it’s under capital, so if I could get clarification.</seg>
<seg id="1353">Through you, I'll ask Deputy Minister Stockley to respond to that.</seg>
<seg id="1354">The majority of these assets were from the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="1355">The funding that we received from the federal government, for example, the refrigerators, the equipment, the mushrooms, the beds, and so on, is used by the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="1356">Ms. Main: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1357">My last question, probably my last one.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The Department of Health and Social Services is responsible for the agency nurses and the contract services. The department has been very successful in reducing the number of services provided by agency nurses.</seg>
<seg id="1359">I would like to ask, this year’s payments from previous years, what is the difference in the amount of money that is paid out to them?</seg>
<seg id="1360">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Instead of using agency nurses, we are hurting more Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="1362">From last year to today, we have been using more agency nurses.</seg>
<seg id="1363">This is my final question.</seg>
<seg id="1364">If I could get the breakdown of the $8.6 million, I would appreciate it.</seg>
<seg id="1365">Broken down by fiscal year, the 2017-18 full-time staffing shortfall of $52.5 million, the casual staffing budget exceeds $45.3 million, the waitlist payment of $15.7 million, and the agency nurses over $0.1 million, for a total over-expenditure of $8.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1366">I just have one question to comment on the breakdown of what you’re talking about, and I'll add to Mr. Main’s question.</seg>
<seg id="1367">I don’t have three details.</seg>
<seg id="1368">If there is a nurse in Sanikiluaq in an emergency situation in the middle of the night, if there is a need for an overtime, I know that the staff has to be overtime.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) It’s all over-expenditures for nurses.</seg>
<seg id="1370">I know the minister was answering earlier today on what the department is doing in recruiting nurses.</seg>
<seg id="1371">I'll leave that alone for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="1372">I just want to make a comment. When we’re looking at the budget for the Department of Health, we have staff, doctors, contractors, mental health workers, and medical travel. It’s always reflected in the supplementary appropriation every year.</seg>
<seg id="1373">The number for mental health and mental health is a dramatic change from last year. I think it was $6.87 million in last year’s supplementary appropriation.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Earlier when I was talking about the budget process, I was wondering what changes were made. The Minister of Finance indicated that they haven’t made any changes at this time, but I believe that major changes need to be made because we keep coming back and forth with approval. That’s what we always do in the supplementary appropriation.</seg>
<seg id="1375">When you’re aware of over-expenditures, I'm just wondering if the department can come up with a budget based on the amount that is required and not just an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1376">That’s just a comment, but I would like to hear from the minister about that.</seg>
<seg id="1377">I think that’s exactly what we’re doing. We’re doing a realistic review of the Fifth Legislative Assembly. We’ve had some discussions with some departments, Health and Justice, and they’re always asking for a supplementary appropriation.</seg>
<seg id="1378">I don’t know how it’s time to take action. I'm very pleased that we’re talking about this budget and I'm working very closely with my colleagues on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="1379">Although I answered some of the health issues, ever since I became the Minister of Health, it has always been called the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="1380">I think that’s something that we have to work very hard to make sure that the budget is correct and correct, and I'm sure that we’re going to have to re-establish it without changing the budget process. We have to recognize that it’s a process that we have to work on.</seg>
<seg id="1381">We will only be able to make changes through the Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="1382">One of the Members of the Regular Members’ Caucus made a very observant observation.</seg>
<seg id="1383">I also think that we have to work closely together as Members of the Legislative Assembly, because we really need that.</seg>
<seg id="1384">For 2017-18, we are facing some of the challenges that we face. I look forward to working with the Premier and during our term of office. Even though we don’t need to be here, if we know exactly how much money was spent by departments, we don’t need to go back to that, but we need to know exactly what our budget is.</seg>
<seg id="1385">I just wanted to make that comment and thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="1386">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1387">I applaud the minister for recognizing the need for improvement.</seg>
<seg id="1388">I just wanted to reiterate, as the minister indicated earlier, that the Department of Justice has been working on a regular basis with our current sitting. It’s a matter of overtime for nurses and other legislation. It’s a revolving fund. It’s an overtime issue that I've raised in the last three and a half years.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Again, I think there needs to be a real recognition from the Minister of Human Resources as to how we can fill the government’s capacity.</seg>
<seg id="1390">As we move forward with the development of existing positions within our organizational structure, if we were to fill some of the weaknesses that Mr. Maine talked about, the challenges of jobs in the government, the exhaustiveness and health of some of our employees, we need to take a step back and look at how we can move forward in filling our government positions where our strengths and strengths are not just trying to keep up.</seg>
<seg id="1391">When we’re talking about overtime, I would like to find out more about moving forward on where the priorities are and what the initiatives are so that we can look forward to what we can do.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Just a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Mr. Mikkungwak, did you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1394">Mr. Mikkungwak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1395">I just have one question in regard to mental health and contract services. On the fourth paragraph, it states that the Department of Justice is responsible for paying for medical travel. Is that included in the $10.5 million?</seg>
<seg id="1396">I'll summarize it, yes it’s the members.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Mr. Lighthizer, do you have another question?</seg>
<seg id="1398">My last question is in regard to Mr. Maine and Mr. Hickes’ questions.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last question on the hospital staff is $8.6 million shortfall. Just to clarify, you’re indicating $143 million, $151 million to achieve $8.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1400">Is that for all salaries and benefits for the department?</seg>
<seg id="1401">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Yes, it is for compensation and benefits.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Mr. Lighthizer: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1403">Is the $151 million 100 percent accurate?</seg>
<seg id="1404">It’s a $25 million increase in wages.</seg>
<seg id="1405">I don’t think the funding has been at 100 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1406">As I stated earlier, if I compile the full-time and overtime orders, I think what we’re trying to do is ask for $8.6 million in our main estimates for compensation and benefits. I think that’s the closest we can get to that.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It’s not 100 percent accurate in our accounting. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1408">In the very near future, there are a lot of things in there.</seg>
<seg id="1409">I'll move on to the minister’s letter on page 4 regarding medical travel of $63.8 million for the 2017-18 fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="1410">I'm just wondering why the money was allocated in the 2016-17 fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Mr. Chairman, please wait a moment while I look at the 2016-17 capital estimates. I don’t have that information in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="1412">If you would like, I can get that. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1413">Mr. Lighthizer, we’re trying to address that in 2016-17, not before 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1414">I'll keep in mind that I'll leave it at that for 2016-17.</seg>
<seg id="1415">I was asking about the medical travel budget last year. I would like to know how much the department will be allocating in 2018-19.</seg>
<seg id="1416">We don’t anticipate that it will be for 2017-18, but Mr. Akeeagok may not have the numbers in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) I think it’s too early to say that in May, there will be a budget address for 2018-19.</seg>
<seg id="1418">We are now voting on the interim appropriations for 2017-18. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1419">In addition to that, in our budgeting process, there is a problem with what the minister has provided. There are a lot of differences between the actual expenditures that were done every year prior to the adjustments being made, and I would hope that in the next fiscal year, at that time, I will be making a request to the Department of Health and Social Services when the main estimates are being discussed.</seg>
<seg id="1420">So I don’t want to see in the House a repeated budget every year.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Just like the way it was done, I would like to get the details of the department’s operations and maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="1422">That’s more of a comment than a question.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Chairman: Mr. Qirngnuq, do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1424">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1425">I just want to find out one thing. I will be asking a question in regard to medical travel in English so that I can make it clear that the third bullet for April, the actual air ambulance service has increased from last year, so I would like to get clarification from the minister.</seg>
<seg id="1426">It’s talking about medical travel. There has been an increase in the number of patients who are sick and there is an increase in the number of pregnancy patients.</seg>
<seg id="1427">However, the number of medical travel clients is increasing.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Mr. Mikkungwak, did you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1429">I'm sorry, I thought you had your hand up.</seg>
<seg id="1430">We’re on Health. Operations and Maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="1431">We have completed $43,100,000. If you go down to the bottom, Total Department. $49 million.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Not Previously Authorized.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Go back to page 2. Supplementary Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) 2017-18, No. 3. Schedule 1. Operations and Maintenance. $56,602,000.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Go to Bill 3 in your legislation binder.</seg>
<seg id="1435">Sorry, let me go back.</seg>

<seg id="1441">Chairman (interpretation): Do members agree that pursuant to Rule 62 (2) that Bill 3 can immediately be placed on the orders of the day for third reading?</seg>
<seg id="1442">Mr. Akeeagok, do you have any closing comments?</seg>
<seg id="1443">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) I appreciate the questions that were asked in regard to the budget allocation process for the upcoming fiscal year and the hard work of our staff to compile the best estimates that are in there.</seg>
<seg id="1444">With that, we will be able to make changes to the budget.</seg>
<seg id="1445">Before we move on to another bill, I would like to ask that the minister be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1446">I would like to thank him for his hard work and he will now rise to report progress.</seg>
<seg id="1447">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you. Did you want to bring in another witness?</seg>
<seg id="1448">Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the witness out.</seg>
<seg id="1449">Moving on to Bill 4.</seg>
<seg id="1450">Mr. Akeeagok, please proceed with your opening comments.</seg>
<seg id="1451">Bill 04 – Supplementary Appropriation (Capital) Act, No. 4, 2017-2018 – Consideration in Committee</seg>

<seg id="1456">I would be pleased to take questions and comments as we proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1457">Are there any general comments in regard to the minister’s opening comments?</seg>
<seg id="1458">This is the first time that I have been involved in this process, so I would like to know why we have to do that.</seg>
<seg id="1459">Are the Department of Community and Government Services not able to find their own capital?</seg>
<seg id="1460">There has to be a financial statement to make sure that the interest rates are transparent.</seg>
<seg id="1461">Nobody would get any money, but the interest rates were higher than expected. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>

<seg id="14">"I didn’t travel several thousand miles to play.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I didn’t come here to be liked, and I didn’t come here for your approval… remember: when Jesus died, he wanted people to leave the room."</seg>

<seg id="19">"The Driving-Print was one of the organised events from the Bill Prankard Engineering Association’s Arctic Hope Project, in Ottawa."</seg>

<seg id="21">"This Evangelistic event, which is the 119th of 300 destinations in urban events, began after an hour of events."</seg>

<seg id="28">He handed out a package to buy the Hawthorn-British religious goods.</seg>
<seg id="29">"And he tabled the Howard-Brown’s book, Killing the Planet, saying that he’s talking about the history of unfair commercial practices over the last 200 years."</seg>
<seg id="30">"“That’s what he’s talking about in a racist Crazy, that’s exactly what he’s talking about,” Garnian says."</seg>
<seg id="31">Gonzalez then filmed the 18 minutes long Hawthorn-Brown’s preaching experiences (evangelical).</seg>
<seg id="32">"At the end of the movie, Howard-Brown prayed that donors of money to the Church of God would be given to the souls that the Church has protected."</seg>

<seg id="61">"It’s going to be a fire on the ice"</seg>
<seg id="62">"Every time they’ve done something, Hawthorn-Brown – the main character – went to the Reverend’s desk."</seg>
<seg id="63">"“It’s going to be a power grid on the ice,” the missionary says of more than 100 people, more than the population, at different ages."</seg>
<seg id="64">"“If you don’t want it, please just whisper to the door in your capabilities."</seg>
<seg id="65">"Every hour, Hawthorne-Brown’s voice gets quiet and quiet."</seg>
<seg id="66">When he stops, he asks for something to be done and he makes a lot of laughter.</seg>
<seg id="67">"“I know that I don’t feel like I'm from Africa, so I'm doing that because my parents used to let me in, they never let me out,” he says to the laughs."</seg>
<seg id="68">"Muscat was the first office (Deblatt).</seg>
<seg id="69">The first one broke down and he had to go back and get another one.</seg>
<seg id="70">And Adamie and Evie were the first Apple products."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Hard-Brin became well known, for the most part, for laughing at meetings where the attendees were laughing."</seg>
<seg id="72">"The victim was approached at the age of two, and he laughed 12 minutes before he left, Hewwwood-Brown says."</seg>
<seg id="73">Horwood-Brown has received numerous complaints from other Evangelicals who are also proud of the world.</seg>
<seg id="74">It’s called a typo and it’s called a religious preacher and it’s a laughing matter and it’s a laughing matter and it’s a laughing matter.</seg>
<seg id="75">"Mr. Arreak, from Iqaluit Ivanjalis and a singer who helped with this event, used to laugh at the members when he was preaching."</seg>
<seg id="76">"“This is not a funeral day, so why are people nervous?"</seg>
<seg id="77">Horwood-Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="78">Mr. Arreak laughs.</seg>
<seg id="79">"We’re doing it in Jesus and it’s alive."</seg>
<seg id="80">Mr. Arreak is laughing loudly.</seg>
<seg id="81">"“I like the preacher,” he says to Mr. Arreak, and this laughs louder."</seg>
<seg id="82">Howard-Brown is laughing with others just laughing.</seg>
<seg id="83">"We’re very happy.</seg>
<seg id="84">"Please enjoy the water, such as water reservoirs forever."</seg>
<seg id="85">Mr. Arreak’s laughter came close to the top of the house.</seg>
<seg id="86">"This is the reality.</seg>
<seg id="87">No one will be arrested this evening."</seg>
<seg id="88">"Mr. Arreak, in Nunatsiaq News, stated that he didn’t want to speak to the media, he was laughing again."</seg>
<seg id="89">"Hawthorne-Brown also spoke incomprehensible language, saying that the language was understood in the indigenous language of this Papua New Genie presidency."</seg>

<seg id="92">Rodney Habsburg-Brown invites the guest at the church to take a bright breath.</seg>
<seg id="93">Some are not laughing</seg>
<seg id="94">However, many of the Harvard-British preachers are unpleasant and laughable.</seg>
<seg id="95">There were a lot of people who went out on the land before he was guided.</seg>
<seg id="96">"When he didn’t sacrifice the attendees, Hawthorn-Brown made a lot of rumours before they left."</seg>
<seg id="97">"Where are you going to Brady?</seg>
<seg id="98">He.</seg>
<seg id="99">Hey!</seg>
<seg id="100">Are you leaving?"</seg>

<seg id="102">"“Where are they going to take pictures and then they’re going out on the phone?"</seg>
<seg id="103">You are a reporter for the daily news here?"</seg>
<seg id="104">Attendants laughed.</seg>
<seg id="105">"“I don’t know if it’s possible to go and adopt it and bring it back…. I find out how much it costs and why it’s taking pictures and why it’s taking off,” he says to one of his staff."</seg>
<seg id="106">"When he asked them to go to the witness table after he was preaching, Hawthorn suddenly took over two female seats because he didn’t like the latter view."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Have you revived?</seg>
<seg id="108">"What do you say, Jihawa Veronica?"</seg>
<seg id="109">The attendees laugh.</seg>
<seg id="110">"I have never seen people sitting across the border who can’t change.</seg>
<seg id="111">"You can squeeze other people, or maybe you’re better than others.""</seg>
<seg id="112">These two ladies stood up and walked out.</seg>

<seg id="114">"I do that, it’s my responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="115">I know the physical condition of the individual.</seg>
<seg id="116">Don’t bother me.</seg>
<seg id="117">It’s not funny.</seg>
<seg id="118">The whole north is now tied to what is happening tonight."</seg>
<seg id="119">Responsibility staff are telling attendees not to take pictures or recordings.</seg>
<seg id="120">"Unfortunately, these guys took pictures of the whole event."</seg>
<seg id="121">When the Hawthorn-Brown touches them, they take pictures of them very close to them.</seg>
<seg id="122">"Students from the Rebel Church of Independence Broadcasting Corporation’s website reflect a wide range of attendances when they are no longer whatsoever – face injuries that appear, no ice, mouth doors, or just on the floor."</seg>
<seg id="123">Madam Harvard-Brown who touched her hands on the floor is crying under the table.</seg>
<seg id="124">"In the near future, Howard-Brown and his staff are approaching it to affect the ethnic couples."</seg>
<seg id="125">This event was originally intended for St. Jude’s</seg>
<seg id="126">"The event was originally intended to be here at St. Jude’s Anglican Cathedral in Iqaluit, but it was changed."</seg>
<seg id="127">"This change was switched from guests to Heathrow-Brown, the secretary of St. Joamie says."</seg>
<seg id="128">"David Parsons, the Anglican Bishop for the North, said he did not know that this was Heath-Barron’s mission in St Jude’s."</seg>
<seg id="129">"If he had known, he is saying that he would have stopped it because Hawthorn-British seems to be too much."</seg>
<seg id="130">"As a result, the local Anglican Church did not comply with the requirement for the approval of the Bishop for the event, Barsons says."</seg>
<seg id="131">"The Anglican Church’s role is to ensure that there is a sense of sensitivity, and that they deal with other churches, Barsons says."</seg>
<seg id="132">"“There is a lot of respect for each other, and it doesn’t deal with the unfairness of religion and churches there."</seg>
<seg id="133">Under Hawthorn’s program it seems to be a different program.</seg>
<seg id="134">"I am not on the list of religious interests.</seg>
<seg id="135">"If it were to be a winter event, something would have happened in the north," says the attendants."</seg>
<seg id="136">"I don’t come for advice.</seg>

<seg id="1">"In an unprecedented manner, Canada is quietly launching a new northern policy document"</seg>
<seg id="2">The Liberals are saying that this new policy reflects a “significant change of direction"””</seg>
<seg id="3">"Many of the wolves grew up in Bathurst Inlet, Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="4">"In light of the federal announcement of the next day’s election campaign, the Liberal government issued a long-awaited Northern Policy Strategy."</seg>
<seg id="5">(Agenda)</seg>
<seg id="6">By Jim Bell</seg>
<seg id="7">"After the start of the national campaign, the Liberal Government, with little attendance, launched a long-awaited northern and northern policy strategy on September 10.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The document, which establishes the first phase of the continuation of the action, is to replace the Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s 2009 Northern Strategy and the Harper’s Government’s 2010 Statement on the Canadian Northern Foreign Policy."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is intended to guide federal policy in the North up to 2030 – but there is no implementation plan or political direction for future action.</seg>
<seg id="10">"In terms of the work that is going to be done on the second phase, the action plan says."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Unfortunately, this initiative from Carolyn Bennett, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and Northern Development, stated that this policy document revealed “a significant change to the direction of the federal government.”"”</seg>
<seg id="12">The introduction of this policy is long overdue than expected.</seg>
<seg id="13">"For this winter, Barnett said that this policy would be introduced in June."</seg>
<seg id="14">CBC News reported earlier this month that a news release in Yellowknife was cancelled in August.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The Liberals under section 8 of the “Strengthening,” which includes aims, and 10 (10) “Strengthening.”"”</seg>
<seg id="16">"They discussed a number of policy issues, including community and regional economic development, building infrastructure, aboriginal rights, environmental protection, national security and foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="17">"When Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, on December 20, 2016, announced his government’s intention to develop new policies, he even promised that “political action” would be taken by northern governments and indigenous groups.”"”</seg>
<seg id="18">"As a result, more than 25 indigenous organizations, including the Government of Nunavut, the Northwest Territories, the Yukon, Manitoba, Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador, joined in the co-ordination process."</seg>
<seg id="19">"“In partnership with Canada’s Northern and Northern Policy Strategy, our partners helped us to understand and raise awareness of unnecessary rights and responsibilities across the various territories, responsibilities and citizenship rights across the north,” Barnett said in a news release."</seg>
<seg id="20">"As well as some partners wrote the terms of reference, these are published separately from the policy document."</seg>
<seg id="21">Some of these comments do not address federal policy.</seg>
<seg id="22">"As such, the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the Government of Nunavut, the Government of the Northwest Territories and the three territorial governments have shared their personal language with each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">But there is something happening.</seg>
<seg id="24">The writing system that has been submitted by the parties may not be able to represent the federal government’s policy.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is a symbol of the possibility of a federal conflict of interest that would agree to more than 31 parties.</seg>
<seg id="26">"“While the blueprints are part of the process, they do not simplify the views of the federal government or other partners,” the action document states."</seg>
<seg id="27">The document also states that approval was a challenge.</seg>
<seg id="28">"“Moments, goals and objectives and aspirations go hand in hand with many ideas and ideas."</seg>
<seg id="29">What this means is that there is an agreement between the federal government and the aboriginal people involved in the approval process."</seg>
<seg id="30">You can find a corresponding northern policy when I appear here.</seg>
<seg id="31">8 goals</seg>
<seg id="32">"One of the eight objectives of the action plan is to demonstrate the federal government’s commitment."</seg>
<seg id="33">"• a strong, sustainable, diverse and sustainable community and regional economy."</seg>
<seg id="34">• Canada’s Northern and Northern Aboriginal Peoples to be sustainable and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="35">• The Canadian Arctic and the Arctic are Inuit in a safe and secure environment.</seg>
<seg id="36">Strengthening industrialized industries from other parts of Canada could be re-established.</seg>
<seg id="37">• The Act is based on a northern-based approach to new innovations and opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="38">• Knowledge and Understanding Guidelines for decision-making.</seg>
<seg id="39">• Canada’s Arctic and the Arctic’s livelihoods are healthy and consistent.</seg>
<seg id="40">Reconciliation is a contribution to the continuity and religion of aboriginal and non-Inuit.</seg>
<seg id="41">These objectives begin with a wide range of “businesses’ that have been redefined.”"”</seg>
<seg id="42">Ten fundamentals</seg>
<seg id="43">"In order to achieve these goals and objectives, the policy document outlines fundamental principles under which it is designed to “continue to implement the mandate":"”"”</seg>
<seg id="44">"Assessments on the North will be shaped by co-operation and the involvement of northerners, rights, needs and northern interests."</seg>
<seg id="45">"The rights and positions of the Government of Canada, provincial, aboriginal and local governments will be respected."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Construction must be used and respected, social, cultural, economic and environmentally friendly."</seg>
<seg id="47">"Continue to meet with aboriginal people on an ongoing basis, using the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission as a starting point, would be a success."</seg>
<seg id="48">"When climate change is a serious issue on the land, it will take steps to address a number of impacts, including the impact on aboriginal people, on the continued use of land and wildlife in the cultural, economic, and food security."</seg>
<seg id="49">"This policy and programme will symbolize inequality and equality, and facilitate resources such as gender-specific research (Gender-Based Analysis Plus) to be used to mitigate the effects of different types of society."</seg>
<seg id="50">"The purpose of this program is to consider a wide range of ground-based initiatives such as rights, interests and circumstances such as Inuit, Northern Aboriginal and Circumpolar Affairs to be respected, defined and implemented."</seg>
<seg id="51">"The Government of Canada recognizes that Inuit, Aboriginal and Circumpolar Affairs Canada, in a way that is inconsistent, is aware of the rights of communities, with their own experiences, including the federal government."</seg>
<seg id="52">"Continue to work together on the basis of their rights, respect, co-operation in such areas as the promotion of interests, priorities and circumstances of each individual."</seg>
<seg id="53">"Community groups, from independent sources to universities and universities, as well as non-profit sectors, community organizations and independent Canadians, have a key role to play in building a stronger Canadian Arctic."</seg>

<seg id="4">(Parliament Emma Toronto)</seg>
<seg id="5">Emma Dunder</seg>
<seg id="6">"The Nunavut Conservative candidate says that if the Conservatives were to become a government, they would eliminate the emissions (carbon) tax because “it raises the prices for everything.”"”</seg>
<seg id="7">Leona Aglukkaq began her campaign in Nunavut communities.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Nunavut Attorney General started the campaign in Iqaluit on September 12 at the Frobisher Inn.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was flying to Rankin Inlet the next day to Iqaluit and will not be returning next week.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nunatsiaq News had an opportunity to speak with Ms. Aglukkaq when she was in Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The emissions tax (carbon tax) “substantially increases the cost of air travel, goods, shipping, hunting and homeownership,” says Aglukark’s campaign poster.”"”</seg>
<seg id="12">Ms. Aglukkaq also told the Nunatsiaq News that this tax has a negative impact on day care facilities and elders’ homes by increasing the heating costs.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Whatever art is affected by this emissions tax."</seg>
<seg id="14">Ms. Aglukkaq said.</seg>
<seg id="15">"When we can’t pay the carbon tax, it’s like you can’t speak to the other side of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="16">"However, Mr. George Hickes, the Nunavut Finance Minister, announced in May that by an agreement with Ottawa, lighting and aviation fuels in Nunavut now owned by this tax were exempted."</seg>
<seg id="17">The Government of Nunavut and subsidised half of the greenhouse gas tax rate for Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Our campaign for Nunavut has four priorities: affordable housing, mental health, and job creation."</seg>
<seg id="19">"How can we as a government and the private sector and the Government of Nunavut work together to address this huge need for housing across the north?"</seg>
<seg id="20">"One of the priorities of Ms. Aglukkaq’s campaign is to develop a strategy that includes housing needs, elder housing and disability housing."</seg>
<seg id="21">"The federal and territorial governments should also consider ways to promote homeownership, he says."</seg>
<seg id="22">Ms. Aglukkaq also spoke of the need for a northern industrial and mental health training program for Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="23">"“Our territory is an enormous shoreline in Canada and we are still abandoned with the necessary marine infrastructure in our territory, so we have to consider large-scale measures like this in the north,” he says."</seg>
<seg id="24">"“We must address the housing needs, build capacity for Nunavummiut in the area of mental health services so that we can support our communities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"While it was thought that it would undermine the federal government’s Nutrition North program, Aglukark noted that the emissions tax on groceries has resulted in higher prices such as freight rates."</seg>
<seg id="26">"When he was convinced that he was considering using this program, and if not, what he would do other than this carbon tax, he said he would consult with the Nutrition North Canada Advisory Board."</seg>
<seg id="27">"He said that once the Conservatives become a government, the council would always exist."</seg>
<seg id="28">"It is very important to have people in the north who can tell the government how to improve the program.</seg>
<seg id="29">This is not a perfect project.</seg>
<seg id="30">Not everything is perfect in the world.</seg>
<seg id="31">But there has to be a subsidy for northern food."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Ms. Aglukkaq did not want to make any clear whatsoever about the Nutrition North Canada Program, but said that there should be a subsidy for food and that it would not be “productive"."”"”</seg>
<seg id="33">"Unfortunately, a study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal found that food was becoming more difficult in Nunavut through the Nutrition North Canada Program, as outlined in the Canadian Community Health Survey."</seg>
<seg id="34">"Ms. Aglukkaq said that her work as the Minister of Environment would help to address climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but she didn’t say exactly how she was going to deal with it."</seg>
<seg id="35">He said he would support the Kivalliq sanitation project (hydro-fire link) and the Green Bay road and the Kitikmeot port for ships.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Are we going to be able to stop using fossil fuels in the short term?</seg>
<seg id="37">"No," he says."</seg>
<seg id="38">"When the Conservative President Andrew Shield came to Iqaluit last June, he stressed the need for Nunavut to develop a recycling program, saying that it is “a very important” under the current Liberal government."”"”</seg>
<seg id="39">Ms. Aglukkak said she believes that policies have been developed to provide people with the opportunity to talk to them about renewable resource development and it is unclear at this time.</seg>
<seg id="40">"“The Nunavut Land Claims Agreement provides information on how businesses should be dealt with in the North. The Land Claims Agreement, in my opinion, is of the utmost importance in the environmental strategy."</seg>
<seg id="41">"It protects our land, protects our waters, protects our wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="42">"It has already been identified the need for how projects should be dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="43">It’s a very important piece of legislation and we have to be proud of it.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Our decisions about the North must come from the people of the North, not from Ottawa."</seg>
<seg id="45">"He left the headquarters when he went to Pond Inlet and Arctic Bay on September 19, his office said."</seg>
<seg id="46">"The plan is also to travel to Pangnirtung, Qikiqtarjuaq and Clyde River before travelling to the Kivalliq and Kitikmeot."</seg>

<seg id="9">"January in Cambridge Bay is the first of three regional wildlife boards to be held between him and Jason Akeeagok, the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board’s director, who they wish to attend."</seg>
<seg id="10">Akeagok said the polar bear management plan was a “significant undertaking."””</seg>
<seg id="11">"“We are going to do what we can to make sure that this is the case before the polar bear season,” he says."</seg>
<seg id="12">"The plan has been under consideration for almost five years, and it was discussed to develop a plan last March at the Iqaluit Nunavut Wildlife Management Board meeting."</seg>
<seg id="13">The plan will be in place until 2029.</seg>

<seg id="15">"In the new polar bear management plan, polar bear threatening kills in three communities would reduce noise."</seg>
<seg id="16">(professional photographer Niore Iqalukjuak)</seg>
<seg id="17">"In all the countries in the 19th century polar bears, 12 are more in Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="18">Polar bear quotas have been set by zones (e.g. male only) of these polar bears – and the TAH for polar bear conservation is included in the year’s polar bear quotas for the communities.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Although this new plan will not increase the total allowable harvest at this time, new total allowable harvests may begin to consider new data when it receives it."</seg>
<seg id="20">"In the past, Nunavut communities were allowed to harvest one female polar bear with two males harvested through the annual community polar bear tags."</seg>
<seg id="21">"That was done only by the people here in Baffin Bay for polar bears, in this area there is a balance between male and female, under the new plan, it will not matter whether the polar bear is male or female but it has to be balanced."</seg>
<seg id="22">The names would be half of the tags.</seg>
<seg id="23">This new equivalent of male/male polar bear subpopulation will allow communities to harvest polar bear protection if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The increased number of polar bears coming into the communities has been a concern in Nunavut since the death of two polar bears in the Kivalliq region last year – however, under the current management plan, the protection of the killing of a polar bear and if it is a female, then it would be used for two tags."</seg>
<seg id="25">As a result, some communities will no longer have any tags to protect their polar bear quotas.</seg>
<seg id="26">"This new plan will allow communities to reduce the importation of polar bears," Susak said in Nunatsiaq News."</seg>
<seg id="27">"However, he previously stated that polar bears approach the trauma of Inuit culture and lifestyle, because of the destruction of cabins, birds and seals."</seg>
<seg id="28">Participants at the meeting in Cambridge Bay welcomed changes to the polar bear management plan.</seg>
<seg id="29">They were also pleased to note that Qimirrujiit will now have five more tags for grizzly bears.</seg>
<seg id="30">There was a big picture of Aklavik and he was shot and this was too close to the cabins here in the Mountain Polly.</seg>
<seg id="31">"As for the bottom line, for this new polar bear management plan they may have something else to consider."</seg>
<seg id="32">"The future of polar bears is unclear as a result of climate change. According to the 2018 study by the Standing Committee on the types of species that may disappear in Canada (COSEWIC), this committee, the type of species that may disappear in Canada (COSEWIC), re-evaluated the polar bear population as a “significant concern.”"”</seg>
<seg id="33">It means that polar bears may be at risk or disappear as a result of combined livelihoods and identified trauma.</seg>

<seg id="1">Inuktut Roman orthography – Establishment and Appeal</seg>
<seg id="2">Our contribution today to our children and future generations</seg>
<seg id="3">The Inuktitut Roman orthography writing system is available in all of the Inuit languages across Canada.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami has stated that it will not replace the syllabics and that the traditional syllabics and other syllabics will be used.</seg>
<seg id="5">Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami has also stated that Inuit traditional writing systems will not have to change the way they use the writing system.</seg>
<seg id="6">Secretary of State Merci 'man'</seg>
<seg id="7">"I was very pleased to hear that the Joint Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami unanimously approved the new Inuktut writing system, namely the Inuktut Roman orthography that was released earlier this month."</seg>
<seg id="8">The Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami means “continue to the rest of Canada’s population” and there are few examples of the strengths that our people have shared with each other in a way that is consistent with our survival and our culture and language.”"”</seg>
<seg id="9">That’s very encouraging for me at this time.</seg>
<seg id="10">"In June of 2011, when I was the President of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, we launched a strong revitalization program to change our education system."</seg>
<seg id="11">"We committed to a national approach to the Innuinaqtun education system with 10 strong initiatives that were developed in partnership with our children to ensure that they have the skills they need, the safety of Inuktitut and culture and language."</seg>
<seg id="12">Our recommendations included the establishment of a centralized public registry system.</seg>
<seg id="13">Innuinaqtun Canadians have spent many years reaching this goal and reaching a new heritage.</seg>
<seg id="14">Inuinnaqtun Language Preservation staff in all communities across the Inuit homeland conducted the Inuktut Roman orthography program.</seg>
<seg id="15">This means that we are going to have one writing system in all of the Inuit languages that can be used properly.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is a new spelling system that will evolve.</seg>
<seg id="17">"It is not going to replace the Inuktitut writing system or replace the traditional community writing system, it is being used as a tool to participate in the existing writing system to improve the quality of Inuit communications."</seg>
<seg id="18">It is our gift today to our children and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="19">I can now envision that the people of Canada will be better able to communicate and share learning materials and curriculum that will provide high-quality education when it comes to issues and our children will be able to graduate from high school in both languages with the ability to write and speak.</seg>
<seg id="20">"In the Western Balkans, we face the challenges of social cohesion, the culture of Qallunaat, our way of life, our family structures, and our language."</seg>
<seg id="21">But we are here today.</seg>
<seg id="22">Over the years we had to look at our experiences to find out who we are today and why we are in a situation today.</seg>
<seg id="23">I believe that we now have a quota system that we have to look back on or are we going to have to look ahead to the future.</seg>
<seg id="24">The use of Inuktitut in Roman orthography in Canada by all people is my understanding that we want to move forward as a united society.</seg>
<seg id="25">"When eight years ago we began the development of a national program for Inuit education, we were able to deliver a language of “Inuktitut” that will mean all individuals in each language, regardless of their dialects."”"”</seg>
<seg id="26">To me this gives me the opportunity to see the single currency, which we can overcome in all aspects of dealing with false obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Our language and identity are preserved, and our language is healthy."</seg>
<seg id="28">It is my hope that we will be able to use Inuktitut in all languages and writing systems and move forward as we work together to fill our geographic gaps as individuals.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Mr. Simon was the former President of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami in 2011 when they released the Canadian Mission to Inuit Education, which included a recommendation to create a single writing system for the Inuit language."</seg>

<seg id="2">"“A number of policies, policies, practices or departmental practices used in this area of inequality and inconsistencies are the beginning""</seg>

<seg id="4">(English)</seg>
<seg id="5">"Unfortunately, the Quebec Government has not exercised its responsibilities to the aboriginal people, Ligur said."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Lago apologized – the first of 142 decisions made in the report – at the National Aboriginal Circumpolar Conference on Wednesday, October 2, two days after the former Supreme Court judge Jack Baines, who was the Commission’s Director of Excellence, released his report."</seg>

<seg id="8">He said that he would look at all the decisions and find out exactly why there is discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="9">"“Many laws, policies, practices or departmental practices used inequality and inconsistencies have resulted in a significant disadvantage in the delivery of services to First Nations and Inuit,” Mr. Vince stated in his September 30th report."</seg>

<seg id="2">"There is a lot of interest"</seg>
<seg id="3">Students walked four foxes in Iqaluit on September 27 including the Global Climate Change Campaign.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three lawmakers in the federal government announced plans to ban Nunavut’s use of fossil fuels by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="5">(President Dustin Patter)</seg>
<seg id="6">Dustin Paddock</seg>
<seg id="7">"In the recent federal election, three law firms announced that Nunavut’s use of Technicolor Fuel will be banned by 2030."</seg>
<seg id="8">"While all 25 communities in Nunavut have diesel generators operated by the Qulliq Energy Corporation, only the Power Corporation in Canada does not have genetically modified light bulbs."</seg>
<seg id="9">Changes to this would be a huge and costly task.</seg>
<seg id="10">"“This is a very ambitious project,” says Martha Lenny, the Arctic Renewable Energy Officer for the World Wildlife Fund."</seg>
<seg id="11">"“It’s probably easy, just a little bit of talent.""</seg>
<seg id="12">The Green Paper’s campaign promises to "promote the use of renewable energy sources.</seg>
<seg id="13">"2030, all of Canada’s electricity will go through renewable energy."</seg>
<seg id="14">This includes outpost camps in northern communities such as telehandlers to be disposed of."</seg>
<seg id="15">"The Liberal Party stated that it would “continue to invest in ensuring that the people in the communities of Teachel are eradicated from fossil fuels but will have electricity using clean, renewable energy sources – like hydro, wind and solar power – by 2030.”"”</seg>
<seg id="16">The New Technologies Battisti (NDP) stated that "to invest in Canada’s energy-efficient greenhouse gas emissions after 2030…. This reduction in greenhouse gas emissions will provide energy-efficient ideas for communities and create jobs.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We would support initiatives such as community ownership and the operation of clean energy projects to provide employment opportunities for residents and qualified individuals, as well as to work with aboriginal and circumpolar communities to reduce the use of Teachel Fuel."</seg>
<seg id="18">"In the context of Environment and Climate Change Canada’s report released earlier this year, greenhouse gas emissions in Nunavut account for less than 1 percent of this impact."</seg>
<seg id="19">"In2017, Nunavut produced an average of 0.6 megawatts (megatonnes) of greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide), of which approximately 18,000 cars could be occupied."</seg>
<seg id="20">"In the same year, Aberdeen, which is the country’s largest emissions trading partner, produced over 84 million vehicles that could be occupied."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Although this is the case, Nunavut has seen that carbon dioxide emissions from cars have increased by 30 percent since 2005, with the largest increase in Canada and Alberta almost doubled, which is the second increase in the same area."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Although energy changes are being made to the three proposed Supreme Court of Canada to reduce emissions, the impact of Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions will still be very small."</seg>
<seg id="23">The communities have this equipment.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Nunavut pays the highest rate of electricity in all other parts of Canada, and funding for energy would reduce this."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Nevertheless, action on renewable energy projects such as this may be inconsistent with payments to existing sources of energy."</seg>
<seg id="26">"On this past week, the World Wildlife Organization released a report which discussed how energy can be used to provide energy in each of the 25 communities of Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="27">"It was noted that with a reduced rate of 8 percent – primarily as a result of the risks associated with the program or other sources of revenue – Baker Lake, Coral Harbour, Iqaluit and Rankin Inlet would be saving by moving 20 percent from renewable energy, including direct payments over the next 15 years."</seg>
<seg id="28">The study also indicated that 16 other communities have a 4 percent subsidy – approximately the Qulliq Energy Corporation’s borrowing limit – and approximately $2 million in subsidy and 20 percent in resources.</seg>
<seg id="29">"The report only talks about the feasibility of these projects, with only a decision to move renewable energy sources to lower the current energy costs."</seg>
<seg id="30">However, moving communities with the potential for renewable energy would be a major undertaking.</seg>
<seg id="31">"“There would have to be consultation, and they would have to start next year in order to meet the energy needs of all the communities,” says Leonard."</seg>
<seg id="32">"“They would have to go to the communities, work with them on what they want to do, and how the community envisions energy, to see what their priorities would be and what the communities would be most important for campgrounds and hunting."</seg>
<seg id="33">"There is no such thing as the development of a combination of solar panels or wind turbines, which would take two years to collect, or work with the Qulliq Energy Corporation to ensure that renewable energy sources are reliable."</seg>
<seg id="34">"The transfer of 100 percent from all communities to renewable energy, which is the result of the three proposed Supreme Court Justices’ experiences, would not only be a long-term project but also a significant investment."</seg>
<seg id="35">"The New Democratic Party (NDP) and the Liberal (Liberal) have not announced yet how much money they would contribute to the move, the Green Paper (Green Party) said last week."</seg>
<seg id="36">"In addition to the campaign spending report, Green Package announced that it will provide $150 million over five years for the relocation of all outpost camps and northern communities – not just in Nunavut – to reduce the use of Teachel Fuel."</seg>
<seg id="37">It’s not enough however.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Mr. Leonard pointed out that if a community like Arctic Bay were to move or even 60 percent of its energy, it would require an operating cost of approximately $27.8 million."</seg>
<seg id="39">"In the same report, for other communities if they’re going to use 60 percent of renewable energy, they would have to use a higher rate."</seg>
<seg id="40">"In Iqaluit, the estimated cost is around $148 million."</seg>
<seg id="41">"Although it is clear that it is less than $250-500 million dollars that would have been energy-efficient in the city, this would apply to one community that the Green Paper would like to contribute."</seg>
<seg id="42">"Nobody expects the federal government to pay for all of these projects, but they also indicated that it would be a project and how it would be dealt with and it would take a lot of time."</seg>
<seg id="43">"In view of the 2030 deadline, there will be very little time."</seg>
<seg id="44">"“In terms of hydroelectric power, I think it would be two to five years."</seg>
<seg id="45">"In terms of energy, it would appear that it would take five to seven years," said Leonard when asked how much energy would be involved."</seg>
<seg id="46">"When you look at the deadlines and divide them into 25 communities and if they’re going to be done at the same time in the remote communities and the land is not always available, Lenny is thinking about how it’s going to be done, looking at the potential, he’s saying that it’s possible."</seg>
<seg id="47">"“I think that when it comes to destinations, this is going to be a major change."</seg>
<seg id="48">"If we don’t even get to 1000 percent, then there’s a lot of interest."</seg>
<seg id="49">"Please note: This book refers to the federal nominations of the following Green Barty, Liberal Party and New Democrats (NDP)."</seg>

<seg id="1">Subject: Operations of the Early Childhood Education and Childcare Facilities</seg>
<seg id="2">It is important to recognize the value of early childhood education and child care workers in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Closer Williamson Patrick, Chair of the Footprints Daycare Board, is seeking additional support from the Government of Nunavut for quality early childhood education and child care based on Inuit language and culture."</seg>
<seg id="4">Nunatsiaq News</seg>
<seg id="5">Letters to the Premier of Nunavut, Joe Savikataaq, and the Minister of Education, David Joanasie, and Minister Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="6">I am one of those people who cares deeply about our language and culture.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I am the Chairperson of the Footprints Daycare, the Inuktitut Language School for Early Childhood Education in Iqaluit and the only one in Iqaluit at the headquarters in Nunavut that brings in child care children who are already speaking Inuktitut."</seg>
<seg id="8">"This small daycare was closed on August 21st, September 12, 2019 due to staffing shortages which had to be closed and, furthermore, has been operating under a full-time capacity for almost a year."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Many people apply for a job in the Footprints daycare because of low pay (which is one of the highest daycare costs), employees who don’t have income support, are not provided housing because they are seen as low-income women as a job in the daycare as they see it."</seg>
<seg id="10">"The centre is now open again, but the urgency of the operation is now challenging: we lost our dedicated staff member because he was tired of resigning."</seg>
<seg id="11">"On a part-time basis we now have an office manager, a full-time daycare manager, two child care workers and each child who works on a rotating basis at the daycare (which all have criminal records checks and safety), who work full-time, while we are looking for a staff member, who is qualified to do the job."</seg>
<seg id="12">"This system is not normal, but for those of us who have children, we believe that our children should be safe and speak Inuktitut to keep the centre open."</seg>
<seg id="13">It is still dangerous for the possibility of closing it permanently.</seg>
<seg id="14">"When Nunavut’s childcare system currently operates as a non-profit organization, departmental staff are expected to provide one of the most important services for a child in order to provide quality early childhood education, which is based on Inuit culture and language, however cost-effective and under-represented."</seg>
<seg id="15">The non-profit society relies on a number of different sources of funding each year, as well as the number of parents who volunteer to operate and manage the daycare centre.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Community workers suffer from a lack of pay and benefits, lack of training for their jobs and lack of staff housing."</seg>
<seg id="17">Daycare staff are currently being asked to work to meet the needs of either self-reliance or family members.</seg>
<seg id="18">We are going through a very difficult time with our daycares because we need special staff with the necessary skills to promote and preserve the Inuit language and culture of our young children; Footprints hires Inuktitut speaking professionals only.</seg>
<seg id="19">We are 100 percent Inuit employment.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, due to the high turnover of our staff, there is a shortage of staff due to the lack of competition and benefits for employees who resign.</seg>
<seg id="21">"As such, it has an impact on early childhood education and early childhood education."</seg>
<seg id="22">Inuit deserve our full support in this area and value our language and culture to be taught to our children.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Government of Nunavut should consider how best to help ensure that quality early childhood education and child care are based on Inuit language and culture.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Effective early childhood education and child care workers are paid by competitors and public benefits, which include housing in their work, vacation travel, training in the workplace and in the school."</seg>
<seg id="25">Footprints' vision is to expand the daycare with a public presence and to increase resources so that more Inuit children can have space.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We have been looking for a larger daycare facility to make this vision a success, so we have raised close to $80,000 for a new space collection."</seg>
<seg id="27">It proposes the following amendments to the Government of Nunavut:</seg>
<seg id="28">"Continue to include early childhood education and child care workers as part of the Government of Nunavut’s public service to provide equal pay for the Government of Nunavut’s payroll, in line with the Government of Nunavut’s rate of eight escalation, applied to employees of the Nunavut school system;"</seg>
<seg id="29">• Incorporating the operations and maintenance of child care facilities in Nunavut into the education system;</seg>
<seg id="30">"• Provide benefits to Early Childhood Education and Childcare Workers but not limited to short-term measures that include long-term patient vacation travel, vacation travel, bilingual bonus, parental leave and housing."</seg>
<seg id="31">• Establishing a body to support all daycares in Nunavut;</seg>
<seg id="32">• Working with day care centres to address the immediate crisis together we will work together to develop a long-term plan for the operation of day cares with changes.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is important to recognize the value of early childhood education and child care workers in Nunavut are vital to our workforce.</seg>
<seg id="34">We want to ensure that our daycares are fully staffed with full-time positions and that all staff receive benefits.</seg>
<seg id="35">We have to keep our daycares open.</seg>
<seg id="36">"To change the administration of the Child Care Act, Nunavut Early Childhood Education and Childcare Workers will lose their jobs will enable them to take the important step forward in making early childhood education and child care operations the most effective way of life for children to begin, including the ability to learn the Inuit language, grow up based on Inuit societal values, and become active members of the Canadian society."</seg>

<seg id="1">QIA announces compensation package for tourism operators in Inuit owned lands</seg>
<seg id="2">Expenditure immediately</seg>
<seg id="3">"The tourism operators who visit the island residents of Nunavut will now have to pay for tourism expenses in order to have access to the Inuit land, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association announced its annual general meeting in Iqaluit from October 8 to 10.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Building tourism operators are now obliged to pay for their own country of origin in the Qikiqtani region, which the Qikiqtani Inuit Association announced at its annual general meeting in Iqaluit on Wednesday, October 9.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Qikiqtani region holds the highest number of cruise ships in all of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Some of the 17 cruise ships were visited this summer, while Iqaluit was visited by four."</seg>
<seg id="7">"“Many of the Qikiqtani communities have expressed concerns regarding the increase in tourism activity in our region, especially in the area of cruise ships."</seg>
<seg id="8">"The Qikiqtani Inuit Association established a tourism management fee to assist individuals in communities impacted by cruise ships," P.J. Akeeagok, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association president, said in a news release."</seg>
<seg id="9">Information provided by the Qikiqtani Inuit Association’s Geoscience and Recycling Division indicated new expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="10">New expenditures include:</seg>
<seg id="11">Flight landing on Inuit lands: $150</seg>
<seg id="12">Helicopter landing on Inuit lands: $100</seg>
<seg id="13">Commercial Tammaativviks in the Inuit communities: $50 a day</seg>
<seg id="14">• Commercial Access to Visitors in the Gallery within 6 hours of Inuit Lands: $25.00 per day</seg>
<seg id="15">"Approximately half of the payments would go to HTOs that are closest to the tourism industry that is available, the news release stated."</seg>
<seg id="16">The other half would go to the Qikiqtani Inuit Association.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The number of passengers travelling to Nunavut ranges from 150 to 400, Roseanne Derrier, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association’s Director of Geoscience and Renewable Resource, noted at the Qikiqtani Inuit Association’s recent meeting."</seg>
<seg id="18">This $25 per day fee would apply to all passengers transporting people to their own communities – or IOL (IOL).</seg>
<seg id="19">"“No matter what the Inuit are on the ship if they are going to be out on the land, they will be charged according to the number of people on the ship,” the Terrorist said to the board."</seg>
<seg id="20">The Terrorist said the ships carrying people to the islands will have to submit to the Qikiqtani Inuit Association the number of people who will be on board each month or before they start boating.</seg>
<seg id="21">"“If the ship carrying 350 people, we would charge $25 a day per person."</seg>
<seg id="22">"The larger people carrying ships would have to pay anywhere from $10,000 to $20,000 to get to the land on the Inuit own land," Terrorist says."</seg>
<seg id="23">"In many communities where cruise ships are visited during the summer, like in Pond Inlet, the HTO would receive between $50,000 to $70,000 in fees," he added.</seg>
<seg id="24">The new payment will also assist the Qikiqtani Inuit Association in accessing the Land Registry.</seg>
<seg id="25">"In this case, tourism operators would be made aware of any new fees that they apply for access to Inuit owned lands."</seg>

<seg id="28">"Many of them also charge people to carry cruise ships and tourism operators going into their communities," DiCaprio says."</seg>
<seg id="29">"“Many people who carry people who have been able to go to their own communities are penalized for this unless the people actually come to our own country,” he says."</seg>
<seg id="30">"Joe Ataguttaaluk, QIA Secretary/Financial Officer, asked if it was possible that these payments would be increased in the future."</seg>
<seg id="31">"The Premier stated that it would be possible to make changes, but it would have to be discussed and resolved by the Qikiqtani Inuit Association Council."</seg>
<seg id="32">"This is a very exciting event.</seg>
<seg id="33">"We are now a leader again where people can benefit from their communities," Mr. Akeeagok said to the council."</seg>

<seg id="3">"The Ship of the Bellevue Principals (Big Barnsz) is anchored by Bremer in Heaven, Germany last summer."</seg>
<seg id="4">"In that area you can see that there are two potential construction projects, 33 and 34 metres high, that were taken from the Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation and delivered to the Mary River mine this summer."</seg>
<seg id="5">Two smaller houses are also being transported from the front.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The purpose of this project is to expand the railway line, which has not yet been approved by the regulatory authorities."</seg>
<seg id="7">(produced by TysonCrab)</seg>
<seg id="8">Community leaders in Pond Inlet are frustrated by the massive shiploading of rail parts of the Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation’s Mary River mine this summer.</seg>
<seg id="9">"What concerns me is that, as a result of the Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation’s proposed expansion of phase 2 of the business plan, which has not yet been approved by the authorities, Baffinland brought two large ten-plex units to Bremerhin, Germany, to the company’s docking facility for Mary River in North Baffin this summer."</seg>
<seg id="10">"There were also two smaller units that could be built and large-scale railways would be used in the construction, such as roads and geotechnical piles."</seg>
<seg id="11">"In Newfoundland, in November 2018, it was announced that the Human Rights Tribunal and its partners in the Qikiqtani Inuit Association would be bringing in, in the form of a public registry between the Nunavut Impact Review Board and the Nunavut Water Board."</seg>
<seg id="12">But the people of Pond Inlet are finally finding out about this.</seg>
<seg id="13">When the ship arrived at the Belcher Islands, the Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation, last August, transported a number of possible materials to be used for the expansion of the railway.</seg>
<seg id="14">When the people of Pond Inlet saw the ship near their community they were going to hear about the ship, two more ships carrying the railway parts came in shortly after that and more sealift is expected in the summer of 2020.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We only found out about three or four weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We see goods being transported near Pond Inlet," Joshua Arreak, Director of the Pond Inlet Hunters and Trappers Organization, told Nunatsiaq News."</seg>
<seg id="17">"We wondered why and who they were and how they were doing that.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We didn’t get any information from the Nunavut Impact Review Board, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association or the public."</seg>
<seg id="19">"We didn’t expect that," Arreak says."</seg>
<seg id="20">"We were not informed by the Qikiqtani Inuit Association or Nunavut Impact Review Board.</seg>
<seg id="21">I don’t know.</seg>
<seg id="22">Through the Inuit organizations we have a problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"They don’t communicate with us," he says."</seg>
<seg id="24">The Nunavut Impact Review Board was aware of the sealift season this winter</seg>
<seg id="25">"None of the Nunavut Power Corporation and any federal minister has approved the Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation’s expansion plan, which would result in a 110 kilometre long road to Mary River, re-establishing a mercury of 12 million tonnes a year, and travelling up to 200 times a year to transport mercury."</seg>
<seg id="26">This project cannot be formally approved by the federal government until the final public announcement is made by the Nunavut Impact Review Board on November 2 in Iqaluit and conclude on November 8 and 9 in Pond Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="27">"The Nunavut Impact Review Board did not, in its statement, consult with stakeholders, indicate that it will be providing sealift for automobiles that were mailed to Baffinland on July 25."</seg>
<seg id="28">"The Nunavut Impact Review Board told the companies that if this project 2 is not approved, Baffinland would have to deal with the shipment of goods, which is probably worth millions of dollars, from the mine."</seg>
<seg id="29">It also indicated that the sealift will not have an impact on NIRB's decision on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="30">"In a recent editorial dated October 17, the Nunavut Impact Review Board’s Director, Ryan Perry, indicated that the regulatory authority of the Nunavut Impact Review Board may approve or reject vessel activities."</seg>
<seg id="31">"“The Nunavut Impact Review Board was only able to ensure that these activities would be included in the evaluation process and that all assets for construction would have to be transferred if the proposal was not approved after the board’s review,” Barry wrote."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is an aerial photograph of the blizzard Principals, this past summer the ship was carrying out a possible installation of materials for the Mary River Shop that will be used for the Sylvia Grinnell Highway expansion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"The building, which is referred to as the “International Unit,” is 33 metres high, 23.5 metres tall and weighs 1,470 tonnes."”"”</seg>
<seg id="34">"Another one, the reference to the “short house,” is 34 metres high."”"”</seg>
<seg id="35">"Each building, which is part of an existing demolition and demolition site, is equivalent to a ten-metre building – perhaps even higher than the premises of the north east."</seg>
<seg id="36">However, Baffinland has not been approved for this program.</seg>
<seg id="37">"“Building will identify these assets "with only 2 – notwithstanding” until such time as this phase 2 application is fully completed,” the company wrote in its July 19 report to the Nunavut Impact Review Board."</seg>
<seg id="38">Materials stored on Inuit owned land</seg>
<seg id="39">"In a joint submission to the Authority, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association and Baffinland wrote that the assets would be located on Inuit owned lands, in accordance with the Qikiqtani Inuit Association’s commercial lease agreement with the company."</seg>
<seg id="40">"In regards to Arreak and so on, activities such as the one in Newfoundland have already been approved for the project."</seg>
<seg id="41">"Pond Inlet residents are unhappy.</seg>
<seg id="42">I'm just wondering if Baffinland is thinking when we don’t know if the Nunavut Impact Review Board or the government is going to approve this project ahead of time.</seg>
<seg id="43">"I don’t know," he says."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Randy Dester, who is the technical advisor with the Hamlet of Pond Inlet, was authorized by the Mayor of Pond Inlet, Joshua Susak, to speak to Nunatsiaq News on behalf of the Hamlet."</seg>
<seg id="45">"“Baffin has been working with a view to approving phase 2,” Mr. Tester said in an e-mail."</seg>
<seg id="46">"“If the Nunavut Impact Review Board or the Nunavut Impact Review Board had the authority to do this, the final impact of the decision would be to put more pressure on the Nunavut Impact Review Board through the responsibility and to approve the application."</seg>
<seg id="47">"This is a concern," Destino said on behalf of the Hamlet."</seg>
<seg id="48">"“Besides the consequences, the Hamlet feels that they shouldn’t do that."</seg>
<seg id="49">"What has happened in the financial sphere and the impression that Baffinland will be approved in phase 2," he writes."</seg>
<seg id="50">"“Our main concern is the animals, marine mammals and their presence."</seg>
<seg id="51">We would be the most impacted communities.</seg>
<seg id="52">That is our concern.</seg>
<seg id="53">"The money is not going to bring back the wildlife," Joshua Arreak said on behalf of the Hunters and Trappers Organization, saying that there has been a lot of talk in Pond Inlet over the years about marine transportation to the Baville Plan."</seg>
<seg id="54">"In the case of a non-governmental organization such as the Oceanic Arctic (Oceans North), which has expressed interest in the upcoming meeting of the Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation’s expansion plan, it stated that it supports “professional development” at the Mary River mine."”"”</seg>
<seg id="55">"However, it also indicated that Baffinland’s export of large-scale faxes did not take into account the environmental impacts, and was dissatisfied with Baffinland’s decision to export large mercury deposits from the Mary River project in the Southern Caucasus, which was allowed to happen in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="56">"“It is no coincidence that residents are dissatisfied with the large importers of rail parts for the Mary River Square prior to the legal approval of this expansion,” says Chris Dupuiski, Vice-President of Policy and Justice for the Department of Fisheries and Oceans for the North."</seg>
<seg id="57">Pre-development work received from TysonCrab</seg>
<seg id="58">The items that are being shipped from Baffinland to Cape Dorset are part of the existing rail parts that the Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation acquired at the Dyson Museum in Romania.</seg>
<seg id="59">"The two large buildings, which came in first place, were designed in PrimaryHealth, which is the third design, which will be a rail loader, organized by Citadelin, in Perland, which was quoted in the newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="60">"Blanc also brought in a ship loader, a locker system and a number of materials to be used for rail transportation."</seg>
<seg id="61">"The substantiation sheets provided by the Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation to the Nunavut Impact Review Board and the Nunavut Water Board included a provision for automobile sanitation and road haulage, as well as potatoes and metal and sanitation."</seg>

<seg id="63">"Many of the barges were carrying additional supplies this summer, and many more will be arriving in the summer of 2020, Tsakrab said."</seg>

<seg id="2">Inuit women’s 15 percent attendance at the women’s centre</seg>
<seg id="3">"Morina Pollock-Wynton, Manager of Women’s Centre (Chez Doris), Women’s Centre and Kathy Wong, a City Council member representing Peter-Marie Nunasi and a spokesman for the Montreal City Council, discussed plans for a 22-bed women’s shelter in Montreal on October 16th in a news release for the women’s centre."</seg>
<seg id="4">(Arctic City of Montreal)</seg>
<seg id="5">"The Montreal Town of Phil-Murray is in the process of expanding the program that was started at the women’s centre, a day-to-day shelter for women who are homeless, which was designed to replace the building that was inherited last year."</seg>
<seg id="6">"The community’s decision, announced Wednesday, October 16, will provide an opportunity to set up a new facility for this centre not too far away, which will become an emergency night place for women."</seg>
<seg id="7">"The women’s centre, the women’s day centre at 1430 Sammy Road in Montreal, is open every day for women in need."</seg>
<seg id="8">Many live.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The women’s centre is currently located on Sammy Road, not far from Attwood Road and Capoulas Coast, a gathering place for people in Town.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The women’s centre is well known by many Inuit women, which accounts for 15 percent of the population.</seg>
<seg id="11">"For the planned opening in the winter of 2021, this building’s emergency nightclub was purchased with a subsidy of $1 million from Montreal’s owner Andrew Harper through the Joyce Community Foundation in Montreal."</seg>
<seg id="12">"“We now have a new facility, we will be able to accommodate 22 beds for women who are homeless,” says Morina Pollock-Financial, who is the director of Chechnya Crisis, said in a news release after the Women’s Centre."</seg>
<seg id="13">"“At present, women account for 25 percent of the homeless in Montreal, but the benefits for women are not enough."</seg>
<seg id="14">This project is a positive start."</seg>
<seg id="15">"The good news is that the centre’s expansion was announced less than a week after this person was in the centre, Clara Ittinuar, originally from Nunatsiavut, after his death on October 11 at the hospital."</seg>
<seg id="16">Bowler-Wynn told the Nunatsiaq News that this very close daughter was in her son’s house when she was incarcerated because she was always sick.</seg>
<seg id="17">"There are more people going to the centre than people going to the cities because of the housing shortage and the legal problems, Bowler-Wynn says."</seg>
<seg id="18">"There are many women who go to the women’s shelter during the day. There are six beds in the facility, they sleep for a few hours and they end up outside in the evening."</seg>
<seg id="19">This will change in the evening when there will be a new shelter.</seg>
<seg id="20">"In the meantime, the women’s centre, which has about a century of women’s places on a daily basis, provides services and activities for women to meet their basic needs such as homelessness, food insecurity, mental illness and substance abuse."</seg>
<seg id="21">Bowler-Finding said that the number of Inuit women coming in has not changed much since 2018.</seg>
<seg id="22">"“Nevertheless, we have a group of women who need more support in areas such as clothing and bathrooms,” he says."</seg>
<seg id="23">"While this is the only women’s day centre in Montreal, the Saez Torres Women’s Centre is now open seven days a week from 8:30 in the morning to 3:00 in the day."</seg>
<seg id="24">"In order to be able to run its programs, the women’s centre was retired on the weekend without providing services for six months in 2014 due to a lack of funding."</seg>
<seg id="25">"“We’re hoping that we’ll get some financial assistance from Makivik, but we don’t know if we’re going to get it this time,” says Bowler-Wynn."</seg>
<seg id="26">"The women’s centre also manages human resources – but the women’s centre tries to raise funds to carry out this work, as is the case with 70 percent of its operations from $1.7 million a year."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Catty Wong, a City Councillor representing Peter-Moggle’s home community and a spokesperson for the Montreal City Council, said in a news release that the new evening will provide more opportunities for women to “promote services that are available to people who wish them well and to ensure that they are safe.”"”</seg>

<seg id="13">"Since 2015, Trudeau has been working with co-management organizations such as Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, Qikiqtani Inuit Association and others."</seg>
<seg id="14">But this week’s election is a testament to the people of Nunavut that Inuit-political relations are not effective.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It’s not amazing, because in the end the people of Nunavut weren’t able to respond to the main questions of the Liberals."</seg>
<seg id="16">"It is well known by the majority of the people of Nunavut that there are major concerns about economic and social issues: the ongoing shortage of housing, food insecurity, the high cost of food and transportation, the issue of tuberculosis and suicide, which is almost daily."</seg>
<seg id="17">"When he last came to Nunavut on October 8, Trudeau didn’t have much good news on these issues."</seg>
<seg id="18">He spoke about South Baffin and talked about climate change and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="19">"This is a national concern, but if I want to vote in this election, Nunavummiut would like to hear their concerns about housing and the cost of living."</seg>
<seg id="20">"It was the case that the Sylvia Grinnell River was a photography site, not for Nunavut voters, but for the Southern Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="21">"In doing so, he didn’t respond to the many challenges facing Nunavummiut and the Nunavut Liberal candidate, Megan Pierre-Louis, who didn’t even help, and he should have received more support from the President of the Liberal Democrats."</seg>
<seg id="22">"In light of the cost and poor diet, the Liberals took action, establishing a higher level of support for the Nutrition North Canada Program, and providing additional funding, $12.5 million per year for aboriginal hunters in Nunavut and elsewhere in the north."</seg>
<seg id="23">However, the Harvester Support Program has to be established and no one can tell why it is like that.</seg>
<seg id="24">"On August 1st as well, Trudeau played a major role in Iqaluit and Arctic Bay, when he signed an agreement to initiate the Lancaster Sound Marine Conservation Area and committed to initiating a new Conservation Area called Tivuittuq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Consequently, it provides a significant amount of funding to communities in North Baffin, such as small craft harbours and preservation of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="26">He also spoke extensively about protective measures such as reconciliation with aboriginal people.</seg>
<seg id="27">"It’s disgraceful to deal with this type of issue as follows: with the constant coughing of TB in a overcrowded house, this “Community” doesn’t make sense."”"”</seg>
<seg id="28">"When you think of it again, do you remember the Liberal government’s extensive news about tuberculosis?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"In early 2018, this was Jane Fairbaird, the former Health Canada Minister, when she announced that the tuberculosis disease would be eliminated in the north by 2030."</seg>
<seg id="30">However, Mr. Fairbaird, the federal minister promised to deal with this issue because it is no longer there.</seg>
<seg id="31">"In regards to Mr. Trudeau’s conduct to Mr. Wrayson’s Republican and controversial handling of this SNC-Lavalin case, Fairbaird resigned from the Convention."</seg>
<seg id="32">"As a result, the Liberals have not heard anything about TB prevention."</seg>
<seg id="33">"It’s like the hunters’ assistance program, I think it’s stranded in the Inuit-public relationship, so it seems that the extensive discussions on the ban on tuberculosis are in a crisis situation."</seg>
<seg id="34">"The public is aware that tuberculosis is caused by poverty, poor diet and poor housing."</seg>
<seg id="35">"In terms of housing, Trudeau also made a statement that was already warm and remarkable last summer."</seg>
<seg id="36">"As well as the Government of Canada’s National Social Housing Program, “Consolidated” with Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, there has been no unexpected action."”"”</seg>
<seg id="37">We would also like to congratulate Mumalaaq Qaqqaq for winning the medal.</seg>
<seg id="38">"As part of the Fourth Division of the Legal Services Board of the Legislative Assembly, it will require assistance to make it heard."</seg>
<seg id="39">Let the people of Nunavut just provide opportunities and support.</seg>
<seg id="40">"He won two capabilities, Leona Aglukkaq and Megan Pizzo-Lyall."</seg>
<seg id="41">I sincerely hope that these two losers continue to serve the people of Nunavut and the north.</seg>

<seg id="2">"In comparison with my colleagues we are prepared to make a decision on the $80 million that can be spent."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Joelie Kownirk, Member for Amittuq, was one of the Members of the Nunavut Legislative Assembly asking the government about the $80 million increase in the Iqaluit-Nuuk Centre for the Weber Approach project."</seg>
<seg id="4">Some Nunavut lawyers are now asking for unsolicited support for the expansion of the Nuuk-Qulliq Bay Abbott project.</seg>
<seg id="5">"In August, the federal government committed $151 million to the project, which is dedicated to 1,700 kilometres of Weber Abbott from Nuuk, Greenland through the Baffin Gulf of Iqaluit."</seg>
<seg id="6">From there, they would be shipped to Kimmirut.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The Government of Nunavut will develop a framework and a project to begin, which will be completed by 2023."</seg>
<seg id="8">"In the last year, the Legislative Assembly approved this project, which was supposed to cost $126 million."</seg>
<seg id="9">"“This year later, we were informed that the cost of the project increased to reflect the increased costs and that it was estimated to be approximately $209 million,” John Main, the Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, said in a Member’s Statement on Wednesday, October 23."</seg>
<seg id="10">"There’s a difference of $80 million," Main said."</seg>
<seg id="11">"“When I look at my colleagues we can make a decision on the possibilities of $80 million,” Main says."</seg>
<seg id="12">Federal contribution from the Small Communities and Northern Communities Initiative to the Investigation of the Canada Plan (Canada Benefits Plan).</seg>
<seg id="13">The project is now before the Supreme Court of Canada in its review of the proposed expenditures for 2020/21.</seg>
<seg id="14">"At the end of Question Period, Joelie Kownirk, MLA for Amittuq asked Quassa Kusugak, Minister of Community and Government Services, about this $80 million increase in the government’s pre-planning program."</seg>
<seg id="15">"This work, as described in the Government of Nunavut’s Fiscal Planning Assistance Program, “makes sure that this project has a clear definition, and that interest information is available on development, a timely cost analysis and timetable, prior to the start of the cost planning process.”"”</seg>
<seg id="16">"“Is it a pre-planning process, yes or no?"</seg>
<seg id="17">He is asking the question to Ms. Kusugak.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The planning has been completed and a cost analysis is still ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="19">"When we were informed, we realized that it was going to be a lot more expensive," Ms. Kusugak says."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Maybe, sitting next to the chair of the legislative assembly, is standing up for further questions from Ms. Kusugak."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Can the minister explain how this massive project is going up in cost over the course of the year?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"It goes on to say that after the budget was approved last year, the department was re-evaluating the project and the cost increased after the review."</seg>
<seg id="23">"The minister stated again that, in May 2019, his department felt that the funding request would be increased to $201.6 million to provide “the maximum amount of federal funding available for the program if necessary.”"”</seg>
<seg id="24">"Unfortunately, on October 24, Main rose again in question period to follow up with Finance Minister George Hickes on the same issue."</seg>
<seg id="25">"“Through the Financial Management Board, what mechanisms were used to inform the department of the $80 million cost increase in this project?"</seg>
<seg id="26">Mr. Maine asked.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Mr.Hickes stated that with the federal government’s increased support for the project, and in addition to a valuable marine research project, the Government of Nunavut also increased its contribution."</seg>
<seg id="28">"The Department of Community and Government Services gave it back to the Financial Management Board for this reason when they found out that the expenditures were under-expended."</seg>
<seg id="29">"Hickes also indicated that half of the GN's share of the 25 percent contribution to the project, while the federal government contributes 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="30">"“As the Government of Nunavut, we don’t have to pay $80 million, and we have to pay 25 percent."</seg>

<seg id="2">Sally Ford, after the election of the federal government, speaks to the need for change.</seg>

<seg id="4">Elaine Anzumi</seg>
<seg id="5">"Makinnasuaqtiit President Charlie Ford did not alter his comments about Nunavik’s legal position in celebrating his announcement to the new Member of Parliament, Saviour Brophy."</seg>
<seg id="6">"“We will be looking at the Electoral Boundaries Commission to make sure that this is understood, in other words, to have Nunavik’s self-government in our communities, which is what we would like to see right now in light of our self-reliance program,” he says."</seg>
<seg id="7">"We need it at the provincial level."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Abby-James Bay-Nudge is one of the largest federal political projects in Quebec, starting from Nunavik to here in the La Valley-Good area of the community, where four of the six 2019 federal candidates live, including Bruce to Black Captain."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Nunavik leaders have wanted to have their own government for their country of origin in 1972.</seg>
<seg id="10">"In 2002, the Kativik Civil Liberties Government, including the Makivik Federal Electoral Boundaries Commission, came to the commission on this issue and attended again in 2011."</seg>
<seg id="11">"The division was expanded in 2013, adding two more communities in southern Canada."</seg>
<seg id="12">"The divisions were re-designed, through the Commission, to ensure that the population was balanced."</seg>
<seg id="13">"From the rest of Canada, there are about 100,000 people in the region, whereas the snowblower-James-Good is less than 85,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="14">"When the Nunavik population was around 13,000, Nunavik was well below that, but the leaders of this group have responded to this issue of Nunavik’s independence."</seg>

<seg id="18">"In a statement to Ford, he welcomed Bruby to Nunavik to visit him as soon as possible."</seg>
<seg id="19">"“I am very pleased that we will be meeting together, and that his support for self-reliance is very much appreciated, as well as issues such as the implementation of the Junior Namibia Act on the rights of aboriginal people,” Mr. Ford says."</seg>
<seg id="20">"It was a great news story for Black Quebec’s President Eves-Francois Blanchett, who won 32 seats for Quebec."</seg>
<seg id="21">"“This is our commitment to support the development of our mandate in Nunavik – through the legal and economic sectors – and to establish a legal framework for appropriate cooperation,” says Ford."</seg>
<seg id="22">"“Nevertheless, in Quebec’s interest in independence, Inuit have a long history of contributing to Canada’s unified system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Wood set up the election, although the Liberals do not have the seats of the new government, to allow the diversity of wrestlers to come together and bring the rest of Canada together."</seg>

<seg id="1">"Increasing the prevention of RSV in Nunavut, thousands of people are saying"</seg>
<seg id="2">"“In general, you would save a lot of money on the rates of lung cancer."</seg>
<seg id="3">The Nunavut Air Ambulance Service (Nunavut Lifeline) is suspended from Iqaluit International Airport for this summer’s Air Show.</seg>
<seg id="4">"In some cases, children with Alzheimer’s disease (RSV, respiratory disease) have to be sent out and this leads to the use of aircraft and hospital costs."</seg>
<seg id="5">"This is Dr. Anna Pangoya and her fellow teachers at the Toronto Jerusalem Health Elementary School in 1989 who first introduced this change.org at the end of September, and for the 1,000 signatures of the participants."</seg>
<seg id="6">"When this report was finally published, there were 23,322 names put together – and now they want to reach 25,000 signatures."</seg>
<seg id="7">The purpose of this campaign is to ensure that the Government of Nunavut will protect many deaths and reduce the need for health care infants through the reintroduction of the antibiotic called paediatric vaccine for all infants under six months of age.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Palvizuma is a non-vaccination program, not a vaccination program, and it’s a marketing program called Synagus."</seg>
<seg id="9">"It has been proven that infants have more lung diseases that start with RSV, a summary of the “professional flu,” which leads to Alzheimer’s disease, and leads to a chronic disease called bronchitis."”"”</seg>
<seg id="10">"However, Dr. Michael Patterson, the Chief Medical Officer of Health for Nunavut, noted in a Nunatsiaq News interview that the Government of Nunavut provides paediatricians with 11 to 12 percent of babies under the age of 2."</seg>
<seg id="11">"“We use it more for infants who are more vulnerable to RSV, and for those who support the international donations of palivizuma,” he says."</seg>
<seg id="12">"These include infants who are born, under 35 weeks of pregnancy, or infants with lung disease or heart disease."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Ponder, who is a teacher in child care in Toronto’s June pharmaceutical industry, has been writing a curriculum for 15 years about the ongoing presence and compatibility of RSV in the north."</seg>
<seg id="14">"As a result of this study, this is totally dissatisfied with the current territorial policy and suggests that all Nunavut infants need this health care system."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Lucy Anna Panuji, one of the facilitators of child care here in Toronto’s Jerusalem Prescription Medicines Program, said that doing research on people’s infants with a vaccination program called palivizuma would make a significant difference in my life and financially."</seg>
<seg id="16">Nunavut’s rate system is essential</seg>
<seg id="17">She noted through her study that RSV is a chronic and multi-purpose disease and provides a wide range of air transportation and medical services to Nunavut’s public health.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The cost of health care is very high: about $5,600 per patient."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Regardless of how much that is costing, the bulldozer and many believe that this is a subsidy."</seg>
<seg id="20">"In Nunavut, early diagnosis and medical evacuations are the best way to deal with them," Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="21">"“We have done a number of cost-benefit analysis that revealed that if we gave the northern majority in the palivia, there would be savings,” he said in an interview."</seg>
<seg id="22">"International research, published in 2013, found that there were a significant number of lung cancers in Kitikmeot infants: it was set at 389 out of 1,000."</seg>
<seg id="23">"In its study, which was conducted from January 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010, it found that the expenditures for the hospitalization of this disease were up to $57,535."</seg>
<seg id="24">"In the Baffin region, lung cancer among infants was in 2002 from 1,000 newborns and in the Kivalliq region, 230 out of 1,000 newborns."</seg>
<seg id="25">This means that the Government of Nunavut has spent $5.9 million on a pandemic infant in the Qikiqtani region and approximately $5.7 million on a Kivalliq infant health study.</seg>
<seg id="26">"However, it was, the Kivalliq had the highest rate of lung cancer at the hospital: $63,686."</seg>
<seg id="27">"“In general, it saves money, because of the high rates of lung cancer,” he says."</seg>
<seg id="28">Superintendent of Ontario Nurses Supports the Register</seg>
<seg id="29">"Many infants are 10 times more likely to be treated at the hospital for lung cancer than the “symptoms’ of infants and the disease is much more severe.”"”</seg>
<seg id="30">"Although this is a major problem, Inuit infants do not receive Nunavut’s antibiotics," Gandhi wrote in his donations."</seg>
<seg id="31">"The situation with professional qualifications has been highlighted by the North West School Health, the Canadian Medical Association and the Canadian Medical Research Centre for Aboriginal Peoples."</seg>
<seg id="32">However, it is safe for infants in Nunavut to complete their babies do not receive this antibiotic service – whether they come from a traumatic community outside of Iqaluit and they are older than lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="33">Mr. Pangoya is saying that they are doing the wrong thing.</seg>
<seg id="34">"I've done a lot of hard work.</seg>
<seg id="35">I have shown my signage to the public.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Korelyn Barnett, Jane Fairbaird, has seen my notes and said they are credible," she says."</seg>
<seg id="37">Nunavik vaccinates all infants</seg>
<seg id="38">"Initially, not only in Nunavut, the Department of Health and Social Services in Nunavik has provided paediatric paediatrics to all infants over the past three years."</seg>
<seg id="39">"In the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut on October 18, the Hon. George Hickes stated in response to questions from the Member for Iqaluit-Niaqunnguu, Pat Angnakak, that the Government of Nunavut "review Nunavik practices."</seg>
<seg id="40">"“We’re monitoring that particular project,” says Hicks."</seg>
<seg id="41">Ms. Arnakak said this RSV (Blueprint for Disease) has a significant impact on the family.</seg>
<seg id="42">"“It was a very good day, I know the baby had to be sent to the hospital for RSV and it has a huge impact on the family, especially when this baby is too young."</seg>
<seg id="43">However, Mr. Hickes defended the Government of Nunavut’s current approach and insisted that the government only provides savings to the public.</seg>
<seg id="44">"There is no legal or policy decision on the cost.</seg>
<seg id="45">"It’s based on the best practice of health care," Hicks says."</seg>
<seg id="46">Mr. Patterson reiterated that Nunavik was successful three years earlier with infants under six months.</seg>
<seg id="47">"“We’re still waiting for that number, and once we find out that it’s not cost-effective to lend it to the palivia, then we would implement it very quickly,” Patterson says."</seg>
<seg id="48">"In its view, there are still not enough official symbols to enforce Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="49">"“I don’t agree with the intent of the signing and the other part of the disclosure is that this has been completed, or that there is a scientific basis for this."</seg>
<seg id="50">"There are a lot of people who still have questions," he says."</seg>
<seg id="51">The use of the pavement in Nunavut has come from a long time ago.</seg>

<seg id="2">"This is a joyous event."</seg>
<seg id="3">Gord Howard became the Iqaluit Fire Chief two weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">"He has been reading and doing a lot of research, but he is saying that this new job is something that he can do more."</seg>
<seg id="5">(Parliament Dustin Paddock)</seg>
<seg id="6">"When Gordon Howard attended the City Council’s first meeting on October 22 when he became the chief fire officer, he didn’t expect to be interviewed."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Are you in support of the Montreal Canadiens?"</seg>
<seg id="8">Asked by the Hon. Member Joanasie Akumalik.</seg>
<seg id="9">"After a while of silence, Howard replied, “No.”"”</seg>
<seg id="10">They are here laughing.</seg>
<seg id="11">"A week later, in an interview with Nunatsiaq News, Mr. Howard said, “I felt that my support was not being heard.”"”</seg>
<seg id="12">"Havewood, who grew up in Hamilton, came to Iqaluit through Methodwood, Ontario, the community of Collingwood near George Bay."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Although he is from the north, he is also from the north."</seg>
<seg id="14">"In his ten years as the emergency health officer for the Canadian Forces, the area near Arviat has been tentative in the middle of winter."</seg>
<seg id="15">"“That’s my understanding of snow, I understand that it’s cold, but it’s also something that has to be done."</seg>
<seg id="16">It seems like it’s in another part of the world and that’s why I brought it up here.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The department is doing a lot of things," says Howard, referring to the Iqaluit Fire Department as a group – some of which are professional firefighters and some of them just volunteer."</seg>
<seg id="18">That was all that he didn’t bring to Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition to their experience as a firefighter and emergency response – which doesn’t happen very often in other areas – this was also due to the fact that there is a lot of fire in Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="20">"“The history of this department is rather ambitious,” says Howard."</seg>
<seg id="21">"“This is a very busy place, and the resources are always in place."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Strengthening departmental programs such as, and now, Mr. Howard, new in this area, such as water problems and the lack of support, for the burning and the fire hall is too small."</seg>
<seg id="23">"You can’t change it overnight and you don’t seem to want to make too many changes in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="24">"If we keep moving forward and not going backwards I would be happy," says Howard."</seg>
<seg id="25">"“To me, it’s a fun project."</seg>
<seg id="26">"Thanks, what we are trying to do and what we know is what we can do."</seg>
<seg id="27">"In regards to the first question that was asked by the city as the designation director of emergency services, “I'm a Catholic assistant,” he says with a smile."”"”</seg>

<seg id="23">"If there are bedbugs for patients from the north, this would not be the first time, as they did in 2010 in Winnipeg."</seg>

<seg id="8">"On Wednesday, November 6, NTI President Aluki Kuuttiq passed a motion immediately calling for the suspension of this final public meeting and the continuation of the eight-month term for the year."</seg>
<seg id="9">It was very interesting to hear the voices speak to their colleagues just to see what the members are going to do about this situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Many of the officials in Newfoundland fell victim to their faces, sometimes smuggling their arms and turning to the kitchen when the river made its motion."</seg>
<seg id="11">"We are concerned that this public meeting would be completed without the action being completed.</seg>
<seg id="12">People need to be consulted and have a good dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Everyone in this room would like to understand all the issues raised and how it would affect NTI and the organizations," Kutiq said in a statement that the chamber is full of people who would like to talk about it and the people."</seg>
<seg id="14">"It affects all people’s lives," he says"</seg>
<seg id="15">"The motion was tabled on the fifth day of the public meeting in Iqaluit, which was almost an hour away."</seg>

<seg id="17">"The Nunavut Impact Review Board was satisfied with Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated’s resolution, that the meeting was suspended and that the Pond Inlet conciliation was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="18">"About a week ago, Baffinland representatives for interested parties continued to express their plans to build a highway from North Mary River to the Mary River Port."</seg>
<seg id="19">"For the railway and other parts of the port, it would make it possible for the company to produce a larger portion of its current 6 million tonnes of metal a year to 12 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="20">"What is particularly noticeable in the week is that the province’s proposal to modify its business powers by removing the existing restrictions and by imposing a restriction on shipping, 20 times the railroads and 176 barges per year."</seg>
<seg id="21">"The motion to adjourn the session was supported by all interested parties, many of whom are concerned about the uncertainty surrounding the project."</seg>
<seg id="22">"People Jay Akeeagok, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association President, stated in Nunatsiaq News that he believes in the Nunavut Impact Review Board’s process to ensure that “the public has the opportunity to ask questions about these values’ and that “the opportunity for residents to express their concerns is always there.”"”</seg>
<seg id="23">"Mr. Akoak also stated that the motion was not expected, but it was scheduled for the last day of the session."</seg>
<seg id="24">The Newfoundland staff are watching Mr. Kuuttiq move the motion to adjourn.</seg>

<seg id="39">"None of them said they weren’t prepared to start this day.</seg>
<seg id="40">In any event, it was not possible to minimize the use of these devices."</seg>
<seg id="41">"Megan Lord-Wheeler, Vice-President of Renewable Resources for Buffalo, said the delay would have an impact on the “emergency deficiencies’ of the project."”"”</seg>
<seg id="42">"“But we will do all we can to provide and protect 3,000 Canadians from employment, 476 of whom are Inuit."</seg>

<seg id="44">"We have to deal with the extent to which there would be a problem with the project," Lord-Whitehead says."</seg>

<seg id="58">I leave them with a better foundation than they were going to me?</seg>
<seg id="59">"This is basically the basis of decision-making, no matter what culture you are," he says."</seg>

<seg id="1">Nunavut Legislative Assembly agrees to amend the Income Tax Act</seg>
<seg id="2">"This government is actively pursuing measures such as repatriating Coppermine to generate revenue."</seg>
<seg id="3">"The Honourable Adam Methuselah questioned Finance Minister George Hickes on Bill 26, An Act to Amend the Income Tax Act, during the Justices of the Peace meeting on Wednesday, November 6.</seg>
<seg id="4">Members of the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut have recently updated the Nunavut Income Tax Act to amend the Payroll Tax Act.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The changes, which were read for the third time on Wednesday, November 6, included an increase in the private rate from $13,325 to $16,000."</seg>
<seg id="6">"This means that taxpayers will earn close to $3,000 a year before they have to pay Nunavut’s income tax."</seg>
<seg id="7">"The other change is to increase the cost of living tax from $1,200 to $1,500."</seg>
<seg id="8">"This means that if taxpayers earn more than $60,000 for their work they will receive an additional $300 in income tax returns."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the territorial corporate tax rate for small businesses is down from 4 percent to 3 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">"“Our government is actively pursuing the issue of repatriating Coppermine to a profit,” says Finance Minister George Hickes."</seg>
<seg id="11">"The federal government’s arrangement with the Coppermine Tax Rebate Program came into effect in Nunavut on July 1st, to make the fuel price increase more efficient – it would have increased by 5 cents per litre – the Government of Nunavut introduced a Coppermine Fuel Rebate Program, which reduces the price of fuel by half."</seg>
<seg id="12">"In its deliberations on the issue of income tax reform, Nunavut legislators agreed that corporate tax revenues should be returned to Nunavummiut."</seg>
<seg id="13">But they couldn’t agree on what would be the best way to do that.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Adam Lighthizer, the Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, was concerned that, as a result of the reduction in income tax rates, the government would have to use tax credits for government operations."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I understand that we are in a critical situation with the federal government and that our own revenues are only 10 to 15 percent of our total allowable harvest.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We have to spend a lot of money on our own economy that we have to operate," says Lighthizer."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Why is the government trying to use the Copenhagen tax credits to benefit the government’s operations?"</seg>
<seg id="18">"“Connor tax credits that we are developing would only be part of the Government of Nunavut and the company has been trying to make it fair to our own companies,” the response Mr. Hickes said, “I don’t think we would be satisfied if we just put those payments in place for other revenues and not get the money back to the taxpayer.”"”</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr. Lighthizer also stated that revising the Income Tax Act would be the most appropriate way of repatriating Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="20">"They also stated that the Copper Tax Benefit will be used by the Government of Nunavut as a prerequisite, to reduce the number of Nunavut companies."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Slaughter’s change is of great concern to me and a lot of work needs to be done now and for the future.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Having said that, I have tabled a number of suggestions for our government on how to find solutions or alternatives for Nunavut’s energy efficiency," says Lighthizer."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Why hasn’t these ideas been taken into consideration and demanded for the use of the Copenhagen tax revenue?"</seg>
<seg id="24">Mr. Hickes responded by saying that each department – responsible for specific projects – was listening.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Many departments have undertaken a number of initiatives, including the Qulliq Energy Corporation, which is responsible for developing energy efficient LED street lighting in Nunavut, which was approved at its recent meeting."</seg>
<seg id="26">"In2019/20, the Government of Nunavut considers it to be generating 12 million dollars in coffee tax payments."</seg>
<seg id="27">It would be broken down as follows:</seg>
<seg id="28">2 million dollars for government wide higher heating costs for public housing and government buildings such as schools and health centres.</seg>
<seg id="29">3.6 million dollars for a new Nunavut company rebate.</seg>
<seg id="30">6.2 million in remittances to Nunavut residents and Nunavut employees during the current fiscal year for the purpose of amending the Income Tax Act.</seg>
<seg id="31">But for Lightning this is not a mathematically integrated system.</seg>
<seg id="32">"“Where is the 50 percent rebate from the Petroleum Products Division and the 50 percent rebate from the Coppermine Tax Rebate Program, why is it so small for energy efficiency measures?"</seg>
<seg id="33">"Mr.Hickes replied that the federal government’s arrangement with Captain Tax increases each year over the next five years, and that although this 50 percent deduction from the refineries will continue, the year of increased tax credits will generate additional revenue for other projects."</seg>
<seg id="34">The Bill received second reading on November 6 and received third reading last night.</seg>
<seg id="35">"At the end of the day, Lighthizer, from yesterday’s newborn son said to the Legislative Assembly that he had only been sleeping for three hours and left."</seg>
<seg id="36">"In a recent email to Nunatsiaq News, Lighthizer expressed dissatisfaction that he was going to vote against the legislation."</seg>
<seg id="37">"“I don’t agree with the terms of reference of Bill 26, I don’t think it’s a proper year policy,” the author of Lighthizer was going to say in the House."</seg>
<seg id="38">"The purpose of the Conservative tax is to reduce the importation of fossil fuels and emissions from industries and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="39">"If this Act includes an energy-related tax rebate for individuals and businesses that are willing to contribute, or if the Government of Nunavut had developed an action plan for individuals to assist in purchasing and developing energy-efficient technologies, I would have been very pleased to have agreed to the legislation."</seg>
<seg id="40">Although Lighthizer is not satisfied this legislation was passed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Mr. Hickes indicated that he was willing to listen to suggestions on how to use the company’s tax revenue to reduce the cost of living in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I strongly encourage the public to write a letter to Members of the Legislative Assembly or the government with a view to taking action in this area."</seg>

<seg id="1">"Nothing: if it’s a profitable factor, let it be realised"</seg>
<seg id="2">Members are very much interested in Bavaria’s investment in production</seg>
<seg id="3">Participants sat in Iqaluit at the Katannilik Hall on the fourth day of the Nunavut Impact Review Board’s public hearing on the Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation’s proposed road expansion proposal for the Mary River project.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Nunavut’s approach to enforcing legislation in the area of industry development, which began in 1993 under the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, has not played a role in such areas as radical, irreversible environmental and socio-economic studies at the Mary River mine over the past decade."</seg>
<seg id="5">"This was advertised in Iqaluit earlier this month, when the Nunavut Impact Review Board held its last public hearing for $900 million worth of highway expansion proposals from the Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation in the event of a sudden resignation due to confusion and miscommunication."</seg>
<seg id="6">The last day of meetings scheduled for seven days for Pond Inlet was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="7">"At the same time, the Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation is in a billion dollars, the multi-faceted mercury mine is in a situation of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="8">"In writing this letter, the Nunavut Impact Review Board had yet to make a decision on the resolution from Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated which, if approved, would result in a delay of eight to twelve months."</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the Baffinland Land Claim Corporation, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, indicated that they could not immediately support or approve the expansion of the highway."</seg>
<seg id="10">"In addition to QIA's work, QC has expressed its full support for the project."</seg>
<seg id="11">These are Arctic Co-operatives Limited.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is a complex process.</seg>
<seg id="13">"When it came to Buffalo, the Vice-President of Renewable Resources, Megan Lord-Health, in this case said that the company was only concerned that the project would be able to proceed, saying, “We will do our utmost to maintain and protect the Canadian population of 3,000 jobs, 476 of which are Inuit.”"”</seg>
<seg id="14">"In the past week, Buffalo reported in Nunatsiaq News that it has suspended 490 southern contractors and 96 contractors of Inuit labour."</seg>
<seg id="15">As a result, we are reaching the largest number of unanswered questions related to this project: the Mary River project funding.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Buffalo has said that the potential for the mine’s economy is uncertain unless regulators permit the construction of a 110 kilometre railway line for Mary River Cape Dorset and its production goes up to 12 million tonnes a year, which would be able to do that by 176 times as much as the Eclipse Sound."</seg>
<seg id="17">"The problem is, they didn’t come up with a public report on this program."</seg>
<seg id="18">"In addition, more scientists were no longer asking questions about this."</seg>
<seg id="19">"A year ago, despite the lack of transparency, this did not stop the holders from expressing their confidence."</seg>
<seg id="20">"In the summer and fall of 2018, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association activated the Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation, protecting the Nunavut Impact Review Board."</seg>
<seg id="21">"On August 31 of this year, the Nunavut Impact Review Board decided that the federal government would not approve the preliminary and lower year-end production rate – from 4.2 million tonnes of metal to 6 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Buffalo and his partner, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, took the initiative."</seg>
<seg id="23">"In a few weeks, they wrote to the Chief Electoral Officer on this issue, Dominique Leblanc, at the time as the federal Northern Minister, to revise the Board’s decision."</seg>
<seg id="24">Why?</seg>
<seg id="25">For the money.</seg>
<seg id="26">"The Inuit Association expressed a shock at the potential of the Mary River mine, which will require a significant amount of funding and resources, in the amount of over $20 million here in the new Inuit Impact and Benefit Agreement."</seg>
<seg id="27">Ottawa agreed.</seg>
<seg id="28">"As a result of the Qikiqtani Inuit Association’s concerns about the feasibility of funding the mine, the federal government approved the Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation’s proposal last year."</seg>
<seg id="29">"“We are also concerned about the long-term potential of the Mary River mine and the knowledge of the Qikiqtani Inuit Association’s concerns with respect to the economic development project’s regulatory framework for reintroducing applications,” Lancaster Sound dated September 30, 2018, in a letter signed by federal-provincial-territorial minister Carolyn Bennett."</seg>
<seg id="30">"In other words, the most important Member of Parliament for everyone – the Federal Government – is committed to the economic importance and value of this."</seg>
<seg id="31">And they did that even though there was no financial evidence in there.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="33">"If it’s true that this project is not profitable, what the Member is saying is that he should be willing to see what he says is true."</seg>
<seg id="34">"As a result of the Mary River project, Baffinland’s employees – as required – should be able to provide a number of benefits to this environmental impact statement."</seg>
<seg id="35">"In terms of the project’s financial ability, I don’t think the Nunavut Impact Review Board is very interested in publishing public indicators."</seg>
<seg id="36">"As a matter of fact, the Nunavut Impact Review Board has recommended that a lengthy financial statement received by the Canadian Coast Guard from the Arctic be “responsible” and that it should not be tabled in the Legislative Assembly by a public register."”"”</seg>
<seg id="37">(This is still on our website).</seg>
<seg id="38">The Nunavut Impact Review Board recommended that this document be used after it was tabled – and it was removed from Baffinland’s request.</seg>
<seg id="39">"In this case, Baffinland wanted to submit, on a personal basis, a shorter financial statement explaining why Baffinland could generate more revenue through greater production."</seg>
<seg id="40">The issue of self-determination may be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="41">Even though the Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation is trying to resolve this problem.</seg>
<seg id="42">"In its response, the Nunavut Impact Review Board made a different decision, which does not make sense."</seg>
<seg id="43">"If the federal government is going to invest in it, then the federal Income Support Board is required to do so."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Absolutely, the Nunavut Impact Review Board and other regulators should apply for this type of evidence."</seg>
<seg id="45">They should be very interested.</seg>
<seg id="46">"As well as the Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association."</seg>
<seg id="47">"In addition to the possibility of resurfacing such concerns, the federal government should amend the federal legislation governing the Nunavut Impact Review Board’s practices, the Nunavut Planning Commission and the Program Review Act, to ensure that financial information is delivered in the future."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Although I would like to take this opportunity to comment, there are still a lot of unanswered questions about the Baffinland’s final proposal, relating to the railway impact on caribou, the impact of ships on whales, the project on the lack of Inuit employment, and a lot more."</seg>
<seg id="49">"The question relates to the Arctic Bay Highway Port proposal, which was approved by Baffinland in 2013 for construction capacity, and 18 million tonnes of production for the year, and it is still not clear why the Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation was asked to build in 2013 when it was allowed to produce 18 million tonnes per year."</seg>
<seg id="50">It remains unclear why the province of Newfoundland has failed to implement this plan.</seg>
<seg id="51">But the biggest question is how can this program be sustainable.</seg>

<seg id="4">"This year the Quebec Government added a subsidy to the members of the early childhood education program, based on family income."</seg>
<seg id="5">"In November 7, 2019, these subsidies were made redundant, with the daycare bill set at $8.25 a day."</seg>

<seg id="8">"The investment in the restructuring of Quebec has resulted in additional funding for family and child care services in Quebec, including Nunavik."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Company’s revenues were accounted for between 2.4 percent in 2018/19, which is 0.6 percent higher than anticipated."</seg>
<seg id="10">"At this time, the Quebec Finance Minister, Eric Garrett, announced on November 7 that $857 million would be in line with what was stated in the past few years."</seg>
<seg id="11">Two major initiatives from this initiative have already been inspired by the Child Benefit and Child Welfare Benefit.</seg>
<seg id="12">"“Environmental improvements to Quebec’s economy and financial situation have resulted in Quebec’s success in this area,” Jarrod says in the news release."</seg>
<seg id="13">"The economic growth of Quebec gives us the opportunity to reduce deficits and fulfill the government’s commitments."</seg>
<seg id="14">"As for this program, Quebec is eliminating the additional resources provided to the Family Child Care Initiative implemented by the former Philippines Liberal government in 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">"In this program, additional support for childcare is an additional cost of living per day."</seg>
<seg id="16">This subsidy was increased by 15 dollars a day for higher income earners.</seg>
<seg id="17">"All income earned less than $50,000 was not increased under the program."</seg>
<seg id="18">"The November 7 news release will reimburse the Quebec childcare payment of $8.25, abandoning the payment to all income earners."</seg>
<seg id="19">This new fee will be used in Nunavik through the Kativik Community Government Program in Nunavik for child care.</seg>
<seg id="20">"In the Quebec news release, this new payment will be for this year, and this reporter from the Montreal Canadiens reported that this will take place on January 1, 2019."</seg>
<seg id="21">"In the last week, the Parents of Childcare Services Centre in every community government, Julie-Anne Petty, was not informed as to how or when these payments would begin in Nunavik."</seg>
<seg id="22">The Premier Francis Liguria’s government first restructured the slow elimination of additional resources and completely dissolved by 2022.</seg>
<seg id="23">The efficiencies and the emerging surplus of $4 billion for 2019/20 fiscal year are accelerating the process.</seg>
<seg id="24">"As well as removing the payments for childcare, the Quebec Government is moving forward with increasing the number of child tax benefits that was promised in 2021."</seg>
<seg id="25">"As of January 2020, the Quebec Government announced that the family here will receive an additional $779 per year."</seg>

<seg id="5">Did you find out during the federal election campaign that either the Premiers or the Premiers didn’t talk too much about the issues of Nunavummiut and other northerners?</seg>
<seg id="6">That’s not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The vast majority of lawmakers seem to think that the majority of Canadians, due to the fact that they are from the south, are not enough to vote whether they are talking about northerners that the majority of Canadians in the country have never heard of."</seg>
<seg id="8">"The Liberal Government made this known, such as the collapse and abandonment of the establishment of a long-standing Northern and Northern Policy Strategy a day before the election campaign begins."</seg>
<seg id="9">"In an election period, indigenous issues, many of which explode northern concerns, were also ignored."</seg>
<seg id="10">"As a result of a new reduction in Justin Trudeau’s government, and after the Board of Directors were sworn in for their mandate on November 20, it is hoped that they will continue to do so without any sympathy."</seg>
<seg id="11">Here is a symbol of this clause.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is about the precise promises made to the North since the Treaty of Lisbon in 2015: eliminating even 50 percent (broken) of tuberculosis in the north by 2025 and completely eradicated by 2030.</seg>

<seg id="16">He did this less than four days before Trudeau came to Iqaluit to apologize for Canada’s inappropriate treatment of people with tuberculosis in the 1950s and 1960s.</seg>
<seg id="17">"As a result, they remained silent on northern tuberculosis."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Although there have been a lot of choices, there wasn’t much done about it."</seg>
<seg id="19">"And so far, the prevention of tuberculosis has stalled."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Although, in the Northwest Territories, with tuberculosis between 2006 and 2016, it is recorded that 248.5 people in 100,000, health professionals have conducted only one community survey."</seg>
<seg id="21">"This happened in Nine, in 2018, when a lung cancer was diagnosed and a young 14-year-old died of this illness while in hospital with Jane Johns."</seg>

<seg id="42">"In fact, they can’t even be reprimanded for the damage that they have done to their language, they didn’t even have any concerns about that."</seg>
<seg id="43">"This is also a reflection of the history of the Canadian Civil Emergency, where tuberculosis in the north is 300 times higher than the number of non-aboriginal Canadians born."</seg>

<seg id="16">"“This training program is intended to assist the Kativik Community Constables in choosing their cultural views,” Laurice says."</seg>
<seg id="17">"The second part of the training program is nine hours long and it has to be an all-inclusive RCMP training program," says Lorus."</seg>
<seg id="18">The project is expected to be completed in the new fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="19">The surveillance cameras will have to be used by the RCMP</seg>
<seg id="20">Another addition was made to the RCMP and it was appreciated by the members that this camera should be used to monitor the work of the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="21">It’s a pilot project and they’re using six cameras right now.</seg>
<seg id="22">"“This project was initiated by Nunavik’s commitment to the Kativik Community Constable to provide more transparency through its programs,” Laross says."</seg>
<seg id="23">"The Kativik Community Constables aim to provide Inuit with programs that can be accessible and harmonious."</seg>
<seg id="24">Kuujjuaq Member Jobie Takaapik hoped that these cameras would be able to help the people who have had problems with the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="25">"We hear from the RCMP about inappropriate activities and those states don’t want to say much.</seg>
<seg id="26">"There’s a lot of police nervousness," Takakiapik says."</seg>
<seg id="27">"The body cameras have to be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">"It goes on to say that if one or two officers mistreat people, this has a huge impact, and it raises concerns for the whole of the RCMP."</seg>
<seg id="29">"There is the impression that the surveillance cameras, which begin to take pictures of what the RCMP is doing, can be used in the short term."</seg>
<seg id="30">Lorus said these cameras would take effect in January.</seg>
<seg id="31">He goes on to say that mistreatment and inappropriate behaviour will not only be offered to the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="32">"“I recently dropped out of the RCMP last week due to a lack of compliance with our programs in Nunavik,” he says."</seg>
<seg id="33">"We don’t want to have too many police officers in Nunavik."</seg>

<seg id="1">Nunavut’s neighbours are talking about renewable energy in the north.</seg>
<seg id="2">"The representatives from Greenland, Canada and Junior Steel share ideas and experiences"</seg>
<seg id="3">"Bruno Pereira, President of the Qulliq Energy Corporation presents the Northern Empowerment Forum and the Civil Liberties Conference in Iqaluit, November 22, 2019."</seg>
<seg id="4">(professional from the U.S. Consulting General)</seg>
<seg id="5">The renewable energy experts from the Arctic gathered in Iqaluit on November 21 and 22 to share their ideas and experiences with the North.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Provides from Nunavut, the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, Greenland and Junior Settlement Settlement Settlement Settlement Settlement Settlement Settlement Settlement Settlement Settlement Settlement Settlement Settlement Settlement Settlement Settlement Settlement Settlement Settlements from various jurisdictions."</seg>
<seg id="7">"This meeting, called Optimism Operations, Integrated New Technologies and Entrance Stakeholders (Strengthening Operations, Incorporating New Resources and Including Stakeholders), was developed by US Presidents in partnership with the Government of Nunavut and the Qulliq Energy Corporation."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Bruno Pereira, the President of the Qulliq Energy Corporation, said the conciliation was a testament to each other’s problems."</seg>
<seg id="9">"“In the interest of using renewable energy sources in our communities, we would very much like to know what others do, and to find out how they are doing their work to achieve or collapse,” Pereira says."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Premier also said that although it is important to bring representatives together to discuss the issue of fuel efficiency, there are territorial events here in Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Some of the communities have access roads so they are not really in the middle of the Nunavut communities.</seg>
<seg id="12">"There are people like us who are struggling, where we have space, who can deal with the community, so we can see similar disabilities."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Chris Rose, the director of renewable energy in Alaska, said Alaska’s hydroelectric development has contributed to the development of renewable energy sources."</seg>
<seg id="14">"We were able to build 80 communities that were able to use renewable energy in addition to diesel fuel in Technologies.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We feel that we now know how beneficial this is," Rose says."</seg>
<seg id="16">"This subsidy, which is designed to promote renewable resource development projects, is a significant contribution from Alaska to lower energy costs."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Russia said that in the west of Russia, five communities were working together to develop wind turbines and they are using this as an energy source."</seg>
<seg id="18">"“So there is an integrated knowledge of how to manage and manage wind turbines and they can help each other in setting up,” Rose says."</seg>
<seg id="19">"In Alaska, like Nunavut, home energy bills are very expensive."</seg>
<seg id="20">Ross said the communities that are using windmills are not just for light bulbs but also for heating purposes.</seg>
<seg id="21">"They have built small furnaces into people’s houses and they are covered with diamonds that seem to be carpeting.</seg>
<seg id="22">"When it’s more expensive, they go to the power grid, and they have set up a very small tracking system for heat and power plants to be detected," Rose says."</seg>
<seg id="23">"“These are fences that can prevent hot air, which can continue to heat."</seg>
<seg id="24">"They can be housed or burned in homes that are acceptable, and if they get stuck they can have another heater."</seg>
<seg id="25">"In Greenland, the installation of wind turbines has been very difficult, in this case New York Habitat, a technology specialist for recycling in Nuuk."</seg>
<seg id="26">"Three temperatures and darkness make it difficult for wind farmers to use southern designs in the north, says Hargreaves."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Highfield also indicated that two wind turbines were properly installed in other parts of the north of Greenland, but were stranded."</seg>
<seg id="28">"We can say that in Greenland we have chosen more possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="29">"The two wind turbines were installed in 200 different locations and the other one was 150 sites," he says."</seg>
<seg id="30">"The wind turbine collapsed, on the other hand, the fuel truck was too thick for the cold and the engine was damaged," Hargreaves says."</seg>
<seg id="31">"In the 2014 federal election campaign, three political parties announced that Nunavut’s telecommunication system would be disposed of by 2030."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Although it may take some time to develop renewable energies in the north, Hargreaves said the use of fossil fuels was a matter of urgency."</seg>
<seg id="33">"“We have to do something about the use of fossil fuels, because of climate change, because it’s already inappropriate."</seg>
<seg id="34">This is a legal matter because there is a need for petroleum products but there is no funding.</seg>
<seg id="35">"It’s a good investment project," he says."</seg>
<seg id="36">Mr. Pereira said that he found it very interesting to talk to people living in Nunavut adjacent to the north.</seg>
<seg id="37">"“I think that this should be taken into consideration in other ways, in terms of how to start working on recycling."</seg>
<seg id="38">Some of the Inuit have used the equipment and they have had problems with the southern skills but they can’t do it in the north.</seg>
<seg id="39">"If we were financially capable we would be able to track the deficiencies," Paramount says."</seg>

<seg id="1">The Government of Nunavut should involve Inuit in the development of the Education Act: NTI</seg>
<seg id="2">"This is an important policy change that affects a significant proportion of the population of parents and Inuit children in Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Lookie Kuuttiq, President of Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, speaks before the Standing Committee on Legislation on Bill 25, An Act to Amend the Education Act and the Inuit Language Protection Act."</seg>
<seg id="4">"By Alookie Kuuttiq President, NTI."</seg>
<seg id="5">Subject: Minister Joanasie’s Letter to Nunatsiaq News on Bill 25 Consultation Process</seg>
<seg id="6">"Minister Joanasie wrote a letter published in Nunatsiaq News on November 25, 2019 announcing discussions between the Department of Education and Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated concerning Bill 25, indicating that the consultations were conducted in a spirit of mutual respect and offered NTI an opportunity to express their concerns."</seg>
<seg id="7">From the point of view of the minister’s encouragement to NTI's public hearings and NTI's hearings, the GN's view is that they have been cooperating with the previous public meetings.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is not.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The Inuit have the right under Article 32 of the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement to participate in the development of social and cultural policies, as well as in the development of social and cultural programs and services, including governance."</seg>
<seg id="10">It’s a different principle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bill 25 proposes amendments to the Education Act and the Inuit Language Protection Act to establish policies and procedures for the delivery of Inuit language instruction.</seg>
<seg id="12">This fundamental policy change will affect many people with children and people with children in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="13">"As such, Inuit have the right to participate in the development and development of this system."</seg>
<seg id="14">NTI was not given the opportunity to participate in the development of the policy demands outlined in the proposed Bill 25.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It does not only reflect the government’s obligations as outlined in the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, it has historically demonstrated that efforts have been made to achieve legislation that better reflects Inuit goals and objectives."</seg>
<seg id="16">"NTI has been collaborating on proposed legislation from the Government of Nunavut, such as the Inuit Language Protection Act, the Official Languages Act and the Wildlife Act."</seg>
<seg id="17">"As we know it can go ahead, NTI notified the Premier and the newly elected government that they will be co-ordinating working together and working together on Inuit priorities, including education, language and culture."</seg>
<seg id="18">"The Department of Education did not submit a legislative proposal to NTI on August 31, 2018, at which time the Department provided a list of planned community consultations."</seg>
<seg id="19">NTI was given less than a week to do a study on Bill 25 and to prepare and prepare for the Nunavut consultation tour.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is not working together.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The department facilitated consultations that were conducted in the short term, and no solutions or accommodations were provided to address the concerns raised by the public, NTI and other organizations such as the District Education Authority (DEA) and the Coalition of Nunavut District Education Authorities (CNDEA) were also present."</seg>
<seg id="22">"I further urge the Minister of Education in the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement to ensure that clear programs are carried out under Article 32, and that the department manages to ensure that there are good reasons, obligations and obligations and takes on the honour of the Queen when it comes to partnering with the Inuit."</seg>
<seg id="23">"NTI believes that the need to rewrite the Education Act by enacting Inuit participation in the Lisbon Treaty should change the way the department operates, and that there should be a comprehensive recognition of human rights.</seg>
