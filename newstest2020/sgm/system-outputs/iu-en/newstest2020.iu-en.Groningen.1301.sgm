<seg id="70">Premier of Nunavut, Mr. Quassa.</seg>
<seg id="71">Minister’s Statement 046 – 5 (1): Nunavut’s 2018 Youth Award Recipient (Quassa) </seg>
<seg id="72">Hon. Paul Quassa (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="73">Good day to my fellow residents of Igloolik, my colleagues, and all Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="74">I would like to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Dr. Donna Minik-Kimmaliardjuk, who will be receiving the 2018 Youth Achievement Award in Winnipeg.</seg>
<seg id="75">She will be recognized as the first Inuk practitioner in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="76">Dr. Kimmaliardjuk was born in Chesterfield Inlet and he is the first Inuk to be a cardiologist.</seg>
<seg id="77">This year, the fourth year of the program is a six-year program that will be offered at the University of Ottawa for the Heart Institute.</seg>
<seg id="78">Mr. Speaker, Dr. Kimmaliardjuk was able to enter the facility in 2014. He is the only person named in the National Physician Institute of Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="79">In 2016, she became a member of the Aboriginal Healing Foundation for HIV / AIDS Working Group on behalf of Inuit.</seg>
<seg id="80">During his tenure as a Member of the Standing Committee on Social Wellness, he promoted Inuit societal values and Inuit societal values.</seg>
<seg id="81">Mr. Speaker, these awards represent the highest level of pride for aboriginal people in our society.</seg>
<seg id="82">This award celebrates the 25th anniversary of the year in 2018 and brings pride to 350 aboriginal people, Inuit, and First Nations, who demonstrate excellence in achievement and achievement.</seg>
<seg id="83">This award celebrates the cultural diversity of aboriginal peoples in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="84">This year’s awards ceremony will take place on March 23 of this year in Winnipeg.</seg>
<seg id="85">I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Dr. Kimmaliardjuk on his achievement.</seg>
<seg id="86">She has done a lot of work on her own and she is very proud of her accomplishments, as well as the Inuit and the Department of Health and Social Services, and she is a very good role model for our young people in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="87">I know that when I talk about the pride of Dr. Kimmaliardjuk, I’m sure that he will be working on this issue and it’s going to be very important to us.</seg>
<seg id="88">Minister of Justice, Ms. Iqalukjuaq.</seg>
<seg id="89">Minister’s Statement 047 – 1 (5): Rankin Inlet Healing Facility Sewing Project (Cambridge Bay) </seg>
<seg id="90">Hon. Jeannie Iqalukjuaq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the cultural sewing program for the men’s healing facility in Rankin Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="91">These inmates are involved in the sealing, sealskin preparation, and other activities, including helicopters, pelts, sealskin pelts, sealskin pelts, and kitchen pelts.</seg>
<seg id="92">Rosemary Angugahak is a well-respected elder and sewing expert who is well known worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="93">He just went to Norway to teach the sealskins.</seg>
<seg id="94">She was a student of Nunavut Arctic College’s Fur Production and Design Program, and she initiated a program for the Literacy Council of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="95">Rosemary is assisting inmates with culturally appropriate physical, safe, and culturally sensitive rehabilitation programs.</seg>
<seg id="96">The sewing program will work in partnership with the department to support on-the-land programs for inmates to learn how to hunt and how to prepare sealskin and food.</seg>
<seg id="97">These furs and sealskins will be used for the sewing program.</seg>
<seg id="98">Programs are designed to help inmates to become more active in their communities. Once their sentence expires, they are offered incentives instead of criminal behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="99">I recently visited the Rankin Inlet Healing Facility and I was pleased to note the positive impact that the cultural programs have had on the community, especially the elders in the community, such as Rosemary Saunders.</seg>
<seg id="100">Minister of Family Services, Minister Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="101">Minister’s Statement 048 – 5 (1): Red Certificate Program (Savikataaq) </seg>
<seg id="102">Hon. Joe Savikataaq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I say "good day" to the people of Arviat and Paniloo.</seg>
<seg id="103">Mr. Speaker, this is for certified heavy equipment operators and heavy equipment operators.</seg>
<seg id="104">In September of 2016, the heavy equipment operator training program, which is comprised of three partners, was announced in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="105">This allows Nunavummiut to take apprenticeship training and certification programs that are known as the Certificate of Apprenticeship.</seg>
<seg id="106">In November of 2017, Nunavut was given the opportunity to obtain a red seal certificate for heavy equipment and heavy equipment operators.</seg>
<seg id="107">Mr. Speaker, as part of the heavy equipment operator program, this program has passed the Provincial Academy Award for Excellence in Excellence and Excellence in Skills Canada.</seg>
<seg id="108">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to announce that we have been able to demonstrate to Nunavummiut the National Award of Excellence for Excellence in Excellence and Diploma in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="109">Minister of Education, Minister Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="110">Minister’s Statement 049 – 5 (1): New Funding for Early Childhood Education Programs (Joanasie) </seg>
<seg id="111">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon, my colleagues, residents of Cape Dorset and Kimmirut, as well as Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="112">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to announce today that the Department of Education will be providing operations and maintenance funding to eligible daycares.</seg>
<seg id="113">Mr. Speaker, this increase is a result of a three-year program plan that my staff developed with the Early Learning and Childcare Initiative that was signed in September of 2017 with the Government of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="114">Mr. Speaker, in the current fiscal year, we will see that eligible daycares will receive an increase of $1,918.80, with a maximum of $45,494.80, depending on the number of daycare spaces and the location of these facilities.</seg>
<seg id="115">As long as the daycares do not increase the cost of the day cares and they do not qualify for the same amount of money that they can get in the next fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="116">Mr. Speaker, this funding will not only help daycares administer their expenses, but will also assist families in providing child care services without increasing the cost of living.</seg>
<seg id="117">Mr. Speaker, we are proud to be able to provide this funding to support daycares and families.</seg>
<seg id="118">I also believe, and I am sure that we also believe that this funding will have a positive impact on not changing the overall budget and the day-care costs.</seg>
<seg id="119">Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="120">Minister’s Statement 050 – 1 (5): Nunavut Mining Symposium (Sheutiapik) </seg>
<seg id="121">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik (interpretation): Good day to the people of Nunavut, my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="122">Mr. Speaker, mining is a fundamental element of Nunavut’s economic development.</seg>
<seg id="123">Mr. Speaker, my department has been committed to supporting mining development in Nunavut so that Nunavummiut can benefit from these types of activities.</seg>
<seg id="124">Mr. Speaker, the National Mining Symposium will be held in Iqaluit for the 21st Annual Nunavut Mining Symposium on April 9 to 12, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="125">This symposium provides an excellent opportunity for people to explore new opportunities in Nunavut’s mining and mining sectors to ensure that our communities are aware of their participation in the mining and exploration sectors in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="126">We are hopeful that this year’s Mining Symposium will continue to attract more than 400 participants from across the territory and we look forward to more than 400 participants.</seg>
<seg id="127">Mr. Speaker, I look forward to welcoming the mines, Inuit organizations, prospectors, community members, and other stakeholders to this important conference.</seg>
<seg id="128">Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I would like to encourage all Members of the Legislative Assembly and the public to participate in this public event on April 11.</seg>
<seg id="129">It’s not just an opportunity to get good things, but it’s an impact on search and rescue. I want to make sure that the people involved in the search and rescue are accountable to you.</seg>
<seg id="130">Members "Statements. Member for Hudson Bay, Mr. Rumbolt.</seg>
<seg id="131">Member’s Statement 096 – 5 (1): Happy Fifth Birthday to Grandchild (Rumbolt) </seg>

<seg id="161">Member’s Statement 098 – 1 (5): Marijuana Legislation (Lightning) </seg>
<seg id="162">Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="163">I rise today to raise a concern that has been brought to my attention by my constituents regarding the issue of illegal smoking.</seg>
<seg id="164">I just received a letter that says, "My family here in Iqaluit, we are in a public housing unit and we are in a duplex next year.</seg>
<seg id="165">Over the last couple of years, we have had to move from smoke to smoke, the smell, the smoke that goes into my house is very strong. "</seg>
<seg id="166">The letter further indicates that, and I quote, "I am deeply concerned about the effects of smoking on my children, my children, and others."</seg>
<seg id="167">Mr. Speaker, as residents of Iqaluit and my family, we also live in condominiums.</seg>
<seg id="168">Mr. Speaker, carbon monoxide pollution affects other smokers who do not smoke.</seg>
<seg id="169">Mr. Speaker, it has been a long time in the past, even though it’s not smoke-free, it’s a pandemic that has been known by the government, and it has been legislated as a non-smoke-free zone for many years.</seg>
<seg id="170">As a father, we have children with these types of illnesses and I don’t want them to be affected by tobacco, tobacco, and smoking.</seg>
<seg id="171">As my colleague from Pangnirtung pointed out, he had asked a question to the Minister of Health and Social Services on the possibility of marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="172">In my conversations with my constituents, there are a lot of people who have the same concerns.</seg>
<seg id="173">Mr. Speaker, I recognize that when you are dealing with these issues, you have to be flexible and balanced.</seg>
<seg id="174">The federal government’s proposed ban on the use of cigarettes in Nunavut will come into force within a few months.</seg>
<seg id="175">Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask for unanimous consent to conclude my statement.</seg>
<seg id="176">The member is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statement. Are there any nays?</seg>
<seg id="177">Mr. Lightstone, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="178">Thank you, my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="179">Under this legislation, elders will be able to take care of and smoke from marijuana. However, the government will have to make a decision on how to regulate the use of cigarettes in the community.</seg>
<seg id="180">Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Rankin Inlet North, the Member for Chesterfield Inlet, also indicated last week that the government’s own consultations and results indicate that there are concerns about the farming and acquisition of public housing units and condominiums.</seg>
<seg id="181">Mr. Speaker, I believe that when this legislation is introduced in the Legislative Assembly, it will be important to clearly identify these issues and I look forward to working with my colleagues in this House on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="182">Before we proceed, I would like to inform members that Mr. Akoak is not here today due to illness.</seg>
<seg id="183">Mr. Akoak will be quick to respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="184">Member for Baker Lake, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="185">Member’s Statement 099 – 5 (1): Expansion of Training Opportunities in Baker Lake (Mikkungwak) </seg>
<seg id="186">Mr. Mikkungwak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="187">I say "hello" to the people of Baker Lake and all Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="188">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage our government to increase training opportunities in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="189">Mr. Speaker, Baker Lake is a rapidly growing community. It is important that we take the time to provide more training and employment opportunities to the residents of Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="190">Mr. Speaker, the Piqqusilirivvik Cultural School operates the program in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="191">This could be expanded so that the public will have a better idea of how to incorporate Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit into the system.</seg>
<seg id="192">Mr. Speaker, the idea of establishing a university in Nunavut has been mentioned, and Agnico-Eagle Mines has indicated that they would be willing to support this initiative.</seg>
<seg id="193">I think it would be best if we put Nunavut into the middle of the country because Canada is a central part of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="194">Mr. Speaker, one of my colleagues stated that it is important that we adopt these items before they pass.</seg>
<seg id="195">The government’s wheelchairs are very slow, but in spite of that, we have to encourage and encourage any emergencies that come before us.</seg>
<seg id="196">Mr. Speaker, this is the beginning of the fifth Legislative Assembly, and I too would like to see it go a step forward.</seg>
<seg id="197">Expanding the training programs at the community level and in the community of Baker Lake would be a great step in the right direction.</seg>

<seg id="201">Good afternoon, colleagues, Kuglukturmiut, and Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="202">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage the government to take a closer look at the day-to-day operations of the boarding homes.</seg>
<seg id="203">Mr. Speaker, a number of my constituents have brought their concerns to me and it seems to have been a long time ago that these issues have been dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="204">The food mail problem and the disposal of the food has been a problem for a number of months.</seg>
<seg id="205">Mr. Speaker, it is important that the government ensure that the services that are paid to Nunavummiut are actually delivered.</seg>
<seg id="206">I understand that the boarding homes have to have a lot of accommodations every day but it is also very important that even though that is the case they have to be comfortable and taken care of.</seg>
<seg id="207">Mr. Speaker, it is unclear whether or not the boarding homes will be included in the review of the boarding homes.</seg>
<seg id="208">I would really like to see the results of the review and the recommendations that will be made to improve the services and the status of the boarding homes.</seg>

<seg id="230">Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to say that we made a strong statement on Friday that the Legislative Assembly will no longer accept and that the government should be sensitive to its own procurement practices.</seg>
<seg id="231">Mr. Main (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My colleague from Iqaluit-Tasiluk brought up a very important motion on Friday and we will proceed with the next sitting of the Legislative Assembly for the spring sitting.</seg>
<seg id="232">Mr. Speaker, we are a territorial government and this is not always a function of strength.</seg>
<seg id="233">For example, last week, as I indicated in my opening comments, when we were dealing with the college’s capital budget, the government listened to our concerns and even changed the budget.</seg>
<seg id="234">I look forward to seeing more of that in the coming weeks and years, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="235">Mr. Speaker, over the past few weeks, Members of the Legislative Assembly have been asking a lot of questions on a daily basis.</seg>
<seg id="236">I think we can say very clearly that we are trying to achieve our goals and I think it’s quite obvious that we need to do a comprehensive review of the government’s expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="237">It’s very inadequate if we just count people who are going out on the land.</seg>
<seg id="238">I would like to ask for unanimous consent to conclude my statement, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="239">The member is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statement. Are there any nays?</seg>
<seg id="240">Mr. Main, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="241">Ms. Main: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="242">Mr. Speaker, I am talking about examples of these emerging technologies.</seg>
<seg id="243">Mr. Speaker, this information has to be made public in the Legislative Assembly so that we, as elected members, can make informed decisions on whether or not any of these funds have to be increased, reduced, or eliminated because we have limited resources.</seg>
<seg id="244">Mr. Speaker, I will use these examples.</seg>
<seg id="245">I think it’s fair to say that I think we can agree that the government’s administration of the Fuel Tax Rebate Program is not enough to support the hunters and trappers.</seg>
<seg id="246">The Department of Environment administers the government’s Harvester Support Program, which requires a comprehensive review of its programs and how we can improve the direction of harvesters to support the price of fuel.</seg>
<seg id="247">Mr. Speaker, I would also like to take this opportunity to give some examples of the government’s grants and contributions programs.</seg>
<seg id="248">As we all know, the government has spent a lot of money on developing and promoting our economy.</seg>
<seg id="249">We know that the money has been borrowed from the private sector and we know how much it’s costing the private sector.</seg>
<seg id="250">We know who received the funding.</seg>
<seg id="251">We don’t know what this money was used for.</seg>
<seg id="252">We don’t know how many Inuit were hired from Nunavut from that fund and we don’t even know what the money was used for.</seg>
<seg id="253">Mr. Speaker, as you may be aware, I can speak to this issue for a very long time and it will not be useful, but I will stop here for now.</seg>
<seg id="254">I would like to add that I want to look very closely at the budget operations of the Legislative Assembly and I would like to take this opportunity to work closely with all members to strengthen our budget by supporting all of our communities and constituents.</seg>
<seg id="255">Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="256">Member’s Statement 104 – 1 (5): Two More Elders Travelling for Care (Towtongie) </seg>
<seg id="257">Mr. Towtongie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="258">The people of Rankin Inlet North and Chesterfield Inlet I rise today with great respect to the current oldest elder Annie Tatty today who was sent to Ottawa by airplane.</seg>
<seg id="259">Also one of our oldest people, Amarok, I rise today in the House to send him to Gjoa Haven because he doesn’t have an elder in Rankin Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="260">I would like to hear from the people of Rankin Inlet North and Chesterfield Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="261">When I was elected in November, when I was looking at the budget, I asked the Minister of Health and Social Services, "What are the plans for the establishment of an elders" facility in Rankin Inlet or in Nunavut? "</seg>
<seg id="262">I was told by the Minister of Health and Social Services that all of us, as Members of the Legislative Assembly, are very sensitive to our elders and we are very concerned about them.</seg>
<seg id="263">When we have our meeting in Pond Inlet, we will be able to bring this up.</seg>
<seg id="264">I am waiting.</seg>
<seg id="265">A couple of days ago I rose in the House when we were dealing with the capital estimates and I didn’t see it, it was set aside for the elders "facility.</seg>
<seg id="266">I was told that I am not allowed to speak to this issue, so I have to resign.</seg>
<seg id="267">However, I was thankful to our Chairman, Allan Rumbolt, for allowing me to continue to express my feelings for the elders "facility.</seg>
<seg id="268">At this time I stand up as an elected official and I am not satisfied with it.</seg>
<seg id="269">The issue of sending elders to southern institutions is not acceptable.</seg>
<seg id="270">We want to be a good Member of the Legislative Assembly and we want to be a good government and we have told our elders to be proud of them, and to send them out of the territory.</seg>
<seg id="271">Member for Amittuq, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="272">Member’s Statement 105 – 1 (1): Recognition of Hall Beach and Igloolik Volunteers and Search and Rescue (Irqittuq) </seg>
<seg id="273">Mr. Enook (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thought I was forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="274">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say how proud I am of my fellow community residents.</seg>
<seg id="275">The search and rescue teams work very hard to search and rescue teams when there is an emergency.</seg>
<seg id="276">They only use their own funds for their own operations.</seg>
<seg id="277">I rise today to pay tribute to the community of Hall Beach’s search and rescue team, chaired by Kyle Issigaitok, Vice-President George Innuksuk, the Director of the Martha Gibbons Tupiq, who is the outfitter, Daniel Qaunaq.</seg>
<seg id="278">Furthermore, our elder, Abraham Ullulaq, is an elder.</seg>
<seg id="279">As I stated before, this is the first time that a person has travelled to search and rescue. This is the first time that I am a young person.</seg>
<seg id="280">We need to provide more support to our young people because our elders are telling the truth.</seg>
<seg id="281">We don’t think that we’re going to be building a future.</seg>
<seg id="282">I’m on this side of the House, but I’m a little disappointed, but if I listened to it again, I would be more than happy to do that.</seg>
<seg id="283">I don’t think that’s going to be the case for the young people. When you go out on the land, you have to be very careful.</seg>
<seg id="284">Mr. Speaker, I would also like to recognize the Igloolik search and rescue teams. They had a meeting this week in Hall Beach and now it’s springtime and it’s a beautiful day, so I would like to wish everyone a safe trip.</seg>
<seg id="285">For that reason, Mr. Speaker, if you are going to be travelling, please ask your SPOT devices, GPS, or GPS, or GPS, and ask the elders where I go, I will catch up as soon as I can.</seg>
<seg id="286">So those are the types of things that we’re looking at.</seg>
<seg id="287">I rise today to reiterate that the Department of Community and Government Services has only one snowmobile and we have been lobbying the Department of Community and Government Services for a long time and they have never received a response.</seg>
<seg id="288">I urge the search and rescue organizations to provide more support to the search and rescue organizations.</seg>
<seg id="289">That’s it.</seg>
<seg id="290">The last name on the list, Member for South Baffin, Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="291">Member’s Statement 106 – 1 (5): Cape Dorset Athletes (Joanasie) </seg>
<seg id="292">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="293">It’s good to hear some good news from the school in Cape Dorset, the Sam Pudlat School, and I’m sure anyone will be welcomed to the music festival or music festival.</seg>
<seg id="294">I would also like to thank the choir for being able to attend the National Arts Centre in Cape Dorset, as well as the support of the Hamlet of Cape Dorset.</seg>
<seg id="295">There are none.</seg>
<seg id="296">Member for Quttiktuq, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="297">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="298">I would like to recognize four individuals in the Gallery.</seg>
<seg id="299">First of all, I would like to recognize my wife, Carol Akeeagok, who is the Manager of Parks in Nunavut, Jenna Burn, and her staff, and she is always looking after me and our children. My wife, Carol Akeeagok, is the one who is the one who is responsible for the park.</seg>
<seg id="300">I would like to extend my gratitude to my sister Naomi Cookie Kuluguqtuq.</seg>
<seg id="301">I would also like to recognize our new employee who is here with us, who has been here for a long time, who is our daughter, and I am very proud of her. I would like to welcome Jayden Natanine.</seg>
<seg id="302">I would like to make a brief statement on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="303">When I was a child, I was still a child...</seg>
<seg id="304">... I was expecting seal meat for the first time in the lake.</seg>
<seg id="305">I don’t think there are too many seals in the lake, but I think they were expecting to get a seal meat from the Southampton Island area.</seg>
<seg id="306">They were very helpful to me and my mother was my father.</seg>
<seg id="307">I would like to thank them very much for being able to come here.</seg>
<seg id="308">Welcome to your Legislative Assembly, Mr. Otak and Mr. Otak.</seg>
<seg id="309">Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="310">Mr. Towtongie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="311">My parents in Ukkusiksalik, although my mother is now a park, all of us were given photographs and I recognize them very well and we are grateful to our eldest.</seg>
<seg id="312">Furthermore, I used to stay in Igloolik and when I was in Igloolik, Theresa Uttak gave me a Tiktak and Louie Uttak, I would like to thank you for all your nutritional food and I would like to be able to stay with you again.</seg>
<seg id="313">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="314">Welcome to the Gallery.</seg>
<seg id="315">Member for Kugluktuk, Ms. Kamingoak.</seg>
<seg id="316">Mr. Kamingoak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="317">I would like to recognize Naomi Cookie Kuluguqtuq and Carol Akeeagok, who are my relatives.</seg>
<seg id="318">From Naomi from Grise Fiord, I don’t have any relatives every day, as you can see.</seg>
<seg id="319">Welcome to your Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="320">Member for Pangnirtung, Ms. Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="321">Mr. Nakashuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would also like to recognize and congratulate my husband, Andrew Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="322">Please welcome him to the Gallery.</seg>
<seg id="323">Mr. Nakashuk, welcome to our Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="324">Recognition of Visitors in the Gallery. I have no more names on my list.</seg>
<seg id="325">We will move on in our orders of the day.</seg>
<seg id="326">We will start with the Member for Iqaluit-Tasiluk, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="327">Question 123 – 1 (5): Private Securities Act (Hickes) </seg>
<seg id="328">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="329">I would like to direct my questions to the Minister of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="330">Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to invite all of my colleagues to join me in the next couple of weeks and the last couple of weeks to recognize the importance of ensuring that our guards are trained and equal in their careers.</seg>
<seg id="331">I would like to ask the minister if he will be introducing legislation as a government to deal with security issues.</seg>
<seg id="332">Minister responsible for the Department of Justice, Minister Simailak.</seg>
<seg id="333">Hon. Jeannie Ugyuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (Interpretation ends) Thank you, Mr. Hickes, for the question.</seg>
<seg id="334">As of today, the Government of Nunavut does not have a statutory requirement for the inspector to conduct inspections of the facility.</seg>
<seg id="335">As the department is aware, a number of companies have been providing security services in our communities, such as health centres.</seg>
<seg id="336">We are currently undertaking a review of the policy development of the Nunavut Business Incentive Policy.</seg>
<seg id="337">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="338">As the minister is indicating, one of the last jurisdictions in Canada that does not have a national security policy is that we want to make sure that they are accountable to the best of their ability and that they have the necessary skills to provide that service.</seg>
<seg id="339">Mr. Speaker, all provinces and territories have brought forward legislation on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="340">I guess my next question would be: If they’re looking at a policy review, is there going to be a legislative proposal coming forward to the House?</seg>
<seg id="341">Minister responsible for the Department of Justice, Minister Iqalukjuaq.</seg>
<seg id="342">Hon. Jeannie Ugyuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (Interpretation ends) Mr. Hickes, yes, we can start working on the development of policies or regulations for the private sector.</seg>
<seg id="343">Your final supplementary, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="344">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="345">I thank the minister for his willingness to do that.</seg>
<seg id="346">Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to note that the Department of Justice is responsible for overseeing the RCMP. In the case of the WSCC, if they work closely with the Department of Community and Government Services to coordinate the contract, they should be contracted out if the Government of Nunavut has a contract with the WSCC.</seg>
<seg id="347">Hon. Jeannie Iqalukjuaq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (Interpretation ends) The policies or policies that are prepared by the Department of Justice, or any other department, when they are drafting policies, that’s why our department is trying to involve them at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="348">I don’t have that information in front of me, but I will look into it and get back to the member.</seg>
<seg id="349">Question 124 – 1 (5): Status of Site Remediation in Baker Lake (Mikkungwak) </seg>
<seg id="350">Mr. Mikkungwak (interpretation): Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="351">My questions are for the Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="352">I asked these questions to the minister last week in regard to the clean-up of the contaminated site in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="353">In response to one of my questions, the minister indicated that the "final report" would be prepared and submitted to the Qulliq Energy Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="354">Will the minister commit to providing a copy of the report to both the Hamlet Council of Baker Lake and as the MLA for the community?</seg>
<seg id="355">Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation, Minister Iqalukjuaq.</seg>
<seg id="356">Hon. Jeannie Ugyuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (Interpretation ends) Yes, Mr. Mikkungwak, I can commit to doing that.</seg>
<seg id="357">Your first supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="358">I thank the minister for that commitment.</seg>
<seg id="359">One of the things that the minister is saying is that the Qulliq Energy Corporation can work with the Municipality of Baker Lake to clean up that colour. Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to share that information with the Hamlet of Baker Lake. When I get back to the community next week, I will encourage the hamlet staff and the Qulliq Energy Corporation to meet with their counterparts.</seg>
<seg id="360">Mr. Speaker, I don’t think it’s going to be an easy thing to do because the Qulliq Energy Corporation’s storage facility is located in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="361">Can the minister confirm that the Qulliq Energy Corporation has already spent $1.68 million to date on the clean-up?</seg>
<seg id="362">Can the minister clarify how much it would cost to clean up the remaining units?</seg>
<seg id="363">Minister responsible for the Department of Justice, Minister Simailak.</seg>
<seg id="364">Hon. Jeannie Iqalukjuak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (Interpretation ends) The whole clean-up would be about $10 million. The Power Corporation, as I mentioned earlier, has been destroyed since the creation of Nunavut and the federal government is responsible for the clean-up.</seg>
<seg id="365">We are committed to working with the Hamlet of Baker Lake on the clean-up of the current contaminated site.</seg>
<seg id="366">Your final supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="367">In my line of questioning last week, the minister indicated that the federal government or the Government of Nunavut has not finalized the cost estimates yet.</seg>
<seg id="368">Mr. Speaker, I am in support of the Qulliq Energy Corporation’s actions that have been destroyed in the past by the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="369">Will the Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation commit to working with the Minister of Justice to review and clarify potential legal options for this issue?</seg>
<seg id="370">Hon. Jeannie Ehaloak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (Interpretation ends) Yes, as the Minister of Energy and the Department of Justice, we will work together to resolve this issue.</seg>
<seg id="371">Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, Mr. Lightstone.</seg>
<seg id="372">Question 125 – 1 (5): School Leave Policy (Lightning) </seg>
<seg id="373">I would like to direct my question to the Minister responsible for the Public Service Act.</seg>
<seg id="374">In previous years, the government’s most recent annual report on the administration of the Public Service Annual Report indicates that a number of its employees were using the ASIST program.</seg>
<seg id="375">Unfortunately, the 2016-17 annual report did not include any of these items.</seg>
<seg id="376">Can the minister provide the House with that information?</seg>
<seg id="377">Minister of Finance, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="378">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="379">It seems like the annual report is going through that and I’m sure it’s going to be published all year round.</seg>
<seg id="380">I don’t know if it’s going to be there, but I can look into it and see if it’s going to be there.</seg>
<seg id="381">Your first supplementary, Mr. Lightstone.</seg>
<seg id="382">I would just like to ask the minister if he could provide that information to the House as to how many employees took advantage of the FANS program in 2016-17.</seg>
<seg id="383">Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="384">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you. (Interpretation ends) The question has been taken as notice.</seg>
<seg id="385">Member for Pangnirtung, Ms. Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="386">Question 126 – 1 (5): Status of Old Pangnirtung Health Centre (Nakasuk) </seg>
<seg id="387">Mr. Nakashuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="388">My questions today are for the Minister of Community and Government Services.</seg>
<seg id="389">I have asked the minister a number of questions in regard to the Pangnirtung Health Centre. I’m assuming that the old health centre is no longer in use after the new health centre was opened.</seg>
<seg id="390">The old health centre is no longer being used for a long time, but it remains closed.</seg>
<seg id="391">I would like to ask the minister if he is aware of what the plans are for the old health centre.</seg>
<seg id="392">Minister of Community and Government Services, Minister Kusugak.</seg>
<seg id="393">Hon. Lorne Kusugak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="394">I also thank my colleague for asking that question.</seg>
<seg id="395">With respect to the old buildings that are no longer being used by the government, when they are no longer being used by the government, it becomes a question of whether or not other government departments would want to use them.</seg>
<seg id="396">The old health centre that was built in 1975 was built in Pangnirtung and it went through the same process.</seg>
<seg id="397">The Department of Health and Social Services doesn’t want to use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="398">We did consult with various government departments and we did not hear any requests for this program.</seg>
<seg id="399">According to the government’s procedures, we are now making plans on whether the hamlet would like to be taken over by the hamlet. We are currently working on that.</seg>
<seg id="400">If they didn’t want it, then we would have to go back to the non-profit community to see if they would be able to get it.</seg>
<seg id="401">There are a number of avenues that the government can use to dispose of these materials.</seg>
<seg id="402">That’s where we are at right now.</seg>
<seg id="403">Your first supplementary, Ms. Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="404">If I understood the question correctly, the communities have been asked if they would like to take on this responsibility. What is the status of this initiative?</seg>
<seg id="405">Hon. Lorne Kusugak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="406">We have not heard from the government that they want it.</seg>
<seg id="407">We are in the planning stages right now to see if the hamlet would like to get that facility. We are currently working on it and we are planning to see if the hamlet would like to get that facility.</seg>
<seg id="408">That’s where we’re at right now.</seg>
<seg id="409">Your final supplementary, Ms. Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="410">I would also like to thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="411">I don’t know if the hamlet would be interested, but if they can’t proceed from there, what happens when they are no longer going to be using the old government buildings?</seg>
<seg id="412">I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="413">There are more than four barriers that we have to deal with.</seg>
<seg id="414">For example, the old Pangnirtung Health Centre was declined by the Department of Health and Social Services and we asked the other government departments if they wanted it.</seg>
<seg id="415">It was not requested, so we will look into it to see if the hamlet wants it.</seg>
<seg id="416">Those are the types of things that we use when we are going through these types of situations.</seg>
<seg id="417">Member for Aivilik, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="418">Question 127 – 1 (5): Social Services Travel Policy (Netser) </seg>
<seg id="419">Mr. Netser (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="420">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="421">First of all, I would like to say "good afternoon" to them. Since I have been here, I didn’t say "good afternoon" to them. I say "good afternoon" to them.</seg>
<seg id="422">We will be going home very shortly.</seg>
<seg id="423">Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that some of Nunavut’s most vulnerable residents have to travel south to receive medical services, which is very rare and far away from their families.</seg>
<seg id="424">I agree with the member that when a visitor is visited by a relative, it really changes.</seg>
<seg id="425">The Department of Family Services "Travel Policy, which is on the government’s website, came into force on June 31, 2013, and came into force on March 31, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="426">It has come to my attention that the former Minister of Family Services has made a commitment to make changes to the Family Abuse Intervention Act.</seg>
<seg id="427">Can the minister indicate if any changes to the Social Assistance Travel Policy have been made since 2013 and, if not, will it be changed beyond March 31 of this year?</seg>
<seg id="428">Minister of Family Services, Minister Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="429">Hon. Joe Savikataaq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="430">Mr. Speaker, I can’t speak for my predecessor, but what I can say is that this policy will be in place until the end of March 2018, and it will remain until the new policy is changed.</seg>
<seg id="431">I have not heard anything from the Department of Family Services to see if there are any changes to the policy.</seg>
<seg id="432">If there is a need to change it then we can look at it, but we can’t change the request until we have a comprehensive review.</seg>
<seg id="433">If there seems to be a need for changes that seem to be beneficial to the clients and to the government, we can look into it.</seg>
<seg id="434">Your first supplementary, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="435">Mr. Netser (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker and thank you, Minister.</seg>
<seg id="436">The department’s Family Abuse Intervention Act states that an elder who is under the care of the Department of Family Services can be visited by two family members or guardians on an annual basis.</seg>
<seg id="437">Can the minister confirm whether or not this policy has been amended to allow for two visits per year?</seg>
<seg id="438">Two return tickets, two flights at the same time, or one trip twice, or two visits.</seg>
<seg id="439">Just to make it perfectly clear, there are two returning tickets each year for one of the foster parents.</seg>
<seg id="440">Your final supplementary, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="441">Mr. Netser (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Will the minister commit to considering changes to family travel for adults who are in foster care?</seg>
<seg id="442">The policy will expire shortly, but at the end of the day, we will have to review it, but at this time, I cannot commit to it until the review of the whole policy is done.</seg>
<seg id="443">I’m sure there’s going to be a review done in regard to the medical travel that is paid by the Department of Family Services for medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="444">We will have to work with the Department of Health to make sure that the policies are adhered to, but at this time, I can’t commit to something else because the Medical Travel Policy is going to be expiring soon and I’m sure that the contents of the policy will be reviewed very carefully.</seg>
<seg id="445">Member for Netsilik, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="446">Question 128 – 1 (5): Update on Continuing Care Office (Qirngnuq) </seg>
<seg id="447">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="448">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Health.</seg>
<seg id="449">Mr. Speaker, from time to time, a number of my constituents have come to my office to seek assistance for medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="450">As the minister often tells me, and I’m sure he even tabled a phone number this week, that Nunavummiut can call the appeals board if they have any concerns.</seg>
<seg id="451">Mr. Speaker, the language and where you live, it becomes a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="452">My question for the minister: Can the minister tell the House what other steps his department is taking to ensure that the Office of Patient Relations is notified?</seg>
<seg id="453">Minister of Health, Ms. Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="454">Hon. Patterk Angnakak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="455">I understand the concern and we try to encourage people to call the toll-free number so that you can get a response right away.</seg>
<seg id="456">I don’t have that information in front of me right now, but there is a website and there is a fax number.</seg>
<seg id="457">Your first supplementary, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="458">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (Interpretation ends) I don’t know if I responded to your question or not, but I will ask it in detail.</seg>
<seg id="459">Mr. Speaker, the Information and Privacy Commissioner has raised a number of concerns with respect to privacy issues, and I understand that there is a critical need to address the issue of personal information in the event of a criminal offence.</seg>
<seg id="460">The appeals board has a form that outlines complaints or concerns.</seg>
<seg id="461">However, if you don’t have fax machines, you can’t send them out on your own. You don’t have all the computers, you can’t take photographs that are going to be put on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="462">My question for the minister: Can the minister explain to the House why the appeals board should not be faxed?</seg>
<seg id="463">An Hon. Member: Good question.</seg>
<seg id="464">Minister Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="465">That’s a very good question.</seg>
<seg id="466">I think the reason for that is because the fax machines are decreasing in the number of people out there who are moving forward with the technology that we as a government are using more computers than the paperwork.</seg>
<seg id="467">In reading the substantiation sheets, the government has a website that can be viewed at www.nutritions.gov.nu.ca. All the communities have health centres.</seg>
<seg id="468">If you want to send out the application forms by fax, you can send them out. The government liaison officer also has staff in all the communities.</seg>
<seg id="469">In the communities, they can be faxed to the headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="470">If the patient relations office doesn’t have a fax, then I can look into it.</seg>
<seg id="471">Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="472">Question 129 – 1 (5): Income Support Policies (Towtongie) </seg>
<seg id="473">Mr. Towtongie: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="474">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="475">Mr. Speaker, I would like to follow up on some of the questions that were asked by the Member for Kugluktuk in regard to the Income Support Program.</seg>
<seg id="476">The minister indicated that the income support recipients who are on income support will be signing off on a project that they’re looking for. It’s part of the program selection process.</seg>
<seg id="477">Can the minister clarify how the search for a successful candidate would apply to a successful selection process when there is no work to be done?</seg>
<seg id="478">Minister of Family Services, Minister Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="479">With respect to the report on the success of the selection process, it would be up to me if there is no job available, but sometimes they can get a short term job.</seg>
<seg id="480">Perhaps if it was an appropriate time to look for someone to go to another department, if it was the appropriate department, then they would be able to get a job.</seg>
<seg id="481">Your first supplementary, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="482">Income support is a policy of the Government of Nunavut and it’s not a policy.</seg>
<seg id="483">If it was a policy, we would not be able to change it as Members of the Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="484">One of the things that I have seen in the past is that when there is no business in the community, when a young person is in Taloyoak, and they want me to sign off on something that doesn’t have a job on a monthly basis, they’re doing it on a monthly basis, and it’s kind of embarrassing to know how it’s going to work and how it’s going to work, and then the income support recipients themselves are going down on top of the job.</seg>
<seg id="485">Would the minister be able to clearly state what kind of Nunavut-specific policy he would be willing to bring forward to the smaller communities in regard to this issue?</seg>
<seg id="486">At this time, it is just a model that is not geared towards Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="487">This policy applies to all of Nunavut and it applies only to Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="488">This program is only used in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="489">The Income Support Program review was done and the policy was changed.</seg>
<seg id="490">At this time, there are a lot of income support recipients who are eligible for income support and the Child Benefit Supplement was deducted from the income support recipients and the income support recipients were assessed.</seg>
<seg id="491">I would like to thank the minister for signing the contract and I feel for the people of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="492">If they don’t have a job, then they won’t be able to get a job. The benefits have to be selected properly, but we will look into that.</seg>
<seg id="493">Question 130 – 1 (5): Mine Training</seg>
<seg id="494">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="495">I rise today to direct my question to the Minister of Economic Development and Transportation.</seg>
<seg id="496">Mr. Speaker, I firmly believe and believe that when mining companies are trying to create jobs, they are responsible for the environment.</seg>
<seg id="497">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Education. I will be asking questions today in regard to the construction of the residential school programs.</seg>
<seg id="498">Last year, you tabled your 2017-18 main estimates for the Department of Economic Development and Transportation, which included $200,000 in funding for the Nunavut Mine Training Program.</seg>
<seg id="499">I wonder if the minister could give us an idea of how much money was spent up to 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="500">Mr. Speaker, I hope I was understandable.</seg>
<seg id="501">Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Ms. Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="502">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="503">I would also like to thank the member for his question.</seg>
<seg id="504">What I can say about the mine training program is that it doesn’t have all the details as to how it was used.</seg>
<seg id="505">The department is working with the Department of Family Services, Nunavut Arctic College, the federal government, the mining industry, and Inuit organizations to develop a number of programs to prepare Nunavummiut for opportunities in the mining sector. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="506">Your first supplementary, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="507">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="508">I thank the minister for that answer.</seg>
<seg id="509">I’m just wondering if the Department of Finance is going to be increasing their budget or decreasing the budget for the fiscal year 2018-19.</seg>
<seg id="510">Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="511">I can’t respond to that question at this time, but I apologize if I can go back to the member’s question about the $200,000 that he was asking about.</seg>
<seg id="512">For the Kitikmeot Corporation, there was $61,000 that was used for that program and the Qikiqtani Inuit Association for the literacy program for the Baffin region, $60,000, and the Hamlet of Arviat for the Labour Standards Program, $78,000 for heavy equipment operator training.</seg>
<seg id="513">Thank you for clarifying my question.</seg>
<seg id="514">Mr. Speaker, as you will recall, last week, I tabled a copy of the Nunavut Mining Symposium entitled, "The Northern Iron Mines Corporation," which I had the opportunity to table in the House in the House.</seg>
<seg id="515">They will be working near Hall Beach this spring.</seg>
<seg id="516">I wonder if the minister and the Department of Economic Development and Transportation can work with the Northern Air Transport Association, not just with the mining companies but with all the mining companies, to see how they can improve the training opportunities that are available to the residents of my community or to the High Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="517">Mr. Speaker, I believe that Hall Beach is an outpost camp and there is going to be a lot of money to be used for that. However, they are provided by the mining companies.</seg>
<seg id="518">You also stated that you will be supporting the mining sector.</seg>
<seg id="519">What I’m trying to ask, Mr. Speaker, is: Will we be able to deal with the funds that you have identified for the Mary River project?</seg>
<seg id="520">In the Baffin region, they are working on the gold project and also in the Kitikmeot region, they are working on the gold project.</seg>
<seg id="521">Will the minister commit to ensuring that these issues are dealt with properly?</seg>
<seg id="522">As an example, if I was an Inuk who wanted to work at a higher level, how would I be able to get training and how would the Department of Economic Development and Transportation be able to provide assistance?</seg>
<seg id="523">Hon. Elizabeth Sheutiapik (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also thank the member for raising a good question because the Department of Economic Development and Transportation is not responsible for that.</seg>
<seg id="524">The Department of Education also has a Mine Training Division, which is very important to recognize that mining is a mix of different types of projects that are being developed and that we have to take into consideration.</seg>
<seg id="525">There are a number of different departments that are involved. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="526">Oral Questions.</seg>
<seg id="527">Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="528">Question 131 – 1 (5): Support for Hospital Staff (Main) </seg>
<seg id="529">Ms. Main (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="530">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="531">First of all, I would like to state that my question is related to many communities, not just my community.</seg>
<seg id="532">I think it’s across Nunavut that we have nurses and nurses working in the health centres.</seg>
<seg id="533">Mr. Speaker, if we are aware that there is a high workload in the communities, then we have to look at the number of nurses in the communities.</seg>
<seg id="534">Due to the lack of staff, due to the lack of staff, there is a shortage of staff. Due to the lack of staff, there is a shortage of staff and there is a shortage of staff. There is a shortage of staff.</seg>
<seg id="535">It seems obvious that this is causing a lot of hardship to the people of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="536">I hope I was understandable. I’m speaking in Inuktitut, so I hope I understood the question.</seg>
<seg id="537">In English, Mr. Speaker, the number of positions in the department is increasing due to the lack of staff and the number of positions in the department is increasing.</seg>
<seg id="538">My question for the minister: Can the minister tell the House what steps his department is taking to provide additional support to health care workers in communities who are overwhelmed by the workload?</seg>
<seg id="539">Minister of Health, Ms. Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="540">I thank the member for that very important question.</seg>
<seg id="541">The issue of staffing health centres is very important and this is one of the things that we have been working very hard as a department to make sure that we don’t have enough staff at the health centre.</seg>
<seg id="542">I would hope that would be the case, but we do have a shortage of staff.</seg>
<seg id="543">I know that the nurses work tirelessly.</seg>
<seg id="544">Our department tries to fulfill its mandate, which is what they can do.</seg>
<seg id="545">We just did that recently in the communities, when it was tired, we sent another nurse out to support the nurses.</seg>
<seg id="546">Once that information is made available, the nurse is sent out to the nursing station and if there is a lack of employment, then they would be sent out to the nursing station.</seg>
<seg id="547">When a nurse is in a situation where there is a vacation, whether it is a sick nurse or a sick nurse, we look at where we can get an assistant in the community.</seg>
<seg id="548">In terms of the recruitment and retention of nurses, we want to make sure that we don’t decrease the number of nurses that are providing health care in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="549">Your first supplementary, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="550">Ms. Main: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="551">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="552">I think we’re all concerned about the department’s staffing numbers. For example, in my communities, it’s evident that there are still too many vacancies at the health centres.</seg>
<seg id="553">In the article, 70 percent of the positions are vacant, Arviat is 44 percent vacant.</seg>
<seg id="554">I know that it’s a challenge and it’s a very difficult situation to deal with.</seg>
<seg id="555">I would like to ask the minister if he could explain the challenges that his department faces in ensuring that we have adequate staffing at the community health centres, which are always very busy.</seg>
<seg id="556">Minister Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="557">I don’t think we can retain them after 30 months of experience. I don’t know if it’s new or not, but it’s very difficult to be a nurse in the community.</seg>
<seg id="558">I think it’s important that you look at it as well. I know that the department has been working very hard to try and address it.</seg>
<seg id="559">Your final supplementary, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="560">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="561">In other words, Mr. Speaker, we all know that there are problems in the communities. There is always a lot of work to be done and there is always a shortage of health professionals.</seg>
<seg id="562">I would like to get clarification on exactly what is being done to address the problems in the communities. What is being done and what is being done to address the problems in the communities?</seg>
<seg id="563">What steps are being taken to ensure that our nurses and other health care professionals are being supported by the department?</seg>
<seg id="564">Hon. Patterk Angnakak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="565">I just want to be very clear, but I don’t have that level of detail in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="566">For example, if we were to be open for emergencies, we would not be able to make appointments if the workload was too high or if too many nurses were sent out for medical reasons.</seg>
<seg id="567">In our department, as I said earlier, we are trying to fill all of our positions. It’s a challenge because we are competing nationally.</seg>
<seg id="568">That’s what we’re trying to do. I know that they work with people from the north, not too long from the north, such as the north of Manitoba.</seg>
<seg id="569">I know that the Department of Health and Social Services is well aware of what our nurses are using.</seg>
<seg id="570">It’s not an easy thing to do, but it’s something that we have to continue to work on. If you have any ideas, please let me know.</seg>
<seg id="571">Question 132 – 1 (5): Insurance Policy for Government Facilities (Hickes) </seg>
<seg id="572">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="573">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="574">As we are all aware, Mr. Speaker, every community in Nunavut has a wide range of infrastructure, such as air terminal buildings, health centres, schools, and offices.</seg>
<seg id="575">My question to the minister is: In terms of the contingency plan, is that a contingency fund, or is it a one-time thing, or is it done on a case-by-case basis on a case-by-case basis?</seg>
<seg id="576">Minister of Finance, Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="577">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (Interpretation ends) Our insurance coverage is broken down by type of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="578">Each of our infrastructure has different policies and some of them don’t even have a policy. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="579">I recently saw in the media that in some of our communities, there was another school that was burned down.</seg>
<seg id="580">There is a lack of insurance and the Department of Finance is trying to rectify the problem with the infrastructure to provide adequate insurance. We also learned that the cost of our own facility in Arctic Bay is $10 million.</seg>
<seg id="581">What kind of impact will it have on the Workers "Safety and Compensation Commission if there is another fire at the school? (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="582">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (Interpretation ends) Today, the insurance premiums have increased from $10 million to $20 million for schools that have experienced fires.</seg>
<seg id="583">We continue to encourage the Department of Education and all of us in this House to continue to push for the high cost of living in Nunavut. It is unfortunate that we are trying to burn it.</seg>
<seg id="584">I think one of the things that we need to try and do is to show that we can continue to do our job and we’re doing a better job of showing that we need to make sure that our own costs are increasing and that we have our own insurance coverage. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="585">Yes, I understand that, but I’m scared of the fact that there was a community insurance program that was half of the total cost of the project.</seg>
<seg id="586">That was my question.</seg>
<seg id="587">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (Interpretation ends) I would hope that we would continue to have insurance coverage.</seg>
<seg id="588">The new $20 million is for school fire damage.</seg>
<seg id="589">Schools and other buildings require $1 million to pay for their own costs.</seg>
<seg id="590">There are different things.</seg>
<seg id="591">I can’t say how many schools would have to be burnt down, but they are no longer insured.</seg>
<seg id="592">I hope that we don’t have a fire in our government and I appreciate the fact that all Members of the Legislative Assembly have to keep pushing for this because this is a school for our children and the public....</seg>
<seg id="593">It’s not just for the schools, it’s for the health centres, it’s very important that we provide the services that we provide.</seg>
<seg id="594">Any damage that is caused is a challenge to our clients and I would like to continue to push for these facilities.</seg>
<seg id="595">So, Mr. Speaker, that is a reminder.</seg>
<seg id="596">This is a public housing unit for all students and the public, including schools, health centres, and garages. It’s a public facility. It’s a public facility.</seg>
<seg id="597">I applaud the minister for tabling this document in the Legislative Assembly. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="598">Question 133 – 5 (1): Expansion of Training Opportunities in Baker Lake (Mikkungwak) </seg>
<seg id="599">I would like to direct my question to the Minister responsible for Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="600">Mr. Speaker, as I noted in my Member’s Statement, the fifth Legislative Assembly of Nunavut has the opportunity to bring the new territory to a brighter future.</seg>
<seg id="601">My question for the minister: Can the minister tell the House if he is willing to reopen the idea of establishing a university in your community in partnership with the private sector and others?</seg>
<seg id="602">Minister responsible for Nunavut Arctic College, Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="603">I thank the member from Baker Lake for that question.</seg>
<seg id="604">Mr. Speaker, Nunavut Arctic College has developed an advertisement for various universities outside of Nunavut to see how we can work together.</seg>
<seg id="605">We have heard from various organizations, such as Agnico-Eagle, that they would like to establish a university for Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="606">We would like to see this proceed, but to date, we have been trying to come up with an agreement with any outside of Nunavut to work with Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="607">I find it very interesting that we have to provide funding for the expansion of our education programs from the Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit Division to the Piqqusilirivvik Cultural School, such as the Piqqusilirivvik Cultural School, which is a diploma program that is offered by the university.</seg>
<seg id="608">I feel that Baker Lake would be a very good location for expansion.</seg>
<seg id="609">Can the minister clarify whether or not he and his officials have had discussions with the Board of Governors of Nunavut Arctic College to look at opportunities for post-secondary education in Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="610">Minister Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="611">Nunavut Arctic College would like to see more opportunities for Nunavummiut to pursue post-secondary education in their communities. We have been noticing that there is an online learning opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="612">With respect to the member’s question about the Piqqusilirivvik Cultural School, we are looking at how we can expand the programs that are available in that facility.</seg>
<seg id="613">Yes, they will be part of the Arctic College Board of Governors, along with my staff at Nunavut Arctic College, the president, and the vice-president. They will be preparing to move this forward.</seg>
<seg id="614">Your final supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="615">Mr. Mikkungwak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (Interpretation ends) I recognize that the previous government accepted the recommendation that Nunavut Arctic College should not be tabled at that time.</seg>
<seg id="616">Will the minister commit to getting back to the House on this issue and report back to the House on the status of this issue?</seg>
<seg id="617">Minister Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="618">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thank Mr. Mikkungwak for the question.</seg>
<seg id="619">The option of building a university in Nunavut is a multi-faceted idea for the public.</seg>
<seg id="620">Agnico-Eagle has been able to come up with $5 million to build a new university in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="621">I think there are ongoing discussions.</seg>
<seg id="622">At this time, in the next four years, I don’t know if we want to go through this process, but once the feasibility study is done, it will be part of the feasibility study.</seg>
<seg id="623">Members, please note that the time for question period has expired.</seg>
<seg id="624">Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="625">Motion 015 – 1 (5): Extension of Question Period (Main) </seg>
<seg id="626">Mr. Mike (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (Interpretation ends) In accordance with Rule 39 (7), I move, seconded by the Hon. Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, that question period be extended. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="627">The motion is in order. To the principle of the bill.</seg>
<seg id="628">All those in favour of the motion, raise your hand.</seg>
<seg id="629">Opposed.</seg>
<seg id="630">As such, the time allotted for oral questions has increased from 30 minutes to 30 minutes from now.</seg>
<seg id="631">Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="632">Question 134 – 5 (1): Grants and Contributions (Main) </seg>
<seg id="633">Mr. Main (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="634">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Environment.</seg>
<seg id="635">I rise today to talk about the Department of Environment’s Harvester Support Program, which I would like to ask about today, and I would like to find out what kind of assistance they provide to our hunters.</seg>
<seg id="636">Looking at our government’s main estimates for 2017-18, there are three main estimates.</seg>
<seg id="637">Let me say it in English. (Interpretation ends) There are three grants and contributions that the Department of Environment administers for disaster compensation, wildlife damage compensation, and fur harvesting programs.</seg>
<seg id="638">The department has been allocated $150,000 for this fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="639">Mr. Speaker, I would first like to ask the minister: Can the minister describe how the Department of Environment evaluates the effectiveness and effectiveness of its programs and services?</seg>
<seg id="640">Minister responsible for the Department of Environment, Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="641">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="642">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member for asking that question. I know that they have been bidding three times a year and they have just recently competed for the first time since March of this year. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="643">Your first supplementary, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="644">I thank the minister for his comments on the sealing issue.</seg>
<seg id="645">Mr. Speaker, the information that has been provided to the Legislative Assembly over the years is something that I really wanted to see and I think it’s something that the hunters and trappers have to see.</seg>
<seg id="646">In 2011, the Department of Environment announced that the Fur Pricing Program would cost approximately $800,000.</seg>
<seg id="647">In 2012, it was $1.1 million and in 2013, it was $1.04 million.</seg>
<seg id="648">Mr. Speaker, can the minister provide me with an update on the status of the sealskin program in this current fiscal year? I would like to hear the latest information from the minister on whether or not this year’s sealskin program is still a good source of revenue.</seg>
<seg id="649">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (Interpretation ends) I have a copy of what you read.</seg>
<seg id="650">I can’t tell you where they are at right now because I don’t have the current tenders in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="651">I can tell you that after the Aqsarniit Middle East trade show, the sales of sealskins have increased and I’m sure that will be the case, but at that time, we will be able to find out when the auctions for sealskins are going to be held. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="652">Your final supplementary, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="653">I thank the minister for that answer.</seg>
<seg id="654">This will be my last question, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="655">I wonder if the Department of Environment would consider providing more funding to the hunters and trappers organizations so that they can provide more assistance.</seg>
<seg id="656">With respect to fox pelts, we are quite familiar with them as Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="657">I believe that the funding that is used is insufficient for one year, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="658">I think it’s too small.</seg>
<seg id="659">I would like to ask the minister if he agrees with me and if he can look into this matter in the coming months.</seg>
<seg id="660">I agree with you, and I look forward to tabling the supplementary appropriation in the House if you are going to be supporting it.</seg>
<seg id="661">Question 135 – 1 (1): Compensation for Damage to Hunters and Trappers (Keyootak) </seg>
<seg id="662">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Environment.</seg>
<seg id="663">Mr. Speaker, as we all know, in Nunavut, hunters are destroyed by polar bears and their cabins are destroyed and their equipment is destroyed by snowmobiles.</seg>
<seg id="664">Mr. Speaker, the issue of compensation for damages is a very difficult issue to deal with and it is very difficult to compensate for the damage that is caused by the damage.</seg>
<seg id="665">I wonder if the funding for damaged equipment has been used for this fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="666">Minister of Environment, Ms. Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="667">I’m sorry I didn’t hear everything.</seg>
<seg id="668">Can he repeat his question, please?</seg>
<seg id="669">Speaker (interpretation): Please repeat your first question, Mr. Keyootak.</seg>
<seg id="670">Our equipment, our snowmobiles, and our cabins are destroyed by polar bears, especially when we leave them behind.</seg>
<seg id="671">As we all know, there are compensation programs for damages that have been caused by the abandonment of the equipment.</seg>
<seg id="672">My question was: Have these funds for this fiscal year been used for the damage that has been done already?</seg>
<seg id="673">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you for the clarification.</seg>
<seg id="674">Minister of Environment, Ms. Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="675">Your first supplementary, Mr. Keyootak.</seg>
<seg id="676">The minister stated that he would provide a response once he has that information.</seg>
<seg id="677">Can the minister give us an indication of how much has been spent in the Baffin, the Kivalliq, and the Kitikmeot regions?</seg>
<seg id="678">Yes, I will give it to the regions.</seg>
<seg id="679">Question 136 – 1 (5): Early Childhood and Early Childhood Services (Hickes) </seg>
<seg id="680">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Education.</seg>
<seg id="681">This afternoon, the Minister of Education stated that all licensed daycares will be able to receive more licensed daycare spaces depending on the location of the facility.</seg>
<seg id="682">How much is being considered to be provided to licensed daycares?</seg>
<seg id="683">Minister responsible for the Nunavut Housing Corporation, Minister Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="684">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="685">I thank Mr. Hickes for the question.</seg>
<seg id="686">Mr. Speaker, the Department of Education’s Executive Committee approved a multiplex agreement for a three-year term. Over the next three years, it has been divided into four categories.</seg>
<seg id="687">I would like you to clarify the amount, the operations and maintenance total of $1.1 million per year, it is broken down that way by year.</seg>
<seg id="688">Those are the numbers that I have.</seg>
<seg id="689">I thank the minister for that explanation.</seg>
<seg id="690">Mr. Speaker, when I look at the Child Day Care Act in Nunavut, section 17 of the Early Childhood Education Act, it states that "all staff who deal with day-to-day issues need to be properly trained. This is one of the things that I expect to see."</seg>
<seg id="691">Mr. Speaker, I am aware that the Early Childhood Education Division is responsible for the delivery of early childhood education programs at Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="692">I’m just wondering: How well are they doing? Are they evaluated to make sure that they’re getting the training that they need to be trained to do that?</seg>
<seg id="693">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thank Mr. Hickes for the question.</seg>
<seg id="694">Training is part of the collective agreement for a three-year term.</seg>
<seg id="695">The $1.1 million is outside of the operations and maintenance budget.</seg>
<seg id="696">We want to get more certified teachers who can teach early childhood education.</seg>
<seg id="697">So that’s one of the things that we’re trying to do to increase the number of apprenticeship positions that we’re looking at in the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="698">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thank the minister for that answer.</seg>
<seg id="699">I look forward to getting that information in the House as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="700">When I look at the daycare staff and the training programs that are offered, I keep hearing that when the staff are trained, they seem to be more beneficial to the daycares.</seg>
<seg id="701">One of the concerns that I have heard is that there is a lack of income for the daycares, Mr. Speaker, there is a high turnover in the daycares.</seg>
<seg id="702">It’s very important that we have the same level of education for our children in the early childhood education system. It’s very important that we do not break down the workforce.</seg>
<seg id="703">Is this funding to help daycares to make sure that they have a better salary so that they will be able to work in that facility and not have to work there on a casual basis?</seg>
<seg id="704">Yes, I agree with Mr. Hickes. I fully understand and agree with him that we want to make sure that the children are well prepared for their education and that they are going to be successful in life before they enter the school system.</seg>
<seg id="705">So that’s one of the things that we’re trying to do and we’re trying to provide support to the daycares.</seg>
<seg id="706">One of the agreements that we have in place with the parents is that as long as they don’t increase the daycare rates, I think we can do what we can to make sure that the staff at the daycares are getting the best value for the money that they need.</seg>
<seg id="707">At this time, we are still working on it and we are working on it with the daycare staff across the territory.</seg>
<seg id="708">Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="709">Question 137 – 1 (5): Inuit Employment Requirements for Government Contracts (Main) </seg>
<seg id="710">On Friday, March 16, I asked the Minister of Community and Government Services a question to the Minister of Community and Government Services.</seg>
<seg id="711">There are a lot of people working within the government that are going to be working on the Inuit labour content and the number of Inuit who will be working in the workforce is not the number of people who will be working in the workforce.</seg>
<seg id="712">In regard to this issue, Mr. Speaker, the minister and I seem to agree that he is in support of increasing the number of Inuit employed.</seg>
<seg id="713">The 20 percent is connected to the construction of the Baffin Correctional Centre and the breakwaters in Iqaluit and Pond Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="714">If I understood the question correctly, Mr. Speaker, the numbers are 20 percent and 15 percent.</seg>
<seg id="715">I’m just wondering if the minister could give us an indication as to how we’re going to change the tendering process to increase the number of tenders that have been put in place and if the department has the authority to do that.</seg>
<seg id="716">Minister responsible for Community and Government Services, Minister Kusugak.</seg>
<seg id="717">I’m sure that the Department of Community and Government Services understands that when they do the work, the Department of Community and Government Services provides assistance to the departments that are going to be responsible for the construction of these facilities.</seg>
<seg id="718">If it’s going to be a docking facility, the Department of Economic Development and Transportation, if we’re talking about a correctional facility, the Department of Justice is responsible for that.</seg>
<seg id="719">Those are the types of things that we do work with the contractors to make sure that the contracts are being adhered to. We provide assistance to them because we don’t operate them.</seg>
<seg id="720">We work with the client departments to find out how many Inuit will be able to work in the communities.</seg>
<seg id="721">We’re trying to make sure that we don’t go over budget and we’re not going to go over budget because we’re trying to get the materials that are coming in and we’re working with the departments.</seg>
<seg id="722">I can’t say at this time that after the tendering process has been completed and the tenders have been tendered out, I don’t think it’s possible to change it at this time, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="723">I would like to ask a question in regard to this issue.</seg>
<seg id="724">If there are no changes to the tendering process, if it’s impossible to do so, then we would be looking at other ways to provide more Inuit employment opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="725">Would the Department of Community and Government Services be willing to work with the Department of Community and Government Services?</seg>
<seg id="726">I hope I was understandable, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="727">Can the minister tell me, maybe tell the House, what happens when employees from other communities want to work in the construction industry, can the employees from Nunavut receive a copy of the benefits that they receive from the employees, from outside of Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="728">Hon. Lorne Kusugak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="729">I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="730">Mr. Speaker, the Nunavummi Nangminiqaqtunik Ikajuuti Policy provides that contractors evaluate the issues and Inuit employment requirements of the Government of Nunavut:</seg>
<seg id="731">What is going to be done;</seg>
<seg id="732">Inuit who are available to work in the workforce based on their academic qualifications;</seg>
<seg id="733">There are other community-based programs that can affect Inuit employment opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="734">Mr. Speaker, we encourage contractors in the communities to hire local people from the regions before they are recruited from outside of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="735">We do encourage people coming to Nunavut to apply for jobs.</seg>
<seg id="736">We encourage them to do that.</seg>
<seg id="737">We work very closely with the client departments to make sure that they are meeting those objectives.</seg>
<seg id="738">Your first supplementary, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="739">Mr. Mike (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (Interpretation ends) I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="740">This will be my last question. I would like to ask the minister if he could commit to working with his department to make sure that the larger projects are done.</seg>
<seg id="741">Will the minister commit to working with the service providers to ensure that jobs are created and that Inuit are able to apply for jobs in the construction of housing units in communities outside of the territory?</seg>
<seg id="742">Will the minister commit to ensuring that this option is taken into consideration to ensure that all Nunavut contractors are included in the contract?</seg>
<seg id="743">I believe that the Government of Nunavut as a whole encourages the public to find employment for Nunavummiut first and foremost.</seg>
<seg id="744">That is the way it is set up and we will continue to do that.</seg>

<seg id="792">Sergeant-at-arms, please escort the witnesses in.</seg>
<seg id="793">Mr. Akeeagok, for the record, please introduce your witnesses and proceed with your opening comments.</seg>
<seg id="794">To my left is my Assistant Deputy Minister, Dan Carlson.</seg>
<seg id="795">Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to appear before the Committee of the Whole on the occasion of its consideration of Bill 2, Interim Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, 2018-19.</seg>
<seg id="796">This bill makes supplementary appropriations for the Government of Nunavut to defray the operations and maintenance expenses of $491,804,000 for the period April 1, 2018 and June 30, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="797">Mr. Chairman, over the past year, the Minister of Finance has been here for the entire fiscal year, but we are the fifth member of the Legislative Assembly that has just sat down and we are preparing for what we are going to be doing.</seg>
<seg id="798">With that being the case, the 2018-19 budget is for the planning and design phase for the fiscal year 2018-19. We will be able to bring it to the community of Pond Inlet in the spring session in May and June.</seg>
<seg id="799">To this end, Mr. Chairman, we are proposing a temporary budget to allow the department to fulfill its mandate to provide services to Nunavummiut in the coming months.</seg>
<seg id="800">This is an area where we have to go and set aside some money for this year after the election.</seg>
<seg id="801">Mr. Chairman, all of our territorial corporations have had an opportunity to review these interim appropriations. Our calculations are based on departmental expenditures and expenditures over the past four years.</seg>
<seg id="802">We are satisfied that this amount will be sufficient to operate as a result of the Legislative Assembly’s review of the bill and that it will be passed for the entire fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="803">These are the contents of the bill, two of which we will be requesting:</seg>
<seg id="804">$8.62 million for the Office of the Legislative Assembly;</seg>
<seg id="805">$11.66 million to the Department of Community and Government Services;</seg>
<seg id="806">$29.08 million to the Department of Finance;</seg>
<seg id="807">$49.1 million for the Department of Family Services;</seg>
<seg id="808">$32.44 million for the Department of Justice;</seg>
<seg id="809">$10.77 million for the Department of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth;</seg>
<seg id="810">$64.1 million for the Department of Education;</seg>
<seg id="811">$85.77 million for the Department of Health’s Old Office;</seg>
<seg id="812">$8.32 million for the Department of Environment’s office;</seg>
<seg id="813">$82.73 million to the Department of Community and Government Services for the Old Office Building;</seg>
<seg id="814">$23.29 million to the Department of Economic Development and Transportation for the Directorate;</seg>
<seg id="815">$73.39 million for the Nunavut Housing Corporation; and</seg>
<seg id="816">$12.54 million, Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="817">Mr. Chairman, that concludes my opening comments.</seg>
<seg id="818">At this time, I would be pleased to answer any questions or comments that members may have.</seg>
<seg id="819">Do members have any general comments?</seg>
<seg id="820">Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="821">Mr. Towtongie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="822">I was reading the Inuktitut version. $32.44 million for the Department of Justice for the Inuktitut language, $32.44 million for the Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="823">There is a difference in the Inuktitut version of the $8.62 million in Inuktitut, which is $8.62 million for the Office of the Legislative Assembly or the Department of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="824">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Just for clarification, the Office of the Legislative Assembly is requesting $8.62 million and the Department of Justice is seeking $32.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="825">I apologize if it wasn’t translated properly. (Interpretation ends) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="826">In the English version, it’s correct.</seg>
<seg id="827">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="828">I just have a question in regard to the interim appropriations, I think it’s just about a percentage of the budget that has been expended in the past, and that’s the amount of money that has been allocated for election purposes.</seg>
<seg id="829">I know that there has been a lot of debate on financial management, but the minister has indicated that there is a need to make real changes in order to ensure that the departments are able to provide the services that they need to provide to the people of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="830">It’s not going to have an impact on the bill, Mr. Chairman, because it has had an impact on the bill.</seg>
<seg id="831">I’m just wondering if there have been any changes to the way the funding is allocated to the next fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="832">Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="833">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (Interpretation ends) Thank you for the question.</seg>
<seg id="834">To date, there have been no significant changes to the operations and maintenance budget, but we will probably see the capital budget in the fall. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="835">Are there any more general comments?</seg>
<seg id="836">I suggest to members that wherever possible you ask your detailed questions during the page-by-page review of the departmental estimates.</seg>
<seg id="837">If not, we will proceed to the clause-by-clause review of the bill.</seg>
<seg id="838">Go to Bill 2 in your white legislation binder.</seg>
<seg id="839">Bill 2, Interim Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="840">Chairman (interpretation): Clause 2. Do you agree?</seg>
<seg id="841">Chairman (interpretation): Go to the Schedule on page 2. Page 3 in Inuktitut Schedule, Interim Appropriation, April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="842">Vote 1: Operations and Maintenance. Interim Appropriation. Total Operations and Maintenance, to be Voted. $491,804,000.</seg>
<seg id="843">Thank you, Mr. Main. Do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="844">Ms. Main: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="845">I guess I should have brought this up earlier, but I have a question in regard to the department’s grants and contributions.</seg>
<seg id="846">It is my understanding that the numbers are based on a percentage of the annual amount, but some of the grants and contributions have already been used for the whole year, so they will be depleted as soon as April 1.</seg>
<seg id="847">I just want to get a little bit more clarification on the grants and contributions, whether it’s Economic Development and Transportation or the Nunavut Housing Corporation. How is that handled when the funding is not for a whole year, but some of the programs are administered annually?</seg>
<seg id="848">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="849">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (Interpretation ends) That’s a good question.</seg>
<seg id="850">In the budget address, in your opening comments, you had indicated that in the last four years, you had mentioned some of the first three months of the Grants and Contributions program.</seg>
<seg id="851">What I can say is that the Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation are one of the largest departments in Nunavut. As you can see, the grants and contributions are for operations and maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="852">If they have to go through a request for proposals, then the departments have different processes, but in the last four years, all the departments "spending on quarterly payments are reviewed by the Department of Finance and the departments have an agreement on how their grants and contributions are operated.</seg>
<seg id="853">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="854">My question for the minister: Can the minister tell the House if there have been any projects that have been suspended or are they just going to be in the process of being put on hold?</seg>
<seg id="855">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="856">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (Interpretation ends) We are doing the same thing as the other departments.</seg>
<seg id="857">Hopefully by tomorrow, we will be able to look at our future budgets. We have been able to set up the Fifth Legislative Assembly with direction from the departments. We will be doing the same thing for the next three months. We will be looking at the next few months.</seg>
<seg id="858">Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="859">I’m sorry, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="860">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank the minister and his officials.</seg>
<seg id="861">In the main estimates, there is $491,804,000 above that.</seg>
<seg id="862">First of all, I would like to clarify that in the bill, there is $8,623,000. In your opening comments, the minister stated that $8.26 million will be used.</seg>
<seg id="863">The amount of $3,000 is not the same, but the total amount is $54,000.</seg>
<seg id="864">Why is that the case?</seg>
<seg id="865">I would like to get clarification on that.</seg>
<seg id="866">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="867">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="868">The bill is on page 3 of the Inuktitut version, so we’re trying to get the numbers approved.</seg>
<seg id="869">Those are the numbers that we are looking at.</seg>
<seg id="870">As I stated in my Member’s Statement, I have only reduced the numbers in English to the main estimates. That’s what I have stated. I don’t want to say all the numbers, but we have reduced them by numbers.</seg>
<seg id="871">The numbers that we’re looking at in the bill are accurate and they don’t just say it all right.</seg>
<seg id="872">Total Centrally Administered Funds. $491,804,000. Do you agree?</seg>
<seg id="873">Clause 5. Do you agree?</seg>
<seg id="874">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you. (Interpretation ends) Do you agree to Bill 2 as a whole?</seg>
<seg id="875">Do members agree, pursuant to Rule 62 (2), that Bill 2 can immediately be placed on the orders of the day for third reading?</seg>
<seg id="876">Minister Akeeagok, do you have closing remarks?</seg>
<seg id="877">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would just like to thank my staff for preparing this government to be able to operate by June of this year.</seg>
<seg id="878">I would like to thank all of you for your support in approving this budget, and I look forward to sitting here in the House when we deal with the budget in May and June.</seg>
<seg id="879">I thank each and every one of you.</seg>
<seg id="880">Bill 2 is concluded.</seg>
<seg id="881">I would now like to ask the minister if he can proceed with his opening comments on Bill 3.</seg>
<seg id="882">Bill 03 – Supplementary Appropriation (Operations &amp; Maintenance) Act, No. 3, 2017-2018 – Consideration in Committee</seg>
<seg id="883">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="884">I will keep my officials here, and I would like you to know that as soon as we get into other positions, I will be able to invite my officials to come to the witness table, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="885">Mr. Chairman, I can now begin with my opening comments.</seg>
<seg id="886">I am pleased to present Bill 3, Supplementary Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, No. 3, 2017-2018. Under this bill, the government is proposing to increase its budget by $56,602,000 for the following items:</seg>
<seg id="887">$49 million to the Department of Health to address the over-expenditure of medical travel, mental health, rehabilitation, elders "long-term care, hospital physician services, and tuberculosis diagnosis;</seg>
<seg id="888">$6.2 million to the Department of Justice to address the over-expenditure of the RCMP, Corrections and Justice; and</seg>
<seg id="889">There is $1,402,000 in over-expenditure for the Children, Family Services, and Banking Services.</seg>
<seg id="890">Mr. Chairman, that concludes my opening comments. I would be pleased to answer any questions or comments that members may have.</seg>
<seg id="891">Are there any general comments?</seg>
<seg id="892">Supplementary Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) 2017-18, No. 3, Family Services. Not Previously Authorized.</seg>
<seg id="893">Total Children and Family Services. $1,402,000.</seg>
<seg id="894">Yes, I just saw the numbers and I still don’t have the information in front of me, but I don’t know where the focus is.</seg>
<seg id="895">Mr. Savikataaq, can you respond to that question? (Interpretation ends) Hon. Joe Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="896">Hon. David Savikataaq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="897">I don’t have the breakdown in front of me, but there are two of them, but we do send more foster children out of the territory and we have increased the number of visits to out-of-territory hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="898">For example, there is an elder in Igloolik, I don’t know which community it is in, so that the person in Ottawa who is on the ticket will be able to visit them, so that they can be visited.</seg>
<seg id="899">There are some people who don’t get any assistance from the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="900">The majority of people who are sent out of the territory are elders who can’t be assisted in Nunavut. As I stated earlier, there are more people visiting the communities.</seg>
<seg id="901">I’m just wondering: In terms of the integration of elders "programs and services that the Department of Family Services is responsible for, I’m just wondering if the Department of Health and Social Services has repatriated the elders" facilities back to the Department of Health and Social Services, are you still working on that?</seg>
<seg id="902">Some of the things that the minister mentioned are not directly related to social services.</seg>
<seg id="903">Some of them are in the care of the Department of Health and Social Services and some of them, if they want to visit, there is funding available through the Department of Health and Social Services for travel.</seg>
<seg id="904">That’s one of the examples that I used. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="905">I understand that there is a requirement to visit some of the children that are in foster care down there because the funding is provided by the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="906">My question is: Are there still elders who are receiving social assistance that have not been transferred to the Department of Health and Social Services?</seg>
<seg id="907">Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="908">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (Interpretation ends) From what I have, the information that I have in front of me, the transfers to the Department of Health have been transferred to the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="909">The outstanding functions of the Department of Health and Social Services are still administered by the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="910">I’m just wondering if there are any other programs that have not been transferred to Family Services. Looking at the information that we have and looking at our plans, I think all of them have been transferred. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="911">Maybe I’m a little confused, but if the Minister of Family Services can elaborate on that, I would appreciate it.</seg>
<seg id="912">It’s up to Minister Akeeagok to respond to another question.</seg>
<seg id="913">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="914">I thought the question was: Are there any other positions in the Department of Health and Social Services that are still in the Department of Health and Social Services?</seg>
<seg id="915">My response was that the Department of Health and Social Services is here right now, the elders "programs are in there.</seg>
<seg id="916">We still have social workers in the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="917">The supplementary appropriation is for the Department of Family Services to determine what the deficit was. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="918">I thank the minister for clarifying that.</seg>
<seg id="919">I understand a little bit better now.</seg>
<seg id="920">Maybe I should ask another question in a more understandable way.</seg>
<seg id="921">Does the Department of Family Services still deal with elders? Do they still have a responsibility for the Department of Family Services?</seg>
<seg id="922">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (Interpretation ends) Yes, there are still resources available for seniors and I would like the Minister of Family Services to clarify that.</seg>
<seg id="923">I am aware that the government’s programs for seniors "fuel subsidy, the Senior Fuel Subsidy Program, the Senior Fuel Subsidy Program, and the Department of Family Services, I’m sure, have more than 60 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="924">If I missed it, Minister Savikataaq, if you can assist me in responding to the question. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="925">Thank you to both ministers for clarifying that.</seg>
<seg id="926">This will be my last question.</seg>
<seg id="927">When people are sent outside of Nunavut, are they still eligible for income support under the Income Support Program?</seg>
<seg id="928">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Through you, Mr. Chairman, I would like Minister Savikataaq to respond to that question. (Interpretation ends) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="929">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="930">It varies depending on the situation.</seg>
<seg id="931">In some cases, they are eligible for income support, but I can’t say for all of them that they are the same.</seg>
<seg id="932">I would like to ask a detailed question within the department.</seg>
<seg id="933">They have indicated that they will be allocating some of the funding for the shortfalls from other departments.</seg>
<seg id="934">As it stands now, are the other departments that are here in Nunavut supporting the whole of Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="935">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="936">In addition to the Department of Family Services, almost all of these positions were transferred over to the Department of Health and Social Services to the Income Support Program.</seg>
<seg id="937">So it’s not very much of a subsidy. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="938">I thank the minister for that answer.</seg>
<seg id="939">I’m just wondering: In terms of allocating funds to other departments, when do you determine that they are going to be in a deficit situation and how do you deal with the deficit situation?</seg>
<seg id="940">I don’t know if that has an impact on our meeting, Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="941">The department reports on a monthly basis and at the end of the fiscal year, there is a little bit of a over-expenditure for the department to be able to rectify some of the over-expenditure that is not possible. We have to go through a supplementary appropriation process.</seg>
<seg id="942">We’re on page 4.</seg>
<seg id="943">Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="944">The document in front of us indicates that the number of people in residential care is increasing based on the number of people who require care. There were 189 individuals who were in residential care. There were 243.</seg>
<seg id="945">Do you foresee an increase in this area?</seg>
<seg id="946">What is the reason for the increase in the number of individuals requiring care?</seg>
<seg id="947">Do you know what the reason is for the increase in the number of people requiring care?</seg>
<seg id="948">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (Interpretation ends) This is an increase in the number of clients in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="949">I’m just wondering if that’s something that has been changing over the last number of years, if that’s something that’s going to be included in the main estimates from now on. I don’t want to be approving supplementary appropriations because you’re going to have to have accurate numbers in the main estimates.</seg>
<seg id="950">Are they going to be included in that increase?</seg>
<seg id="951">I’m just wondering if there are any changes that are occurring in terms of the numbers that are going up in each of the pages. It’s going to be noticeable when we talk about the changes that are occurring when we don’t keep up with the budget that we have in the budget.</seg>
<seg id="952">We will be asking questions when we get to the main estimates. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="953">In the substantiation sheet that was provided by the department, it states that there is a surplus.</seg>
<seg id="954">One of the things that the department recently announced was the restructuring of the Income Support Program.</seg>
<seg id="955">I’m just wondering if the minister could indicate where the surplus was spent from the Department of Finance. Was the income support worker in the Department of Finance depleted or is there going to be more money allocated to the income support workers?</seg>
<seg id="956">I’m just wondering if you can tell us what the increase is for.</seg>
<seg id="957">What I’m trying to get at is where did the surplus go, where did it go?</seg>
<seg id="958">I’m just wondering: In terms of the Income Support Case Management System, is there an increase in the paperwork or is there an increase in the income support amount? Where did that money go?</seg>
<seg id="959">Chairman: Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="960">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (Interpretation ends) There are a number of issues with the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="961">One of the things that we have done in the past is we have hired a person to coordinate the transfer of positions from another department, and some of these individuals were hired to work on the job descriptions and the job descriptions, and so on, and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="962">With the restructuring of the Income Support Program, there was also some funding for that, but the government’s response was that they send people out to residential care and they would be able to provide a variety of services.</seg>
<seg id="963">There are a number of factors in how the Department of Family Services has reached its budget shortfall for the current fiscal year. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="964">I’ll leave it at that.</seg>
<seg id="965">The news release indicates that the department is spending more money on income support than it currently has in the budget, which is listed as an increase in the amount of money that is being spent on income support.</seg>
<seg id="966">Is the money that is being proposed for the staff or is it going to be used for the income support office?</seg>
<seg id="967">I would like my colleague, Mr. Savikataaq, to respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="968">Mr. Savikataaq, go ahead.</seg>
<seg id="969">The Income Support Program, as amended, has a significant impact on the amount of money that was spent on income support. I can use this example.</seg>
<seg id="970">The Child Benefit Supplement, the Child Benefit Supplement, the Income Support Program, the Child Benefit Supplement, the Income Support Program, the Income Support Program, and the Child Benefit Supplement, were deducted.</seg>
<seg id="971">The child benefits that were deducted from the Income Support Program are no longer going to be the case now. The income support recipients will be receiving more money than the income support recipients and the families who are on income support will no longer be deducted from their income support.</seg>
<seg id="972">We’re on Total Children and Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="973">Not Previously Authorized. $1,402,000.</seg>
<seg id="974">Justice. Operations and Maintenance. Not Previously Authorized.</seg>
<seg id="975">Total Department of Justice. $2,600,000.</seg>
<seg id="976">Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="977">Mr. Netser (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="978">I would like to welcome the minister and his officials.</seg>
<seg id="979">It states here that the purchase of new drugs is going to be done by the federal government this summer. Is there any plans to replace the marijuana legislation with the federal government?</seg>
<seg id="980">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (Interpretation ends) Yes, Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask the Deputy Minister of Justice to go to the witness table and remove my deputy minister. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (Interpretation ends) I will take that as notice and respond to the member’s question.</seg>
<seg id="981">Does the committee agree to bring in the witnesses?</seg>
<seg id="982">Sergeant-at-arms, please escort the witnesses out.</seg>
<seg id="983">For the record, Mr. Akeeagok, please introduce your witness.</seg>
<seg id="984">To my left is the Deputy Minister of the Department of Justice, Bill MacKay.</seg>
<seg id="985">If it’s okay with you, I would like to respond to the question that was posed.</seg>
<seg id="986">Mr. Chairman, that’s a very good question from the Minister of Justice in regard to the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="987">This is not geared towards marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="988">We want to make sure that the prescription drugs that are prescribed in Canada don’t come to Nunavut, but these are new drugs that we need to learn and implement.</seg>
<seg id="989">In December, during the FPT finance ministers "meeting, the funding will be provided through the Anti-Smoking Fund. Twenty-five percent of the funding from the federal government will be allocated to the RCMP for the purpose of investigating drugs and drugs.</seg>
<seg id="990">This is a two-part program.</seg>
<seg id="991">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="992">My next question is in regard to the high cost of housing in the communities.</seg>
<seg id="993">I’m just wondering if the minister could explain why that is in there.</seg>
<seg id="994">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="995">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (Interpretation ends) In conjunction with the RCMP, they hired nine additional RCMP officers in various communities and that’s why they provide staff housing.</seg>
<seg id="996">When there are additional RCMP officers, we have to get them through the government contracts. The additional cost was $300,000. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="997">Mr. Main, did you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="998">Ms. Main: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="999">In the minister’s opening comments, he talked about the $2.6 million breakdown of the $300,000 for housing.</seg>
<seg id="1000">I’m just wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on that.</seg>
<seg id="1001">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (Interpretation ends) I may be missing a number.</seg>
<seg id="1002">I will ask my officials to respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1003">Those are the numbers that we have.</seg>
<seg id="1004">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1005">I would also like to thank the minister. (Interpretation ends) In your opening comments, you stated that $1 million will be used for vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1006">I wonder why these vehicles were not expected to be purchased.</seg>
<seg id="1007">I believe it was supposed to be in the budget, if I understood you correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1008">What was the reason for the purchase of new vehicles?</seg>
<seg id="1009">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank the member for that excellent question.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This $1 million is geared towards vehicle replacement.</seg>
<seg id="1011">We do have a contract with the RCMP and there are a number of different things that they do.</seg>
<seg id="1012">The minister stated last year that the vehicles were not replaced due to lack of funding.</seg>
<seg id="1013">However, earlier this year, a number of vehicles were destroyed due to the fact that they had to purchase the equipment that they needed to do the work.</seg>
<seg id="1014">That’s why there’s been a substantial increase in this year’s budget.</seg>
<seg id="1015">I know that there has been a decrease in the sale of the equipment, but the equipment has been deteriorating.</seg>
<seg id="1016">With respect to the RCMP contracts, they don’t have to purchase the equipment. We don’t usually do that.</seg>
<seg id="1017">However, when we are talking with the federal government, they usually come to an agreement with the federal government and it seems to have gone up significantly.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Ms. Main (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1019">It also states here that my colleague was talking about this issue.</seg>
<seg id="1020">These drugs, I believe, are the most dangerous drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1021">Is it going to be for all the communities or is it just going to be made available to the communities?</seg>
<seg id="1022">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (Interpretation ends) Yes, all the RCMP officers will be receiving this funding for all the communities.</seg>
<seg id="1023">So those are the new equipment that we have in place for the RCMP and for the public that may be going through that type of thing. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1024">In regard to drugs, if it’s a dangerous situation, if there are new drugs in the communities, are there any plans to find drugs in the communities? If there are no drugs in the communities, have you found any RCMP officers in the communities to date?</seg>
<seg id="1025">I hope that the people who are coming into our communities are not very happy and I hope that they will stop.</seg>
<seg id="1026">However, there have been a couple of communities that have been impacted by this issue. Further, the federal government is going to be coming up here in the Northwest Territories and they are in the Northwest Territories.</seg>
<seg id="1027">I am afraid that the people who are going to be taking drugs are going to be taking drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1028">If you don’t take these things, it’s a lot more fun, but these things are becoming dangerous and I am very pleased that the RCMP is preparing for them.</seg>
<seg id="1029">Ms. Main: I thought I was done.</seg>
<seg id="1030">That’s my last question.</seg>
<seg id="1031">In regard to the lack of housing in the community, perhaps you can clarify that for the Nunavut communities.</seg>
<seg id="1032">In the documents that we have provided, there are nine additional RCMP officers. There are nine in six communities in Nunavut that are decentralized and they have been allocated to different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1033">That was just a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1034">Moving on, Mr. Hickes, do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the $2.6 million that you are requesting, it talks about the interpreter / translators that are going to court. You said that there were seven judges that were going to court. Did you also have to get an interpreter from the court system?</seg>
<seg id="1036">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (Interpretation ends) At this time, no, there are a number of additional interpreter / translators in the hiring process.</seg>
<seg id="1037">I’ll just leave it at that for now. In his opening comments, he talks about the need for new telephone systems to be installed and to keep the old telephone systems in place.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Given the fact that they’re going to have to replace the existing telephone system, are they going to be setting aside some money for the new system or are they going to be asking for additional funding once they get the numbers from the RCMP?</seg>
<seg id="1039">Yes, this is in the planning stages for the department and we are requesting funding for that. That is what we are planning for.</seg>
<seg id="1040">One of the things that the Minister of Finance is planning on doing is to have the Public Service Act passed, as my colleague has mentioned, the Motor Vehicle Information System. It’s in the planning stages, but there’s nothing in here for additional funding for smoking. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1041">With respect to other correctional facilities, it talks about the number of staff in the Baffin Correctional Centre. I’m just wondering if the minister could give us an idea of how many staff there are at the Baffin Correctional Centre.</seg>
<seg id="1042">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (Interpretation ends) Item 8. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1043">Did he say that there were eight?</seg>
<seg id="1044">Mr. Hickes (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to ask a question in regard to the information that has been provided to the minister on the overtime. It states that the Baffin Correctional Centre is $180,000, so I’m just wondering if there are any mistakes in the job descriptions, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Can the minister clarify that for me?</seg>
<seg id="1046">Through you, I would like my Deputy Minister, Mr. MacKay, to respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1047">Mr. MacKay: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1048">The superintendent of the nurse in charge, there are a lot of other staff that work there. If the weather is bad, they have to stay there, so that’s part of the overtime costs.</seg>
<seg id="1049">When there is a blizzard, the staff can’t go home. You said that there is going to be more people coming to work. Is there more than two times that there is a blizzard in the community?</seg>
<seg id="1050">Mr. MacKay, can you clarify your question?</seg>
<seg id="1051">Yes, there are two things. If there is a blizzard in the community, they are automatically brought in, but there are two instances where there is a blizzard in the community and there is a blizzard.</seg>
<seg id="1052">Mr. Lightstone.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1054">My questions are for the Minister of Justice. First of all, the RCMP has indicated that there will be a need for nine new RCMP detachments.</seg>
<seg id="1055">When you get a police officer, are they provided with housing on a case-by-case basis?</seg>
<seg id="1056">I am very pleased to say that one of my staff, who is just playing hockey, has been called by one of his colleagues, but I’m sure it’s going to be okay, but my deputy minister can’t write a letter.</seg>
<seg id="1057">There’s going to be a need for wheelchairs.</seg>
<seg id="1058">My question is in regard to the nine RCMP detachments. The RCMP gets housing from the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="1059">As I stated earlier, we work with different departments through the RCMP contract.</seg>
<seg id="1060">I would like to clarify that 70 percent of the RCMP costs are paid by the Government of Nunavut and 30 percent is paid by the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="1061">In terms of the RCMP, they are provided with a contract with the federal government. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1062">Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1063">I’m just wondering: Will the RCMP provide housing for all the RCMP officers?</seg>
<seg id="1064">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (Interpretation ends) With respect to the RCMP, when they are sending their staff to the community, how often do they determine the age?</seg>
<seg id="1065">That’s how they operate in a unique way because they don’t keep their RCMP officers out on the land because they do take them out on the land.</seg>
<seg id="1066">They don’t expect to get their own housing in most communities at any given time, but depending on how many RCMP officers they need, they are provided with housing in the communities.</seg>
<seg id="1067">The RCMP has a different system in place.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When they identify the need for a new RCMP detachment in all 25 communities, they try to include housing as soon as possible. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1069">It’s unfortunate that the RCMP does not try to integrate the RCMP into the communities.</seg>
<seg id="1070">When the RCMP gets their own home, how do they give them income support?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Lightstone.</seg>
<seg id="1072">I don’t think anyone should be asking that question in this House.</seg>
<seg id="1073">I don’t think we should expect them to get their own homes, so that’s why they are provided with home care.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Mr. Akeeagok, if you want to comment on that, it’s up to you.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1076">That was a very good comment, Mr. Chairman, a very good comment.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Yes, the RCMP, even though they only stay in the community for three years, they are part of the community fundraiser.</seg>
<seg id="1078">If a police officer wants to get a house, they can apply to the federal government for housing.</seg>
<seg id="1079">The federal government makes money, not us. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1080">In terms of the last contract with the RCMP, how many contracts did you have with the RCMP?</seg>
<seg id="1081">On page 5 of the bill, it states, "$40,071,000."</seg>
<seg id="1082">If this is approved, it will be $42,671,000 for the contract for the 2017-18 fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="1083">I thank the minister for that information.</seg>
<seg id="1084">Moving on to Item 3, Corrections. Corrections. Branch Summary. Corrections. Overtime and casual employment.</seg>
<seg id="1085">Chairman (interpretation): Mr. Lightstone, we are just here with the Law Enforcement Branch. We haven’t gotten to that stage yet. Can you wait for your questions?</seg>
<seg id="1086">At this time, we are asking questions to the Law Enforcement Branch. (Interpretation) Are there any further questions on this page?</seg>
<seg id="1087">Mr. Lightstone: Yes, the last one for the Law Enforcement Branch.</seg>
<seg id="1088">In the minister’s letter, he explained that the total budget was $40 million and they actually spent $30 million on escorts, which is estimated to be $42 million.</seg>
<seg id="1089">I’m just wondering if the minister could give us an indication of how that $42 million is projected to be spent by the end of the fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Perhaps if I could ask the member which numbers he is looking at.</seg>
<seg id="1091">If there is a number, I would like to get some assistance. I sent a letter on Friday and I believe I found $30 million, but if he could elaborate a little bit more.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The letter is dated March 16 and it is referred to the Regular Members "Caucus Chair, the Minister of Finance’s letter to the Minister of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="1093">The document that I’m referring to is on page 4 of the business plan. It’s on page 4 of 5 of the business plan.</seg>
<seg id="1094">I would like to thank the member for his question. I see it in the document that we tabled.</seg>
<seg id="1095">The $30 million for this year has been used up to date, $30 million, and the plan is $42 million.</seg>
<seg id="1096">The RCMP has a description of what they’re going to be using and how much they’re going to be using. The $2.6 million that we have requested is based on the numbers of the RCMP. That’s how I wrote it down.</seg>
<seg id="1097">I’m looking at $2.6 million on page 1 of the business plan of the Legislative Assembly, and it indicates that the RCMP operates on a more streamlined radio station, and on top of that, it says, "For the history of the request."</seg>
<seg id="1098">The standing committee notes that the Legislative Assembly is proposing to amend its management structure. However, due to its unique nature, a $2.6 million increase is required to cover the cost of staff training for staff, training, staffing, and departmental activities.</seg>
<seg id="1099">In the same paragraph, it talks about $2.6 million for casual employment and casual employment. In the same paragraph, it talks about $2.6 million, and then it says, "There’s a little bit more of an efficiency of the CARS program."</seg>
<seg id="1100">Can you clarify that for me, Mr. Chairman?</seg>
<seg id="1101">Mr. Akeeagok, if you would like to clarify your question, it’s up to you.</seg>
<seg id="1102">If you look at the substantiation sheets that I mentioned earlier, there’s another breakdown. There’s a project of $2.6 million that’s going to be used for corrections.</seg>
<seg id="1103">There are two separate items. There’s $2.6 million, but it’s a separate project.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Mr. Chairman, the need for the RCMP radio stations, the need for housing, the need for vehicles, as well as the emergency situations that have occurred in the past. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1105">Thank you, Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="1106">If we’re talking about $2.6 million, how much of that is, I don’t understand that, can you clarify that for me?</seg>
<seg id="1107">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="1108">On page 5 of our business plan, we’re dealing with the Law Enforcement Branch, $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1109">In addition to the "Correctional Facilities" of $2.6 million, it also says, "Total Corrections." We’re not dealing with that right now. We’re in the $2.6 million area of law enforcement.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Do you have any questions?</seg>
<seg id="1111">Mr. Towtongie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for clarifying that.</seg>
<seg id="1112">In reading the Inuktitut version, the English budget is the way it is, but in the Inuktitut version, it seems to be an estimate, it seems to be an estimate in Inuktitut.</seg>
<seg id="1113">Can the minister clearly explain what this means? Is it the main estimates or the main estimates for 2017-18?</seg>
<seg id="1114">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (Interpretation ends) To my left, in the main estimates, it talks about the $40 million for law enforcement and $11 million for the office has already been approved.</seg>
<seg id="1115">At this time, we are still in the 2017-18 fiscal year and the estimates are projected to be a little over that amount, so that’s why we’re trying to get approval from the Legislative Assembly for supplementary appropriations for the Department of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1116">A total of $6.2 million, of which $2.6 million is for the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="1117">Those are the types of things that we are requesting from the House. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1118">I was just confused because it seems like they are estimates in the Inuktitut version, although they are estimates.</seg>
<seg id="1119">I understand my question a little bit better now, but I’m done.</seg>
<seg id="1120">We’re on Law Enforcement. Total Law Enforcement. $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Next on the list is Total Registries and Court Services, $1 million.</seg>
<seg id="1122">Total Justice, Corrections, $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1124">My question is in regard to the Corrections Division, I think it’s an annual over-expenditure, if memory serves me correct. It’s just over-expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Am I correct in that?</seg>
<seg id="1126">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1127">The member is correct that the maximum amount is for overtime as well as casual employees.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1129">If my memory serves me correct, the correctional facilities have a 12-hour facility. Is that correct?</seg>
<seg id="1130">Now that the current correctional facilities are full and overtime, has your department considered three to eight hours a day to rectify this situation?</seg>
<seg id="1131">Perhaps through you, the Deputy Minister, Mr. MacKay, can respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The member is correct that they work 12 hours a day.</seg>
<seg id="1133">That’s how it’s set up for two hours, 42 hours a week, so it’s going to be overtime for 42 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1134">Under the agreement, the overtime was reduced to $4 million and now it’s $2.49 million.</seg>
<seg id="1135">As a result, the corrections division’s deficit was $4.5 million, which is almost $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1136">We are moving forward with the overtime payments and we will continue to do that.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Just a reminder, please turn your cellphones off and put them on silent mode.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1139">They travel on overtime and they work 42 hours a week.</seg>
<seg id="1140">Do the employees work 50 hours or 60 hours a week?</seg>
<seg id="1141">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1142">It’s too detailed, so we have to provide it to the House and we will provide it in writing.</seg>
<seg id="1143">My deputy minister can’t respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1144">We don’t have that information in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="1145">I don’t know the level of detail that the member is talking about in terms of the operations of the facility.</seg>
<seg id="1146">I would like to ask these questions.</seg>
<seg id="1147">What kind of training do they receive?</seg>
<seg id="1148">With your permission, I would like Deputy Minister MacKay to respond to that.</seg>
<seg id="1149">So in answer to that question, I think that’s where the training and training is going to be provided under the supplementary appropriations that are going to be provided to the courts.</seg>
<seg id="1150">At this time, we don’t provide any training.</seg>
<seg id="1151">We do have a trainer that is contracted out and that’s one of the reasons why it’s costing us a lot of money to replace the overtime and so on and so forth, and that’s why we have to increase the cost of the training.</seg>
<seg id="1152">At the same time, we are looking at other ways to better plan for the budget so that we can have more staff at the correctional centre and the courthouse to be able to provide more training to the contractors so that we don’t have a lot of teachers.</seg>
<seg id="1153">Ms. Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="1154">I was curious to find out about the 2.6 million dollars that was announced and the training of the staff.</seg>
<seg id="1155">What kind of training are you going to be providing to the employees and the casuals?</seg>
<seg id="1156">Both Corrections and Court Services provide training to casuals and employers.</seg>
<seg id="1157">There are a number of training programs that are offered in the correctional facilities, such as arbitration, dispute resolution, and so on, and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="1158">Can the minister clarify what programs and services are currently in place at the correctional facilities or can he ask me questions on this issue?</seg>
<seg id="1159">I don’t know if they have that level of detail, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="1160">With your permission, Deputy Minister MacKay can give you a brief overview of what they do.</seg>
<seg id="1161">Ms. MacKay.</seg>
<seg id="1162">I don’t have the numbers in front of me, but I will be able to get back to the member on what kind of training is provided to inmates.</seg>
<seg id="1163">Depending on which facility is the most secure facility in Nunavut, the Iqaluit Healing Facility and the trades training centre will enable inmates to take advantage of employment opportunities, training, and employment opportunities at the Baffin Correctional Centre.</seg>
<seg id="1164">We also have Akausisarvik, which is one of the programs that we provide to each inmate based on the needs of the inmates, the addictions counselling that is provided at the facility, the anger management counselling, and so on, and so forth, depending on the inmates that are incarcerated, what they need, what they need, and what they have to do with their rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="1165">Even though they can’t leave the correctional facility, they are given training in order to get out of jail so that they can get into the workforce, which is usually the high school diploma and the trades training program that is offered in the correctional facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1166">In Rankin Inlet, we do provide probation services to the inmates.</seg>
<seg id="1167">There are different programs that we provide.</seg>
<seg id="1168">Mr. Nakashuk: I’m done.</seg>
<seg id="1169">We are on page 5.</seg>
<seg id="1170">Justice. Operations and Maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="1171">Total Department. Not Previously Authorized. $6,200,000.</seg>
<seg id="1172">Go to page 6.</seg>
<seg id="1173">Health. Operations and Maintenance. Not Previously Authorized.</seg>
<seg id="1174">Mr. Akeeagok, did you want to comment on that?</seg>
<seg id="1175">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (Interpretation ends) It’s not a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1176">If it’s okay with you, we will move on to another department. I would like to have my officials at the witness table respond to that question before we go on to questions. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1177">I was going to give you an opportunity, but if you would like to take this opportunity, it’s okay.</seg>
<seg id="1178">Sergeant-at-arms, you can change your staff at this time.</seg>
<seg id="1179">Does the committee agree to bring in the witnesses?</seg>
<seg id="1180">Chairman (interpretation): Sergeant-at-arms, please escort the other witness out.</seg>
<seg id="1181">For the record, Mr. Akeeagok, please introduce your new witness.</seg>
<seg id="1182">The person who just walked in, to my left, the Deputy Minister of Health and Social Services, Colleen Inuujaq Stockley.</seg>
<seg id="1183">Operations and Maintenance. Not Previously Authorized. Total Headquarters Region. $5.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Mr. Netser: My mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1185">I’m going to be asking questions in regard to medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1187">Are there any questions on the Directorate.</seg>
<seg id="1188">I don’t have too many questions, but when we’re talking about elders "facilities in Nunavut, there are three continuing care facilities that will be funded through different programs.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the last couple of days when I was asking questions about the preliminary studies that are going on in Igloolik and Gjoa Haven, they are doing a feasibility study to see if they can expand the elders "facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1190">At that time, the minister was not aware of the number of beds that were going to be tested.</seg>
<seg id="1191">I’m just wondering if we can get an update as to what’s happening with the increase in the elders "group homes.</seg>
<seg id="1192">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you for the question.</seg>
<seg id="1193">This year, according to the preplanning study, it’s under that category. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1194">What is the status of this preplanning study and what is the status of it now?</seg>
<seg id="1195">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (Interpretation ends) You, Mr. Chairman, I would like the Deputy Minister of Health and Social Services to respond to that because he knows a lot more about the capital planning process.</seg>
<seg id="1196">The Department of Health has already planned for last year’s capital estimates for 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1197">I would like to ask the minister if they can proceed with the expansion of the facility in Igloolik. The minister just stated that they would be able to do that.</seg>
<seg id="1198">Just to keep that in mind, after the election, I’m sure that the government was going to have a new mandate, but I’m just wondering if there are any options for expanding the facility in Igloolik.</seg>
<seg id="1199">It’s not that far away, but we expect that we will be able to move forward once we know what the government’s mandate is.</seg>
<seg id="1200">In conclusion, when we talk about the use of government programs, we have identified that there is a lack of adequate infrastructure and I would like to take this opportunity to emphasize the department’s role in the delivery of the government’s seniors "care program.</seg>
<seg id="1201">I look forward to the development of an existing system that identifies a number of opportunities for new infrastructure that is currently on the waiting list.</seg>
<seg id="1202">That was more of a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1203">I would like to follow up on my colleague’s question in regard to the elders "homes.</seg>
<seg id="1204">I would like to know how the breakdown of the $900,000 is.</seg>
<seg id="1205">I’m just wondering if the minister could give us an indication as to which infrastructure is going to be divided amongst the group homes.</seg>
<seg id="1206">The $900,000 is for the three regions and the $300,000 is for each of the three elders.</seg>
<seg id="1207">Ms. Main (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (Interpretation ends) I’m just wondering if the minister could comment on the status of these units that are under contract with non-profit organizations in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1208">My question for the minister: Can the minister tell the House how the Department of Health and Social Services works with the Department of Health and Social Services to inform the public if they are going to be over-expended?</seg>
<seg id="1209">The three communities that are operated by the government, not by the government, have just recently issued a new contract. That’s one of the things that we have been working on.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Additionally, if there is a need to increase or decrease, the Department of Health and Social Services and the various organizations have to meet with each other.</seg>
<seg id="1211">They work with each other when they have to work with each other to try to resolve the issues.</seg>
<seg id="1212">We have to abide by the rules of Canada and Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1213">In the business plan, it states that "There are three facilities that have just opened in their homes, two to three levels of residential care, and there are a number of factors that indicate that the majority of these facilities are residential care and aging."</seg>
<seg id="1214">Going back to the budget, do you anticipate that in the coming year, the costs will continue to increase, or is it going to be the end of the fiscal year, or are we getting enough money now?</seg>
<seg id="1215">At the beginning of the contract, there were three social workers that were under the responsibility of the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="1216">The Department of Health and Social Services finally awarded the contract in April of 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1217">In terms of the information that we gave to the Department of Health and Social Services, it’s a little bit different from the Department of Health and Social Services. The way we looked at it, the level of care, the level of care, the level of care, and the level of care that is provided by the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="1218">That was the recommendation that was made by the department to look at the food that they are receiving.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When we looked at the contract, the elders "facilities were not able to meet the needs of the elders.</seg>
<seg id="1220">We’re projecting a deficit of $1.3 million and we’re projecting a deficit of $855,000 last year, so we’re proposing close to $900,000 for that purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Correct me if I’m wrong, but when you look at the funding for mental health and addictions across the territory, I’m not sure if I’m wrong, but I’m just wondering if you can correct me if I’m wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With respect to trauma or trauma, we have to deal with the trauma of the people who have been in trauma.</seg>
<seg id="1223">I’m just wondering: Is there any talk about setting aside some money for mental health services?</seg>
<seg id="1224">We’re here, we’re just talking about additional funding for operations and maintenance because we’re not talking about actual costs.</seg>
<seg id="1225">I don’t think it’s appropriate for this House or any other legislature to be in a position to be able to do that.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Do you have any further questions, Ms. Towtongie?</seg>
<seg id="1227">Thank you for that clarification.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The mental health contract for 2017-18 is $16.7 million, I believe, $6.2 million. What is the status of that?</seg>
<seg id="1229">That’s my last question. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1230">Mr. Chairman, with respect to the $5.9 million that the member is asking about, it is included in the $43.1 million.</seg>
<seg id="1231">The bulk of the $16 million and $10 million is in there.</seg>
<seg id="1232">I wonder if the minister can elaborate on the details of that. Through you, Deputy Minister Stockley, I would like to ask why there is an additional $10 million for this project.</seg>
<seg id="1233">It’s good to hear that the people of Nunavut are asking for help, and I would like to encourage you to contact the health centres and the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1234">The number of people seeking treatment is increasing and that’s why we have seen an increase in the number of people who are going to the treatment centre.</seg>
<seg id="1235">I know that they have mental health problems and addictions.</seg>
<seg id="1236">There are also monies that are outside of the Department of Health and Social Services that are administered by the Department of Justice. There are a number of people who have been ordered to go to a rehabilitation centre and they go through the funding process.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Before we proceed to the Directorate, we will take a five-minute break.</seg>
<seg id="1238">&amp;gt; &amp;gt; Committee recessed at 18:03 and resumed at 18:10</seg>
<seg id="1239">I would like to call the committee meeting back to order.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Total Health Care Service Delivery. $43,100,000.</seg>
<seg id="1241">In the out-of-territory, long-term care for our elders, you have identified a number of areas that are deteriorating and deteriorating.</seg>
<seg id="1242">That would probably increase because we don’t have a forgivable laboratory in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1243">That’s what I want to hear.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Are they looking at that to make sure that we have a laboratory in Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="1245">It’s one of them right away, but it’s not at the top of the list.</seg>
<seg id="1246">These are the types of mental health issues that are being dealt with by the government.</seg>
<seg id="1247">On the same page, outside of the territory, the last bullet states, "Outside of the Territory of Nunavut, the Department of Health and Social Services is responsible for the delivery of health care services in Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="1248">I was a little surprised that the minister’s correspondence, which is broken down by department, did not include any of the details of the over-expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="1249">I’m just wondering if the department is going to be spending all of their money in this area.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On page 6, the first item is the $5.9 million that has not been previously authorized for out-of-territory care for elders in the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This year, we are requesting $5.9 million for elders "care and we are requesting $5.9 million for elders" care. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1252">My question is more directed to the Department of Health and Social Services, which is responsible for over-expenditure in other areas of the budget.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Perhaps through you, if I make a mistake, the Deputy Minister, Stockley, can correct me.</seg>
<seg id="1254">I think that was the question that was posed, but I can respond by saying that the over-expenditure has not been removed from the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="1255">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you for the clarification.</seg>
<seg id="1256">The money has not been spent internally, so the money that has not been spent has not been spent and we move it over to the next fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The balance of the budget for the Department of Health is $49 million.</seg>
<seg id="1258">The letter that I just sent to you today will be translated into Inuktitut. It was sent in English on Friday and it’s not an appendix, it’s an appendix, it’s an over-expenditure, and if you look at what the plans are.</seg>
<seg id="1259">That’s a very small amount, if you look at the over-expenditure that we’re proposing in the supplementary appropriation. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1260">I appreciate the fact that you mentioned the appendix, but what I was trying to get at was the letter that I received from the minister on page 4 of the business plan.</seg>
<seg id="1261">Under the Department of Family Services, they are showing the surplus that they can use to reuse it.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The Department of Health and Social Services has not done that. Why is it that they have not done that?</seg>
<seg id="1263">The Department of Health and Social Services did not have any indication that there would be a surplus.</seg>
<seg id="1264">On page 5 of the business plan, it indicates that the Department of Health and Social Services will require an additional $49 million. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1265">The Department of Health does not provide a breakdown of the department’s programs.</seg>
<seg id="1266">In the Department of Health and Social Services, I know that there has been a budget surplus in the department, but in terms of the recruitment and retention of nurses, staffing, informatics, and so on, there has been over $1 million left over over over in the last few years.</seg>
<seg id="1267">Can the minister provide us with a breakdown of all the programs that the Department of Health and Social Services offers that are left over when there is an over-expenditure?</seg>
<seg id="1268">You’re asking for very detailed information that may not be available at this time.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Minister Akoak...</seg>
<seg id="1270">... Mr. Akeeagok, go ahead.</seg>
<seg id="1271">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for recognizing me.</seg>
<seg id="1272">We don’t have that level of detail in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="1273">We will be able to table that in the House at a later date. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1274">I’ll move on to the elders "facility.</seg>
<seg id="1275">In the second paragraph, it indicates that the current elders "facilities are operated through contracts with non-profit organizations in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1276">I would just like to say that this is a very good program for all of Nunavut’s organizations.</seg>
<seg id="1277">I would hope that we would be able to contract as many contracts as we can.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Moving on to a different topic, on the same page, on a daily basis, 24-hour care for elders, it states that the Department of Health provides 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for staff housing under the Department of Health’s Staff Housing Policy.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The elders have to be administered according to the legislation.</seg>
<seg id="1280">I would like to ask the Minister of Health and Social Services: Can the minister tell the House what kinds of elders "facilities are required to meet the minimum requirements of the facility?</seg>
<seg id="1281">I responded to that question earlier.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The contract has been awarded to a new contractor and there has been an increase in the contract with the Department of Health and Social Services in terms of compliance and compliance.</seg>
<seg id="1283">If it’s not being followed properly, then the interpreters and the Department of Health and Social Services have to meet with each other to make sure that they’re following the proper procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1284">Mr. Monteith.</seg>
<seg id="1285">Can you clarify if these elders "facilities are up to the minimum level of care that they require?</seg>
<seg id="1286">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1287">Right now, it’s a new contract and we have increased it by $900,000 to $5.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="1288">It has been identified that the three organizations will be trying to keep up with the needs of the elders, but they have not reached the level of care that they need.</seg>
<seg id="1289">As the minister stated, they are trying to catch up with that. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Mr. Netser (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1291">It’s getting a little bit cynical now because I’m getting too quiet.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In regard to medical travel, they are asking for $50 million, and I have brought this up many times in the House in regard to medical travel patients who don’t have an appointment, especially in my constituency, when they go down to Winnipeg, they find out that they don’t have an appointment.</seg>
<seg id="1293">I’m just wondering if the Department of Health has a list of the patients that were sent down to Winnipeg for medical reasons that were not informed of their appointments, if the department has a list of the costs that were incurred for those patients that were not able to get appointments, their travel, accommodations, and so on. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1294">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (Interpretation ends) I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="1295">The Minister of Health and Social Services has committed to reviewing all of the patients who have been sent out for medical treatment and those who have not been seen or who have changed their appointments.</seg>
<seg id="1296">One of the things that the government is trying to do is to make sure that we look at all of the incidents that have occurred in the past and find out where the misconduct occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1297">The member has asked me a number of questions and he has seen these types of things and we would like to include them in the review.</seg>
<seg id="1298">I would like to thank the member for bringing this issue forward and we can look at it as a joint venture.</seg>
<seg id="1299">That will be part of the review, but there are patients who have to go to the health centre for appointments. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1300">Mr. Netser (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (Interpretation ends) I look forward to the results of the review.</seg>
<seg id="1301">At this time, $5.5 million was allocated for tuberculosis in Qikiqtarjuaq and I believe it was just recently on February 26 that the federal government made a significant amount of money for Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami. I believe it was $82 million and $80 million was set aside for the TB study.</seg>
<seg id="1302">I wonder if the government or the Department of Health and Social Services has made a request or if Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami can assist us with this funding. I wonder if the government has discussed this matter with the federal government to see if they can be compensated for tuberculosis.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1304">That’s a very good question.</seg>
<seg id="1305">At this time, the federal government announced that its 2018-19 budget will be used to support the development of the Inuit Tuberculosis Program, which is also stated that Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami will be funded over the next five years to work with Inuit Nunangat.</seg>
<seg id="1306">At present, the committee is comprised of representatives from Inuit Nunangat. The Department of Health and Social Services is a member of the committee, which is a member of the committee.</seg>
<seg id="1307">At this time, the additional funding will be provided by the federal government and as the Minister of Finance, I haven’t seen any details on that.</seg>
<seg id="1308">I look forward to seeing the details of the work that is being done by the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami. They are very knowledgeable to us as the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="1309">That is how it is set up.</seg>
<seg id="1310">With respect to the contents of the report, we will be informed by the minister as to what is happening with this issue.</seg>
<seg id="1311">I would like to ask another question in regards to the concerns of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1312">In here, medical travel is not an operational issue, but there are interest rates and contracts that go up. That’s what we’re talking about.</seg>
<seg id="1313">I’m just wondering: In terms of the $15 million over-expenditure, does the Department of Health and Social Services have an idea of why the costs are going up?</seg>
<seg id="1314">The 5.6 percent is projected to increase on an annual basis, what are the main reasons for these increases?</seg>
<seg id="1315">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Through you, I would like my Deputy Minister, Mr. Stockley, to respond to that.</seg>
<seg id="1317">Medical travel and medivacs are increasing every year.</seg>
<seg id="1318">There are more and more patients going on medical travel, so it’s a good thing that they are getting diagnosed as early as possible and they are sent out.</seg>
<seg id="1319">In this case, tuberculosis is one of the most severe cases of tuberculosis in Canada. This is one of the reasons why people are not vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="1320">I’ll give you an example.</seg>
<seg id="1321">I think there were about 60 medevacs that had to go to the health centre on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="1322">The number of medivacs is increasing every week, so we have been looking at it every year, especially in the springtime, where people are suffering from lung cancer or respiratory illness, and we have to deal with it on an emergency basis.</seg>
<seg id="1323">The total number of medical travel clients and medical evacuations has increased.</seg>
<seg id="1324">Mr. Chairman, I’m not going to get into the details of what the reasons are for the increase.</seg>
<seg id="1325">I’m just wondering: Is the population of Nunavut going to be good for the health of the people?</seg>
<seg id="1326">Can I get a little bit of an explanation or if my question is too broad, are we on par with the number of patients that we are experiencing or are we being left behind?</seg>
<seg id="1327">I would like Deputy Minister Stockley to respond to that.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Mr. Speaker, it’s unfortunate that all of Canada’s health care system in Nunavut has the highest number of people living in overcrowded homes and it has caused a lot of health problems, but we have made some progress, but if there is no more housing available, then we will be able to address that.</seg>
<seg id="1329">We have also added an addition to the marshalling facility that has been added to the Baffin Regional Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="1330">We are trying to reduce the amount of medical travel that is provided to the communities.</seg>
<seg id="1331">We are moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="1332">The second category is the Telehealth system, which will be used in all three regions.</seg>
<seg id="1333">You will get a lot more information when we want to get funding for operations and maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="1334">I thank the minister for that answer.</seg>
<seg id="1335">I look forward to the day when we are dealing with the main estimates for this department.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In terms of the mental health over-expenditure of $10.5 million, one of the things that we hear is that it’s an ongoing program and it’s a very important program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">When I look at the substantiation sheets, it doesn’t say what the reason is for the increase of $10.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="1338">I’m just wondering: In your department, are there more people with mental health issues now and, if so, what is the reason for that?</seg>
<seg id="1339">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1340">During the Fourth Session of the Fourth Legislative Assembly, a number of Members of the Legislative Assembly took their own lives. This was an urgent matter for the government to take action.</seg>
<seg id="1341">We’re going to continue to promote that. We don’t have any training programs in place to be able to provide that service to the physicians.</seg>
<seg id="1342">It will change the way our constituents and members continue to bring forward issues in the Legislative Assembly to the public on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="1343">My last question is in regard to the Mental Health and Addictions Program, how many of our clients are currently receiving care outside of the territory for mental health and addictions?</seg>
<seg id="1344">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 64.</seg>
<seg id="1345">I’m just wondering: Is it 64 more, or is it less, or what’s the change from the previous year?</seg>
<seg id="1346">We don’t have that information in front of us, but if the member wants that information, we will be able to provide it in the main estimates.</seg>
<seg id="1347">Moving on to a different topic, the Qikiqtarjuaq Tuberculosis Survey, I’m sure all of us agree that it’s very encouraging to hear that.</seg>
<seg id="1348">It says here that the equipment and equipment will be kept by the Department of Health and Social Services in other communities. Is it going to be a study or is it too small or is it going to stay in the community?</seg>
<seg id="1349">Through you, I will have my Deputy Minister, Stockley, respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Will the property assessments be done through the capital planning process?</seg>
<seg id="1351">I’m lost.</seg>
<seg id="1352">I know it’s under capital, but I would like to get clarification on that.</seg>
<seg id="1353">Yes, through you, I would like my Deputy Minister, Stockley, to respond to that.</seg>
<seg id="1354">The bulk of the assets came from the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="1355">The funding that we received from the federal government, for example, the breakwaters, the breakwaters, the doors, and so on, is used by the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="1356">Ms. Main: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1357">My last question, I’m sure it’s my last one.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The Department of Health and Social Services, in terms of the recruitment and retention of agency nurses, the department has been very successful in reducing the number of agency nurses.</seg>
<seg id="1359">I would like to ask, in this current year’s expenditures in the past, what changes have been made to the formula financing arrangement?</seg>
<seg id="1360">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Instead of having to use agency nurses, we have been able to provide more services to the people of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1362">From last year to today, we have been utilizing more of our own nurses.</seg>
<seg id="1363">That’s my final question.</seg>
<seg id="1364">If I get the breakdown of the $8.6 million, I would appreciate it.</seg>
<seg id="1365">Broken down by fiscal year for the 2017-18 fiscal year, there was a shortfall of $52.5 million for casual staffing, which exceeded $45.3 million in overtime, waitlist payments of $15.7 million, and agency nurses exceeding $0.1 million, totalling $8.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1366">I just have one question to make a comment on the breakdown of the items that you’re talking about, but I’ll just add to Mr. Main’s question.</seg>
<seg id="1367">I’m not going to get into the details of that, but I’m going to go into the details of that.</seg>
<seg id="1368">If there is a nurse in Sanikiluaq who has an emergency in the middle of the night, if they have to leave, they have to have overtime. I know that the employee has to have overtime.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (Interpretation ends) All of these are agency nurses. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1370">I know the minister was answering questions today about what the department is doing to recruit and retain nurses.</seg>
<seg id="1371">I’ll leave it at that for now.</seg>
<seg id="1372">I just want to make a comment. When we look at the budget of the Department of Health, there are physicians, contractors, psychiatric nurses, and medical travel, there are always supplementary appropriations that are put forward every year.</seg>
<seg id="1373">The number for mental health and addictions has changed dramatically from last year. I believe it was $6.8 million to $7.8 million last year.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Earlier in my budget speech, the Minister of Finance indicated that there has been no change at this time, but I believe that there has to be a real change because we have to go back and forth and we have to go through the supplementary appropriation process.</seg>
<seg id="1375">When you are aware of the over-expenditure requirements that are in place right now in the main estimates, you have to be able to come up with the dollar values that are required and not just the supplementary appropriations.</seg>
<seg id="1376">That’s just a comment, but I would like to hear from the minister in regard to that.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Again, I think it’s a realistic thing that we’re looking at, as Members of the Fourth Legislative Assembly, we’ve been considering these issues and we’ve had discussions with some departments, Health and Social Services, and the Department of Justice, and we’ve always come back with supplementary appropriations.</seg>
<seg id="1378">I am very pleased that we are dealing with this issue in the main estimates and I am working closely with my colleagues on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="1379">I have responded to some of the health issues since I have been the Minister of Health and Social Services. It has always been called the Department of Health and Social Services and it has been very sensitive to the health department.</seg>
<seg id="1380">I think that’s something that we really need to work on, to make sure that the budget is accurate, to make sure that everything is corrected, and to make sure that we don’t change the budgeting process, we have to recognize that we have to do some of the things that we have to do.</seg>
<seg id="1381">We will have to go through the Legislative Assembly to make those changes.</seg>
<seg id="1382">One of our regular members made a number of observations and observations.</seg>
<seg id="1383">I also feel that we have to work closely together as Members of the Legislative Assembly, because we really need that.</seg>
<seg id="1384">In 2017-18, we are facing some of the challenges that we face. I would like to work closely with the Premier and the Members of the Legislative Assembly to make sure that we know how much money was spent by the departments and we don’t have to go back to the main estimates.</seg>
<seg id="1385">I just wanted to make that comment and thank you, Mr. Chairman, for giving me the opportunity to make my comments.</seg>
<seg id="1386">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1387">I applaud the minister for acknowledging the need for an amendment.</seg>
<seg id="1388">I just wanted to reiterate that as he stated earlier, the Department of Justice continues to approach our current colleagues to deal with overtime issues, such as overtime, overtime, nurses, and other statutory requirements. I have raised this issue for the last three and a half years and I will be tabling it in the House.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Again, I think it’s important to recognize that, and I think the Minister of Human Resources is saying, "How can we get the government to fill these positions?"</seg>
<seg id="1390">As we move forward with the development of our existing organizational structure, if we were to fill those positions, as Mr. Main was talking about the challenges that the government faces, the tireless, and the pain that it causes to some of our employees, then we have to look at how we can move forward with the government, where we have strengths, and we’re not trying to keep up with the challenges that we’re facing.</seg>
<seg id="1391">In terms of overtime, I would like to find out more about moving forward where the priorities are and what the initiatives are so that we can look forward to what we can do.</seg>
<seg id="1392">That was just a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Mr. Mikkungwak, did you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1394">Mr. Mikkungwak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1395">I just have one question in regard to the mental health contract. In the fourth paragraph, it states that the Department of Justice is compensated for the cost of medical travel. Is that included in the $10.5 million?</seg>
<seg id="1396">I will try to make it short. Yes, I will provide that information to the member.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Mr. Lightstone, do you have any further questions?</seg>
<seg id="1398">My last question, Mr. Chairman, is in regard to Mr. Main and Mr. Hickes "questions.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last question I have is in regard to the health centre staff, the $8.6 million over-expenditure. It’s just an indication of the $143 million that you’re indicating, $151 million up to $8.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1400">Is that for all the salaries and benefits of the department?</seg>
<seg id="1401">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (Interpretation ends) Yes, these are for the compensation and benefits.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1403">Is this $151 million 100 percent accurate?</seg>
<seg id="1404">This is a $25 million increase in compensation and benefits.</seg>
<seg id="1405">I don’t think the funding has ever been 100 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1406">As I stated earlier, we are requesting $8.6 million in our main estimates for compensation and benefits.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It’s not 100 percent accurate in our financial statements. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1408">In the very near future, there are a lot of things in there.</seg>
<seg id="1409">Let me move on to the minister’s letter on page 4 of the minister’s opening comments. The department’s proposed budget for the Patient Relations Division is $63.8 million for the 2017-18 fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="1410">I’m just wondering why the money was set aside for the 2016-17 fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I don’t have that information in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="1412">If you would like, I can get it. (Interpretation ends) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1413">Mr. Lightstone, we’re trying to deal with 2016-17, not 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1414">I’ll just keep in mind that I’ll leave it at that for the 2016-17 fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="1415">I asked this question in regard to the medical travel budget last year. I would like to know what the department’s budget is for 2018-19.</seg>
<seg id="1416">I don’t think Mr. Akeeagok has the figures in front of him for 2017-18, but I don’t think he’s anticipating it for next year. Mr. Akeeagok may not have that information in front of him, Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (Interpretation ends) In May, there will be a budget address for 2018-19. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1418">We are voting on the interim appropriation for 2017-18. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1419">One of the other things that I would like to point out in the budget is that there is a problem with the funding that the minister provided. There are a lot of differences between the main estimates and the main estimates that have been done every year, but I would hope to be in a position in the next fiscal year to be able to make a commitment to the Department of Health and Social Services when the O &amp; M budget comes up.</seg>
<seg id="1420">I don’t want to see the Legislative Assembly repeatedly asking for additional funding on an annual basis.</seg>
<seg id="1421">I would like to ask the minister if he could give us an update on the operations and maintenance of the department.</seg>
<seg id="1422">That’s more of a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you. (Interpretation ends) Mr. Qirngnuq, do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1424">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1425">I would like to ask a question in regard to medical travel. In English, I will be asking questions in regard to medical travel. For the third bullet in April, there has been an increase in the number of medivacs last year.</seg>
<seg id="1426">The member is referring to medical travel. This has increased the number of people who have to go to the health centre. The number of people who have to go to the hospital has increased. The number of people who have to have a baby has increased.</seg>
<seg id="1427">However, the number of patients requiring medical travel is rising.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Mr. Mikkungwak, do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1429">I’m sorry, I thought you had your hand up.</seg>
<seg id="1430">We are on Health and Social Services. Operations and Maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="1431">We’re done with the $43,100,000. If you go down to the bottom, the total department is $49 million.</seg>

<seg id="1442">Minister Akeeagok, do you have any closing remarks?</seg>
<seg id="1443">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (Interpretation ends) I would like to thank the members for their questions on the budget allocation for the upcoming fiscal year and the hard work of our staff to compile the best estimates that are available.</seg>
<seg id="1444">Using this methodology, we will be able to make changes to the budget.</seg>
<seg id="1445">Before we go to the next bill, we will move on to the next bill.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would like to thank the minister for his hard work and I will now rise to report progress.</seg>
<seg id="1447">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you. Did you want another witness to come in?</seg>
<seg id="1448">Sergeant-at-arms, please escort the witness out.</seg>
<seg id="1449">We will move on to Bill 4.</seg>
<seg id="1450">Mr. Akeeagok, please proceed with your opening comments.</seg>
<seg id="1451">Bill 04 – Supplementary Appropriation (Capital) Act, No. 4, 2017-2018 – Consideration in Committee</seg>
<seg id="1452">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1453">I am pleased to appear before you today to present Bill 4, Supplementary Appropriation (Capital) Act, No. 4, 2017-2018.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Through this bill, the government is requesting an additional $96,000 for 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1455">This supplementary appropriation will provide the Department of Community and Government Services with a non-profit contribution of $96,000, as a result of interest adjustments in negotiations for the lease of the Nunavut Construction Corporation’s Legislative Assembly building, as well as nine GN offices across Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1456">I would be pleased to take questions and comments as we proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1457">Are there any general comments on the minister’s opening comments?</seg>
<seg id="1458">This is the first time that I have been involved in this process. I would like to know why we have to do this.</seg>
<seg id="1459">Is the Department of Community and Government Services not able to find their own capital estimates?</seg>
<seg id="1460">I think it’s important that the financial statements be recorded so that we can be more transparent and transparent.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There would not be any money, but it would have to be paid out of the interest that was higher than what was expected. (Interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>

<seg id="1520">As Speaker of this House and Chair of the Order of Nunavut Advisory Council, I am honoured to take this opportunity to announce this year’s recipients of the Order of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1521">On January 1, 2010, the Order of Nunavut Act came into force.</seg>
<seg id="1522">It makes sense for individuals to be recognized for their hard work, dedication, and dedication to the people of Nunavut, to our communities.</seg>
<seg id="1523">This award is the Government of Nunavut’s highest honour of all awards, medals, or medals.</seg>
<seg id="1524">As of today, 15 individuals have received the Order of Nunavut Award for Excellence in Excellence.</seg>
<seg id="1525">These individuals have been recognized for their hard work and dedication to a variety of areas, including public service promotion, education, language advocacy, and various leadership roles in diversification, and economic development.</seg>

<seg id="1527">I am very pleased that we are able to have Pudluk in the House with us today.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Welcome, Mr. Pudluk.</seg>

<seg id="2">"The entire Arctic right now is tied to the event tonight"</seg>

<seg id="6">"It is believed that Reverend Evelyn is better known for her actions, that climate change is unbelievable and that the economy of the world will eliminate the Christian faith that went to the Iqaluit church on August 27."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Rodney Howard Brown, a Saudi-African-American who moved to the United States, told attendees at the Tamapta Bay neighbourhood last year that the world’s most vulnerable people were wounded in Louisiana and drink a human blood donation."</seg>
<seg id="8">He stranded more than an hour at the Iqaluit Cathedral for over 100 people.</seg>
<seg id="9">But their information is not for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The entire Arctic right now is tied to the event tonight.</seg>
<seg id="11">"So if you want the light (in the air), please stand here (in the church), or you can leave."</seg>
<seg id="12">"It’s up to you," Hewitt-Brown said of her two-and-a-half hours of work. "</seg>
<seg id="13">About 50 people attended.</seg>
<seg id="14">"I didn’t fly thousands of miles to play.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I didn’t come here to be liked, and I didn’t come here to ask for permission from you... remember: When Jesus died of a heart attack, he asked me to leave the room with people."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Attendees were more Inuit and infants, youth and elders."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Within the church of the Christian Valley church near Iqaluit Ruth Novosti, children race in between chairs."</seg>
<seg id="18">"On the outside, the church and Musk are facing each other over a car park, which is in front of Ted Doug Lake."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Hewitt-Brown’s admission was part of a organized event led by the Bell Partners of the Eastern Arctic Hope Project, based in Ottawa."</seg>
<seg id="20">The organization did not respond to Nunatsiaq News "request for comment.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The Evangelical Mission, which is 119th out of 300 destinations in the community, began after an hour of events."</seg>
<seg id="22">"First, the Iqaluit church choir launched this evening in Iqaluit after the late Evangelical Reverend Louis Arreak, who helped launch the Christian Valerie Church."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Eric Gonzalez, a missionary of the Howard Brown-Ribbon church in Indonesia, gave 40 minutes of testimony to the president."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Louis Arreak, Iqaluit’s Evangelical and songwriter, sings Rodney Howard Brown before he speaks."</seg>
<seg id="25"> (Photo courtesy of Rebel Prime Minister Indonesia) </seg>
<seg id="26">"God loves a gift"</seg>
<seg id="27">Giannis is asking attendees to submit their emails to the Registrar and to comply with Howard Brown’s Instagram post.</seg>
<seg id="28">He handed out a permit to Howard Browne for religious sales.</seg>
<seg id="29">"And he revealed that Howard Brown-Brown will be reading, the Kindergarten Plan, saying he’s talking about the experiences of disadvantaged economies over the last 200 years."</seg>
<seg id="30">"This is about a protester in Crystal, he should be talking about that," Giuliani said. "</seg>
<seg id="31">Giannis then posted a video of the 18-minute Hawaiian-Brown trial.</seg>
<seg id="32">"At the end of the video, Hewitt-Brown prayed that those who donate money to the church in God will be given what they have protected for the soul of the church."</seg>
<seg id="33">"God loves a great gift," Hazlewood Brown said in his video. "I don’t know."</seg>
<seg id="34">Giuliani inspired his parents at the end of the video.</seg>
<seg id="35">"One is a square and one brings together and together we’re celebrating the vegetables, so if you put a chimney in there, it goes to your church."</seg>
<seg id="36">That’s amazing. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"He then hands out a bag and tells these people that he can do" the best gift for the soul, "or financially, to RMI Canada, using a credit card or card."</seg>
<seg id="38">"I keep telling people, don’t let the biggest economy go to the Steel or the new telephone... please use the church for promotion and slavery."</seg>
<seg id="39">Is that what he is saying? "</seg>
<seg id="40">Many people filled and recorded the bag and packaged it into a blue plastic bag.</seg>
<seg id="41">Some people just scratch the bag and hold the bag.</seg>
<seg id="42">One woman grabbed a knife and put it in her pants.</seg>
<seg id="43">The goal of this program is to provide assistance to many countries, including Nunavut, where almost half of the population is dependent on income support, including food insecurity and housing shortages.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Howard Browne did not respond to a request for an interview with Nunatsiaq News, so it is unclear how much he made."</seg>
<seg id="45">Their earnings are no secret to anyone but their website says they train 158 landowners.</seg>
<seg id="46">It also states that people who wish to participate in the aviation subsidy program can be deducted from their income tax.</seg>
<seg id="47">Giannis told attendees to shake hands with their donations to the Riverside church.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Dad, we thank you for this gift, and we thank you for representing your soul, going to our bank accounts," Giannis said. "</seg>
<seg id="49">Three-quarters of them were filled to capacity.</seg>
<seg id="50">Rodney Howard Brown directs the woman on top of her hand when she touches her hand.</seg>
<seg id="51">Reverend Patterk Netser’s best friend</seg>
<seg id="52">"The Rev. Yovanovitch is already founded in Nunavut, escorting most of the communities."</seg>
<seg id="53">"Third-party conferences occur every year and, between the 2000s, they continue to grow."</seg>
<seg id="54">"One participant in this kind of conference, Roger Armstrong, told Nunatsiaq News in 2004 that these conferences are very record-breaking for people whose lives are damaged by violence and abuse."</seg>
<seg id="55">But Haber-Brown’s instruction to spend more money on revitalization and realisation may be new to Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="56">"Patterk Netser, the longest-serving defender of reality religious affairs and now Nunavut’s minister of housing and Nunavut Arctic College, has called Hewitt-Brown’s calls" Saskatchewan’s girlfriend "and told him that climate change is not true."</seg>
<seg id="57">"Mr. Netser did not want to be interviewed by Nunatsiaq News but he said," Ronnie is my friend and we talk to each other. "</seg>
<seg id="58">"When asked to respond to Hewitt-Brown on a number of occasions in the media about the obstruction of justice, it also suggested that the U.S. Supreme Court should shoot down the U.S. Constitution because it’s inappropriate," Netser said. "I don’t care about what happens in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="59">My main concern is my constituents and Nunavummiut. "</seg>

<seg id="61">"Tonight’s Light on Ice"</seg>
<seg id="62">"After an hour of events, Hayward Brown – the main focus – went to the missionary."</seg>
<seg id="63">"It’s going to be light tonight on the ice," the missionary said of more than 100 people, with more people, at different ages. "</seg>
<seg id="64">"If you don’t want the light, just run to the door where you can."</seg>
<seg id="65">"In the hour, Hazlewood Brown’s voice gets quiet and quiet."</seg>
<seg id="66">He stops talking about what’s going to happen and he leads me to say what’s going to happen.</seg>
<seg id="67">"I know I didn’t feel like I was living in Africa, so I did that because my parents kept me in the door, never let me go," she said to the crowd. "</seg>
<seg id="68">"Moses was the first person in the office (Douglas).</seg>
<seg id="69">The first one broke down and he had to go back and pick up another one.</seg>
<seg id="70">And Adamie and Evie were the first carvings of Abbott. "</seg>
<seg id="71">"Hewitt-Brown became famous, in particular, for laughing at meetings where attendees would laugh."</seg>
<seg id="72">"His grandson was approached for breathing at the age of two, he laughed for 12 minutes and didn’t quit, Howard Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="73">Hewitt-Brown has repeatedly complained to other Evangelicals about their pride in the world.</seg>
<seg id="74">It’s called the Tamapta Mandate, which makes religious behaviour worse.</seg>
<seg id="75">"Arreak, a Iqaluit Evangelical and singer-songwriter who assisted in this incident, used to laugh at members of the family when he was ordained."</seg>
<seg id="76">"This is not a funeral, why are people saddened?"</seg>
<seg id="77">Hewitt-Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="78">Mr. Arreak is laughing.</seg>
<seg id="79">"We’re serving Jesus and he’s alive."</seg>
<seg id="80">Mr. Arreak has a quiet laugh.</seg>
<seg id="81">"I like the attorney general," said Arreak, whose bedroom is more loud. "</seg>
<seg id="82">Hewitt-Brown has a laugh with other people and they’re just laughing.</seg>
<seg id="83">"We’re very happy.</seg>
<seg id="84">"Please be happy to be able to get in the water, from the reservoirs to the limit."</seg>
<seg id="85">Mr. Arreak’s bedroom suddenly fell off the roof of the house.</seg>
<seg id="86">"This is real.</seg>
<seg id="87">No one will be arrested this evening. "</seg>
<seg id="88">"Mr. Arreak, the Nunatsiaq News reporter tells the media that he doesn’t want to say anything, he’s laughing."</seg>
<seg id="89">"Howard Brown-Brown also spoke in unclear language, saying the word was understood in the Indigenous language by Barbara Nielsen’s missionary."</seg>
<seg id="90">"Mam-N-R-Ida.</seg>
<seg id="91">"Ran-Bombardier," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="92">Rodney Howard Brown invites guests to the church’s walls to get a light bulb.</seg>
<seg id="93">Some of them don’t have glasses.</seg>
<seg id="94">But many of Hezbollah’s Brown-Brown’s rhetoric is unpleasant and unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="95">They suddenly broke down in tears before he was ordained.</seg>
<seg id="96">"Before he touched down on the unmarked attendees, Hazlewood Brown complained to two people before they left."</seg>
<seg id="97">"Where are you going with Brady?</seg>
<seg id="98">H.</seg>
<seg id="99">Hi!</seg>
<seg id="100">Are you leaving? "</seg>
<seg id="101">Hewitt-Brown says one man has no voice when he leaves the church.</seg>
<seg id="102">"After they came in, they took a picture and got out of the phone?"</seg>
<seg id="103">You’re a reporter for daily newspapers here? "</seg>
<seg id="104">Attendees laughed.</seg>
<seg id="105">"I don’t know how I would regret it if I grabbed him and returned... to find out who he was and why he was taking photographs and why he was leaving," said one of his staff. "</seg>
<seg id="106">"I asked them to go to your desk after the game, Hazlewood Brown suddenly grabbed two women in the chairs because they didn’t like their next look."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Have you been alive again?</seg>
<seg id="108">"What are you, Joseph Whitney?"</seg>
<seg id="109">Attendees are laughing.</seg>
<seg id="110">"I’ve never seen people sitting in the boundary that can’t change.</seg>
<seg id="111">"So you can scratch through others, or maybe you’re better than others."</seg>
<seg id="112">The two women stood up and went out.</seg>
<seg id="113">"I’m just trying to ask a question.</seg>
<seg id="114">"As I do, it’s my duty."</seg>
<seg id="115">I know what the Inuit body is like.</seg>
<seg id="116">Don’t do anything for me.</seg>
<seg id="117">It’s not funny.</seg>
<seg id="118">The entire Arctic right now is connected to the event tonight. "</seg>
<seg id="119">Action staff are calling on attendees to avoid taking photographs and recording them.</seg>
<seg id="120">"However, they took photographs of the whole process."</seg>
<seg id="121">When the Habitat for Humanity Brown touches them and the photographs are very close to them.</seg>
<seg id="122">"Photographs of the Riverside church on Instagram show a large number of attendees at the scene – their faces injured in the scene, on the ice, their mountains, or on the floor."</seg>
<seg id="123">Lady Haber-Brown’s hand is crying on the floor below the table.</seg>
<seg id="124">"In front of him, Howard Brown-Brown and his staff are going to have an impact on the couple."</seg>
<seg id="125">This event was directed to St. Jude.</seg>
<seg id="126">"This event was originally intended to be held at St. Jude’s Anglican Cathedral in Iqaluit, but it was changed."</seg>
<seg id="127">"That change was switched from guests to Hewitt-Brown, Secretary of State Joamie said."</seg>
<seg id="128">"David Parsons, the Anglican Bishop of the Arctic, said he did not know that Howard Browne would be the goalie of St. Jude."</seg>
<seg id="129">"If he knew it, he said he would have stopped it because Hayward Brown seemed to be too much."</seg>
<seg id="130">"As a result, the community of Anglican did not comply with the requirement to receive permission from the Bishop, Parsons said."</seg>
<seg id="131">"The Anglican Cathedral works with a familiar sense of sensitivity, and works with other prayers, Parsons said."</seg>
<seg id="132">"But there’s confidence in each other, and it doesn’t work out that it wouldn’t be appropriate for religious and religious people to go there."</seg>
<seg id="133">It appears that the Habitat for Human-Brown program is a separate program.</seg>
<seg id="134">"I am not here to pursue religious aspirations.</seg>
<seg id="135">"If religion was a northerner, it would have taken place in the Arctic," he said to attendees. "</seg>
<seg id="136">"I don’t get an invitation.</seg>
<seg id="137">"Due to need... If you have a good light, you have to be welcomed."</seg>

<seg id="1">"In absence of attendance, Canada launches a new Arctic policy document"</seg>
<seg id="2">Liberal Democrats say this new policy reflects a "huge shift in direction"</seg>
<seg id="3">"Many farmers grew up in Cape Dorset, Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="4">"With the federal government tomorrow to announce the nomination, the Liberal government released a long-awaited Arctic policy framework."</seg>
<seg id="5"> (File photo) </seg>
<seg id="6">By Jim Bell</seg>
<seg id="7">"Just a day before the national election campaign began, the Liberal government, with little attendance, launched a long-awaited northern and northern policy framework on September 10."</seg>
<seg id="8">"This document, which reveals the first phase of the continuation of the event, will replace former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s 2009 Northern Strategy and Harper’s government’s 2010 Statement on Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is intended to guide the federal government’s policy in the Arctic by 2030 but there are no implementation plans or political direction for future actions.</seg>
<seg id="10">"These will take place in a second phase, the strategy says."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Despite all this, this is a start from Carolyn Bennett, the minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs, who said this policy document reflects a" significant shift in direction to the federal government. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The introduction of this policy has been delayed as expected.</seg>
<seg id="13">"This winter, Bennett announced that the policy would be released in June."</seg>
<seg id="14">CBC News reported earlier this month that a news conference in Yellowknife was cancelled in August.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The Liberal Democratic Party has eight" goals, "including a proposal, and 10 (10) " principles. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"They discuss a wide range of policy issues, including community and regional economic development, infrastructure, Indigenous rights, environmental protection, national security and foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="17">"When Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, on December 20, 2016, when he announced his government’s intention to create a new policy, he insisted that a" co-ordination "would be done with northern governments and Indigenous organizations."</seg>
<seg id="18">"As a result, more than 25 Indigenous groups, including the Government of Nunavut, the Northwest Territories, the Yukon, Manitoba, Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador, joined the creation."</seg>
<seg id="19">"In collaboration with Canada’s Arctic and Arctic policy framework, our partners helped us understand and raise awareness of the unprecedented challenges and challenges facing diverse regions, responsibilities and land rights across the Arctic," Bennett said in a news release. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"And some of the partners wrote their findings, which were posted in a separate policy document."</seg>
<seg id="21">Some comments do not mention federal policy</seg>
<seg id="22">"For example, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the Government of Nunavut, the Government of the Northwest Territories and the three territorial governments have shared their own personal words."</seg>
<seg id="23">But there’s something happening.</seg>
<seg id="24">These articles submitted by stakeholders may not be able to represent the federal government’s policy.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is a sign that the federal government may face a conflict of interest that would approve more than 31 partners.</seg>
<seg id="26">"While the transcripts are part of the process, they are not entirely clear on the views of the federal government or any other party," the action document said. "</seg>
<seg id="27">The document also states that the approval process was difficult.</seg>
<seg id="28">"Attitudes, aspirations and goals and aspirations are at the table with many thoughts and opinions."</seg>
<seg id="29">This means that there are agreements between the federal government and the aboriginal people involved in the process of getting approval. "</seg>
<seg id="30">You can find a link to Arctic policy in this article.</seg>
<seg id="31">8 goals</seg>
<seg id="32">"Here are eight goals in the strategy, reflecting the federal government’s commitment."</seg>
<seg id="33">"Strong, reliable, diverse and sustainable communities and regional economies."</seg>
<seg id="34">• Canada’s Arctic and northern Indigenous peoples must remain vigilant and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="35">• Canada’s Arctic and northern Inuit are safe and secure.</seg>
<seg id="36">• A stronger institution where diversity in Canada can be restructured.</seg>
<seg id="37">• The legislation relies on the Arctic as an effective tool for innovative approaches and opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="38">• Knowledge and understanding strategies for decision-making.</seg>
<seg id="39">• Canada’s Arctic and Arctic livelihoods are healthy and sustainable.</seg>
<seg id="40">• Strength is helping to maintain and build confidence among Indigenous and non-Indigenous people.</seg>
<seg id="41">The objective starts with a variety of "projects" that have been redefined.</seg>
<seg id="42">Ten principles</seg>
<seg id="43">"In order to fulfill these objectives and objectives, the policy document outlines the principles under which, which are designed to" continue to guide the implementation of the mandate ":</seg>
<seg id="44">"The decisions about the Arctic will be made in collaboration and involvement with the circumpolar region, while the rights exist, needs and interests of the Arctic."</seg>
<seg id="45">"The rights and positions of federal, provincial, provincial and territorial governments will be respected."</seg>
<seg id="46">"The development must be used and believed, socially, culturally, economically and environmentally."</seg>
<seg id="47">"The merging of Indigenous peoples continues, using the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission as a starting point, would succeed."</seg>
<seg id="48">"As climate change plays a critical role in this land, action will be taken on a wide range of stakeholders, including the impact on Indigenous peoples, who continue to rely on land and wildlife for their cultural, economic and food security."</seg>
<seg id="49">"The policy and delivery will symbolize inequality and equality, and enforce resources such as the German / Basic Anti-Semitism Polytechnique (Getty Images) that will be used to measure the potential impacts of diverse populations."</seg>
<seg id="50">"The purpose of this exercise is to consider a wide range of foundational initiatives such as rights, aspirations and circumstances for Inuit, Arctic Indigenous and Indigenous Indigenous peoples and Indigenous people to be respected, defined and implemented."</seg>
<seg id="51">"The Government of Canada recognizes Inuit, Indigenous and Indigenous Indigenous peoples of Canada, in the form of diverse, empowering communities, with their own experiences, including the federal government."</seg>
<seg id="52">"• Work to work together based on the right, respectful, collaborative approach that reflects the needs, priorities and circumstances of each person."</seg>
<seg id="53">"All organizations, from the private sector to universities and colleges, such as non-profit organizations, community organizations and individuals across Canada, have a vital role to play in building a stronger Canadian Arctic."</seg>

<seg id="6">"The Nunavut Conservative candidate says that if the Conservative Party were to become a government, it would eliminate the carbon tax because it" increases the cost of everything. "</seg>
<seg id="7">Leona Aglukkaq began her campaign in the Nunavut communities.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Nunavut legislature began its campaign in Iqaluit at an event held Sept. 12 at the Frobisher Hotel.</seg>
<seg id="9">He later flew to Rankin Inlet the next day before returning to Iqaluit next week.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nunatsiaq News was able to talk to Ms. Aglukkaq when she was in Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The carbon tax" raises the cost of flying, buying, shipping, hunting and homeownership, "says Ms. Aglukkaq’s campaign poster."</seg>
<seg id="12">Ms. Aglukkaq also told Nunatsiaq News that the tax credit has a negative impact on daycares and elders "homes on the increase in heating fuel.</seg>
<seg id="13">"All products are affected by this dust tax."</seg>
<seg id="14">Ms. Aglukkaq said.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The carbon tax that we can’t afford to pay is like a computer that can’t get into a house."</seg>
<seg id="16">"But George Hickes, Nunavut’s finance minister, announced in May that through an agreement in Ottawa, lighting and aviation fuel in Nunavut has belonged to this tax exemption."</seg>
<seg id="17">The Government of Nunavut and its subsidiaries pay half of the carbon tax to Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Ms. Aglukkaq’s campaigns for Nunavut have four priorities: Affordability, housing, mental health and employment."</seg>
<seg id="19">"How can the government and the private sector and the Government of Nunavut work together to address this massive housing crisis across the Arctic?"</seg>
<seg id="20">"The housing minister’s campaign’s priority is to create a strategy that includes housing needs, elders" housing and disabled housing. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"The federal and territorial governments must also take into account the increased incentives for self-reliance, he said."</seg>
<seg id="22">Ms. Aglukkaq also pointed to Arctic infrastructure and mental health training for Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Nunavut is a vast territory with good coastal waters in Canada and we are still left behind by the need to invest in marine infrastructure in our communities, so we have to think about big strategies like this in the Arctic," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"We must address the need for housing, train Nunavummiut to provide mental health services to our communities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"When asked if he would convince the federal government about the Nutrition North Canada Program, Ms. Aglukkaq said the carbon tax has increased the cost of food through the increase in freight rates."</seg>
<seg id="26">"When asked if he thinks that the business is on the road, and if not, what he would do other than the carbon tax, he said he would consult with the Arctic Council."</seg>
<seg id="27">"He said that if the Kazakhstan government became a government, that council would always exist."</seg>
<seg id="28">"It is important that there are people in the Arctic who can tell the government how to improve the program.</seg>
<seg id="29">This is a terrible project.</seg>
<seg id="30">Everything is not very good in the world.</seg>

<seg id="32">"Ms. Aglukkaq was reluctant to specify what to say about the Nutrition North Canada Program, but said there should be a subsidy for food and the" removal "would not help."</seg>
<seg id="33">"Recently, a study published in the National Institute of Health published in the Journal of the National Institute of Health found that food intake is far more difficult in Nunavut than in the Arctic through nutrition, according to a study published in the Canadian Community Health Research Institute."</seg>

<seg id="37">"No," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="38">"When Conservative leader Andrew Scheer came to Iqaluit last June, he insisted Nunavut should create a recycling program, saying it was" impossible "under the current Liberal government."</seg>

<seg id="42">"It is already designed to meet the needs of how projects should be done.</seg>
<seg id="43">And it has become a political issue and we have to be proud of it.</seg>
<seg id="44">"And the decisions about the Arctic must come from the Inuit of the Arctic, not from Ottawa."</seg>
<seg id="45">"Ms. Aglukkaq left the headquarters and went to Pond Inlet and Arctic Bay on September 19, her office said."</seg>

<seg id="3">"Nunavut’s new polar bear management plan sets out a balance between male and female polar bears in all of Nunavut’s polar bear populations, said the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board."</seg>

<seg id="5">By Jane George</seg>
<seg id="6">Cambridge Bay – The Government of Nunavut agrees to a new polar bear management plan.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported by the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board members at the Kitikmeot Wildlife Board meeting in Cambridge Bay last week.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The introduction of the new polar bear management plan is a combination of male and female polar bears in Nunavut, the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board’s chairman, Dan Shewchuk, told delegates."</seg>
<seg id="9">"The meeting in Cambridge Bay is the first of three regional NWMB meetings between him and Jason Akeeagok, the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board’s executive director, to attend."</seg>
<seg id="10">Akeeagok said the polar bear management plan was "very active."</seg>
<seg id="11">"We’re going to do what we can to make sure that this does not happen before the polar bear hunt," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"This plan has been under consideration for nearly five years, which was announced in a plan to develop this last March in Iqaluit at the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board meeting."</seg>
<seg id="13">The plan will be in place by 2029.</seg>
<seg id="14">This female polar bear fell into the ocean near Arctic Bay when the four floors were watching.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Under the new polar bear management plan, the threat of polar bear moratorium in three communities would lead to a loss of voice."</seg>
<seg id="16"> (Photo courtesy of Niore Iqalukjuak) </seg>
<seg id="17">"In all the circumpolar countries in the 19th century the polar bear population, 12 are more in Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="18">Polar bear quotas have been set by region (e.g. male polar bear) between the polar bears – and the moratorium on polar bear protection are included in the year-round polar bear quotas set by the communities.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Although the new plan will not increase the total allowable harvest at this time, a new combination of the total allowable harvest may take into account the new collection."</seg>
<seg id="20">"As per our previous plan, Nunavut communities were allowed to harvest at least one female polar bear with a total allowable harvest of two male polar bears per year through local polar bear tags."</seg>
<seg id="21">"This was done only in the Davis Strait area for polar bears, where there is a balance between female and female polar bears, and under this new plan, it doesn’t matter whether the polar bear population in Nunavut is male or female but they have to be balanced."</seg>
<seg id="22">The next name on the list would be half a tags.</seg>
<seg id="23">This new combination of male / female polar bear quotas could be achieved if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The increasing number of polar bears in the communities has been a concern in Nunavut after the death of two polar bears in the Kivalliq region last year – however, under the current management plan, protecting the killing of a polar bear which is female, it will result in two tags."</seg>
<seg id="25">That’s why some communities don’t have tags to protect the polar bears.</seg>
<seg id="26">"This new plan could prevent communities from importing polar bears, Susan told Nunatsiaq News."</seg>
<seg id="27">"But he previously said that the polar bears that go to the destination are shocked by Inuit culture and lifestyle, because they destroy cabins, birds and seals."</seg>
<seg id="28">Attendees at the meeting in Cambridge Bay welcomed the changes to the polar bear management plan.</seg>
<seg id="29">They were also pleased that the dogs will soon have five more tags for grizzly bears.</seg>
<seg id="30">There was a massive gunshot that was shot and that was too close to the cabins here in Mount Palluq.</seg>
<seg id="31">"On the other hand, on the new polar bear management plan they may have a different perspective."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Polar bears" futures are unclear because of climate change, according to a 2018 study by the Standing Committee on the COSEWIC. This committee, the type of species that may disappear in Canada (COSEWIC), further examined polar bears as a "major concern."</seg>
<seg id="33">It means that polar bears are at risk or at risk of disappearing as a result of a combination of livestock and specified threats.</seg>

<seg id="1">Inuktut 142-foot – Developments and Progress</seg>
<seg id="2">Our contribution today to our children and future generations</seg>
<seg id="3">The Roman orthography is a syllabic writing system for all Inuit languages across Canada.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami has stated that it will not replace the syllabics and the Inuit Nunangat region’s traditional syllabics and so on.</seg>
<seg id="5">Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami has also said that Inuit traditional writing systems will not have to change.</seg>
<seg id="6">By Methuselah (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I was honoured to hear that the Joint Task Force of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami unanimously approved the new Inuktut symbol, named after the Inuktut Roman orthography of the 142nd anniversary of this video."</seg>
<seg id="8">The Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami means the "unity of Canada’s ordinary people" and there are few good examples of the younger generations of our people who have worked together for a long time to survive and our culture and language.</seg>
<seg id="9">That is something that I am interested in at this point in time.</seg>
<seg id="10">"In June of 2011 when I was the President of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, we had an opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to modernizing our education system."</seg>
<seg id="11">"We launched a nationwide effort to ensure that single-handedly 140-century education in 10 innovative and innovative ways in which we create a collective vision for our children to have the skills they need in their education, our 140s and our language."</seg>
<seg id="12">Our 143 recommendations included the establishment of a standardized public registration system.</seg>
<seg id="13">Single-handedly 140 Canadians have for decades achieved this goal and achieved the goal of a new era.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Innuinaqtut 140kg Uqausinginnik Taiguusiliuqtiit in every community in the Inuit Nunangat held the Inuktut Roman orthography.</seg>
<seg id="15">This means that we will have one writing system in place for all people to learn their language effectively.</seg>
<seg id="16">The use of this new system will continue to grow faster.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The Gaga Innuinaqtut 140s will not replace and will not replace community historical records, as it is a tool to participate in the Taiguusiliuqtiit System as an enhancement to the Innuinaqtut 140s communications network."</seg>
<seg id="18">Our contribution today is to our children and the next generation.</seg>
<seg id="19">I can now imagine that a single group of 140 Canadians will be able to communicate with each other and share the paintings with each other so that they can use the writing system and provide a good education system to worry about the 140s and our children from the high school to be able to use the language of instruction.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We face global developments in the face of humanitarian and non-Inuit traditions that have led to the deterioration of our way of life, our families, our culture, and our language."</seg>
<seg id="21">But today we are here.</seg>
<seg id="22">Over the past few years we have had to review our experiences to find out who we are today and what we are today at 144 / 143.</seg>
<seg id="23">I believe that we are now in a situation where we are going to have to look back at the 14th century or are we going to be able to look at the future.</seg>
<seg id="24">The use of Inuktut at 142 feet in Canada’s public life makes me understand that we want to move forward as a unified society.</seg>
<seg id="25">"In the 144th century when we started developing a national campaign for Inuit education, we were able to deliver the word" 143 in Inuktut "to mean every single citizen’s language, regardless of where they came from."</seg>
<seg id="26">To me that gives me the opportunity to see the single population of 140 per cent of the population, and then we can get to the point where we are able to do all of the things that are not true in terms of the barriers.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Our language and identity is preserved, our language is healthy."</seg>
<seg id="28">I am hopeful that we will be able to use Inuktut as a whole in terms of language and writing and moving forward with the 144km / h partnership that we are trying to do with the land claims that we are trying to do as a society.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Mayor Simon was the former president of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami in 2011 when they unveiled the national goal of Inuit education, which included a recommendation to create a single writing system for the Inuit language."</seg>

<seg id="2">"This is a lot of work"</seg>
<seg id="3">Students walk four foxes from Iqaluit on Sept. 27 to participate in a global climate change protest.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three political candidates for the federal government said they intend to ban Nunavut’s diesel fuel consumption by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="5"> (Photo courtesy of Dustin Bauer) </seg>
<seg id="6">By Dustin Bauer</seg>
<seg id="7">"During this federal election, three political parties said Nunavut’s use of diesel fuel will be halted by 2030."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Currently all 25 communities in Nunavut have electricity generated by diesel generators operated by the Qulliq Energy Corporation, the only electricity provider in Canada that does not have any renewable energy sources in their communities."</seg>
<seg id="9">Changing that would be a huge and costly project.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This is a tremendous effort," said Martha Leno, Arctic recycling specialist for the World Wildlife Fund. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"It’s probably possible, just a little bit."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Green Party’s campaign promises to "implement a renewable energy system.</seg>
<seg id="13">"By 2030, all Canadian electricity will go through the recycling process."</seg>
<seg id="14">This includes outpost camps in the Arctic communities that are banned from using diesel fuel for electricity. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"The Liberal Party has said it will" move forward financially to ensure that the Inuit communities of Tel Aviv are banned from fossil fuels but will have the power to use clean, renewable energy sources – such as wind, wind and solar power – by 2030. "</seg>
<seg id="16">The New Democratic Party (NDP) said it would "target Canada’s ability to generate greenhouse gas emissions from non-carbon dioxide by 2030... This reduction in carbon dioxide emissions will lead to community emissions and job creation.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We would contribute to initiatives such as community-owned and managed clean energy projects to provide employment for residents and the skilled, and to work with Indigenous and Arctic communities to eliminate the use of diesel fuel."</seg>
<seg id="18">"According to the Environment and Climate Change Canada report released earlier this year, greenhouse gas emissions in Nunavut are less than 1 per cent of this effect."</seg>
<seg id="19">"In 2017, Nunavut produced a total of 0.6 megawatts of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide), equivalent to 18,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide."</seg>
<seg id="20">"That year, Aberdeen, which is the country’s most carbon footprint, produced about 84 million hectares of carbon dioxide."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Despite this, Nunavut has seen carbon dioxide emissions rise by more than 30 per cent since 2005, with the largest increase in Canada and Alberta almost doubling, which is the second highest increase in the same period."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Despite the energy changes that the three MPs are trying to make to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions, the impact on Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions will still be very small."</seg>
<seg id="23">That is what the community is getting.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Nunavummiut pay the largest electricity rate in all other parts of the country, and funding for energy would reduce that."</seg>
<seg id="25">"However, action on renewable energy projects such as this may be inconsistent with the expenditure of existing utilities."</seg>
<seg id="26">"Last month, the World Wildlife Organization released a report outlining how renewable energy could generate electricity in each of the 25 communities in Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="27">"They found that a reduction of 8 per cent – primarily due to the risk of a project or other sources of funding – in Baker Lake, Coral Harbour, Iqaluit and Rankin Inlet would save up to 20 per cent on renewable energy, including an automatic payment of about 15 years."</seg>
<seg id="28">The survey also identified 16 other communities with a 4 per cent subsidy – roughly the Qulliq Energy Corporation’s potential loan limit – and roughly $2 million in benefits and a 20 per cent net transfer.</seg>
<seg id="29">"But the report only refers to how capable these projects are, suggesting that transferring a renewable energy source would be cheaper than the current power rates."</seg>
<seg id="30">But transferring local talent into renewable energy would be a great deal of work.</seg>
<seg id="31">"There would have to be consultations, and they would have to start next year in order to meet the energy needs of all the communities," said Leno. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"They would have to go to the communities, work with them on what they want to do, and how the communities envision energy, to find out what their priorities are and the communities that are most important to the outfitters and wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="33">"This does not include the creation of a collection of materials for solar or wind, which would take two years to collect, or work for the Qulliq Energy Corporation to ensure that renewable energy is connected to its resources."</seg>
<seg id="34">"Transferring 100 per cent of all communities from renewable energy to renewable energy, which the three parties claim to be politically responsible, would not only be a waste of time but also a significant amount of money."</seg>
<seg id="35">"The New Democratic Party (NDP) and the Liberal Democrats have not yet announced how much they would contribute to the transfer, the Green Party (Green Party) said last week."</seg>
<seg id="36">"As part of the campaign’s expenditure report, the Green Party said it would contribute $150 million over five years to the relocation of all outpost camps and northern communities – not just in Nunavut – to reduce fuel consumption."</seg>
<seg id="37">It’s not acceptable.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Lennie explained that if communities like Arctic Bay were to relocate at least 60 percent of their electricity, they would have to spend about $27.8 million."</seg>
<seg id="39">"According to the same report, for other communities that will try to use 60 per cent of renewable energy, they will have to use it at a higher level."</seg>
<seg id="40">"In Iqaluit, it is estimated that it would cost about $148 million."</seg>
<seg id="41">"Although it is clear that it is less than the $250-500 million that would have been spent on energy than previously thought in the city, this would apply to one community that the Green Party wants to contribute."</seg>
<seg id="42">"Lynch doesn’t expect the federal government to pay for all of these projects, but they also said the task force and how it would work and it would be difficult to do so."</seg>
<seg id="43">"Given the 2030 deadline, there won’t be much time."</seg>
<seg id="44">"In terms of solar energy, I think it could take two to five years."</seg>
<seg id="45">"In terms of wind energy, I think it would take five to seven years," said Lennon when asked how much energy they would do. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"In comparison to these deadlines, broken down by 25 communities and at the same time, if they’re going to be dealt with in remote communities and the land is not always available, Lionel thinks how it’s going to be done.</seg>
<seg id="47">"I think for those who want to get there, that’s going to be a big change."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Even if we don’t get 100 percent, then there’s a lot of interest."</seg>
<seg id="49">"Note: This article refers to the federal election campaigns of the Green Party, the Liberal Party and the New Democratic Party (NDP)."</seg>
<seg id="50">"In the development of this book, the Conservative Party has not yet announced its candidacy, so they are not included in this report."</seg>

<seg id="1">Subject: Internal Early Childhood and Daycare Issues</seg>
<seg id="2">We must recognize that the value of early childhood education and childcare workers in Nunavut is vital to our employees.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Lakuluk Wilson Patrick, the chair of the Footprints Daycare Board, is seeking more support from the Government of Nunavut for quality early childhood education and child care based on Inuit language and culture."</seg>
<seg id="4">By Nunatsiaq News</seg>
<seg id="5">Letter to Nunavut Premier Joe Savikataaq and Minister of Education, David Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="6">I am one of the people who are craving our language and culture who are very sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="7">"As the Chair of the Board of Directors of the Football Studies Centre, Inuktut is the only school for children with early childhood education in Iqaluit and is the only one in Iqaluit where we have a facility in Nunavut that provides daycare services for children who already speak Inuktitut."</seg>
<seg id="8">"The Footprints Space Centre was closed on August 21, 2019 due to a shortage of staff and again, it has been in operation for almost a year."</seg>
<seg id="9">"There are very few people applying for jobs at the Footprints Shelter because of the low pay (in Iqaluit, the highest cost of childcare), employees who don’t have any benefits, they don’t have housing because they’re being looked at like a lady’s job at the daycare is being looked at."</seg>
<seg id="10">"The daycare is now open again, but the urgency of the operation is stressful: We lost a very good employee and he resigned."</seg>
<seg id="11">"We now have a part-time office worker, full-time child care coordinator, two child care workers and each parent who work at the daycare (to ensure that all of them are probable and safe), full-time staff, while we are looking for a full-time, qualified child care worker."</seg>
<seg id="12">"This process is not normal, but for those of us who have children, we believe that our children should be safe and able to speak in Inuktitut so that the question can be opened."</seg>
<seg id="13">There is still a risk that the door will remain closed.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Nunavut’s daycares" operations currently under the non-profit category. Childcare workers are expected to one of the most important areas for a child relating to providing quality early childhood education, based on Inuit culture and language, despite the low cost and lack of support. "</seg>
<seg id="15">The not-for-profit organization relies on a number of factors, such as shortfalls in annual funding, as well as the number of parents who volunteer to manage the daycare at the Early Childhood Education Centre.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Childcare workers tend to live in poverty due to lack of pay and benefits, without adequate training for their jobs and housing for staff."</seg>
<seg id="17">Childcare workers are now being asked to work in the aftermath of their needs for self-reliance or family maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="18">There is a lot of stress in our daycares because of the need for specialized staff to have the skills to promote and preserve the Inuit language and culture in the age of our children; the Footprints only hire Inuktitut speakers.</seg>
<seg id="19">We have 100 percent Inuit employment.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, due to the turnover of our staff, we have been struggling with staff shortages due to the lack of competitive pay and benefits for our employees.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Therefore, it affects early childhood and early childhood education."</seg>
<seg id="22">Inuit deserve the full support and value of our language and culture so that they can be taught to our children.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Government of Nunavut must consider ways to better support early childhood education and ensure that the daycare is based on Inuit language and culture.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Effective early childhood education and child care workers are paid to compete with the public and receive benefits, including housing for their job, vacation, training in the workplace and in the school."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Footprints dream of expanding the daycare into the public domain and increasing the resources to accommodate more Inuit children.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We have now been looking for a larger, day-care facility in order to achieve this vision, so we have raised close to $80,000 for a new facility."</seg>
<seg id="27">It proposes that the following amendments be made to the Government of Nunavut:</seg>
<seg id="28">"The consolidation of early childhood and childcare staff as part of the Government of Nunavut’s collective bargaining process;</seg>
<seg id="29">• Include the operations and maintenance of daycares in Nunavut within the education system;</seg>
<seg id="30">"Provide support to early childhood and childcare workers but not limited to short-term costs including long-term medical leave, VTA, two bilingual bonuses, parental leave and housing"</seg>
<seg id="31">• establish an organization to support all daycares in Nunavut;</seg>
<seg id="32">• Work with daycares to address urgent challenges together so that we can develop a long-term plan for the operation of daycares.</seg>
<seg id="33">We must recognize that the value of early childhood education and childcare workers in Nunavut is vital to our employees.</seg>
<seg id="34">To ensure that our daycares have adequate staff to fill all of the vacant positions and that all employees receive benefits.</seg>
<seg id="35">We have to keep our daycares open.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Changes to the operations of the early childhood education and childcare system will allow Nunavut’s early childhood and childcare workers to gain valuable experience in their careers. This will allow them to take the necessary steps to ensure that early childhood and daycare operations change in the best interests of the lives of children, including the ability to learn Inuktut language, build a strong foundation for Inuit culture, and participate fully in Canada."</seg>

<seg id="4">"Along with Louis Tapardjuk, a member of the Inuit Uqausinginnik Taiguusiliuqtiit, the Nunavut Language Authority."</seg>
<seg id="5">Even though there were no interpreters, they kept talking in Inuktitut.</seg>

<seg id="7">By Lisa Gregory not permanently used by Nunatsiaq News</seg>
<seg id="8">"At the Montreal Boarding Home there was a lot of silence on Thursday, Oct. 3, when Inuit attended the 21st Inuit Cultural Education Conference to hear the two Inuit leaders talk about why Inuktut is a Nunavut Inuit rights and that authority was rejected."</seg>
<seg id="9">"NTI President Aluki Kotierk and Louis Tapardjuk, the former Government of Nunavut minister and member of the Inuit Uqausinginnik Taiguusiliuqtiit, the Nunavut Language Authority, attended the event on time and sat in front of the chairs of Inuit."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Photographers are organizing an exhibition on NTI’s Facebook page, which features videos of a wide range of internet connections for English-speaking speakers, and attendees were mostly Inuinnaqtun speakers."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Kotierk welcomed the attendees and began speaking in Inuktitut, with those who speak Inuktitut sometimes accepting their heads and applauding."</seg>
<seg id="12">"But for those who can’t speak Inuktitut, including this writer, they just sat in their eyes."</seg>
<seg id="13">Some people just walked out.</seg>
<seg id="14">Some of them are just trying to listen to the telephone system that they’re going to be waiting for in English.</seg>
<seg id="15">There was no English version.</seg>
<seg id="16">Welcome to the beautiful community of many people in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="17">"It’s called Inuit culture education so it was like, especially when we were talking about the Inuit language, we wanted to use the Inuit language," Kotierk said at the beginning. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"Louie and I spoke about this and we know that there will be no interpreters but we felt that it was very important to use our language when we talk about the need to support and promote our language development."</seg>
<seg id="19">"The United Nations Conference, which brings together Arctic experts from the circumpolar region and the south, in recent years, began to involve more Inuktut speakers and activists, making the conference more responsive to the needs of Inuit and increasing the role of Inuit and non-Inuit educators."</seg>
<seg id="20">"This Inuktitut symposium, in regards to language rights, seemed to be in the process of developing that."</seg>
<seg id="21">Kotierk’s testimony highlights the many pieces of legislation that need to be introduced and protected in Inuktut in Nunavut where there are more Inuit and more speakers in Inuktut.</seg>
<seg id="22">"These laws come from the United Nations (United Nations) on the Constitution of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (Indigenous Peoples) to the Confederation of Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the National Inquiry into Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls, and the Nunavut Act."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Kotierk described many of the recent deaths of Inuit, partly, in the area of language and cultural docks, such as Annie Kootou, who died due to the disease in 2017, and this 15-year-old Elaine Kooneeloosie, who died of tuberculosis in the same year."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Inuit want a right to life and they have a right to life.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Canadians should not die due to the lack of access and services in comparison to other Canadians," Kotierk wrote in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="26">"In his opening remarks, Mr. Tapardjuk spoke about the recent incident in Iqaluit where officers went to the elders to say that their adopted son had been vaccinated at the youth centre."</seg>
<seg id="27">This woman is a single woman and does not speak English.</seg>
<seg id="28">Mr. Tapardjuk said the police had to stop the vehicle and ask for help to inform them of the bad news.</seg>
<seg id="29">"There are a number of things that could have been done through this story that could have been done in this case. Does the person have an assistant to help them change their lifestyle? They didn’t even have an interpreter," Kotierk told Nunatsiaq News. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"Many Inuit who speak English and Inuktitut are invited to do so.</seg>
<seg id="31">"We are thought to be able to interpret at some point, even if we don’t know the people."</seg>
<seg id="32">Sometimes it’s confidential.</seg>
<seg id="33">"So, in that way, I can say that it’s a violation of human rights."</seg>
<seg id="34">"Kotierk said at least that Inuktut speakers in Nunavut should have access to professional services in their language in the areas of health, justice and education."</seg>
<seg id="35">They’re not even available.</seg>
<seg id="36">That and other leaders continue to call on the federal government to protect their language and lifestyle in their homes.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ottawa passed a new Indigenous language legislation in June that criticized NTI and Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami for saying their decisions have been ignored.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Kotierk told people to know," We are the authorities. "</seg>
<seg id="39">Let’s speak in Inuktitut when we go to the store.</seg>
<seg id="40">Let’s speak Inuktitut when we go to the bank.</seg>
<seg id="41">Let’s speak Inuktitut when we go to school.</seg>
<seg id="42">"When we start speaking in Inuktut and don’t take into account those who don’t understand, then they will be able to receive a larger portion of the requirement."</seg>

<seg id="1">Qikiqtani Inuit Association announces compensation for tourism operators for Inuit Nunangat</seg>
<seg id="2">Expenditure automatically</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tourism operators who visit the islands of Nunavut will now have to pay tourism bills if they want to access Inuit Nunangat, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association announced at its annual general meeting in Iqaluit on Oct. 8 to 10."</seg>
<seg id="4">"Commercial tourism operators must pay for their own travel to the Qikiqtani region, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association announced at its annual general meeting in Iqaluit on Wednesday, Oct. 9."</seg>
<seg id="5">The Qikiqtani region has the largest number of cruise ships in the territory.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Pond Inlet had 17 passengers on board the cruise ship this summer, with Iqaluit approaching four."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Inuit in the QIA communities have expressed concern that this is due to the increasing number of tourism activities in our region, especially for passengers on cruise ships."</seg>
<seg id="8">"The Qikiqtani Inuit Association put in place a tourism management fee to help people in communities affected by cruise ships," B.J. Akeeagok, the QIA president, said in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="9">Following a news release from the Qikiqtani Inuit Association on land and recycling, the department announced new expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="10">The new expenditures are for:</seg>
<seg id="11">• Flight landing in Inuit Nunangat: $150</seg>
<seg id="12">• A helicopter landing on Inuit Nunangat: $100</seg>
<seg id="13">• Commercial mistakes in Inuit Nunangat: $50 a day</seg>
<seg id="14">• Commercial visitor access within six hours of Inuit Nunangat: $25.00 a day</seg>
<seg id="15">"A consolidated payment would go to the Hunters and Trappers Organization the closest to the tourism industry available, the release said."</seg>
<seg id="16">Half of that would go to the Qikiqtani Inuit Association.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Cruise ships that come to Nunavut are occupied by approximately 150 to 400 people, Roseanne Terror, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association’s director of land and recycling, told the Qikiqtani Inuit Association at the meeting."</seg>
<seg id="18">This $25 per day fee would apply to all passengers who carry passengers to their own community – or IOL (Inuit Nunangat).</seg>
<seg id="19">"Regardless of how many people on the vessel are on their own, they would be fined based on the number of people on the ship," Derek told the board. "</seg>
<seg id="20">Derek said cruise ships carrying passengers to the islands will have to submit to the Qikiqtani Inuit Association the number of passengers per month or before they go boating.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If the ship carries 350 people, we would charge $25 per day per person."</seg>
<seg id="22">"So the larger passenger vessels would have to pay anywhere from $10,000 to $20,000 to land on Inuit owned land," Derek said. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"In many communities where cruise ships are visited during the summer, like Pond Inlet, their HTO would receive about $50,000 to $70,000 in compensation, he added."</seg>
<seg id="24">New payments will also support the Qikiqtani Inuit Association’s proposed land use database.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Accordingly, tourism operators will be made aware of new costs when applying for access to Inuit owned lands."</seg>
<seg id="26">Derek said the QIA set up a fee based on what other organizations pay for tourism.</seg>
<seg id="27">"For example, Parks Canada pays $25 per person for a national park."</seg>
<seg id="28">"Hamlets also charge passengers for cruise ships and cruise ship operators who come to their communities," Derek said. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"Cruise ship passengers who have been able to get into their own communities are fined only if people are actually going to our own communities," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"Joe Ataguttaaluk, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association secretary / finance secretary, asked if it would be possible to increase these expenditures in the future."</seg>
<seg id="31">"Derek said it would be possible to change it, but there would have to be a lot of discussion and a decision made by the Qikiqtani Inuit Association."</seg>
<seg id="32">"This is an exciting action.</seg>
<seg id="33">"We are once again leading the way that Inuit can get benefits for their communities," Akeeagok told the council. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"The payments will come into effect immediately, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association said."</seg>

<seg id="1">Baffinland’s huge passenger truck has become a concern for Pond Inlet residents</seg>
<seg id="2">"I guess Baffinland thinks that when we don’t know if the Nunavut Impact Review Board or the government is going to approve that project?"</seg>
<seg id="3">"The loader of the vessel Pierre Bruns (Beverly Hills) is missing from Prime Minister Hewitt, in the summer of last year."</seg>
<seg id="4">"On the loader you can see two potential construction materials, 33 and 34 metres high, that Baffinland Iron Mines Corp. received from Texas and shipped to the Mary River mine this summer."</seg>
<seg id="5">Two smaller units are also transported from the front.</seg>
<seg id="6">"These will be used to expand the railway, which has not yet been approved by regulators."</seg>
<seg id="7"> (Photo courtesy of Dixon) </seg>
<seg id="8">Community leaders in Pond Inlet are frustrated by the massive cruise ship landing parts of Baffinland Iron Mines Corp. "s Mary River iron mine this summer.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Worryingly, Baffinland wants to expand the railway in its Phase 2 plan, even though it has not yet been approved by authorities, Baffinland has brought in two large ten-plexes that could be built by Prime Minister Hewitt, Romanow, to the company’s dock in North Baffin this summer."</seg>
<seg id="10">"It also brought in two smaller units that may be built and a large amount of railway that would be used to build, such as roads and land pipes."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Baffinland, in November 2018, declared to rights groups and partners that the Qikiqtani Inuit Association would be bringing in, in the form of a public petition to the Nunavut Impact Review Board and the Nunavut Water Board."</seg>
<seg id="12">But the people of Pond Inlet are finding that out.</seg>
<seg id="13">This cruise ship arrived at Brunswick Port of Baffinland’s port in Mary Qirngnuq last August to transport material that could be used for the expansion of the railway.</seg>
<seg id="14">When people in Pond Inlet saw a cruise ship near their community, they first heard about the cruise ship that was going to be carrying two more ships to the railway station shortly thereafter and they’re expecting more ships in the summer of 2020.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We only found out about three or four weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We see a lot of cargo going around Pond Inlet," Joshua Arreak, the executive director of the Pond Inlet Hunters and Trappers Organization told Nunatsiaq News. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"We used to wonder why and who they were and how they were doing that.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We have not received any information from the Nunavut Impact Review Board, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association or anyone else."</seg>
<seg id="19">"We didn’t expect that," Arreak said. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"We have not received any information from the Qikiqtani Inuit Association or the Nunavut Impact Review Board.</seg>
<seg id="21">I don’t know.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have a problem with Inuit organizations.</seg>
<seg id="23">"They don’t keep us informed," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="24">NIRB knew about the sea lift this winter</seg>
<seg id="25">"None of Nunavut’s authorities and any federal minister rejected Baffinland’s expansion plan, which would result in a 110-kilometre railway linking Mary River to Mary River, reintroducing a metal deposit of 12 million tonnes a year, and traveling around 200 kilometres a year."</seg>
<seg id="26">This project cannot be approved by the federal government until a final public announcement by the NIRB has been made on November 2 in Iqaluit and will conclude on November 8 and 9 in Pond Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="27">"The Nunavut Impact Review Board, which did not seek comment on this issue with stakeholders, said they would be shipping a railway to Baffinland in a letter sent to Baffinland on July 25."</seg>
<seg id="28">"The NIRB told the company that if the phase 2 deal is rejected, Baffinland would have to take responsibility for the shipping of assets, which is likely worth hundreds of millions of dollars, from the mine."</seg>
<seg id="29">They also said that the shipping season will not have an impact on the NIRB’s decision.</seg>
<seg id="30">"In an email dated Oct. 17, the Nunavut Impact Review Board’s executive director, Ryan Perry, confirmed in a lawsuit that the Nunavut Impact Review Board could accept or reject any vessel activity."</seg>
<seg id="31">"The Nunavut Impact Review Board was simply able to ensure that these activities were included in the evaluation process and that all properties would have to be moved if the proposal was rejected after the board’s investigation," Barry wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="32">This is an aerial photograph of Philippine Brunswick, this past summer a vessel carrying potential materials to Mary River that will be used for Baffinland’s railway expansion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"One of the units, described as a" destruction unit, "is 33 metres high, 23.5 metres high and weighs 1,470 tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="34">"In another case, it’s referred to as the" pollution centre, "which is 34 metres high."</seg>
<seg id="35">"So each building, which is part of the existing structural damage and pollution, is equivalent to 10 floors of the building – or perhaps even higher than those built in the eastern Arctic."</seg>
<seg id="36">But Baffinland has not been authorized to use them yet.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Baffinland will testify in its July 19 report to the Nunavut Impact Review Board."</seg>
<seg id="38">Supplies occupied by Inuit Nunangat</seg>
<seg id="39">"In a joint submission to the authorities, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association and Baffinland wrote that the property would be occupied by Inuit owned land, according to the Qikiqtani Inuit Association’s commercial lease agreement with the company."</seg>
<seg id="40">"For Mr. Arreak and others, actions like this suggest that Baffinland has already been approved for the project."</seg>
<seg id="41">"The people of Pond Inlet are not happy.</seg>
<seg id="42">Baffinland is thinking that we don’t know if the Nunavut Impact Review Board or the government will approve that project.</seg>
<seg id="43">"I don’t know," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="44">"Rank Tester, a technical advisor to the Hamlet of Pond Inlet, was granted permission by the Mayor of Pond Inlet, Joshua Saskatchewan, to speak to Nunatsiaq News on behalf of the Hamlet."</seg>
<seg id="45">"Baffinland has been active in considering the approval of phase 2," Tester said in an email. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"If the Nunavut Impact Review Board had or had the authority to do so, the final impact of this decision would be to put pressure on the Nunavut Impact Review Board to take responsibility and approve the proposal."</seg>
<seg id="47">"That’s a concern," Tester said on behalf of the hamlet. "</seg>
<seg id="48">"On the other hand, the hamlet is thinking that they shouldn’t have done that."</seg>
<seg id="49">"This has resulted in the financial and perception that Baffinland will be approved in phase 2," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="50">"Our main concern is the animals, marine mammals and their presence."</seg>
<seg id="51">We would be most impacted in our community.</seg>
<seg id="52">That’s our concern.</seg>
<seg id="53">"The money is not going to bring back the animals," Joshua Arreak said on behalf of the Hunters and Trappers Organization, saying in a statement repeatedly in Pond Inlet over the years regarding marine transportation for Baffinland’s plans. "</seg>
<seg id="54">"As for non-governmental organizations such as the Department of Fisheries and Oceans North, who have expressed interest in holding a hearing on Baffinland’s expansion plan, they said they supported the" responsible development "of the Mary River mine."</seg>
<seg id="55">"But they also stressed that Baffinland’s exports were too large to fast-track its environmental impact, and were not satisfied with Baffinland’s decision to import large metals from Baffinland instead of Arctic Bay in the south, which could have been achieved in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="56">"It’s no surprise that residents are frustrated with the huge amount of imported railway parts to Mary Qirngnuq prior to the legal approval of this expansion," said Chris Dickie, vice president of policy and legal affairs at the Department of Fisheries and Oceans for the Arctic. "</seg>
<seg id="57">Manufactured equipment acquired from Texas</seg>
<seg id="58">The equipment that is being shipped to Baffinland is part of a list of existing vehicles that Baffinland acquired from the Diamond Jubilee Mine.</seg>
<seg id="59">"Two large buildings, which were first arrived, were organised in Birmingham, which is the third manufacturer, will be a railway station, built in Stuttgart, Poland, the Diaspora newspaper said."</seg>
<seg id="60">"Baffinland also brought in a cruise ship, a cruise ship and a number of equipment to be used for a railway."</seg>
<seg id="61">"Property descriptions of Baffinland’s submission to the Nunavut Impact Review Board and the Nunavut Water Board included railway links and railways, as well as paving metal and containers."</seg>
<seg id="62">"Dixon’s first ship to Baffinland, the vessel called Bloody Falls, weighed 5,500 tonnes of goods, and travelled from Birmingham in early August."</seg>
<seg id="63">"Two more cargo vessels were carrying additional supplies this past summer, and there will be more arrivals in the summer of 2020," Diaspora said. "</seg>
<seg id="64">"Under a joint agreement with the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, Baffinland agreed to put an additional $18 million in reimbursement funding for the cleanup of the Mary River mine if the project stops, the Water Board’s letter said."</seg>

<seg id="2">Inuit women make up 15 per cent of attendance at the Women’s Centre</seg>
<seg id="3">"Maurina Blu-Windsor, CEO of the Women’s Centre (Chelsea Doris), Women’s Centre and Cathy Wang, a city councillor representing the Peter-McGregor community and a spokesperson for the Montreal City Council, discussed plans for a 22-bed women’s shelter in Montreal."</seg>
<seg id="4"> (Photo courtesy of Montreal City) </seg>
<seg id="5">"The Montreal Town of Bel-Murray is able to begin the expansion of the project that was started at the women’s centre, the day centre for women’s homelessness, which was designed to change the land that was acquired last year."</seg>
<seg id="6">"The residents" decision, announced on Wednesday, Oct. 16, will allow for the installation of a new facility in a remote location, which will become an emergency evening for women. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"The women’s centre, the women’s day centre at 1430 Samoa Road in Montreal, is open every day for women who need help."</seg>
<seg id="8">Many of them are Inuit.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The women’s centre right now is located in Sammie Road, not far from the Atlanta Road and Copper Square, the gathering room for Inuit in Downtown."</seg>
<seg id="10">"The women’s centre is well known to many Inuit women, which accounts for 15 per cent of the time."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Set to open in the winter of 2021, the building’s emergency evening destination was purchased with a grant of $1 million from Montreal’s businessman Andrew Harper through the Joyce Community Foundation in Montreal."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Thank you for having a new house, we will now be able to accommodate 22 beds for women who are homeless," said Maurina Blu-Windsor, the executive director of Sir Chris, who said in a news release after an event at the Women’s Centre. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"Right now, women are 25 per cent homeless in Montreal, but the benefits for women are not enough."</seg>
<seg id="14">This project is an appropriate initiative. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"The good news is that the expansion of the destination was announced less than a week after this individual stayed at the centre, Clara Uttak, who lived in the Northwest Territories, died on Oct. 11 at the hospital."</seg>
<seg id="16">Buller-Windsor told Nunatsiaq News that when her daughter was in custody she became sick.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The vast majority of those who go to the center are people who go to the cities with housing and legal problems, Blue Wine said."</seg>
<seg id="18">"A lot of people go to the women’s centre for sleep during the day. There are six beds, there are only a few hours of sleep and they just sleep in the evening."</seg>
<seg id="19">That’s going to change because there’s going to be a new bed in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Right now, the women’s centre, at least 100 women’s centres every day, provides services and programs to women in need of shelter, food security, mental health and addictions."</seg>
<seg id="21">Burlington said the number of Inuit women who come in here has not changed significantly since 2018.</seg>
<seg id="22">"However, we have reached out to women who need more help than they need in clothing and washing machines," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"This is the only women’s day in Montreal. Sarah Doherty’s Women’s Centre is now open seven days a week from 8:30 a.m. to 3:00 p.m."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Due to their ability to operate their programs, the women’s centre took a weekend off without providing services for six months in 2014 due to a lack of funding."</seg>
<seg id="25">"We’re hoping that we can get some financial support from Makivik, but we don’t know if we’re going to get it this year," said Blu-Windsor. "</seg>
<seg id="26">"The women’s centre also runs an Inuit-specific program – but the women’s centre raises money to do that, as it does with its 70 percent operating budget of $1.7 million a year."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Cathy Wang, the city councillor on behalf of the Peter-McGill community and the spokesperson for the Montreal City Council, said during the announcement that the new evening centre will provide more women with access to" services that are offered to people who wish them safe and safe.

<seg id="1">No Nunavut Liberal Democrats</seg>
<seg id="2">"For the fundamental questions, the Liberal Democrats were not competitive"</seg>
<seg id="3">The Royal Canadian Mountain Championship on Oct. 21 reveals its refusal to accept the Liberal policy for Nunavut and the North.</seg>
<seg id="4">Do you remember the Liberal Democrats "report?</seg>
<seg id="5">They share information with each other on a regular basis.</seg>
<seg id="6">We can remember the majority of them.</seg>
<seg id="7">"That doesn’t matter, because the vast majority of Nunavut voters came out on Oct. 21, they didn’t come up with anything."</seg>
<seg id="8">"As of 2015, Justin Trudeau and other Liberal governments have published numerous news stories."</seg>
<seg id="9">Some of the information was new.</seg>
<seg id="10">"But in the end, the people of Nunavut just said" hi. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"But in the end, they were more resilient to the political party, since 1961, as Canadians have fought for them to change: The New Democratic Party."</seg>
<seg id="12">"This elderly woman’s mountain win reveals her disapproval of Trudeau’s actions in the north and northwest of Canada, which includes her refusal to commit to the repeated Inuit-Crown Partnership."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Since 2015, Trudeau has partnered with co-management organizations such as Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, NTI, Qikiqtani Inuit Association and others."</seg>
<seg id="14">But this week’s election reveals to Nunavummiut that the Inuit-Crown Partnership is not worth it.</seg>
<seg id="15">"And that’s not surprising, because at the end of the day the people of Nunavut were unable to answer the main questions of the Liberal Party."</seg>
<seg id="16">"It’s no secret to the majority of the people of Nunavut that the biggest concern is economic and social issues: The housing crisis, the lack of food, the high cost of groceries and airfares, which is the prevalence of tuberculosis and suicide which is almost daily."</seg>
<seg id="17">"But in his latest trip to Nunavut on Oct. 8, Trudeau had little interest in these issues."</seg>
<seg id="18">He spoke in South Baffin about climate change and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="19">"These are national issues, but during the election period, Nunavummiut want to hear their concerns about housing and the high cost of living."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Instead it was the Sylvia Grinnell River that was also a camera, not for Nunavut voters, but for southern Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="21">"In doing so, he did not respond to the enthusiasm of Nunavummiut and the Nunavut Liberal Democrat candidate Megan Pierre Lyall, who did not even help and should have been more helpful to the president of the Liberal Party."</seg>
<seg id="22">"As for the cost of food and nutrition, the Liberal Party took action, establishing a higher contribution to the Nutrition North Canada Program, and giving more money, $12.5 million a year to Indigenous hunters in Nunavut and elsewhere in the North."</seg>
<seg id="23">But the Harvester Support Program has to come out and no one can say why it’s like that.</seg>
<seg id="24">"This past August 1, Trudeau played a crucial role in Iqaluit and Arctic Bay, signing a memorandum of understanding to launch the Tallurutiup imanga Marine Conservation Centre and promising to launch a new protected area called Davis Strait."</seg>
<seg id="25">"This resulted in hundreds of thousands of dollars being allocated to communities in North Baffin, for small craft harbours and protection jobs."</seg>
<seg id="26">He also touched on security issues such as reconciliation with Indigenous peoples.</seg>
<seg id="27">"The frustration of such a approach is that: In the wake of the spread of tuberculosis in a overcrowded house, this" merger "doesn’t make much sense."</seg>
<seg id="28">"With that in mind, do you remember the Liberal government’s big message about tuberculosis?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"They did that in early 2018, when Jane Webb, then the former Canadian health minister, said that TB would eliminate the disease in Inuit Nunangat by 2030."</seg>
<seg id="30">But Webb, the federal minister promised to take on that responsibility because it is no longer there.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Due to Trudeau’s behaviour towards Judy Wilson of Ukraine and her controversial handling of SNC-Lavalin, Webb resigned at the conference."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Since then, the Liberal Democrats have never heard of TB as a preventative measure."</seg>
<seg id="33">"Like the Harvester Support Program, I think it’s getting stuck in the Inuit-Crown Partnership. I think the conversation that they had about tuberculosis is at risk."</seg>
<seg id="34">"And the public knows that tuberculosis is a result of poverty, poor eating and poor housing."</seg>
<seg id="35">"But on the issue of housing, Trudeau also offered something that was already warm and repeated this summer."</seg>
<seg id="36">"And the Government of Canada’s social housing program," organised "by Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, has been unpredictable."</seg>
<seg id="37">We would also like to congratulate Mamalaaq Qaqqaq for winning.</seg>
<seg id="38">"To be a member of the fourth divisional political party in the House of Commons, he will need help to be heard."</seg>
<seg id="39">Let the people of Nunavut just give them the opportunity and support.</seg>
<seg id="40">"Qaqqaq won two straight, Leona Aglukkaq and Megan Pizzo-Lyall."</seg>
<seg id="41">I hope that these two losers will continue to serve Nunavummiut and the North.</seg>

<seg id="1">Members questioned ministers on the $80 million expansion of the Webber Abbey Road Project</seg>
<seg id="2">"Looking at my colleagues, we can certainly make a decision on the $80 million option"</seg>
<seg id="3">"Joelie Qirngnuq, MLA for Amittuq, was among the MLAs from the Nunavut legislature asking the government about the $80 million increase in the Iqaluit-Niaqunnguu program."</seg>
<seg id="4">Some Nunavut lawmakers are now asking for unspecified support for the expansion of the Nuuk and Iqaluit Webber Application project.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Last August, the federal government promised to contribute $151 million to the project, which is targeted at 1,700 square kilometers of Webber Abbey Nuuk, Greenland through the Davis Strait fire in Iqaluit."</seg>
<seg id="6">From there, it would be brought to Kimmirut.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The Government of Nunavut will develop a framework and project at the start of the project, which will be completed by 2023."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Last year, the Legislative Assembly approved this project, which was to cost $126 million."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Later this year, we were informed that the cost of the project has gone up in line with the price increase and is now thought to be around $209 million," John Main, MLA for Arviat North-Whale Cove, said in a member’s statement on Wednesday, Oct. 23. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"This is a $80 million difference, Main said."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Looking at my colleagues we can definitely make a decision on the value of $80 million," Main said. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The federal funding comes from the Small Communities and Arctic Community Initiatives Program (Investment Canada Plan).</seg>
<seg id="13">The project is now on the legislative assembly’s review of the budget for 2020 / 21.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Later in the day during Question Period, Julie Qirngnuq, MLA for Amittuq asked Quassa Kusugak, the Minister of Community and Government Services, about the $80 million increase to the government’s pre-planned business plan."</seg>
<seg id="15">"This process, as outlined in the Government of Nunavut’s Budget Planning Subsidy," is intended to ensure that the project has a clear definition, and that information is available for development, reasonable cost estimates and timelines, prior to the commencement of the budget planning process. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"Was it pre-planning work, yes or no?"</seg>
<seg id="17">Returns to Oral Questions. Mr. Kusugak.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The planning has been completed and the costs are still being looked at.</seg>
<seg id="19">"When we were informed, we found that it was going to be much more expensive," Ms. Kusugak said. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"Main, sitting next to the chairperson of the legislative assembly, is standing up to ask another question from Ms. Kusugak."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Can the minister tell us how this massive project cost increases over the course of the year?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"Ms. Kusugak reiterated that after the proposed budget was approved last year, the department took a closer look at the project and increased the cost of the review."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Ms. Kusugak added that, in May 2019 her department felt that her funding proposal should be increased to $201.6 million" in order to provide the largest federal contribution to the project if necessary. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"On the next day, Oct. 24, Maine rose again in question period to find out more about the Finance Minister George Hickes on the same subject."</seg>
<seg id="25">"According to the Financial Management Board, what steps and actions were taken to inform the department of the $80 million cost increase in this expenditure process?"</seg>
<seg id="26">I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Hicks said the federal government has increased funding for the project, and, along with a significant contribution to the proposed marine research facility, the GN has also increased its contribution."</seg>
<seg id="28">"The Department of Community and Government Services redirected it to the Financial Management Board because it found that the expenditure was insufficient."</seg>
<seg id="29">"Hicks also said that the GN’s half (25 per cent) contribution to the project, with the federal government contributing 75 per cent."</seg>
<seg id="30">"As a Government of Nunavut, we don’t have to pay the full $80 million, and we would have to pay that 25 percent."</seg>
<seg id="31">"So we’re going to be looking for... some time in the next few years... in terms of additional resources to complete this project," he added. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"Nunavik needs its own federal lawyer, says Makivik President"</seg>
<seg id="2">Charlie Watt after the election of a federal government speaks about democracy</seg>
<seg id="3">"Charlie Watt, the president of Makivik Corp., issued a news release on Oct. 22 after the federal election, saying Nunavik should have its own federal regulator."</seg>
<seg id="4">By Elaine Anthony</seg>
<seg id="5">"Makivik President Charlie Watt did not change his comments about Nunavik’s political location during the ceremony when he announced to the new MLA, Shepherd Parker."</seg>
<seg id="6">"We will seek to get the Electoral Boundaries Commission to better understand this, in a way, Nunavik will have its own political party for our territory, which is what we want right now with respect to our own self-reliance," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"We need that through the provincial government."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Hezbollah – James P. Iyago is the largest federal political project in Quebec, which starts in Nunavik from the south to the Mala Val-d’Or community, where four of the six 2019 federal candidates live, including Puerto Rico to the Quebec River."</seg>
<seg id="9">Nunavik’s premiers have chosen their own government since 1972.</seg>
<seg id="10">"In 2002, the Katimajiit’s entire community, including Makivik, went to the Federal Election Commission for that purpose and reappeared in 2011."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Since the division was expanded in 2013, it has added two more communities in the south."</seg>
<seg id="12">"The divisions were redesigned, according to the commission, to balance the population."</seg>
<seg id="13">"In Quebec, there are 100,000 people in the region, which is Abi-James Iyago with less than 85,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="14">"While Nunavik’s population is around 13,000, Nunavik is far below that, but its leaders have raised this issue with respect to Nunavik’s independence."</seg>
<seg id="15">"The smallest jurisdiction in Canada is Labrador, which has about 26,000 people, where Newfoundland has about 80,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Puppy won the prize for Northern Quebec, picked by more than 11,000, or 40 per cent, followed by the Liberal Democrats and Conservative candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Watt announced his congratulations to the Green Party candidate Kara Kapa-Whitley, an Inuk from Kuujjuaq, who won the fifth prize with more than 1,000 votes."</seg>
<seg id="18">"In his speech to Watt, he welcomed him in April to visit Nunavik as soon as possible."</seg>
<seg id="19">"I look forward to the merger, and his support for self-determination in this process is exciting, as well as issues such as the implementation of the United Nations Act on the rights of Indigenous people," Ford said. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"There was a big message to Black Quebec President Evo Francois Blanchard, who won 32 seats in Quebec."</seg>
<seg id="21">"We look forward to supporting ourselves in the development of our agenda in Nunavik – through the legal and economic sectors – and in order to create a legitimate working relationship," said Ford. "</seg>
<seg id="22">"However, in the spirit of Quebec’s independence, Inuit have long supported Canada’s integration."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Watt ruled out the election, despite the fact that the Liberal Democrats did not have seats in the new government, to allow him to meet with various batteries and to meet with the rest of Canada."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Justin Trudeau has a strong government in the absence of seats, and he can work with other parties (politicians) – NDP, Black Quebec, Green, Conservative and Independence Party – to pass legislation and bring it to Parliament, and to work together," he said.</seg>
<seg id="25">"As for Nunavut’s newly elected NDP MLA, sorry about the mountains of Baker Lake, he gave us some hope."</seg>
<seg id="26">"I remember when NTI met in Baker Lake in 1871 with Tagak Curley," Watt said. "</seg>
<seg id="27">"At that time we were young.</seg>
<seg id="28">"They’re going to do a good job, I’m sorry, and I look forward to seeing you and working together to make sure that people are trying to do their own thing together, for the next generation."</seg>

<seg id="1">"To reinforce the prevention of RSV in Nunavut, thousands say"</seg>
<seg id="2">"For Inuit, you can save money on the number of lung illnesses"</seg>
<seg id="3">The flight attendant for the Nunavut Emergency Measures Line is on strike at the Iqaluit airport this summer for flight attendants.</seg>
<seg id="4">"In some years, when infants have lung disease (RSV), they have to be evacuated and this leads to the use of aircraft and clinical resources."</seg>
<seg id="5">"These are Dr. Anna Bennett and her fellow teachers at the Toronto University School of Medicine who joined us in 1989 for the first time since she launched this program in Chicago at the end of September, as well as about 1,000 signatures."</seg>
<seg id="6">"But when this news was finally published, 23,322 names had gathered – and now they’re set to reach 25,000 signatures."</seg>
<seg id="7">The campaign states that the Government of Nunavut would provide multiple preventative measures and reduce the need for health care for infants by implementing a preventative prevention program called Philippines for all infants under six months.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Philadelphia is a preventable disease, not a vaccination program, and it is marketed as a Swedish flu vaccine."</seg>
<seg id="9">"It is classified as a prevalence of infant lung disease that starts with RSV, a summary of the" Reproductive Virus, "which causes lung disease, and leads to a disease that is traumatised by a blood vessel called RSV."</seg>
<seg id="10">"But Dr. Michael Patterson, the president of healthcare in Nunavut, told Nunatsiaq News in an interview that the GN contributes 11% to 12% of babies under the age of 2."</seg>
<seg id="11">"We spend more on infants who are at higher risk of disease for RSV, as well as those who support the world’s contribution to policing," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"These include infants who are Inuit, who are under 35 weeks of pregnancy, or babies with lung cancer or heart disease."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Panorama, an associate professor of pediatrics at the Toronto University of Medicine, has published a series of books over the past 15 years about the prevalence and cost of RSV in the Arctic."</seg>
<seg id="14">"As a result of this study, he is deeply dissatisfied with the current territorial policy and said all Nunavut infants need this prevention program."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Dr. Anna Bennett, an associate professor of pediatrics at the Toronto University School of Medicine, said after conducting research on Inuit infants who have a vaccination program called Philippines that would make a significant difference in your life and finances."</seg>
<seg id="16">The cost of living in Nunavut is worth it</seg>
<seg id="17">She said in her study that the RSV disease is prevalent in many areas and has resulted in a significant number of airfares and hospitals for Nunavut’s health care system.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Health care is very expensive: About $5,600 per patient."</seg>
<seg id="19">"However, despite the cost, the premier and many others believe that this is a discount."</seg>
<seg id="20">"This is because Nunavut suffers from early cancer and medivacs are the most effective, responsive."</seg>
<seg id="21">"We’ve done a lot of cost-cutting studies that have shown in the Arctic that if we give more money to the RCMP, we can save money," he said in an interview. "</seg>
<seg id="22">"The cost analysis, published in 2013, found that there were hundreds of cases of lung cancer in Kitikmeot infants: Set at 389 out of 1,000."</seg>
<seg id="23">"During the study, which took place from January 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010, it found that the cost of living in hospitals for this disease reached $57,535."</seg>
<seg id="24">"In the Qikiqtani region, the rate of lung cancer among infants was 2002 from 1,000 newborns and in the Kivalliq, 230 out of 1,000 newborns."</seg>
<seg id="25">This means the Government of Nunavut has spent $5.9 million on sick people in the Qikiqtani region and roughly $5.7 million in the Kivalliq region for infants and that was the result of the study.</seg>
<seg id="26">"However, it was, in fact, the Kivalliq had the highest rate of tuberculosis in hospitals: $63,686."</seg>
<seg id="27">"For Inuit, it’s saving money, because of the high rates of lung cancer," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="28">Superintendent of Ontario Nurses Supports Registered Nurses</seg>
<seg id="29">"Inuit infants are 10 times more likely to be treated with lung disease than" vulnerable "infants and the disease is significantly more common in their sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Despite this fundamental problem, Inuit infants in Nunavut do not receive the H1N1 virus," Gandhi wrote in his submission. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"This is also the case for professionals identified in the University of Winnipeg School of Health, the National Health Association and the National Institute of Health Research for Indigenous Peoples."</seg>
<seg id="32">But healthy babies in Nunavut who have completed their babies don’t receive this preventative medication – even if they come from vulnerable communities other than Iqaluit and have more cases of lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="33">Planned Parenthood says it’s a mistake to do that.</seg>
<seg id="34">"I have worked very hard.</seg>
<seg id="35">I have shown it to the public.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Carolyn Bennett, Jane Webb, has seen my article and said it’s credible," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="37">Nunavik vaccinates all infants</seg>
<seg id="38">"And he gave notice, unlike Nunavut, that health officials in Nunavik have donated a policeman to all babies over the last three years."</seg>
<seg id="39">"In the Nunavut legislature on Oct. 18, Health Minister George Hickes said in response to questions from the Iqaluit-Niaqunnguu MLA Pat Angnakak, that the Government of Nunavut undertake a thorough review of Nunavik’s activities."</seg>
<seg id="40">"We’re keeping track of that project," said Hickes. "</seg>

<seg id="49">"There are two things that I don’t agree with in the process of signing and the other one is that the disclosure process has been completed, or the scientific evidence of that."</seg>

<seg id="2">Nunavik construction firm offers small construction</seg>
<seg id="3">"A small building that is visible, by Nunavik builders, was brought to Churchill by ship this summer."</seg>
<seg id="4"> (Photo courtesy of Nunavik builders) </seg>
<seg id="5">The first small units built in Nunavik arrived by ship to Churchill this summer.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I wanted to show you how good we were building for the North," said Willy Godfrey, co-founder of Nunavik Construction, a residential design and construction office in Kuujjuaq and Nairobi, Quebec. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"Ten years before, Gardner, a Kuujjuaq plumber, was a skilled manufacturer and a construction engineer who had obstacles with housing expert Cloud Janelle."</seg>
<seg id="8">"We started talking about affordable housing in the Arctic," Godfrey said. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"Housing in the Arctic is too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="10">It started from there. "</seg>
<seg id="11">From there they have developed a framework for small units with a view to Arctic weather.</seg>
<seg id="12">The houses have metal garbage and there are 10 wind turbines that can be activated and can be used longer than normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">"They are designed with insulated fixtures for their faces, roofs and ceilings and a three-storey window to prevent the warm weather."</seg>
<seg id="14">"They have floor-to-ceiling heating systems, not like wall heat, to balance the temperature across the building."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I think that’s the only way to do it in the Arctic," Godfrey said. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"There are a lot of problems with heating systems and heating systems that go to a certain degree.</seg>
<seg id="17">People say their feet are freezing.</seg>
<seg id="18">Their houses are completely insulated but they’re walking in. "</seg>
<seg id="19">The design of the Nunavik building is a one-bedroom apartment.</seg>
<seg id="20"> (Photo courtesy of Nunavik builders) </seg>
<seg id="21">"Due to the design of furnaces and pipes across Nunavut, Gardner is responsible for ensuring that units are built within the framework, making sure everything is fixed and maintained."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Nunavik builds multi-faceted structures that have small, four-bedroom units, and other options available to them."</seg>
<seg id="23">"They can add another room and it can be expanded, for example, when they’re older than their children."</seg>
<seg id="24">"The building is displayed in Kuujjuaq with a single bedroom, with a size of 5 metres to the side and 10 metres per metre."</seg>
<seg id="25">There is an entrance at the end of the building to the kitchen and the living room.</seg>
<seg id="26">Just above your house and beyond the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="27">The power plant in another building is over.</seg>
<seg id="28">It took about two hours to complete the building and the electrical and utilidor systems were installed.</seg>
<seg id="29">"This house can be purchased for $228,000, for the connection and for all inside," said Godfrey. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"The Nunavik building costs between $500,000 and $600,000, he said."</seg>
<seg id="31">"We’re trying to build affordable housing with adequate spaces and problems with their waterways," said Godfrey. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"I am a plumber, I am a scientist for many years and a lot of things are done properly, the pipes are not adequate, their heating systems are not adequate."</seg>
<seg id="33">That’s what I’ve been building for many years and now we’ve got something that would be more suitable for the Arctic. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"The houses that are built in Southwark, Quebec, and they were built a month later, Gottlieb said, and they were bumped into a truck by ship."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Once we get the orders and the booking is in place for the shipping season, the building can be in place by the summer."</seg>
<seg id="36">"In the future, if this is successful, we are determined to build capacity in the Arctic," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"But that’s a lot of money."</seg>
<seg id="38">He added that these units across the Arctic would be suitable and would be very happy to order from Nunavut or from Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="39">"We’re open and we’re just waiting for the costs to be determined and they’re prepared for the construction," said Godfrey. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"We plan to help people in need."</seg>

<seg id="1">"In Canada’s Arctic, sea ice is at its lowest level right now"</seg>
<seg id="2">"We may be a month behind schedule for the current fiscal year"</seg>
<seg id="3">"The freeze is very late this year," said Gjoa Haven resident Bailey Aglukkaq, who took this photo on Oct. 18. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"It’s still boating for the land, although it doesn’t happen in Gjoa Haven."</seg>
<seg id="5">I have never seen it on the ice for the rest of my life. "</seg>

<seg id="8">"Last October, when Judah Sarpinak of Igloolik went seal hunting he had to go through snowmobiles."</seg>
<seg id="9">"When he applied that year, he had to go boating."</seg>
<seg id="10">"In Nunavut and other parts of the Arctic, it’s the same."</seg>
<seg id="11">"This is the first time I’ve seen this shock in my life," said Bailey Aglukkaq, who has lived in Gjoa Haven for almost 40 years. "</seg>
<seg id="12">That’s correct.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Since Oct. 15 the sea ice glaciers were around 5.118 million square kilometres, the lowest recorded in 1968."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Depending on where it is, we may have a month to do that late last year," said Josh Logan, a violent researcher on land services in Canada. "</seg>
<seg id="15">But this is not the first year that the ice is so low.</seg>
<seg id="16">In April it was also the smallest ice on record.</seg>
<seg id="17">Subsequent to that, July was the most recent publication.</seg>
<seg id="18">"In August, the shrinking ice began to slow down."</seg>
<seg id="19">"We picked up the second-lowest (ice) ice in 2007 and 2016, but it was higher in 2012," said Walter Mayo, a senior researcher at the National Institute of Technology and the Forestry Institute. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"But we’re still at a lower point than the 2012 lows when it was because of the slow freeze – 2012 that quickly returned to normal, but this winter’s ice conditions."</seg>
<seg id="21">"At the time of Oct. 15, the ice conditions were lower than in 2012, at which time it was the lowest."</seg>
<seg id="22"> (Photo courtesy of NSIDC) </seg>
<seg id="23">The sea ice is based on temperatures.</seg>
<seg id="24">"If there is no ice in the water and the temperatures are warmer in the water, even if the temperatures are in the air then the temperatures will get warmer and the water will get warmer or freezing," said Lawrence. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"But the Arctic temperature in October is very cold, with temperatures in the last six months."</seg>
<seg id="26">"It was a summer," said Mayo. "</seg>
<seg id="27">"As of April, monthly temperatures remained the third highest on record – in the Arctic – on record, this is May and August."</seg>
<seg id="28"> (Image courtesy of UNEP) </seg>
<seg id="29">This year’s event will bring a bigger picture.</seg>
<seg id="30">"As a result of global warming from the perspective of humanitarian vehicles, we have seen a decrease in sea ice levels since 1979," said Bashar Patrick, director of the GRID-Guinea, in a news release released by the United Nations Environment Agency (UNEP).</seg>
<seg id="31">"Unlike the current trend this year in the Arctic, declining sea ice has benefited from Arctic warming over the years."</seg>
<seg id="32">"According to the release," temperatures rose to 0.5 degrees Celsius in the last decade of 1982 and 2017, primarily due to the solar eclipse that began to deteriorate in 1979. "</seg>
<seg id="33">This is twice as fast as the global average. "</seg>
<seg id="34">This summer has not been the only picture.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Despite the same year, the ice is now recovering."</seg>
<seg id="36">"The ice is just starting to freeze," she said, Ms. Aglukkaq. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"In 10 days, since Oct. 20, the sea ice has increased by nearly 1.5 million square kilometres, including water near Gjoa Haven."</seg>
<seg id="38">"If the current freeze continues, 2019 may be even higher than it was in 2012."</seg>

<seg id="2">"To me this is a joyous event"</seg>
<seg id="3">Goodwin Howard became Iqaluit’s fire marshal two weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">"It has since been read and investigated, but she says her new job is something she can do about it."</seg>
<seg id="5"> (Photo courtesy of Dustin Patterk) </seg>
<seg id="6">"When Gordon Howard appeared before the city council on Oct. 22 when he became the fire chief, he did not expect to be interviewed."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Do you support the Montreal Canadiens?"</seg>
<seg id="8">Asked by Member Joanasie Akumalik.</seg>
<seg id="9">"After a long silence, Howard responded," No. "</seg>
<seg id="10">They are here with a lot of laughs.</seg>
<seg id="11">"A week later, in an interview with Nunatsiaq News, Howard said," That’s why I decided that my clients should not be heard. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"Howard, who grew up in Hamilton, went to Iqaluit through Meadowbank, Ontario, a town close to Georgetown Bay."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Even though he’s originally from here, he’s also a resident of the Arctic."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Over the past 10 years as an emergency health officer for the Canadian Armed Forces, Arviat’s neighbourhood has been camped in the wintertime."</seg>
<seg id="15">"So it’s my understanding of the snow, I understand it’s cold, but there’s also something that has to be done."</seg>
<seg id="16">It seems like it’s in a different world and that’s why I brought it here.</seg>
<seg id="17">"And the department is in trouble," said Howard, referring to the Iqaluit firefighters "collection – some of them are firefighters and some of them just go out and help."</seg>
<seg id="18">That’s the only thing that Howard did not come to Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="19">As part of their experience as a volunteer firefighter and Emergency Measures – in the absence of so many other areas – it was also due to the fact that Iqaluit was experiencing a fire.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The history of this department is overwhelming," said Howard. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"It’s incredible here, and when you look at their resources they’re always in place."</seg>
<seg id="22">"The activities of the department are related to, and now Howard, in this new area, from water problems and lack of support, to fire extinguishers and fire extinguishers."</seg>
<seg id="23">"We can’t change that overnight and there doesn’t seem to be much change in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="24">"If we continue to move forward and don’t go backwards I would be happy," said Howard. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"For me, it’s a very exciting project."</seg>
<seg id="26">"It’s a pleasure, what we’re trying to do and what we know to be able to do."</seg>
<seg id="27">"The first question that was asked by the city’s designated director of emergency services is," I’m a Toronto assistant, "said Howard with a smile."</seg>
<seg id="28">"It’s good to hear that some of them are supporting the fire hall in Toronto.</seg>

<seg id="2">Hotel operator says they do inspections but they never find one.</seg>
<seg id="3">This person just wants to eat in a room that you wouldn’t want to see: A bedbug.</seg>
<seg id="4">"But in recent years, the bedbugs have been seen at the Quebec boarding home where patients from Nunavik are staying in the city."</seg>
<seg id="5">The bedbugs that are seen in Nunavik’s boarding home when they go to the hospital in Montreal are a major concern for the patients and their families.</seg>
<seg id="6">This photograph reveals the bedbugs of Cecilia Tookoome that she saw last month at the bottom of her mother’s bedroom at the Curtis Hotel at Kirt Lewis Valley.</seg>
<seg id="7"> (Photo courtesy of Cecilia Tookooka) </seg>
<seg id="8">"In mid-October, Cecilia Kukushka was visiting her mother at the Cornwall Hotel at the Kirt Lodge in Toronto. She was very scared: She saw the dog below Elizabeth’s mouth, which she took photographs of."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Kukushka’s observation of the Iglulik Quebec tells the patients to the Nunavik watchdog at the Ublivik Hotel, where they have a bedroom hotel, 39 total, on the first floor when they are overflowing."</seg>
<seg id="10">Kutsika phoned her mother and told her that she would never be there again.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The hotel’s president, Sergeant Abdullah Noah, told Nunatsiaq News last week that he was surprised to see the bedbugs."</seg>
<seg id="12">"What happened in the recent past, when there was a thorough investigation, with the coroner’s report, they were unable to find it."</seg>
<seg id="13">"One bedroom study found that there were bedbugs in the bedroom, but they’re no longer there."</seg>
<seg id="14">Abdus Noah also posted an email on Instagram showing a group of people who had seen bedbugs.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Due to the importance of Ublivik Boarding Home operations, Abdul Noah said all rooms were performed this year and are regularly inspected and processed if required."</seg>
<seg id="16">Nunatsiaq News was unable to communicate with the Nunavik Regional Health Board or the Motor Vehicle Information System that deals with the Nunavik Health Centre in Montreal such as bedbugs and what to do about it.</seg>
<seg id="17">The MNQC has shared their concerns via email to Abdullah Noah.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It appears that billionaires are seeing bedbugs and they don’t want to stay in hotels anymore," wrote George Delilah, president of Ublivik on Oct. 16. "</seg>
<seg id="19">"Let me know what it is and what it is and when the problem will be resolved.</seg>
<seg id="20">We have to keep the patients informed about the treatment of the bedbugs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">Ublivik patients always take care of their clothing / bags before they enter.</seg>
<seg id="22">There are bedbugs in Montreal: The government offices were forced to shut down in Cumberland Sound this past month.</seg>
<seg id="23">"And if there were bedbugs from patients in the Arctic, that wouldn’t be the first, as happened in 2010 in Winnipeg."</seg>
<seg id="24">"The bedbugs are very unusual: They’re small, but they’re very sweet, sweet and painful after they’re washed away."</seg>
<seg id="25">The bedbugs that contain the flu will reduce the blood sugar levels in the blood sugar levels and reduce the sensitivity of the blood vessel.</seg>
<seg id="26">"On the other side of the pipe, the bedbug pumps in the blood, sometimes for about five minutes, after melting, searching the blood and screaming."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Bedbugs eat five to ten days a year and can survive a year, often stay at the bottom of the bottom of the bag, wheat and other hot chocolate, dark and come out when they want to eat."</seg>
<seg id="28">"The good news is that the bedbugs don’t stay in the cold, so they just fall asleep and die."</seg>
<seg id="29">So you can store your bags when they’re outside for more than two days if it’s not warm.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Try to avoid bedbugs while you’re out on the land, check them in the bedroom, and look at the bottom and don’t put your bags in the bedroom."</seg>
<seg id="31">"And when you go home, wash your clothes before going into your bedroom and check your packaging."</seg>
<seg id="32">"If you look at a bedbug in a Montreal hotel, you can call 311 for city problems."</seg>

<seg id="3">"It affects all aspects of Inuit life," said NTI’s president. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"Representatives from Igloolik and Pond Inlet are listening to Aluki Kotierk, NTI’s president, in a motion calling for the cancellation of the NIRB’s final hearing on Baffinland’s phase 2 expansion on Wednesday, November 6 in Iqaluit."</seg>

<seg id="7">"The Nunavut Impact Review Board’s meeting on Baffinland’s proposed expansion of the Mary River iron mine suddenly ended, with a two-day retreat in Pond Inlet cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="8">"On Wednesday, November 6, NTI President Aluki Kotierk issued a resolution calling for an immediate adjournment of the last public meeting and that the meeting be held for eight months."</seg>
<seg id="9">It would have been interesting to hear the testimony from the witnesses that they were looking for, and the members were looking at Baffinland to see what they were going to do about that situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Baffinland officials stood by their faces, occasionally mobilizing their arms and turning their backs on when Kotierk made his motion."</seg>
<seg id="11">"We are concerned that this public forum will be completed in a timely fashion.</seg>
<seg id="12">People need input and dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Anyone in this room wants to understand all the issues that are raised and how it affects NTI and the union," Kotierk said when the chamber is full of witnesses and people. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"It affects all people’s lives," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"The motion was tabled on the fifth day of the hearing in Iqaluit, at the end of the hour."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Nunavut Impact Review Board’s first agenda was organized to continue the hearings in Pond Inlet to allow communities to participate on November 8 and 9.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The Nunavut Impact Review Board was satisfied with NTI’s motion, which stopped the meeting and the Pond Inlet merger was also cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Over the course of a week, Baffinland representatives who wanted to have an opportunity to speak repeatedly expressed their plans to build a railway from the north to the Mary River port."</seg>
<seg id="19">"This railway and other parts of the port, it would make it easier for the company to produce more than six million tonnes of steel a year that produces up to 12 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="20">"But it’s notorious for the week that Baffinland’s proposal to amend its project permit is to remove its production deadline and to establish a deadline for shipping, 20 times the railway and 176 cruise ships a year."</seg>
<seg id="21">"The motion to adjourn the meeting was supported by all those who wished to speak, many of whom expressed concern about the uncertainty surrounding the project."</seg>
<seg id="22">"P.J. Akeeagok, the QIA president, told Nunatsiaq News that he believes in the NIRB’s process to ensure that" people have the opportunity to ask questions about these important issues "and" allow residents to voice their concerns on an ongoing basis. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"Mr. Akeeagok also said the motion was not expected, but it was well organized at the last day of the session."</seg>
<seg id="24">Baffinland officials are watching Kotierk make a motion to terminate.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I think there are too many questions that haven’t been resolved yet.</seg>
<seg id="26">"From my perspective, if you are going to make a decision about your future, then you have to be fully informed in order to make good decisions."</seg>
<seg id="27">There is a lack of it here. "</seg>
<seg id="28">Representatives from the North Baffin communities also unanimously voted in favour of the motion.</seg>
<seg id="29">"There is a need for more information and research," said Amanda Hanson Main, a researcher for the Pond Inlet Hunters and Trappers Organization. "There is a need for research."</seg>
<seg id="30">He said the project "may have a very serious impact on our values and values as Inuit and as a part of the world."</seg>
<seg id="31">"Some members of the Kimball team expressed their dissatisfaction with the Mary River project, and they just wanted to continue with Baffinland’s work in Nunavut, but there were too many questions and concerns about the proposed expansion."</seg>
<seg id="32">"What we hear is that it’s too independent and unacceptable," said Peter Ivalu, who represents the Hamlet of Igloolik. "It’s too small."</seg>
<seg id="33">"All the information has to be translated.</seg>
<seg id="34">Everything has to be transparent. "</seg>
<seg id="35">"The Government of Nunavut also agreed with the motion, in reference to this issue, that there is too much disagreement among those who want to have a say and that is just a backstop."</seg>
<seg id="36">"The federal government also supported the motion, but said the Nunavut Impact Review Board can make a decision on how long this will take."</seg>
<seg id="37">"Through their legal team, Baffinland said they were dissatisfied with the motion to adjourn for eight months and were not satisfied with that motion until they were informed."</seg>
<seg id="38">"All those who arrived at the announcement meeting were likely to go ahead as of November 2," said Brad Armstrong, the lawyer for Baffinland. "It’s just a matter of time."</seg>
<seg id="39">"None of them said they had any plans to start this day.</seg>
<seg id="40">There was no way of preventing any of these comments from coming to the table. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"Megan Lord-Hoyle, the vice president of recycling for Baffinland, said the delay would have a" immediate impact "on the project."</seg>
<seg id="42">"But we will do all we can to ensure that we continue to provide and protect 3,000 Canadians for employment, 476 of whom are Inuit."</seg>
<seg id="43">We have to know that Inuit will be working with us.</seg>
<seg id="44">"We need an opportunity to find a way to deal with the problem," Lord-Hoyle said. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"Although the Qikiqtani Inuit Association has said they can’t help work on phase 2, Akeeagok said they will continue to work on the Inuit communications program and the project’s economic potential will not be limited."</seg>
<seg id="46">"We are not satisfied with the Mary River project.</seg>
<seg id="47">We are working with them.</seg>
<seg id="48">We own Inuit Nunangat.</seg>
<seg id="49">"We support Inuit employment," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="50">"We’ve spent a lot of money and work to make this project a profit for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="51">"So with that in mind, there is a balance that we have to find."</seg>
<seg id="52">But there is nothing at this time. "</seg>
<seg id="53">Mr. Akeeagok also pointed out that the community’s uncertainty about the impact of the railway on caribou is important.</seg>
<seg id="54">"As an Inuk, these things have a profound impact on our culture and rights."</seg>
<seg id="55">"While it was visible to the elders that they are not only thinking about themselves, this is also for the future."</seg>
<seg id="56">That’s my focus.</seg>
<seg id="57">"My decision is not just for now, but for the next generation."</seg>
<seg id="58">I leave them with a better foundation than they were going to be me?</seg>
<seg id="59">"It’s mainly based on decision-making, no matter what culture you are," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="60">"In accordance with the recommendation, the Nunavut Impact Review Board provided an opportunity for witnesses to speak in writing until November 15."</seg>
<seg id="61">"From there, the Nunavut Impact Review Board will submit a written submission to the motion and the timeline."</seg>

<seg id="1">Nunavut MLAs approve amendments to the Income Tax Act</seg>
<seg id="2">"Our government is working diligently to ensure that carbon pricing is recovered as a source of income"</seg>
<seg id="3">"MLA Adam Lightstone questioned Finance Minister George Hickes on Bill 26, An Act to Amend the Income Tax Act, during the legislative session on Wednesday, November 6."</seg>
<seg id="4">Nunavut MLAs updated the Nunavut Income Tax Act to amend the Carbon Tax Act.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The changes, which were read for the third time on Wednesday, November 6, included an increase in the personal expenses of $13,325 to $16,000."</seg>
<seg id="6">"This means that taxpayers will earn more than $3,000 a year before they have to pay the Nunavut Income Tax."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Another change is the increase in the living allowance from $1,200 to $1,500."</seg>
<seg id="8">"This means that taxpayers who make more than $60,000 will receive an additional $300-plus tax credit."</seg>
<seg id="9">And Nunavut’s corporate tax rates for small businesses drop by 4 per cent to 3 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Our government is working hard to ensure that carbon pricing is recovered," said Finance Minister George Hickes. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"The federal government’s fixed carbon tax bill came into effect in Nunavut on July 1, with the fuel price stabilizing – it would have increased by 5 cents per litre – the Government of Nunavut introduced a carbon pricing program, which reduces the cost of fuel by half."</seg>
<seg id="12">"In a series of discussions on income tax reform, Nunavut MLAs agreed that carbon tax revenues should be returned to Nunavummiut."</seg>
<seg id="13">However, they couldn’t agree on how best to do that.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Adam Lightstone, the MLA for Iqaluit-Manirajak, was concerned that, given the reduction in income tax rates, the government would have to pay taxes on government operations."</seg>
<seg id="15">"It is my understanding that our current federal investments are vital and that our own economy is only 10 to 15 per cent of our contribution.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We really have to use our own revenues to operate," said Lightstone. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"Why is the government trying to use the carbon tax to contribute to the government’s operations?"</seg>
<seg id="18">"The carbon tax that we’re developing is a small part of the Government of Nunavut and the carbon has been trying to fit into our own carbon footprint," replied Hicks, adding, "I don’t think we would be satisfied if we just put these carbon pricing systems in place for other revenues and that money is not being paid back to the consumer."</seg>
<seg id="19">Lightstone also said that amending the Income Tax Act would be the most appropriate way to reimburse Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="20">"It also emphasized that the carbon tax contribution to the Government of Nunavut will go to the Government of Nunavut to ensure that it is used for its purpose, reducing Nunavut’s carbon footprint."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Climate change is something I am very concerned about and it needs to be worked on now and for the future.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Having said that, I have come up with some ideas for our government on how we can develop or come up with a strategy that will save the lives of Nunavummiut," said Lightstone. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"Why have these ideas not been considered and proposed to be used for carbon tax purposes?"</seg>
<seg id="24">Hicks responded by saying that each department – responsible for specific projects – is listening.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Some departments have been working with departments, including the Qulliq Energy Corporation, which is responsible for the development of energy-efficient LED street lighting in Nunavut which was approved in the near future."</seg>
<seg id="26">"In 2019 / 20, the GN expects to make $12 million in carbon tax."</seg>
<seg id="27">That would be broken down as follows:</seg>
<seg id="28">• $2 million for the government’s higher cost of furnaces for public housing and government buildings such as schools and health centres.</seg>
<seg id="29">• $3.6 million for the new Nunavut carbon tax.</seg>
<seg id="30">• $6.2 million will be reimbursed to Nunavummiut and Nunavut jobs this year for the establishment of an amendment to the Income Tax Act.</seg>
<seg id="31">But to Lightstone this is not a mathematical combination.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Given the 50 per cent recovery from the refinery and the 50 per cent cost of carbon tax, why is there so little room for energy efficiency measures?"</seg>
<seg id="33">"Hicks responded that the federal government’s rate of carbon tax is increasing every year over the next five years, and that even though the 50 per cent deduction in the refineries will continue, this year’s increase in tax credits would generate more revenue for other projects."</seg>
<seg id="34">The bill received second reading on November 6 and received third reading that evening.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Despite that, Lightstone, yesterday’s newborn son told the legislative assembly that he only slept for three hours and left."</seg>
<seg id="36">"Shortly afterwards in an email to Nunatsiaq News, Lightstone said he was disappointed that he would vote against the legislation."</seg>
<seg id="37">"I don’t agree with the terms of reference of Bill 26, I don’t think it’s a perfectly organized year policy," wrote Lightstone, although he was going to say something about the legislative assembly. "</seg>
<seg id="38">"The purpose of the carbon tax is to reduce fossil fuels and carbon emissions from industries and to address climate change.</seg>
<seg id="39">"If this legislation included an electricity tax credit for individuals and businesses that wanted to help save money, or if the Government of Nunavut put in place a mechanism to help people purchase and develop energy efficiency measures then I would have been very pleased to approve the legislation."</seg>
<seg id="40">Although Lightstone disagreed with the bill, it was passed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Hicks said he can hear thoughtful suggestions on how to use carbon tax revenues to reduce Nunavut’s carbon footprint.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I strongly urge members of the public to write a letter to their MLAs or the government that considers the potential for action in this area."</seg>

<seg id="5">"From April to September, 2018, more than 51,000 people visited Nunavut outside of Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="6">"This is the result of Nunavut’s annual tourism report for 2018-19 from the Department of Economic Development and Transportation, which was tabled in the Legislative Assembly earlier this month."</seg>
<seg id="7">"The same people who came here spent a total of $271,383,000 on engagement and travel expenses."</seg>
<seg id="8">The report does not specify how much has been spent other than travel.</seg>
<seg id="9">"In contrast, there were roughly 16,750 visitors from Nunavut who did not live in the territory from May to Oct. 2015, according to that year’s Nunavut Visitor Exit Survey."</seg>
<seg id="10">"The Baffin and Kivalliq regions are the most visited from July to September, 2018."</seg>
<seg id="11">"The island was visited by 95,600 people, of which just over half (53.2 per cent) came to Iqaluit with a budget of $75.1 million."</seg>
<seg id="12">Pond Inlet and Pangnirtung are the second and third communities visited in the Baffin region.</seg>
<seg id="13">"In the Kivalliq region, Rankin Inlet received 33,600 visits and $68 million, followed by Baker Lake and Arviat."</seg>
<seg id="14">Cambridge Bay was one of the Kitikmeot’s most visited communities.</seg>
<seg id="15">Drinks by Wayne Olsen on the research vessel from Georgia to Kimmirut in August 2019.</seg>
<seg id="16">"And in 2018, 3,404 cruise ships arrived in Nunavut within two and a half years."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Cruise ship operators spent $388,351 on community services, the report said."</seg>
<seg id="18">But the weather and ice conditions affected more than half of the vessels that wanted to visit Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The agency received the results of eight passenger operators from 23 traveling in Nunavut from July to September, 2018."</seg>
<seg id="20">"The vessels carried 3,404 passengers in total."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Just over half, or 59 per cent of the passengers travelled to Pond Inlet from Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Iqaluit is the second-largest tourist vessel with 8.3 per cent, followed by Qikiqtarjuaq, which is 6.1 per cent visited and Grise Fiord at 5.9 per cent."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Cruise ship visitors to Pond Inlet did not only spend a total of $245,565, but these visitors were the most visited by 100 hours from 189.5 hours of cruise ship visits in Nunavut, according to the report."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Cambridge Bay, Gjoa Haven, Kimmirut and Kugluktuk were not visited by cruise ships in 2018."</seg>
<seg id="25">"In the report, both Cambridge Bay and Gjoa Haven were expected to receive seven visits, but all were cancelled due to weather."</seg>
<seg id="26">"The report notes that Cambridge Bay and Gjoa Haven had an impact on the cancellation of cruise ship visits that resulted in a total loss of about $25,000."</seg>
<seg id="27">"The feedback from the report came from visitors who were leaving the research vessel in 2018, which surveyed cruise ship operators and other visitors to Nunavut a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="28">"In 2018, the GN had to respond to community concerns from Pond Inlet and Clyde River as a result of these cruise ships going out on the land."</seg>
<seg id="29">"In its report, the GN contacted the organization’s Arctic Research Vessel operators and all cruise ship operators to avoid this."</seg>
<seg id="30">"It also said that while tourism is an independent development, it needs government support for development."</seg>
<seg id="31">"In Nunavut, this means training and employment for Nunavummiut in the tourism sector."</seg>
<seg id="32">"There is always a lack of enthusiasm and expertise for a variety of tourism activities.</seg>
<seg id="33">"In the absence of skilled workers, tourism has not been determined to meet its potential."</seg>
<seg id="34">"Training has been known to focus on tourism in Nunavut," the report said. "</seg>
<seg id="35">"The registration team, Nunavut’s Inuit cruise ship training program, trains 12 people a year to work with passengers on cruise ships to participate in the study, the report said."</seg>
<seg id="36">"In the report, all Government of Nunavut tourism inspectors are Inuit."</seg>
<seg id="37">"As has been in the past, tourism data is often rare, which leads to uncertainty about the size of the economy and its potential to contribute to Nunavut’s economy," the report said. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"Mary River: If its economy is a factor, please bring it forward"</seg>
<seg id="2">Legislators are desperate to get Baffinland’s revenues revealed</seg>
<seg id="3">Participants sit in Iqaluit at Katt Hall on the fourth day of the Nunavut Impact Review Board’s public hearing on Baffinland Iron Mines Corp. "s proposed expansion of its Mary River project.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Nunavut’s practice of enforcing laws on industrial development, which began in 1993 under the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, has not been performed except in areas ranging from environmental and socio-economic studies to the Mary River iron mine over the past decade."</seg>
<seg id="5">"This was posted in Iqaluit earlier this month, when the NIRB held its final public meeting on the $900 million railway expansion proposal from Baffinland Iron Mines Corp." s resignation due to confusion and misunderstanding. "</seg>
<seg id="6">The last day of the meeting, a seven-day arrangement for Pond Inlet was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="7">"At the same time, Baffinland has made billions of dollars, a multi-billion-dollar mine that has been uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="8">"In writing, the Nunavut Impact Review Board has yet to make a decision on the resolution from NTI that, if approved, delays from eight to 12 months."</seg>
<seg id="9">"And Baffinland Iron Mines Corp., the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, said in the near future that they could not support or approve a railway expansion."</seg>
<seg id="10">"But at the QIA level, the Qikiqtaaluk Corporation has said they are in full support of it."</seg>
<seg id="11">We also have Arctic Co-operatives Limited.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is a complex process.</seg>
<seg id="13">"As for Baffinland, the vice president of recycling, Megan Lord-Hoyle, warned that the company is only concerned about the possibility of the project going ahead, saying," We will do everything we can to maintain and protect Canada’s 3,000 jobs, 476 people. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"Last week, Baffinland told Nunatsiaq News that it has suspended 490 southern contractors and 96 contractors for Inuit labour."</seg>
<seg id="15">That’s why we’re up to the biggest unanswered questions on the project: The Mary River budget.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Baffinland says the potential of the mine is unclear unless regulators allow the construction of a 110-kilometre railway into the Mary River area and its production to rise to 12 million tonnes a year, which could result in 176 traffic jams."</seg>
<seg id="17">"The problem is, they haven’t produced a public report that would help."</seg>
<seg id="18">"And in the near future, the vast majority of officials declined to ask questions on this issue."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Last year, although there was no evidence that this did not stop the shareholders from saying what they believe."</seg>
<seg id="20">"For example, in the summer and fall of 2018, the QIA packed with Baffinland, protecting them from the NIRB."</seg>
<seg id="21">"On August 31 of that year, the Nunavut Impact Review Board recommended that the federal government not accept prior and smaller annual production – from 4.2 million tonnes of iron ore to 6 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="22">"So Baffinland and his partner, QIA, did a lot of work."</seg>
<seg id="23">"In a few weeks, they wrote to the chief decision-makers who came here, Dominic LeBlanc, then the federal minister of northern affairs, to reverse the council’s decision."</seg>
<seg id="24">Why?</seg>
<seg id="25">Money.</seg>
<seg id="26">"The Inuit organizations said they were surprised by the Mary River mine’s ability, to contribute hundreds of thousands of dollars and contributions, worth more than $20 million in the new IIBA."</seg>
<seg id="27">Ottawa agreed.</seg>
<seg id="28">"Focused on the QIA’s concerns about the possibility of financing the mine, the federal government approved Baffinland’s proposal last year."</seg>
<seg id="29">"We are also concerned about the potential for a long term use of the Mary River mine and with the knowledge of the QIA’s concerns about the economic development of the project," LeBlanc wrote in a September 30, 2018 letter signed by Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"Instead, the most important member of the public – the federal government – agrees that economic prosperity is important and important to this."</seg>
<seg id="31">And they did that even though there was no financial evidence there.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Because if it’s true that the project is not economically viable, the Member for Baker Lake should want to see what he says."</seg>
<seg id="34">"At all levels of the Mary River project, Baffinland’s employees – as required – must produce hundreds of benefits for this environmental impact statement."</seg>
<seg id="35">"But in terms of the program’s financial capacity, I don’t think the Nunavut Impact Review Board really wants to publish public signs."</seg>
<seg id="36">"For example, the Nunavut Impact Review Board has recommended that a lengthy financial document obtained by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans in the Arctic" does not apply "and that it should not be published on the board’s public registry."</seg>
<seg id="37"> (The document is still on our website.) </seg>
<seg id="38">The Nunavut Impact Review Board recommended that after the document was tabled – and removed from Baffinland’s recommendation.</seg>
<seg id="39">"By contrast, Baffinland chose to give, on its own, a shorter financial statement that explains why Mary River could make more money by creating a bigger economy."</seg>
<seg id="40">This self-determination may be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="41">Even though Baffinland has made some adjustments to that.</seg>
<seg id="42">"In response, the NIRB made a different decision, which does not make any sense."</seg>
<seg id="43">"If the federal government is going to invest in it, then the Federal Income Support Board must do so."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fortunately, the Nunavut Impact Review Board and other regulators must pursue other avenues such as this display."</seg>
<seg id="45">They should be very interested.</seg>
<seg id="46">"As well as Baffinland’s loans on the land, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association."</seg>
<seg id="47">"And due to such concerns as the possibility of another possible outcome, the federal government should amend the federal legislation to regulate the Nunavut Impact Review Board’s practices, the Nunavut Planning Commission and the Program Review Act, to clarify how financial information must be handled in the future."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Unfortunately given the willingness to speak, there are still many questions that have not been answered by Baffinland’s latest expansion proposal, related to the railway’s impact on caribou, the impact of vessels on whales, the project’s lack of Inuit employment, and much more."</seg>
<seg id="49">"A lot of the questions come from Arctic Bay to the south about the railway proposal, which Baffinland approved in 2013 for construction, and 18 million tonnes of production a year. It remains unclear why Baffinland was forced to build in 2013 when it was allowed to produce 18 million tonnes a year."</seg>
<seg id="50">It remains unclear why Baffinland has failed to implement this plan.</seg>
<seg id="51">But the biggest question is how can this project continue to exist.</seg>

<seg id="2">Qanukkanniq Investments in Quebec recently imposed its promises on Quebec</seg>
<seg id="3">When children and teachers were here at the Aqivik Early Childhood Centre in Hudson Bay in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="4">"At that time of year the Quebec government added additional resources to support members of the Early Learning Centre, based on family income."</seg>
<seg id="5">"On November 7, 2019 these funds were banned, with the Early Childhood Education Program set at $8.25 a day."</seg>
<seg id="6"> (Photo courtesy of Nunavik C.c.ca) </seg>
<seg id="7">By Elaine Andrew</seg>
<seg id="8">"The economic restructuring in Quebec has led to more funding for family and child services in Quebec, including Nunavik."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Quebec’s economy was marginalized at about 2.4 per cent in 2018-19, which is 0.6 per cent larger than previously thought."</seg>
<seg id="10">"In this case, the Quebec Finance Minister, Eric Jarrett, announced on November 7 that the $857 million that has been announced will be adhered to in the short term."</seg>
<seg id="11">Two of these will be achieved following the envy of the Child Benefit and Child Benefit.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The renewal of Quebec’s economy and investment demonstrates that Quebec has successfully achieved this," Jarrett said in a news release. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"Economic growth in Quebec gives us the opportunity to reduce debt and bring the government’s promises forward."</seg>
<seg id="14">"As for this contribution, Quebec has banned any additional funding for the Child Welfare Program that was implemented by the Philippine Quebec Liberal government in 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Under this program, an additional contribution to child welfare on top of that is a day of income."</seg>
<seg id="16">That subsidy was increased by $15 a day for high earners.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The families who make more than $50,000 did not receive an increase in the contribution."</seg>
<seg id="18">"The November 7 release will reimburse the Quebec Daycare fee of $8.25, with the exception of an additional payment to all profits."</seg>
<seg id="19">This new fee in Nunavik will be used through the Katimajiit’s entire community government program in Nunavik for child welfare.</seg>
<seg id="20">"According to the Quebec release, this new payment will be for this year, and the Montreal Gazette reported that this will be effective January 1, 2019."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Next week, the head of the childcare services centre in the entire municipality, Julie Ann Peete, was not informed of how or when these payments would start in Nunavik."</seg>
<seg id="22">Premier François Lagerfeld’s government first put in place a slow process to eliminate the use of additional resources and completely eliminate it in 2022.</seg>
<seg id="23">A profitable and emerging budget surplus of $4 billion in the 2019-20 fiscal year has been accelerated.</seg>
<seg id="24">"And as a result of the withdrawal of payments for early childhood education, the Quebec government is making progress towards increasing the number of child tax credits announced in 2021."</seg>
<seg id="25">"As of January 2020, the Quebec government said families in the region will receive an increase of $779 a year."</seg>
<seg id="26">"This grant is tied to income, with a minimum of $1,000 fine of up to $2,515 a year."</seg>
<seg id="27">"This new protocol applies to child equality, which is less than what the Liberal Democrats can afford to pay for the wider pension of the eldest child."</seg>
<seg id="28">"Today, we will complete the implementation of a broad range of strategic investments for Quebec," Jarett said. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"We’re bringing more money back to Quebec faster."</seg>

<seg id="5">"Mr. Kattuk, 69, a respected MLA, Major and a community leader’s home, joined Nunavut at the beginning of February 15, 1999, when voters in Hudson Bay voted for the first Nunavut legislature and they had their first meeting on April 1 of the same year."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Peter Kattuk (left) accompanied by former Commissioner of Nunavut Peter Irniq on April 12, 2000, when Mr. Kattuk was sworn in as Nunavut’s minister."</seg>
<seg id="7">"At the beginning of the Legislative Assembly, Mr. Kattuk was the Minister of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth on April 12, 2000 when he replaced MLA Donald Havioyak, who resigned from his position."</seg>
<seg id="8">"On December 17, 2001, Mr. Kattuk was removed from his portfolio as the Minister of Community and Government Services, which he held until 2004."</seg>
<seg id="9">"And in 2004, Sanikiluaq voters re-elected Mr. Kattuk from Hudson Bay, as an MLA until 2008."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Peter was an ambassador in Hudson Bay for eight years and he was twice elected and some of them are in my thoughts," Nunavut Speaker Simeon Mikkungwak said in a news release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"Born on June 2, 1950, Mr. Kattuk spent many years in Sanikiluaq on environmental issues, as mayor and community leader."</seg>
<seg id="12">"In the early 1990s, he was a member of the Sanikiluaq Impact Review Board, which collects information on the effects of a significant amount of electricity that was generated near Northern Quebec as a result of the effects of ice and sea ice on the Belcher Islands."</seg>
<seg id="13">That’s the result of a report entitled "Hudson Bay Neighbours: A culture known by Inuit and Indigenous people of Hudson Bay."</seg>
<seg id="14">"As mayor of Sanikiluaq, Mr. Kattuk also used to express his dissatisfaction with the current withdrawal of the Churchill Power Plant from the water reservoir."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Subsequent to that, Mr. Kattuk was a member of the Nunavut and Hudson Bay Working Group, named the Nunavut Hudson Bay Neighbours Regional Roundtable."</seg>
<seg id="16">"The group, formed by the Government of Nunavut, Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. and the Hamlet of Sanikiluaq, is monitoring the progress of the neighbourhood of Sanikiluaq on the second hydro project proposal, which has been banned since then, by the Eastern Arctic and the Rupert River."</seg>
<seg id="17">"And in 1996, Katak was a member of the Nunavut Impact Review Board, a body created in 1993 under the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Peter Kattuk speaks at the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut on February 19, 2008, at the end of his second term in Hudson Bay."</seg>

<seg id="20">"Paul Okalik, then the premier of Nunavut, appointed Mr. Kattuk as the Minister of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth in April 2000, saying Mr. Kattuk had produced Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit before it was too much information."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Peter was involved in the study of Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit a long time ago when it wasn’t fully known," Mr. Okalik said in a news release in April 2000. "</seg>
<seg id="22">"Prior to my career as minister in 2001, Mr. Kattuk had to deal with the" terrible "bedbug.</seg>
<seg id="23">That happened when NTCL shipped the gasoline to Nunavut and destroyed the snowmobile engines in the Baffin and Kivalliq regions.</seg>

<seg id="6">Members of the Legislative Assembly, Shelby Pereira, won the presidential election by a whopping 37.7 per cent of the vote.</seg>
<seg id="7">"While the Black Quebec MLAs are more vocal in French, he said he was looking for an Inuktitut translator to work with him."</seg>
<seg id="8">"I want to make a clear statement on the needs of Indigenous communities," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"So far, Pope said there are two critical areas of urgency in Nunavik that he is aware of with respect to health and housing."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Even though health care is a provincial jurisdiction, it’s a federal program," said Poppy. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"In order to increase its health benefits, the federal government must consider how it allocates it."</seg>
<seg id="12">Pauktuutit has been working on health issues for over 30 years.</seg>
<seg id="13">"During the Black Quebec campaign, the group said the province needs 10,000 units over the next decade."</seg>
<seg id="14">"In this case Pope has been talking about a lot, a lot of material for a variety of designs."</seg>
<seg id="15">"If we want this new government to move the Liberal Party forward, then we have to find a solution," Pope said. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"This new MLA may not be seen in Nunavik, but he hopes to attend the next annual general meeting of Makivik, which will be held in March."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Following his election in Peru, Makivik President Charlie Watt issued a news release inviting him to visit Pope Bay as soon as possible."</seg>
<seg id="18">"I look forward to meeting with him, and his support is welcomed by our efforts to support entrepreneurship and the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples," Watt said. "</seg>

<seg id="1">Trudeau government 2.0: Don’t expect too much.</seg>
<seg id="2">"If you have a good idea, don’t expect too much."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Jane Webb then served as Indigenous services minister on March 23, 2018, alongside ITK President Natan Obed, when she announced that the federal government would eliminate Inuit Nunangat by 2030."</seg>
<seg id="4">Less than a year ago he resigned as a federal politician.</seg>
<seg id="5">Or did you find that during the federal election campaign or any of the premiers did not specifically address the needs of Nunavummiut and other northerners.</seg>
<seg id="6">That is no surprise.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The more important politicians seem to think that the vast majority of Canadians, because in the south, there’s not enough voter turnout even if they’re talking about the North that the majority of Canadians have never heard of."</seg>
<seg id="8">"The Liberal government made this known, in a way that sparked a backlash and revealed a much-delayed Arctic and Arctic policy framework a day before the election."</seg>
<seg id="9">"During the campaign, primarily Indigenous perspectives, many northerners raised concerns, which were not taken lightly."</seg>
<seg id="10">"As a result of a new decline in Justin Trudeau’s new government, and the panel was sworn in on its agenda last November 20, it is likely that they will continue to do so in a way that they don’t seem to care."</seg>
<seg id="11">This is one of the signs.</seg>
<seg id="12">That’s because of the noticeable promises made by the North since Trudeau’s government became president in 2015: Eliminate or impose 50 per cent (50 per cent) of tuberculosis in Inuit Nunangat by 2025 and eventually eliminate it by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="13">"This included an initial contribution of $27.5 million over five years, which will be made" by four members of the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"But it was suggested that it was a disaster as a result of its promise, starting with, that the TB genocide specialist for the federal government, Jane Webb, the former Indigenous services minister had said that."</seg>
<seg id="15">He resigned from Trudeau’s lawyers on March 4 after he criticized Trudeau for not doing a good job on Judy Wilkinson-Raybould.</seg>
<seg id="16">He did that within four days before Trudeau traveled to Iqaluit to apologize to Canada for inappropriate treatment of people with tuberculosis in the 1950s and 1960s.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Since then, they have remained silent on the issue of Arctic tuberculosis."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Despite all the campaigns, this was not done much."</seg>
<seg id="19">"And so far, tuberculosis prevention has stalled."</seg>
<seg id="20">"For example, in Nunatsiavut, where cases of tuberculosis occurred between 2006 and 2016 and recorded 248.5 per 100,000 people, the Department of Health has done only one community survey."</seg>
<seg id="21">"They did this to Nine, in 2018, when there was a tuberculosis disease and a boy in a 14-year-old boy died at the hospital in Jane Johnston."</seg>
<seg id="22">"In Nunavik, 313 people suffered from tuberculosis between 2006 and 2016, which is accompanied by tuberculosis in Inuit Nunangat, 234 of the 100,000 cases."</seg>
<seg id="23">"But it doesn’t appear that there have been any community surveys in Nunavik since 2018, when the FBI issued a news release."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Indeed Nunavut’s most recent population surveyed the outbreak of tuberculosis, when Stephen Harper and the Conservative Party became prime minister, long before Trudeau’s Liberal Democrats were elected."</seg>
<seg id="25">"For Nunavut, there have been 670 people diagnosed with tuberculosis between 2006 and 2016, up from 171.8 out of 100.000 and there has been some work done on that."</seg>
<seg id="26"> (One thing that has not been affected is the Inuvialuit region of the Northwest Territories.</seg>
<seg id="27">"At that time, there was no confirmed cases of tuberculosis between 2007 and 2016."</seg>
<seg id="28">Tuberculosis is a disease that is lacking.</seg>
<seg id="29">That’s why we’re talking about it.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it’s true.</seg>
<seg id="31">"If people do not have adequate food and housing, tuberculosis can develop."</seg>
<seg id="32">"On the other hand, poverty in Cape Dorset, where the 12-week TB test ended in May."</seg>
<seg id="33">The 2016 unemployment rate was 27.3 percent.</seg>
<seg id="34">"In 2015, the average age of 15 earned more than $18,933."</seg>
<seg id="35">"From the 370 units, 120 units were in critical need of repair."</seg>
<seg id="36">"According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the following 140 units of 370 units were reported as" uninhabitable "under the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. Act."</seg>
<seg id="37">This means that there is a lack of classrooms per capita.</seg>
<seg id="38">There are also a few people in Canada who are not provided with housing.</seg>
<seg id="39">"It is no surprise that over the last 20 years, tuberculosis has been an emergency for Nunavut and other parts of the Arctic."</seg>
<seg id="40">And it’s hard to imagine that tuberculosis could be eliminated in those communities unless there’s a major change in the way housing is increased and better.</seg>
<seg id="41">"But during the last campaign, Trudeau’s lawyers did not offer any public housing, but reiterated their 2016 and 2017 budget commitments."</seg>
<seg id="42">"In this case, they could not even be accused of violating their language, nor did they have any concerns about it."</seg>
<seg id="43">"This also reveals what has happened to the national epidemiological emergency, where tuberculosis in Inuit Nunangat has more than 300 times the rate of tuberculosis among non-Indigenous Canadians born in Canada."</seg>
<seg id="44">"In Nunavut, it could be worse."</seg>
<seg id="45">Last year’s report found that one in 100 babies born in Nunavut may have this disease.</seg>
<seg id="46">"When they are not overly concerned about emergencies of the disease, what is the concern of the Trudeau Liberal government about other issues such as mental health, community housing, more education and more?"</seg>
<seg id="47">"If you have a good idea, don’t expect too much."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Otherwise, plan for a bankruptcy."</seg>
<seg id="49">"Note: The number of cases of tuberculosis sustained from Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami’s" Inuit Tuberculosis Elimination Framework ," released in November 2018."</seg>

<seg id="5">"After months of severe staff shortages, Kativik’s entire community police force can now see its efforts to recruit additional officers,"</seg>
<seg id="6">The Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superintendent Jean-Pierre Lawrence appeared before the committee to provide an update on the Katimajiit’s overall municipal government meeting on November 26 to date.</seg>
<seg id="7">This included the passing of 10 new constables in every community by the RCMP from the Ontario Police Academy in the same week.</seg>
<seg id="8">The hiring process also included people who had worked for the senior citizens who had retired to talk to them about employment at the centre.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Due to failure to recruit, the centre in every community has RCMP detachments in Quebec with the RCMP, led by Sergeant Quebec."</seg>
<seg id="10">"In September, there were 20 Quebec RCMP officers in Nunavik."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Quebec’s police force has been declining slowly as the centre is trying to recruit all community constables, and Lawrence said in early 2020 that they may no longer use the Quebec police force."</seg>
<seg id="12">Cultural awareness training begins</seg>
<seg id="13">The Inuit cultural orientation training centre in every community was posted online on November 18.</seg>
<seg id="14">"The training was organized by the Katimajiit of all communities of the RCMP and Laval University and included information on Nunavik’s issues, Inuit culture, and policing practices in the area of Nunavik."</seg>
<seg id="15">"This is a three-hour training program and once completed it is assessed by a newly trained person, which is described as a job application."</seg>
<seg id="16">"This training is intended to support the Katimajiit in choosing a culture of opinion," Lawrence said. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"The second trainee is nine hours long and requires all officers to be trained, said Lawrence."</seg>
<seg id="18">This is expected to be completed by the end of the new fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="19">Security cameras will be required for RCMP officers</seg>
<seg id="20">Another area that was added to the RCMP and was appreciated by the members is the need to have security cameras in place for officers to work.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is a pilot project and they’re using six cameras right now.</seg>
<seg id="22">"This exercise was driven by Nunavik’s desire to bring the centre to every community where the RCMP can be more transparent in their work," Lawrence said. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"The Katimajiit is aimed at ensuring that all community constables are able to access and live together."</seg>
<seg id="24">Churchill Councillor Jobie Takiapik hoped that these cameras could help people who have had problems with the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="25">"We hear from the RCMP about inappropriate behaviour and they don’t want to say anything.</seg>
<seg id="26">"They’re shocked by the police," Takiapik said. "</seg>
<seg id="27">"These are body cameras that need to be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">"He added that if only one or two police officers abused Inuit, this has a huge impact, and it becomes a concern for all the RCMP."</seg>
<seg id="29">"He thinks that when they take photographs, they start taking photographs of what the RCMP is doing, in the short term."</seg>
<seg id="30">Lawrence said those cameras will be in effect in January.</seg>
<seg id="31">He added that the abusive and inappropriate actions will not only be offered by the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I also recently suspended a police officer last week for failing to comply with our mandate in Nunavik," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="33">"We don’t want police officers especially in Nunavik."</seg>

<seg id="1">Nunavut’s neighbours discuss renewable energy in the Arctic</seg>
<seg id="2">"Representatives from Greenland, Canada and the United States discuss ideas and experiences"</seg>
<seg id="3">"Bruno Pereira, president of the Qulliq Energy Corporation reveals at the Arctic Strengthening and Community Conference in Iqaluit, November 22, 2019."</seg>
<seg id="4"> (Image courtesy of the American Consulting Group) </seg>
<seg id="5">Renewable energy experts from the Arctic gathered in Iqaluit on November 21 and 22 to consider and share their findings in the Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Attendees from Nunavut, the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, Greenland and the United States discussed the collapse of various activities in different communities."</seg>
<seg id="7">"The merger, entitled Opportunities, Incentive New Technology and Entrepreneurship Studies (Improvement) operated, incorporating new technologies and engagement with stakeholders, was organized by the U.S. President of the Qulliq Energy Corporation and the Government of Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Bruno Pereira, the president of the Qulliq Energy Corporation, said the merger confirmed the problems."</seg>
<seg id="9">"In light of the desire to invest in renewable energy in our communities, we really want to know what other people do, and to see how they have achieved their job or their collapse," Pereira said. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"Pereira also said that despite the important gathering of representatives to discuss the issue of fossil fuels, Nunavut has a number of events here in Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Some communities have access roads so they’re not in a small population in Nunavut communities.</seg>
<seg id="12">"But like those of us who struggle, in this capacity, to deal with communities, we can see similar challenges."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Chris O’Rourke, the executive director of renewable energy in Alaska, said Alaska’s energy contribution has contributed to renewable energy development."</seg>
<seg id="14">"So we were able to build 80 communities that were able to use renewable energy on top of the diesel.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We think that we now know how beneficial this is," Roos said. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"This fund, which is designed to promote recycling in the economic development sector, is also a major contributor to Alaska’s reduction in energy costs."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Roos said that in Russia’s south-west, five communities are working together to develop wind turbines and they’re using that for energy."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Now there is a consolidated knowledge of how to manage and manage wind turbines and they can help each other to develop them," Roos said. "</seg>
<seg id="19">"In Alaska, like Nunavut, home electricity bills are very expensive."</seg>
<seg id="20">O’Rourke said communities are using wind turbines not only for electricity but also for heating fuel.</seg>
<seg id="21">"What they have done is put small furnaces into public housing which are covered in diamonds that look like flooring.</seg>
<seg id="22">"When the wind gets warmer, they go to the power plant, and they have set up a small tracking system for heating and electricity," Roos said. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"These are covered in hot temperatures, which can remain warm."</seg>
<seg id="24">"They can be turned off or burned in homes that are acceptable, and if they are stuck in a different heating system."</seg>
<seg id="25">"But in Greenland, the installation of wind turbines has been difficult, according to News Eric Higgins, a technical expert on recycling in Nuuk."</seg>
<seg id="26">"High temperatures and darkness have made it impossible for wind turbines to come to the south to be built in the Arctic, said Haggard."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Higgins also said there were two wind turbines that were properly installed elsewhere in North Carolina, but they failed."</seg>
<seg id="28">"We can also say that in Greenland we have chosen a more reliable source of resources.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Even the two wind turbines that were installed in 200 different locations will be inspected and the other one in 150 sites will be inspected," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"One of the windshields fell, on the other hand, the fuel was too thick for the cold and the engine was damaged, Haggard said."</seg>
<seg id="31">"During the 2019 federal election campaign, three politicians said that if elected, Nunavut’s Tesla fuel will be banned by 2030."</seg>
<seg id="32">"While it may take some time to develop a recycling program that can be used in the Arctic, Higgins said the elimination of fossil fuels is urgent."</seg>
<seg id="33">"We have to do something to get away from fossil fuels, for climate change, because there is already a problem now."</seg>
<seg id="34">This is for legal purposes because if you’re not going to use fuel you have to have equipment but there’s no money.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Financially good work, he said."</seg>
<seg id="36">Pereira said it’s noticeable to have a conversation with Nunavut’s neighbourhood residents in the Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="37">"I think that’s something else that needs to be considered, that’s how to start working towards implementing recycling."</seg>
<seg id="38">Some people have used the technology and they have had problems with the southern counterparts but they can’t do it in the Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="39">"If we are financially capable we will be able to track the problems," Pereira said. "</seg>

<seg id="1">The Government of Nunavut must involve Inuit in the development of the Education Act: NTI</seg>
<seg id="2">"This is an important policy change that will affect thousands of Inuit parents and Inuit children in Nunavut"</seg>
<seg id="3">"Aluki Kotierk, the president of NTI, speaks during the Standing Committee on Legislation on Bill 25, an Act to Amend the Education Act and the Inuit Language Protection Act."</seg>
<seg id="4">"By Aluki Kotierk President, Nunavut Tunngavik Inc."</seg>
<seg id="5">Issue: Minister Joanasie’s Letter from Nunatsiaq News on Bill 25</seg>
<seg id="6">"Minister Joanasie wrote a letter to Nunatsiaq News on November 25, 2019 concerning discussions between the Department of Education and Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated concerning Bill 25, indicating that these discussions were conducted in a religious manner and offered NTI the opportunity to address their concerns."</seg>
<seg id="7">In the minister’s view, he encouraged NTI to participate in public hearings and NTI’s hearings that the Government of Nunavut is looking at working with previous meetings.</seg>
<seg id="8">That’s not the case.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Inuit rights under Article 32 of the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement must be included in the development of social and cultural policies, as well as the development of social and cultural programs and services, including governance."</seg>
<seg id="10">It’s a different foundation.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bill 25 proposes amendments to the Education Act and the Inuit Language Protection Act to reflect the policies and procedures of the Inuit language.</seg>
<seg id="12">The foundation for this policy change will affect many people with children and people with children in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Meanwhile, Inuit have the right to participate in the development and restructuring."</seg>
<seg id="14">NTI was not given the opportunity to participate in the development of policy proposals outlined in the proposed Bill 25.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It is not only violating the government’s obligations as outlined in the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, it is a practice that demonstrates that efforts have been made to achieve a common goal that is more inclusive of Inuit goals and objectives."</seg>
<seg id="16">"NTI has been working with the Government of Nunavut, such as the Inuit Language Protection Act, the Official Languages Act and the Wildlife Act."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Knowing that it can continue, NTI contacted the Premier and the newly elected government to co-ordinate and cooperate on Inuit priorities, including education, language and culture."</seg>
<seg id="18">"The Department of Education did not submit the proposed legislation to NTI until August 31, 2018, when the department submitted a draft plan for community consultations."</seg>
<seg id="19">NTI was given less than a week to study Bill 25 and to plan and prepare for the Nunavut consultation tour.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is not a working relationship.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The department coordinated the consultation process in the near future, and did not come up with any solutions or accommodation issues raised by the public, NTI and other organizations such as the District Education Authorities (District Education Authorities) and the Coalition of Nunavut District Education Authorities (CNDA) were also present."</seg>
<seg id="22">"I further urge the Minister of Education to work with the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement to ensure that the mandate is fulfilled by Article 32, and that the department must take full responsibility for its purposes, obligations and obligations and adopts the honour of the Queen when it comes to partnering with Inuit."</seg>
<seg id="23">"NTI believes the rewriting of the Education Act by passing the Inuit Participation in the Framework must change the way the department operates, and as a whole recognize the rights of Inuit," he wrote.</seg>
