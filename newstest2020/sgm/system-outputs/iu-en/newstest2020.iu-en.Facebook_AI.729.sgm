<seg id="66">&gt;&gt;House commenced at 13:33</seg>
<seg id="67">Speaker (Hon. Joe Enook) (interpretation): Mr. Quassa, can you say the opening prayer, please.</seg>
<seg id="68">Speaker (interpretation): Good afternoon, Premier, Members, and Nunavummiut who are listening to the radio broadcast and watching the televised proceedings. Welcome to your committee.</seg>
<seg id="69">At this time, we will proceed with the orders of the day.</seg>
<seg id="70">Premier of Nunavut, Mr. Quassa.</seg>
<seg id="71">Minister’s Statement 046 – 2(1): Nunavut 2018 Youth Award Winner (Quassa)</seg>
<seg id="72">Hon. Paul Quassa (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="73">I say “good day” to my fellow residents of Igloolik, my colleagues, and all Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="74">I would like my colleagues to join me in congratulating Dr. Donna Maynard-Kimmaliardjuk on her award for the 2018 Youth Parliament in Winnipeg.</seg>
<seg id="75">She is the first Inuk nurse to receive this honour.</seg>
<seg id="76">Dr. Kimmaliardjuk was born in Chesterfield Inlet and he was the first Inuk cardiologist.</seg>
<seg id="77">This is the fourth year of a six-year program at the University of Ottawa’s Heart Institute.</seg>
<seg id="78">Mr. Speaker, Dr. Kimmaliardjuk was able to be admitted to the Qikiqtani General Hospital in 2014 and he is the only registered heart specialist in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="79">In 2016, she became a member of the Aboriginal Peoples’ Advisory Committee on AIDS, which represents Inuit.</seg>
<seg id="80">During his time as a Member of the Legislative Assembly, he promoted Inuit health issues and Inuit culture.</seg>
<seg id="81">Mr. Speaker, these awards represent the highest honour of our aboriginal peoples.</seg>
<seg id="82">The scholarship celebrates its 25th anniversary in 2018 and honours 350 aboriginal, Inuit, and Métis students who have demonstrated outstanding achievement.</seg>
<seg id="83">These awards celebrate a culture that reflects the diversity of indigenous peoples in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="84">This year’s awards ceremony will be held on March 23 in Winnipeg.</seg>
<seg id="85">I would like to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Dr. Kimmaliardjuk on his recognition.</seg>
<seg id="86">She has devoted her time and energy to celebrating Inuit societal values and healthy living, and she is a role model for our youth in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="87">As I stated in my Member’s Statement, I would like to extend my congratulations to Dr. Kimmaliardjuk, as it is obvious that his work will be very important to us.</seg>
<seg id="88">Minister of Justice, Mr. Iqaqrialu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Minister’s Statement 047 – 2(1): Rankin Inlet Healing Facility Swing (Iqaluit)</seg>
<seg id="90">Hon. Jeannie Iqaqrialu (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) I rise today to talk about the cultural sewing program for men at the Rankin Inlet Healing Facility.</seg>
<seg id="91">These inmates are involved in sealskin preparation, sealskin preparation, and other activities, including making parka, sealskin pants, sealskin pants, sealskin bags, and sealskin garments.</seg>
<seg id="92">The program is run by Rosemary Angutingaaq Sandy, a respected elder and seamstress who is well known worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="93">He recently went to Norway to teach sealskins.</seg>
<seg id="94">She was a student at Nunavut Arctic College’s Fur Production and Design Program and initiated the Fur Program with the Literacy Council of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="95">Rosemary supports inmates in providing culturally appropriate, healthy, and safe Inuit language and cultural healing programs.</seg>
<seg id="96">The sewing program will work with and support on-the-land programs where inmates learn how to hunt and how to properly prepare skins and food.</seg>
<seg id="97">These furs and skins will be used in the sewing program.</seg>
<seg id="98">Programs such as this provide inmates with the opportunity to reintegrate into the community once their sentence is over and to apply for rehabilitation instead of criminal behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="99">I recently visited the Rankin Inlet Healing Facility and was pleased to note the positive impact that the Piqqusilirivvik programming has had on the community’s elders, such as Rosemary Shawn.</seg>
<seg id="100">Minister of Family Services, Mr. Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="101">Minister’s Statement 048 – 4(2): Red Seal Certificate Program (Savikataaq)</seg>
<seg id="102">Hon. Joe Savikataaq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I say “good day” to the people of Arviat.</seg>
<seg id="103">Mr. Speaker, this program is for certified heavy equipment operators, loaders, and mechanics.</seg>
<seg id="104">In September 2016, heavy equipment operator training was offered in all three regions of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="105">This allows Nunavummiut to take advantage of the Nunavut Apprenticeship Program and the Certificate Program, known as the Certificate Program.</seg>
<seg id="106">In November of 2017, Nunavut received the Red Seal certification for heavy equipment operators and heavy duty technicians.</seg>
<seg id="107">Mr. Speaker, as part of the Heavy Equipment Operator Program, this program exceeds the provincial and territorial certification standards. It promotes the knowledge, skills, and abilities of heavy equipment operators across Canada.</seg>
<seg id="108">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to announce that we have been able to provide Nunavummiut with a national award in recognition of the outstanding achievements of Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="109">Minister of Education, Minister Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="110">Minister’s Statement 049 – 2(1): New Funding for Early Childhood Programs (Joanasie)</seg>
<seg id="111">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon, my colleagues, the people of Cape Dorset, Kimmirut, and Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="112">Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure today to announce that the Department of Education will be making operations and maintenance funding available to eligible daycares.</seg>
<seg id="113">Mr. Speaker, these increases are the result of a three-year program plan that my department developed for early childhood education and daycares as a result of a bilateral agreement signed in September 2017 with the Government of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="114">Mr. Speaker, this current fiscal year will see eligible daycares receive increased funding ranging from a minimum of $1,918.80 to a maximum of $45,494.80 depending on the number, type, and location of the daycare.</seg>
<seg id="115">As long as the daycares do not increase their tuition and fees, they will be eligible for similar funding in the next fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="116">Mr. Speaker, this funding will not only help daycares with operating expenses, it will also help families with child care expenses without increasing their costs.</seg>
<seg id="117">Mr. Speaker, we are proud to be able to provide this funding to support daycares and families.</seg>
<seg id="118">I also believe, and I am sure that we all believe that this funding will have a positive impact on the stability of both the funding and the daycare expenses.</seg>
<seg id="119">Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Ms. Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="120">Minister’s Statement 050 – 2(1): Nunavut Mining Symposium</seg>
<seg id="121">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik (interpretation): Good day to the people of Nunavut and my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="122">Mr. Speaker, the mining sector is a cornerstone of Nunavut’s economic development.</seg>
<seg id="123">The department is committed to supporting the mining sector to ensure that Nunavummiut benefit from such activities.</seg>
<seg id="124">Mr. Speaker, representatives from across Canada will be in Iqaluit for the 21st annual Nunavut Mining Symposium from April 9 to 12, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="125">This conference provides an excellent opportunity for Inuit to explore new opportunities in Nunavut’s mineral exploration and mining sector and to ensure that our communities are aware and involved in mineral exploration and mining in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="126">We expect that this year’s mining symposium will continue to be one of the best attended events in Nunavut and we expect more than 400 participants to attend.</seg>
<seg id="127">Mr. Speaker, I look forward to welcoming mining companies, Inuit organizations, exploration companies, community representatives, and other stakeholders to this important meeting.</seg>
<seg id="128">Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would like to encourage all Members of the Legislative Assembly and the public to attend this public event on April 11.</seg>
<seg id="129">It’s not just an opportunity to come up with some good ideas, but also to look at the impact that search and rescue has on the people involved.</seg>
<seg id="130">Members’ Statements. Member for Hudson Bay, Mr. Rumbolt.</seg>
<seg id="131">Member’s Statement 096 – 2(1): Happy Fifth Birthday to Grandchild (Rumbolt)</seg>
<seg id="132">Mr. Speaker, five years ago to this day, the former Speaker of the Legislative Assembly rose in this House to announce the birth of my first grandson. This is the first time in five years that I have had a grandson.</seg>
<seg id="133">Happy birthday, Jayden.</seg>
<seg id="134">Member for Netsilik, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="135">Member’s Statement 097 – 4(1): Kitikmeot Youth Empowerment (Qirngnuq)</seg>
<seg id="136">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="137">What I’m going to be talking about is something that is very good for young people to think about and to plan for their future.</seg>
<seg id="138">I rise today to share some good news with my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="139">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to inform the House that Inuit youth from across the Kitikmeot will be gathering in Cambridge Bay next week for the 2018 Kitikmeot Youth Empowerment Conference.</seg>
<seg id="140">Mr. Speaker, this gathering provides an opportunity for the Kitikmeot youth to meet and discuss their priorities and concerns with the youth.</seg>
<seg id="141">This includes:</seg>
<seg id="142">Mental wellness;</seg>
<seg id="143">Youth facilities;</seg>
<seg id="144">Experience;</seg>
<seg id="145">Promoting Inuit societal values, residential school solutions, and reconciliation; and</seg>
<seg id="146">The protection of the Inuit language and culture.</seg>
<seg id="147">Mr. Speaker, the participants from Taloyoak are:</seg>
<seg id="148">Judy Crow;</seg>
<seg id="149">David Tungilik;</seg>
<seg id="150">Harold Paniyuk;</seg>

<seg id="154">Becky Makittuq;</seg>
<seg id="155">Brenda Rose Arqviq Qirngnuq;</seg>

<seg id="157">Chantel Kanayuk Qirngnuq; and</seg>
<seg id="158">Pauline Illuitok.</seg>
<seg id="159">Mr. Speaker, I ask all members to join me in wishing them the best of luck in their gathering.</seg>
<seg id="160">Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, Mr. Lightstone.</seg>
<seg id="161">Member’s Statement 098 – 2(1): Tobacco Control Act (McLean)</seg>
<seg id="162">Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="163">I rise today to address concerns that have been brought to my attention by a number of my constituents concerning the issue of marijuana legalization.</seg>
<seg id="164">I just recently received a letter and it says, “All of my family members in Iqaluit live in public housing units.</seg>
<seg id="165">Over the last couple of years we have had to smoke, we have had to move because the smell, the smoke coming into my house is very strong.”</seg>
<seg id="166">The letter goes on to state that, and I quote, “I am deeply concerned about the impact of second-hand smoke on my children and others who are in this situation.”</seg>
<seg id="167">Mr. Speaker, as residents of Iqaluit, my family and I share an apartment building.</seg>
<seg id="168">Mr. Speaker, second-hand smoke affects other people who do not smoke.</seg>
<seg id="169">It has been a long time since people have been aware of the harmful effects of second-hand smoke and the government has passed legislation that prohibits smoking in public places.</seg>
<seg id="170">As a father with children, I don’t want them to be affected by these types of illnesses that are associated with tobacco, and marijuana smoke.</seg>
<seg id="171">As my colleague from Pangnirtung pointed out, the member asked a question to the Minister of Health about the health consequences of marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="172">I have spoken to a number of my constituents who have similar concerns.</seg>
<seg id="173">Mr. Speaker, I recognize that when you’re dealing with a situation like this, you have to try and balance things out.</seg>
<seg id="174">The federal government’s new Tobacco Damage Prevention Act will come into force in a few months.</seg>
<seg id="175">I would like to ask for unanimous consent to conclude my statement.</seg>
<seg id="176">The member is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statement. Are there any nays?</seg>
<seg id="177">Mr. Lightstone, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="178">Thank you, my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="179">Under this legislation, elders will be able to possess and smoke marijuana. However, the government will have to make a decision on how to regulate where smoking is permitted within the community.</seg>
<seg id="180">Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet also noted last week that the government’s own research and results indicate that there is a concern about the agricultural use and consumption of public housing and condominium units.</seg>
<seg id="181">Mr. Speaker, I believe that when this legislation is introduced in the Legislative Assembly, it will be necessary to clearly articulate these concerns and I look forward to working with my colleagues to achieve the best possible solution.</seg>
<seg id="182">Before we proceed, I would like to inform members that our colleague, Mr. Akoak, is not here due to illness.</seg>
<seg id="183">I wish Mr. Akoak a speedy recovery.</seg>
<seg id="184">Member for Baker Lake, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="185">Member’s Statement 099 – 2(1): Increase Education Opportunities in Baker Lake (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="186">Mr. Mikkungwak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="187">I say “hello” to the people of Baker Lake and all Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="188">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage our government to increase training opportunities in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="189">Mr. Speaker, Baker Lake is a rapidly growing community and it will be important that efforts are made now to provide more training and employment opportunities for the residents of Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="190">Mr. Speaker, Piqqusilirivvik operates a number of programs in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="191">This can be greatly expanded so that the public will have a better understanding and experience of Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit.</seg>
<seg id="192">Mr. Speaker, the idea of establishing a university in Nunavut has been raised, and Agnico Eagle Mines has indicated that it would be willing to support such a move.</seg>
<seg id="193">I think it would be best if it was put in the centre of Nunavut because it’s also the centre of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="194">Mr. Speaker, one of my colleagues said that it’s very important that we take these things as soon as possible before they pass.</seg>
<seg id="195">The wheels of government move very slowly, but in spite of that, we must encourage and push forward when opportunities arise in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="196">Mr. Speaker, this is the beginning of our term as the Fifth Legislative Assembly, and I, too, would like to see us take a big step forward.</seg>
<seg id="197">Expanding educational opportunities in communities such as Baker Lake would be a positive step forward.</seg>
<seg id="198">Member for Kugluktuk, Ms. Kamingoak.</seg>
<seg id="199">Member’s Statement 100 – 2(1): Issues with the Larga Boarding Home</seg>
<seg id="200">Mr. Kamingoak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="201">Good afternoon, colleagues, Kuglukturmiut, and Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="202">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage the government to more closely monitor the daily operations of medical boarding homes.</seg>
<seg id="203">Mr. Speaker, a number of my constituents have brought forward concerns that they feel should have been dealt with a long time ago.</seg>
<seg id="204">It’s a food problem, it’s a waste problem, and it’s been going on for months.</seg>
<seg id="205">Mr. Speaker, it is important that the government ensures that the services that are paid for by Nunavummiut are actually delivered.</seg>
<seg id="206">I understand that the boarding homes require a lot of people to stay at the boarding home on a daily basis but it is also important that they are comfortable and well looked after.</seg>
<seg id="207">Mr. Speaker, it is unclear whether boarding homes will be included in the review of the Medical Travel Policy.</seg>
<seg id="208">I look forward to the results of the review and the recommendations that will be made to improve the services and conditions of the boarding homes.</seg>
<seg id="209">Member for Aivilik, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="210">Member’s Statement 101 – 2(1): Congratulate Rosaline Ejangiaq (Netser)</seg>
<seg id="211">Mr. Netser (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) I rise today to congratulate Rosaline Ejangiaq of Repulse Bay.</seg>
<seg id="212">He is a young man who has graduated from high school but has worked very hard and has been recognized as a recipient of the Horace Elder Canada Scholarship.</seg>
<seg id="213">Mr. Speaker, the Horace Elder Canada Scholarship is a scholarship that is awarded to post-secondary students who, despite some difficulties, are able to successfully complete their studies.</seg>
<seg id="214">Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize Ms. Ejangiaq for her perseverance and her commitment to continuing her education.</seg>
<seg id="215">Many of our young people are struggling with the challenges and barriers that they face in completing their high school education.</seg>
<seg id="216">I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating him on his achievement. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="217">Member for Pangnirtung, Ms. Nakasuk.</seg>
<seg id="218">Member’s Statement 102 – 2(1): Poisey Mike Recognized Under Canada 150 (Netser)</seg>
<seg id="219">Mr. Nakasuk (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="220">Good afternoon, my colleagues, my relatives, and the people of Pangnirtung.</seg>
<seg id="221">I rise this afternoon to congratulate one of my constituents from Pangnirtung who was recognized by Dennis Patterson.</seg>
<seg id="222">I would also like to congratulate a person who has been volunteering for 18 years for search and rescue in Pangnirtung. Poisey Mike has been volunteering for the search and rescue for 18 years and I would like to congratulate him.</seg>
<seg id="223">The last name on my list, Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="224">Member’s Statement 103 – 2(1): Budget Reflections</seg>
<seg id="225">Ms. Main (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="226">I say “good day” to the people who are watching the video.</seg>
<seg id="227">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer some observations and recommendations concerning the government’s financial management practices.</seg>
<seg id="228">Mr. Speaker, for those of us who are new to this House, the past two weeks have been a learning experience.</seg>
<seg id="229">Mr. Speaker, as Chair of the Regular Members’ Caucus of the Legislative Assembly, I would like to express my appreciation to all of my colleagues for the opportunity to work together since the beginning of the new Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="230">Mr. Speaker, I am proud to say that we made a strong public statement on Friday that the Legislative Assembly will not tolerate and that the government must respect its own procurement laws.</seg>
<seg id="231">Ms. Main (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My colleague from Iqaluit-Tasiluk introduced a very important motion on Friday and I look forward to moving this motion when the House reconvenes for its spring sitting.</seg>
<seg id="232">Mr. Speaker, although we are a territorial government, this one is not always working well.</seg>
<seg id="233">For example, last week, I indicated in my opening comments that when we were dealing with the college’s capital budget, the government listened to our concerns and even changed its budget.</seg>
<seg id="234">I look forward to seeing more of that in the coming weeks and years, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="235">Mr. Speaker, over the last few weeks, Members of the Legislative Assembly have been asking a lot of questions on a daily basis.</seg>
<seg id="236">I think it’s fair to say that now that we have identified our goals, it’s clear that we need to do more research on the government’s expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="237">It is not enough if we are just counting the amount of money that is going out.</seg>
<seg id="238">I would like to ask for unanimous consent to conclude my statement, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="239">The member is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statement. Are there any nays?</seg>
<seg id="240">Mr. Main, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="241">Mr. Main: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="242">Mr. Speaker, I am referring to the issue of measuring outcomes.</seg>
<seg id="243">Mr. Speaker, I believe that this information should be made public in the Legislative Assembly so that we, as elected Members of the Legislative Assembly, can make informed decisions: should any of our expenditures be increased, decreased, altered, or eliminated in order to deal with our limited resources?</seg>
<seg id="244">Mr. Speaker, I will cite the following examples.</seg>
<seg id="245">I think we can all agree that the way the government administers the tax rebate for harvesters, there is not enough support for the harvesters.</seg>
<seg id="246">The Department of Environment, which administers the government’s Harvester Support Program, must carefully review its programs and determine what improvements can be made to target harvesters to help offset the high cost of fuel.</seg>
<seg id="247">Mr. Speaker, I will also take this opportunity to provide further examples of the government’s grants and contributions spending.</seg>
<seg id="248">We know that the government has spent a lot of money on developing incentives.</seg>
<seg id="249">We are aware of the amount of money that has been borrowed by commercial enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="250">We know who was given the money.</seg>
<seg id="251">We don’t know what this money was used for.</seg>
<seg id="252">We don’t know how many Inuit were hired by Nunavummiut from that fund and we don’t even know what the money was used for.</seg>
<seg id="253">Mr. Speaker, as you know, I can talk about these issues for a long time, but I will stop there.</seg>
<seg id="254">I would like to add that I look forward to reviewing the budget process in the Legislative Assembly and I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to strengthen our budget in support of all of our communities and constituents.</seg>
<seg id="255">Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="256">Member’s Statement 104 – 2(1): Two More Elders Travelling for Care (Tootoo)</seg>
<seg id="257">Mr. Towtongie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="258">Residents of Rankin Inlet North and Chesterfield Inlet, I rise today to pay tribute to one of our most respected elders, Annie Tatty, who is on her way to Ottawa by plane.</seg>
<seg id="259">As well, one of our elders, Amarok, as I stand in this House today, has been sent to Gjoa Haven because he is not an elder.</seg>
<seg id="260">I want to be heard by the people of Rankin Inlet North and Chesterfield Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="261">As soon as I got elected in November, when I looked at the business plan, I asked the Minister of Health at the top, “Where are the plans for the establishment of an elders’ care facility in Rankin Inlet or in Nunavut?”</seg>
<seg id="262">I was assured by the Minister of Health and Social Services that all of us as MLAs are very sensitive and concerned about our elders.</seg>
<seg id="263">At the upcoming meeting in Pond Inlet, this issue will be brought up.</seg>
<seg id="264">I am waiting.</seg>
<seg id="265">A few days ago, I rose when we were dealing with the capital estimates and I didn’t see the money set aside for the elders’ facility.</seg>
<seg id="266">I was told that I should not be talking about this issue and that I should resign.</seg>
<seg id="267">However, I was grateful to our Chairman, Mr. Allan Rumbolt, for allowing me to continue to express my feelings on the elders’ facility.</seg>
<seg id="268">I rise today to criticize myself as an elected official.</seg>
<seg id="269">The idea of sending elders to a southern jurisdiction where they have not grown up is not acceptable.</seg>
<seg id="270">We want to be a good legislature, we want to be a good government, and we have told our elders to respect them, and we have sent them out of the territory.</seg>
<seg id="271">Member for Amittuq, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="272">Member's Statement 105 - 1(5): Recognition of Hall Beach and Igloolik Volunteers and Search and Rescue (Irqittuq)</seg>
<seg id="273">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thought I was forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="274">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my pride in my fellow residents.</seg>
<seg id="275">The search and rescue teams work very hard to search for people when there is a search and rescue operation.</seg>
<seg id="276">They just use it for their own purposes.</seg>
<seg id="277">I rise today to congratulate the following people from Hall Beach: Chairperson Kyle Issigaitok, Vice-Chairman George Inukshuk, and Director Martha Gibbons Tupik.</seg>
<seg id="278">As well, one of our elders, Abraham Ullalaaq, is an elder.</seg>
<seg id="279">As I stated before, the first person who goes out on the land to do search and rescue is an elder or a young person.</seg>
<seg id="280">We have to provide more assistance to our youth because our elders tell us the truth.</seg>
<seg id="281">We don’t think that they’re making a future for us.</seg>
<seg id="282">Now I’m on this side of the House. I’m always disappointed, but I’ll listen again.</seg>
<seg id="283">If you are going to be going out on the land, please be prepared.</seg>
<seg id="284">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would also like to recognize the Igloolik Hunters and Trappers Organization. They had a meeting this week in Hall Beach and spring is just around the corner.</seg>
<seg id="285">With that being the case, Mr. Speaker, if you’re going to be going out on the land, SPOT devices, GPS, and if you’re asking elders where to go, I’ll be able to catch you right away.</seg>
<seg id="286">Those kinds of things.</seg>
<seg id="287">The reason why I rise today is to reiterate that the search and rescue has one snowmobile and they have made repeated requests to the Department of Community and Government Services, but they have never received a response.</seg>
<seg id="288">I would like to see more support provided to the search and rescue teams.</seg>
<seg id="289">That’s it.</seg>
<seg id="290">The last name on the list, Member for South Baffin, Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="291">Member’s Statement 106 – 4(1): Cape Dorset Athletes (Joanasie)</seg>
<seg id="292">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="293">It will be held at the Sam Pudlat School in Cape Dorset and anyone will be welcome to learn how to play music or write songs.</seg>
<seg id="294">I would also like to recognize the choir that performs these beautiful songs and I would like to thank them for being able to go to Cape Dorset with the help of the Hamlet of Cape Dorset.</seg>
<seg id="295">There are none.</seg>
<seg id="296">Member for Quttiktuq, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="297">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="298">I would like to recognize four individuals in the Gallery.</seg>
<seg id="299">First of all, I would like to recognize the Federal Director of Parks and Special Places for Nunavut, Jenna Byrne, and her staff. She is always looking after me and our children, my wife, Carol Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="300">I would also like to thank my sister, Naomi Kirkuk Kuluguqtuq, for being able to come to Iqaluit from the furthest community.</seg>
<seg id="301">I would also like to welcome Jayden Natanine to the Gallery. He is one of our daughters and he is always going to school with our daughter. I am very proud of him.</seg>
<seg id="302">I would like to give a little bit of background.</seg>
<seg id="303">When I was a child, although I was still a child…</seg>
<seg id="304">…I caught my first seal in a lake.</seg>
<seg id="305">I don’t think there were too many, but I think it was the first time that they caught a seal in a lake and we were over there on a sand island.</seg>
<seg id="306">They helped a lot and they were my foster parents.</seg>
<seg id="307">I would like to thank them very much for being able to come here.</seg>
<seg id="308">Welcome to the House, Mr. Uttak and your officials.</seg>
<seg id="309">Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="310">Mr. Towtongie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="311">My parents in Ukkusiksalik, although it is now a national park, all of us were given pictures. I recognize all of you and we are grateful to our oldest and youngest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I was billeting in Igloolik and Teresa Uttak gave me a cup of tea. I would also like to thank Louie Uttak for providing me with good food and I will be staying with you again.</seg>
<seg id="313">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="314">Welcome to the Gallery.</seg>
<seg id="315">Member for Kugluktuk, Ms. Kamingoak.</seg>
<seg id="316">Mr. Kamingoak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="317">I would like to recognize Naomi Kopak Kuluguqtuq and Carol Akeeagok, they are my relatives.</seg>
<seg id="318">Naomi is from Grise Fiord. It’s been a long time since I haven’t had a family member on a daily basis, as you can see.</seg>
<seg id="319">Welcome to your Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="320">Member for Pangnirtung, Ms. Nakasuk.</seg>
<seg id="321">Mr. Nakasuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would like to recognize and congratulate my husband who is here, Andrew Nakasuk.</seg>
<seg id="322">Please welcome him.</seg>
<seg id="323">Mr. Nakasuk, welcome to the House.</seg>
<seg id="324">Recognition of Visitors in the Gallery. I have no more names on my list.</seg>
<seg id="325">We will move on in our orders of the day.</seg>
<seg id="326">We will begin with the Hon. Member for Iqaluit-Tasiluk, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="327">Question 123 – 2(1): Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act</seg>
<seg id="328">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="329">My questions are for the Minister of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="330">Mr. Speaker, I have asked a number of my colleagues over the last couple of weeks to join me in calling for referees to be trained more consistently and fairly.</seg>
<seg id="331">I would like to ask the minister if he will be introducing legislation during the life of this government to address this issue.</seg>
<seg id="332">Minister of Justice, Mr. Iqaqrialu.</seg>
<seg id="333">Hon. Jeannie Ugyuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thank Mr. Hickes for the question.</seg>
<seg id="334">As of today, the Government of Nunavut does not have a Code of Values and Ethics.</seg>
<seg id="335">Our department is aware of the companies that are now hiring security guards in our communities such as health centres.</seg>
<seg id="336">We are currently in the process of reviewing the policy for the establishment of a Nunavut-owned security company.</seg>
<seg id="337">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="338">As the minister indicated, one of the last jurisdictions in Canada that doesn’t have a private security system is the Northwest Territories. We want to make sure that we have a private security system that is accountable and that we have people that are trained to provide that service.</seg>
<seg id="339">All jurisdictions have introduced legislation in this regard.</seg>
<seg id="340">My next question is: once the review is done, is there going to be a policy or legislative proposal coming forward to the House?</seg>
<seg id="341">Mr. Iqaqrialu.</seg>
<seg id="342">Hon. Jeannie Iqaqrialu (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Mr. Hickes, yes, we can start working on developing policies or regulations for the private sector.</seg>
<seg id="343">Your final supplementary, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="344">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="345">I thank the minister for that commitment.</seg>
<seg id="346">Mr. Speaker, at this point in time, I would just like to say that the Department of Justice is being monitored by the RCMP and the Law Enforcement Division is working with Community and Government Services to coordinate the contract requirements for the Government of Nunavut to provide security services.</seg>
<seg id="347">Hon. Jeannie Iqaqrialu (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) The regulations or policies that are prepared by the Department of Justice or any other department, when they are drafting the regulations, then our department is involved from the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="348">I don’t have that information in front of me, but I can look into it and get back to you.</seg>
<seg id="349">Question 124 – 2(1): Status of Site Clean-up in Baker Lake (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="350">Mr. Mikkungwak (interpretation): Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="351">My questions are for the Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="352">I would like to follow up on some of the questions that I asked the minister last week concerning the clean-up of the contaminated site in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="353">In one of his responses to me, the minister indicated that a “preliminary report” had been prepared and submitted to QEC.</seg>
<seg id="354">Will the minister commit to providing a copy of this report to both the Hamlet Council of Baker Lake and myself as the MLA for the community?</seg>
<seg id="355">Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation, Minister Iqaqrialu.</seg>
<seg id="356">Hon. Jeannie Iqaqrialu (interpretation): Yes, Mr. Mikkungwak, I can commit to doing that.</seg>
<seg id="357">Your first supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="358">I thank the minister for that commitment.</seg>
<seg id="359">One of the things that the minister rose to talk about was the possibility of the Qulliq Energy Corporation working with the Hamlet of Baker Lake to clean up the site. Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to share that good news with the Hamlet of Baker Lake when I get back to the community next week and I will encourage the hamlet staff to meet with QEC officials.</seg>
<seg id="360">Mr. Speaker, I don’t think that would be possible because the Qulliq Energy Corporation’s headquarters is located in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="361">The minister indicated that the Qulliq Energy Corporation has already spent $1.68 million to date on the clean-up.</seg>
<seg id="362">Can the minister clarify how much it would cost to clean up the remaining rubble?</seg>
<seg id="363">Mr. Iqaqrialu.</seg>
<seg id="364">Hon. Jeannie Iqaqrialu (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) The overall clean-up cost for the Qulliq Energy Corporation is approximately $10 million. That’s the amount of money that I mentioned earlier. The damage has been done since the creation of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="365">We are committed to working with the Hamlet of Baker Lake on the clean-up of the current contaminated site.</seg>
<seg id="366">Your final supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="367">As I indicated in last week’s question, the federal government or the Government of Nunavut has not finalized the rates yet.</seg>
<seg id="368">Mr. Speaker, I am in support of the Qulliq Energy Corporation’s position that these damages occurred while the project was under federal jurisdiction.</seg>
<seg id="369">Will the Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation commit to working with the Minister of Justice to review and clarify the legal options that may be open to him in this area?</seg>
<seg id="370">Hon. Jeannie Iqaqrialu (interpretation): Yes, as the Minister of Energy and the Minister of Justice, we will work together to resolve this issue.</seg>
<seg id="371">Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, Mr. Lightstone.</seg>
<seg id="372">Question 125 – 2(1): School Leave Policy (McLean)</seg>
<seg id="373">My questions are for the Minister responsible for the Public Service Act.</seg>
<seg id="374">In previous years, the government’s most recent annual reports on the administration of the Public Service indicate that a significant number of employees took advantage of such programs as the Summer Student Employment Equity Program.</seg>
<seg id="375">Unfortunately, the 2016-17 annual report did not include this information.</seg>
<seg id="376">Will the minister commit to providing the House with that information?</seg>
<seg id="377">Minister of Finance, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="378">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="379">The annual reports are tabled annually and I’m sure that they will be tabled throughout the year because they are tabled annually.</seg>
<seg id="380">I’m not sure if the need is going to be there, but I can look into it.</seg>
<seg id="381">Your first supplementary, Mr. Lightstone.</seg>
<seg id="382">I would just like to ask the minister if he could make that information available to the House as to how many employees took advantage of the training program in 2016-17.</seg>
<seg id="383">Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="384">Speaker (interpretation): The question has been taken as notice.</seg>
<seg id="385">Member for Pangnirtung, Ms. Nakasuk.</seg>
<seg id="386">Question 126 – 2(1): Status of Old Pangnirtung Health Centre</seg>
<seg id="387">Mr. Nakasuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="388">My questions today are for the Minister of Community and Government Services.</seg>
<seg id="389">I have asked the minister in the past about the old Pangnirtung Health Centre that is no longer in use after the new health centre was constructed and opened.</seg>
<seg id="390">The old health centre has not been used for a long time, but it has remained closed.</seg>
<seg id="391">My question is: what kind of plans does the minister have for the old health centre?</seg>
<seg id="392">Minister responsible for Community and Government Services, Minister Kusugak.</seg>
<seg id="393">Hon. Lorne Kusugak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="394">I would like to thank the member for asking that question.</seg>
<seg id="395">When buildings that are no longer being used by the government are no longer being used by the Department of Community and Government Services, it becomes a question of whether other government departments would like to use the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="396">The old health centre that was built in 1975 in Pangnirtung went through that same process.</seg>
<seg id="397">The Department of Health does not want to use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="398">We did a request for proposals to various government departments and we have not heard of any requests for proposals.</seg>
<seg id="399">According to the procedures of the government, we are now making plans to see if the hamlet council would like to take over that responsibility. That’s where we are at right now.</seg>
<seg id="400">If they don’t want it, then we would have to go back to the non-profit community to see if they would like it.</seg>
<seg id="401">There is a process for disposal of surplus assets by the government.</seg>
<seg id="402">That is where we are at right now.</seg>
<seg id="403">Your first supplementary, Ms. Nakasuk.</seg>
<seg id="404">If I understand correctly, the communities have been asked if they would like to take on that responsibility or what is the status of that?</seg>
<seg id="405">Hon. Lorne Kusugak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="406">We haven’t heard from the government whether they want it or not.</seg>
<seg id="407">At this time, we are in the planning stages to see if the hamlet would be interested in doing a feasibility study.</seg>
<seg id="408">That is where we are at right now.</seg>
<seg id="409">Your final supplementary, Ms. Nakasuk.</seg>
<seg id="410">I would like to thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="411">I don’t know if the hamlet would want it, but if it can’t go from there, what happens to the government buildings that are no longer going to be used?</seg>
<seg id="412">I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="413">There are four main criteria that we use.</seg>
<seg id="414">For example, when the old Pangnirtung Health Centre was no longer wanted by the Department of Health, we asked if other government departments wanted it.</seg>
<seg id="415">The hamlet didn’t want it, so we’re going to see if the hamlet wants it.</seg>
<seg id="416">Those are the criteria that we use when we go through that process.</seg>
<seg id="417">Member for Aivilik, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="418">Question 127 – 2(1): Department of Family Services Client Travel Policy (Netser)</seg>
<seg id="419">Mr. Netser (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="420">I would like to direct my questions to the Minister of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="421">I would first like to say “good afternoon” to them. Since I have been here for a long time, I haven’t said “good afternoon” to them.</seg>
<seg id="422">We will be going home very shortly.</seg>
<seg id="423">Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that some of Nunavut’s most vulnerable individuals have to travel south for treatment, even away from their families and communities.</seg>
<seg id="424">I agree with you that when you are visited by a family member, it changes a lot.</seg>
<seg id="425">The Department of Family Services’ Client Travel Policy was posted on the government’s website in June of 2013 and came into effect on March 31, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="426">I was led to understand that the previous Minister of Family Services had agreed to make changes to the family travel policy.</seg>
<seg id="427">Can the minister indicate if any changes to the Department of Family Services’ client travel policy have been made since 2013 and, if not, will any changes be made after March 31 of this year?</seg>
<seg id="428">Minister of Family Services, Mr. Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="429">Hon. Joe Savikataaq: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="430">Mr. Speaker, I can’t speak for the previous minister or myself, but what I can say is that the policy will be in place until the end of March 2018 and it will remain in place until a new policy is changed.</seg>
<seg id="431">I haven’t heard from any of the Department of Family Services officials that they’re looking at changing that policy.</seg>
<seg id="432">If there is a need to change it, we can look at it, but we can’t change anything just for the sake of changing it until we look at it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="433">If there seems to be a need for changes that are going to be beneficial to the clients and to the government then we can look into it.</seg>
<seg id="434">Your first supplementary, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="435">Mr. Netser (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="436">The Department of Family Services’ Client Travel Policy states that an adult who is being cared for by the Department of Family Services in a residential care facility can be visited by two family members or guardians on an annual basis.</seg>
<seg id="437">Can the minister indicate if this policy has been revised to ensure that two family members are allowed to visit twice a year?</seg>
<seg id="438">Two return tickets; two people can travel together or one person can visit twice.</seg>
<seg id="439">Just to clarify, two return tickets is one, two return tickets per year for one foster child.</seg>
<seg id="440">Your final supplementary, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="441">Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Will the minister commit to considering changing family travel arrangements for elders who are in care?</seg>
<seg id="442">The policy is going to expire very soon and once it expires, we will have to review it, but at this time, I can’t say yes right away until we review the whole policy.</seg>
<seg id="443">I’m sure that there’s going to be a review done on all the medical travel that is paid for by the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="444">We will have to work with the Department of Health to make sure that the policies are adhered to, but at this time, I can’t commit to anything else because the Medical Travel Policy will be expiring soon and I’m sure the contents will be reviewed.</seg>
<seg id="445">Member for Netsilik, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="446">Question 128 – 2(1): Update on the Patient Relations Office (Qirngnuq)</seg>
<seg id="447">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="448">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Health.</seg>
<seg id="449">Mr. Speaker, from time to time, a number of my constituents come to my office in our community to seek help with their medical travel issues.</seg>
<seg id="450">As the minister often tells us, he even created a toll-free number this week where Nunavummiut can call the patient relations office if they have any concerns.</seg>
<seg id="451">Mr. Speaker, the language and where you live is one of the barriers.</seg>
<seg id="452">My question for the minister: can the minister tell the House what other means by which the Office of Patient Relations can be contacted?</seg>
<seg id="453">Minister of Health and Social Services, Minister Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="454">Hon. Patterk Netser (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="455">I understand your concern and we do try to encourage people to call the toll-free number so that you can get an immediate response.</seg>
<seg id="456">I don’t have that information in front of me. It also has an email address and a fax number.</seg>
<seg id="457">Your first supplementary, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="458">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) I don’t know if he answered my question or not, but I’ll ask it anyway.</seg>
<seg id="459">Mr. Speaker, the Information and Privacy Commissioner has raised a number of concerns with respect to the issue of privacy, and I understand that it is important that steps be taken to ensure that personal information is not compromised.</seg>
<seg id="460">The Office of Patient Relations has a form that identifies complaints or concerns.</seg>
<seg id="461">However, if you don’t have a fax machine, you don’t have the ability to send it out on your own. You don’t have all the computers to take the picture and send it to the computer.</seg>
<seg id="462">Can the minister clarify why the Office of Patient Relations does not require a fax copy of the complaint to be sent to the patient relations office?</seg>
<seg id="463">An Hon. Member: Good question.</seg>
<seg id="464">Ms. Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="465">That’s a very good question.</seg>
<seg id="466">I think it’s because we’re getting less and less bandwidth out there. With all of the advances that we’re making as a government, we’re getting more and more bandwidth out there.</seg>
<seg id="467">According to my briefing note, the government has a website that can be accessed at www.patientrelations@gov.nu.ca. Every community has a health centre.</seg>
<seg id="468">If you want to send out an application form by fax, you can do that. There are government liaison officers in every community.</seg>
<seg id="469">They can be faxed from their community to our headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="470">If the patient relations office didn’t have a fax machine, I could find out why.</seg>
<seg id="471">Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="472">Question 129 – 2(1): Income Support Policies</seg>
<seg id="473">Mr. Towtongie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="474">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="475">Mr. Speaker, I would like to follow up on the questions that were asked by the Member for Kugluktuk in regard to income support.</seg>
<seg id="476">The minister indicated that the Income Support Case Management System that the department will be signing off on is part of the program selection process.</seg>
<seg id="477">Can the minister clarify how the search for a proper job selection process can be undertaken when there are no job opportunities?</seg>
<seg id="478">Minister of Family Services, Mr. Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="479">With respect to the (interpretation ends) enhancements to the selection process, (interpretation) it would seem to me that if there are no vacancies, then yes, there are no vacancies, but sometimes they can be filled on a short-term basis by casual employees.</seg>
<seg id="480">Perhaps if the contractor was able to find a suitable contractor to fill the position, they would be able to fill the position.</seg>
<seg id="481">Your first supplementary, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="482">The Income Support Program is a policy of the Government of Nunavut and not a law.</seg>
<seg id="483">If it was a policy, we wouldn’t be able to make any changes as MLAs.</seg>
<seg id="484">What I see is when a young person doesn’t have a job to do on their own and they want a young person to sign up for a job that doesn’t have a job to do on a monthly basis, and that’s what they’re doing on a monthly basis, it’s kind of embarrassing and disheartening.</seg>
<seg id="485">Can the minister clearly explain what kinds of Nunavut-specific policies his department can provide to the smaller communities in this regard?</seg>
<seg id="486">Right now, it’s just a model for Nunavut and not for the north.</seg>
<seg id="487">The Client Travel Policy applies only to Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="488">It’s only used for outside of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="489">There was a review done on the Income Support Program and the policy was changed.</seg>
<seg id="490">At this time, there is still a lot of money available for income support recipients, as well as child tax benefits that are not deducted from the Nunavut Income Support Program.</seg>
<seg id="491">The apprenticeship program was going to be reviewed again and I feel for them.</seg>
<seg id="492">If they don’t have a job, then they won’t be able to get a job. However, with respect to the benefits, yes, they have to be carefully selected, but this will be looked into further.</seg>
<seg id="493">Question 130 – 2(1): Mining Training</seg>
<seg id="494">Mr. Irniq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="495">I rise today to direct my question to the Minister of Economic Development and Transportation.</seg>
<seg id="496">Mr. Speaker, I firmly believe that when the mining sector seeks to develop and create employment, and is responsible for the environment, these benefits can be realized.</seg>
<seg id="497">Perhaps my question today will be in regard to apprenticeship programs.</seg>
<seg id="498">Last year, you tabled the 2017-18 main estimates for the Department of Economic Development and Transportation, which included $200,000 in funding for the Nunavut Mine Training Program.</seg>
<seg id="499">Can the minister clarify or respond to this question as to how much funding was used for the 2017-18 fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="500">Mr. Speaker, I hope I was understandable.</seg>
<seg id="501">Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Ms. Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="502">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="503">I would like to thank the member for his question.</seg>
<seg id="504">What I can say about mine training is that I don’t have a breakdown of how it was spent.</seg>
<seg id="505">The department is working with the Department of Family Services, Nunavut Arctic College, the Government of Canada, our mining industry, and Inuit organizations on a number of projects to prepare Nunavummiut for opportunities in the mining sector. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="506">Your first supplementary, Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="507">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="508">I thank the minister for that answer.</seg>
<seg id="509">Will the Department of Finance be increasing or decreasing its budget for the 2018-19 fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="510">Ms. Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="511">I can’t respond to that right now, but I apologize if I can get back to the member’s question on how the $200,000 has been spent.</seg>
<seg id="512">The Kitikmeot Corporation’s Apprenticeship Program, $61,000 was used for that, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association’s Literacy Program for the Baffin region, $60,000, and the Arviat Hamlet Employment Readiness Program, $78,000 was used for heavy equipment operator training.</seg>
<seg id="513">Thank you for clarifying your question.</seg>
<seg id="514">As members will recall, last week, I tabled a copy of the Nunavut Impact Review Board’s most recent annual report on the mining sector.</seg>
<seg id="515">They are going to be doing some work near Hall Beach this spring.</seg>
<seg id="516">I wonder if the minister and the Department of Economic Development and Transportation can work with NIRB, not just with the mining companies, to see what kind of training programs can be made available to the people of the High Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="517">I would like to add, Mr. Speaker, that Hall Beach is a small community and there’s going to be a lot of money that is going to be used for that community.</seg>
<seg id="518">You also stated that you will be supporting the mining companies.</seg>
<seg id="519">What I’m trying to ask, Mr. Speaker, is: are you going to be able to deal with the funding that you identified for the Mary River project?</seg>
<seg id="520">There is Mary River in the Baffin, there is gold in the Kivalliq, and there is also gold in the Kitikmeot.</seg>
<seg id="521">Are you going to be able to deal with this properly?</seg>
<seg id="522">For example, if I was an Inuk and I wanted to pursue higher education, how would I be properly trained and how would the Department of Economic Development and Transportation be able to assist me?</seg>
<seg id="523">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also thank the member for that excellent question.</seg>
<seg id="524">The Department of Education has a mine training centre and I think it’s important to recognize that there are different types of mines that are being developed.</seg>
<seg id="525">There are different departments involved. (interpretation ends) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="526">Oral Questions.</seg>
<seg id="527">Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="528">Question 131 – 2(1): Support for Hospital Staff</seg>
<seg id="529">Ms. Main (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="530">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="531">First of all, let me say that my question is related to many communities, not just my community.</seg>
<seg id="532">I believe this applies to all of Nunavut, especially our nurses and other health care professionals.</seg>
<seg id="533">They are under pressure, Mr. Speaker, if they are aware, and that is one of the reasons why they are overworked.</seg>
<seg id="534">That’s one of the reasons why we don’t have enough staff. We don’t have enough staff because there’s a lot of work that needs to be done.</seg>
<seg id="535">It seems obvious that this is one of the causes of poverty in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="536">I hope you understand me because I’m speaking in Inuktitut.</seg>
<seg id="537">Let me say it in English. (interpretation ends) Mr. Speaker, the number of positions in the department is increasing due to capacity issues.</seg>
<seg id="538">My question for the minister is this: can the minister tell the House what steps his department has taken to provide additional support to health centre staff in communities where there is a high workload?</seg>
<seg id="539">Minister of Health and Social Services, Minister Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="540">I thank the member for that very important question.</seg>
<seg id="541">The issue of staffing at the hospital is a very important one and it’s something that we have been working very hard on as a department to make sure that we have adequate staff at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="542">Hopefully that will be the case, but we are always short of funds.</seg>
<seg id="543">I know for a fact that the nurses are overworked.</seg>
<seg id="544">Our department does what it can, what it can do.</seg>
<seg id="545">We just did that in one of the communities. When the nurse was tired, we sent an additional nurse to provide support.</seg>
<seg id="546">That information is sent to the nurse in charge when there is a high vacancy rate in the community.</seg>
<seg id="547">When a nurse is in a situation where there is a vacancy or a sickness, when a nurse is in a situation like that, we look at where we can get an escort from within the community.</seg>
<seg id="548">With regard to the recruitment of nurses, we don’t want to reduce the number of nurses providing health care in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="549">Your first supplementary, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="550">Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="551">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="552">I think we’re all concerned about the department’s staffing statistics. Using my two communities as an example, it’s evident that there are still too many vacant positions in the health centres.</seg>
<seg id="553">Arviat has a 70 percent vacancy rate and Arviat has a 44 percent vacancy rate.</seg>
<seg id="554">Mr. Speaker, I recognize that this is a challenging and challenging issue.</seg>
<seg id="555">I would now like to ask the minister if he could explain the challenges that his department faces in ensuring that there are adequate staffing levels at the community health centres, which are always very busy.</seg>
<seg id="556">Ms. Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="557">At the end of the day, after 30 months, we’re not able to retain them when they’re trained. I don’t know if they’re new or not. It’s very stressful to be a nurse in a community.</seg>
<seg id="558">That’s one of the things that you have to look at. In terms of providing support to the communities, the department has been working very hard to try and address that.</seg>
<seg id="559">Your final supplementary, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="560">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="561">Maybe to put it another way, Mr. Speaker, we know that there are problems in the communities where there is always a lot of work to do and there is always a shortage of nurses working in the health centres.</seg>
<seg id="562">I would like to get clarification on exactly what is happening with these problems in the communities, what is being done, and what are the thoughts of the people who are experiencing these problems in the communities?</seg>
<seg id="563">What is being done and what is being considered to ensure that our nurses and other health care professionals are supported by the department?</seg>
<seg id="564">Hon. Pat Angnakak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="565">Just to be clear, I don’t have that level of detail with me.</seg>
<seg id="566">For example, if we’re only open for emergencies, we can’t make appointments at a time when the workload is too great or there are too many nurses leaving for whatever reason.</seg>
<seg id="567">In the department, as I said, we’re trying to fill all the positions. It’s a challenge because we’re competing with the rest of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="568">That’s what we’re trying to do. I know that they work with people who have experience in the north, not so much in the north but in places like northern Manitoba.</seg>
<seg id="569">There are a number of different methods that we use. I know that the Department of Health and Social Services is well aware of the methods that our nurses use.</seg>
<seg id="570">We try to assist them as much as we can. It’s not as simple as fixing it right away, but we have to keep working on it. If you have any ideas, please let me know.</seg>
<seg id="571">Question 132 – 2(1): Insurance Policy on Government Property (Hickes)</seg>
<seg id="572">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="573">My questions are for the Minister of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="574">As we are all aware, Mr. Speaker, every community in Nunavut has different infrastructure, such as air terminal buildings, health centres, schools, and offices.</seg>
<seg id="575">My question to the minister is: when they’re going through the insurance process, are those assets on a case-by-case basis or are they on a case-by-case basis?</seg>
<seg id="576">Minister of Finance, Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="577">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Our contingencies are divided into different categories depending on the nature of the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="578">Each facility has different policies and some don’t even have a policy. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="579">I saw on the news recently in one of our communities that there was an attempted arson attack on a school.</seg>
<seg id="580">It’s not insured enough and the Department of Finance is trying to come up with a solution to make sure that the infrastructure is adequately insured. We also learned that our own cost in Arctic Bay is $10 million.</seg>
<seg id="581">How will it affect the insurance company in the event of another school fire? (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="582">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Today, the current contingency amount has increased from $10 million to $20 million for schools as a result of these fires.</seg>
<seg id="583">We continue to urge the Department of Education and all of us to replace these incinerators, which are very expensive and unfortunate to have to replace.</seg>
<seg id="584">I think one of the things that we have to try and do is show that we can continue to work on preventative measures. We’re doing better now. We have to show that we’re increasing our own premiums and we’re getting more and more self-insured. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="585">I understand exactly where the member is coming from, but I’m afraid that we’re going to have to rely on the local insurance companies to cover half of the costs.</seg>
<seg id="586">I asked a question.</seg>
<seg id="587">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Hopefully, we will always have insurance.</seg>
<seg id="588">The new $20 million is for school fires.</seg>
<seg id="589">Schools and other buildings have to pay $1 million on their own.</seg>
<seg id="590">They are different.</seg>
<seg id="591">I can’t tell you how many schools would have to be burnt down, they are no longer insured.</seg>
<seg id="592">I hope that we don’t get caught in the crossfire of bureaucracy and I appreciate the fact that we have to keep lobbying all of the Members of the Legislative Assembly because this is a school for our children, for the public… .</seg>
<seg id="593">Not just for the schools but also for the health centres because they are very important to the services that we provide.</seg>
<seg id="594">Any damage is a burden on our clients and I would like to continue to push for these facilities.</seg>
<seg id="595">So Mr. Speaker, a reminder.</seg>
<seg id="596">It’s a public building. All of the students, all of the public, all of the schools, all of the health centres, and all of the garages are public buildings.</seg>
<seg id="597">I applaud the member for bringing this issue forward to the House. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="598">Question 133 – 2(1): Expansion of Training Opportunities in Baker Lake (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="599">My questions are for the Minister responsible for Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="600">Mr. Speaker, as I noted in my Member’s Statement, as the Fifth Legislative Assembly of Nunavut, we have an opportunity to chart a new path to a brighter future for our territory.</seg>
<seg id="601">Can the minister tell the House if he would be willing to reopen the idea of establishing a university in your community in partnership with the private sector and others?</seg>
<seg id="602">Minister responsible for Nunavut Arctic College, Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="603">I would like to thank the Member for Baker Lake for asking that question.</seg>
<seg id="604">Through Nunavut Arctic College, we advertised to different colleges outside of Nunavut to see how we can work together.</seg>
<seg id="605">We have heard that different organizations, such as Agnico-Eagle, are interested in setting up a university for Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="606">We would like to see this proceed, but to date, we have been trying to get an agreement from outside of Nunavut to work with Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="607">I believe that we need to provide funding for the expansion of programs from Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit to the Piqqusilirivvik Cultural School in order to meet the academic requirements of the university.</seg>
<seg id="608">I feel that Baker Lake would be an ideal location for such an expansion.</seg>
<seg id="609">Can the minister clarify whether or not he and his officials have had discussions with the board of governors of Nunavut Arctic College to focus on ways to provide more opportunities for higher education to be delivered in Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="610">Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="611">We would like to see Nunavut Arctic College provide more opportunities for Nunavummiut to pursue post-secondary education in their communities. One of the things that we have noticed more and more is that there are opportunities for online learning.</seg>
<seg id="612">In regard to the Piqqusilirivvik Cultural School, we are looking at how we can expand the programs that can be offered there.</seg>
<seg id="613">Yes, the Nunavut Arctic College Board of Governors will be involved. My staff, the President of Nunavut Arctic College, and the Vice-President of Nunavut Arctic College will be in the planning stages to move this forward.</seg>
<seg id="614">Your final supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="615">Mr. Mikkungwak (interpretation): Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) I recognize that the previous government accepted the recommendation that Nunavut Arctic College would not be established at that time.</seg>
<seg id="616">Will the minister commit to revisiting this issue and reporting back to the House on his findings?</seg>
<seg id="617">Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="618">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thank Mr. Mikkungwak for the question.</seg>
<seg id="619">The option of building a university in Nunavut is being considered by a number of different people.</seg>
<seg id="620">Agnico-Eagle Mines has also committed $5 million towards the construction of a new university in the region.</seg>
<seg id="621">I think the discussions are still ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="622">At this point in time, in the next four years, I don’t know if we’re going to be able to go that route. We’re going to be doing a feasibility study.</seg>
<seg id="623">Members, please note that the time for question period has expired.</seg>
<seg id="624">Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="625">Motion 015 – 2(1): Extension of Question Period (McLean)</seg>
<seg id="626">Ms. Main (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Pursuant to Rule 39(7), I move, seconded by the Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, that question period be extended. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="627">The motion is in order and is not debatable.</seg>
<seg id="628">All those in favour of the motion, please raise your hand.</seg>
<seg id="629">All those opposed.</seg>
<seg id="630">As a result, we have extended the time for oral questions by 30 minutes from now.</seg>
<seg id="631">Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="632">Question 134 – 2(1): Grants and Contributions</seg>
<seg id="633">Ms. Main (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="634">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Environment.</seg>
<seg id="635">I rise today to talk about the Department of Environment’s Harvester Support Program. I would like to know what kind of support they provide to our hunters.</seg>
<seg id="636">Looking at our government’s main estimates for 2017-18, there are three items.</seg>
<seg id="637">There are three grants and contributions that the Department of Environment administers: the Disaster Compensation Program, the Wildlife Damage Compensation Program, and the Fur Pricing Program.</seg>
<seg id="638">The department has budgeted $150,000 for this fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="639">Mr. Speaker, I would first like to ask if the minister can describe how the Department of Environment evaluates the effectiveness of these programs.</seg>
<seg id="640">Minister of Environment, Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="641">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="642">The auction is held three times a year and the auction was recently held in early March. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="643">Your first supplementary, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="644">I thank the minister for bringing up the sealskin issue.</seg>
<seg id="645">Mr. Speaker, the information that has been tabled in this House over the years is something that I really wanted to see and I think it’s something that the hunters and trappers should see as well.</seg>
<seg id="646">In 2011, the Department of Environment reported that the value of sealskin pelts sold at auction was approximately $800,000.</seg>
<seg id="647">In 2012, it was $1.1 million and in 2013, it was $1.04 million.</seg>
<seg id="648">Mr. Speaker, can the minister provide an update on the status of sealskin sales this year and can he provide me with the latest information on whether this year’s sealskin sales are as good as last year’s?</seg>
<seg id="649">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik (interpretation): Mr. Speaker, I have a copy of what you read.</seg>
<seg id="650">I can’t say where they are at right now because I don’t have the bids in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="651">I can tell you that after the Fur Harvesters Auction, there is an increase in sales of sealskins and I’m sure that there will be an increase in sales of sealskins at the next auction. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="652">Your final supplementary, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="653">I also thank the minister.</seg>
<seg id="654">This will be my last question, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="655">I wonder if the Department of Environment can consider providing more funding to our hunters so that they can provide more assistance.</seg>
<seg id="656">With respect to the (interpretation ends) fox pelts, (interpretation) we are quite familiar with them as Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="657">I believe that the funding that is used for one year is too small, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="658">I think it’s too small.</seg>
<seg id="659">I would like to ask the minister if he agrees with me and if he can look into this matter in the upcoming months.</seg>
<seg id="660">I agree with you and I look forward to tabling that increase in the House if you will support it.</seg>
<seg id="661">Question 135 – 2(1): Compensation for Damage to Hunters and Trappers</seg>
<seg id="662">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Environment.</seg>
<seg id="663">Mr. Speaker, as we all know, in Nunavut, hunters are severely damaged by polar bears, including damage to their cabins, equipment, and snowmobiles.</seg>
<seg id="664">Mr. Speaker, there is usually compensation for damage done, but it is very difficult to get compensation for the damage done.</seg>
<seg id="665">Has the funding for the Disaster Compensation Program been used up in this fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="666">Minister of Environment, Ms. Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="667">I am sorry I did not hear everything.</seg>
<seg id="668">Can he repeat his question?</seg>
<seg id="669">Speaker (interpretation): Can you please repeat your first question, Mr. Keyootak.</seg>
<seg id="670">Our equipment, snowmobiles, and cabins are damaged by polar bears, especially when we leave them behind.</seg>
<seg id="671">We know that there is compensation available for damage done when we leave them behind.</seg>
<seg id="672">My question was: for this year’s capital estimates, have any of the funds for disaster compensation been used already?</seg>
<seg id="673">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you for the clarification.</seg>
<seg id="674">Minister of Environment, Ms. Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="675">Your first supplementary, Mr. Keyootak.</seg>
<seg id="676">The minister stated that he would provide a response once he has the information.</seg>
<seg id="677">Can the minister indicate how much of this funding has been used in the Baffin, Kivalliq, and Kitikmeot regions?</seg>
<seg id="678">Yes, I will give him the breakdown.</seg>
<seg id="679">Question 136 – 2(1): Child Care and Early Childhood Development (Hickes)</seg>
<seg id="680">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Education.</seg>
<seg id="681">In the Minister of Education’s Minister’s Statement this afternoon, he indicated that all licensed child care facilities would be eligible for additional funding depending on the location.</seg>
<seg id="682">How much money is being considered to be given to licensed daycares?</seg>
<seg id="683">Minister responsible for the Nunavut Housing Corporation, Minister Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="684">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="685">I thank Mr. Hickes for the question.</seg>
<seg id="686">The Department of Education’s executive committee approved the development partnership agreement for a three-year term. Over the next three years, it’s broken down into four phases.</seg>
<seg id="687">I just want you to be clear on how much it is, the O&amp;M for a total of $1.1 million a year, is broken down that way by year.</seg>
<seg id="688">Those are the numbers that I have.</seg>
<seg id="689">I thank the minister for that clarification.</seg>
<seg id="690">Mr. Speaker, when I look at the Child Day Care Regulations in Nunavut, section 17 of the Early Childhood Education Act states that all employees who deal with children on a daily basis must be fully trained. That’s one of the expectations that I have.</seg>
<seg id="691">Mr. Speaker, I know that there is an early childhood education program that is run through Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="692">I’m just wondering if the minister could give us an indication of how well they’re doing in terms of ensuring that they’re getting the training that they need.</seg>
<seg id="693">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="694">Training is one of the components of the agreement for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="695">The $1.1 million is outside of the O&amp;M budget.</seg>
<seg id="696">We would like to get more certified teachers who can teach early childhood education.</seg>
<seg id="697">We are looking forward to expanding our training and apprenticeship programs over the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="698">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thank the minister for that response.</seg>
<seg id="699">I look forward to sharing that information with the House.</seg>
<seg id="700">When I look at the daycare workers and the training programs that are offered, I always hear that when the employees are trained, they seem to be more effective in their training.</seg>
<seg id="701">Mr. Speaker, I have also heard concerns about low wages for daycare workers and the high turnover of daycare workers.</seg>
<seg id="702">When it comes to providing the same level of education to our children in early childhood education, it is very important to ensure the stability of our workforce.</seg>
<seg id="703">Is this funding to help daycare workers get better wages so that they can work there as full-time employees rather than casuals?</seg>
<seg id="704">I agree with Mr. Hickes and I understand exactly where he’s coming from. I agree with him wholeheartedly that we want to make sure that our children are well prepared to learn and move forward in life before they enter the school system.</seg>
<seg id="705">So that’s what we’re trying to do in terms of providing support to the daycare workers.</seg>
<seg id="706">As long as we don’t increase the cost of child care, I think we can work to make sure that the employees of the daycares are getting the value that they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="707">At this time, we’re still working on it and we want to make sure that we have child care workers in all of Nunavut.</seg>

<seg id="709">Question 137 – 2(1): Inuit Employment Requirements in Government Contracts</seg>
<seg id="710">On Friday, March 16, I asked the Minister of Community and Government Services about this issue. I had a discussion with the minister and I wanted further information on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="711">With respect to the increase in the number of Inuit employed within the government, we have to look at the number of Inuit employees.</seg>
<seg id="712">Mr. Speaker, the minister and I seemed to agree that he was in support of increasing the number of Inuit hired.</seg>
<seg id="713">The 20 percent is for the construction of the Baffin Correctional Centre and the docking facilities in Iqaluit and Pond Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="714">If I understood correctly, Mr. Speaker, it is 20 percent and 15 percent.</seg>
<seg id="715">Can the minister elaborate on how we’re going to change the tendering process to increase the numbers and if the department has the authority to do that?</seg>
<seg id="716">Minister responsible for Community and Government Services, Minister Kusugak.</seg>
<seg id="717">With respect to the tendering process, I believe the member understands that whenever a project is undertaken, the Department of Community and Government Services assists the departments in the tendering process.</seg>
<seg id="718">If it’s going to be a dock, it would be the Department of Economic Development and Transportation. If we’re talking about a jail, it would be the Department of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="719">Those are the types of things that we do. We work with the contractors to make sure that the contracts are adhered to.</seg>
<seg id="720">We work with the client departments and they try to figure out how many Inuit employees there will be.</seg>
<seg id="721">We’re trying to make sure that we don’t go over budget and we’re trying to make sure that we don’t go over budget and we’re trying to make sure that we’re not going to fall through the cracks.</seg>
<seg id="722">I can’t say at this time when they will be tendered out, but I think it’s impossible to change them at this time, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="723">I will be asking questions in regard to that.</seg>
<seg id="724">If we can’t make any changes to the (interpretation ends) tendering process (interpretation) and if we can’t make any changes, then we will have to look at other options for Inuit employment.</seg>
<seg id="725">Can the Department of Community and Government Services undertake this work?</seg>
<seg id="726">I hope I was understandable, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="727">Can the minister tell me, perhaps, and tell the House why when employees from other communities want to work in construction, can employees from Nunavut receive the same benefits as employees from outside of Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="728">Hon. Lorne Kusugak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="729">I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="730">Mr. Speaker, the Nunavummi Nangminiqaqtunik Ikajuuti Contracting Appeals Board investigates issues related to Inuit labour content and sets out the following criteria:</seg>
<seg id="731">scope of work;</seg>
<seg id="732">Inuit who are available to work based on their level of education;</seg>
<seg id="733">Other community-based programs can have an impact on Inuit employment opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="734">Mr. Speaker, we encourage contractors to hire locally rather than hiring from outside of the territory.</seg>
<seg id="735">We do encourage people to come to Nunavut and look for employment.</seg>
<seg id="736">We do encourage that.</seg>
<seg id="737">We continue to work closely with our client departments to achieve these goals.</seg>
<seg id="738">Your first supplementary, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="739">Ms. Main (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker and I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="740">For my last question, Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask the minister: will the minister commit to working with his department to undertake these larger projects?</seg>
<seg id="741">Will the minister commit to working with his counterpart in the Department of Community and Government Services to ensure that job opportunities are created and that Inuit are able to apply for jobs in construction projects in communities other than the regional centres?</seg>
<seg id="742">Will the minister commit to ensuring that this requirement is taken into consideration when determining whether or not to include Nunavut residents in the contracting process?</seg>
<seg id="743">I believe that the Government of Nunavut as a whole encourages the public to look for employment for Nunavummiut first and foremost.</seg>
<seg id="744">That is the way it has always been set up and we will continue to do that.</seg>

<seg id="788">Please refer to Bill 2 in your legislation binder.</seg>
<seg id="789">Moving on, Mr. Akeeagok, do you have witnesses that you would like to bring to the table?</seg>
<seg id="790">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): If I can, I would like to have my officials with me at the witness table.</seg>
<seg id="791">Chairman (interpretation): Does the committee agree to bring in the witnesses?</seg>
<seg id="792">Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the witnesses in.</seg>
<seg id="793">Mr. Akeeagok, for the record, please introduce your witnesses and proceed with your opening comments.</seg>
<seg id="794">On my left is my Assistant Deputy Minister, Dan Carlson.</seg>
<seg id="795">Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to speak to Bill 2, Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, 2018-19.</seg>
<seg id="796">As a government, we are requesting approval to spend $491,804,000 between April 1, 2018 and June 30, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="797">Mr. Chairman, earlier this year, the Minister of Finance appeared before the Committee of the Whole on the occasion of its consideration of the Department of Finance’s main estimates. However, as the Fifth Legislative Assembly of Nunavut, we are in the early stages of preparing our business plans for the upcoming fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="798">With that being the case, at this time, in the 2018-19 fiscal year, we are working on the plans and what we will be doing in the 2018-19 fiscal year is that we will be going to Igloolik for the spring session in May and June.</seg>
<seg id="799">To that end, Mr. Chairman, we are proposing an interim appropriation to allow the department to fulfill its mandate to provide services to Nunavummiut in the coming months.</seg>
<seg id="800">The issue of attendance is critical to setting aside funds for this year’s general election.</seg>
<seg id="801">Mr. Chairman, all departments and territorial corporations have had the opportunity to review these interim appropriations. Our calculations are based on departmental spending and cash flow over the past four years.</seg>
<seg id="802">We are satisfied that this amount will be sufficient to operate until such time as the Legislative Assembly reviews the results of this review and passes the annual budget.</seg>
<seg id="803">The major components of the department’s budget are:</seg>
<seg id="804">$8.62 million for the Office of the Legislative Assembly;</seg>
<seg id="805">$11.66 million to the Department of Community and Government Services;</seg>
<seg id="806">$29.08 million to the Department of Finance;</seg>
<seg id="807">$49.1 million to the Department of Family Services;</seg>
<seg id="808">$32.44 million to the Department of Justice;</seg>
<seg id="809">$10.77 million to the Department of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth;</seg>
<seg id="810">$64.1 million to the Department of Education;</seg>
<seg id="811">$85.77 million for the old Department of Health and Social Services offices;</seg>
<seg id="812">$8.32 million for the Department of Environment;</seg>
<seg id="813">$82.73 million, for the Department of Community and Government Services Headquarters;</seg>
<seg id="814">$23.29 million for the operations of the Department of Economic Development and Transportation;</seg>
<seg id="815">$73.39 million to the Nunavut Housing Corporation; and</seg>
<seg id="816">$12.54 million to Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="817">Mr. Chairman, this concludes my opening comments. I would be pleased to take questions.</seg>
<seg id="818">At this time, if there are any questions or comments, the floor is open.</seg>
<seg id="819">Do members have any general comments?</seg>
<seg id="820">Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="821">Mr. Towtongie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="822">I was reading the Inuktitut version. $32.44 million for the Department of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="823">There is a difference in Inuktitut of $8.62 million. In Inuktitut of $8.62 million, is that for the Office of the Legislative Assembly or is that for the Department of Justice?</seg>
<seg id="824">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): For clarification, the Office of the Legislative Assembly is requesting $8.62 million and the Department of Justice is seeking $32.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="825">I apologize if it wasn’t translated properly. (interpretation ends) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="826">The English version is correct.</seg>
<seg id="827">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="828">It’s just a question on the interim appropriation. We don’t have a percentage of the interim appropriation, so it’s just a question on the past expenditures and the budget allocation process.</seg>
<seg id="829">I know there was a lot of debate on the Financial Administration Manual and the minister has indicated that there are some fundamental changes that need to be made in order for accurate departments to provide the services that they’re supposed to provide to the people of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="830">It doesn’t really have an impact on the bill, Mr. Chairman, but it does have an impact on the bill.</seg>
<seg id="831">I’m just wondering if there have been any changes to the way that the money has been allocated so that there’s more money coming in.</seg>
<seg id="832">Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="833">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you for the question.</seg>
<seg id="834">To date, there have been no real changes to the operations and maintenance budget, but we will probably see some changes to the capital budget process this fall. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="835">Are there any more general comments?</seg>
<seg id="836">If members have any questions on the opening comments, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="837">If not, we will proceed with the clause-by-clause review of the bill.</seg>
<seg id="838">Go to Bill 2 in your white legislation binder.</seg>
<seg id="839">Bill 2, Interim Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="840">Chairman: Clause 2. Do you agree?</seg>
<seg id="841">Chairman (interpretation): Go to Schedule on page 2. Schedule on page 3. Interim Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) for the period April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="842">Vote 1: Operations and Maintenance. Detail of Expenditures. Total Operations and Maintenance. $491,804,000.</seg>
<seg id="843">Thank you, Mr. Main. Do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="844">Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="845">I probably should have brought this up earlier, but I have a question about departmental grants and contributions.</seg>
<seg id="846">It is my understanding that the figures are based on a percentage of the annual budget, but some of the grants and contributions are already expended and the rest of the annual budget will be expended as soon as April 1.</seg>
<seg id="847">I just want to get a little bit more clarification on the grants and contributions, whether it’s Economic Development and Transportation or the Nunavut Housing Corporation. How is that handled when some of these grants and contributions are not for a whole year, but some of the programs are administered on an annual basis?</seg>
<seg id="848">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="849">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): That is a very good question.</seg>
<seg id="850">Under the grants and contributions, I noted in my opening comments that over the past four years, there have been some changes to the first three months of grants and contributions.</seg>
<seg id="851">I can state unequivocally that the Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation are the two largest departments and as you can see here, their grants and contributions are geared towards operations and maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="852">If it’s a request for proposals, the departments have different ways of doing it, but in the last four years, every department’s expenditures on a quarterly basis are reviewed by the Department of Finance and the departments agree on how their grants and contributions work.</seg>
<seg id="853">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="854">I guess my next question is: can the minister indicate if there are any projects that have been put on hold or are they just going to go through the normal process?</seg>
<seg id="855">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="856">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) The departments are operating the same way and those are the figures that we have received.</seg>
<seg id="857">I would hope to be in a position tomorrow to be able to look at some of the work that needs to be done in the future. One of the things that we were able to do in the Fifth Assembly, with the direction that we’ve been given by the departments and the ministers, is that for the next three months, we’re going to be doing the same thing in May.</seg>
<seg id="858">Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="859">I’m sorry, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="860">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to welcome the minister and his officials.</seg>
<seg id="861">In the main estimates, there is $491,804,000 at the top.</seg>
<seg id="862">For example, in the bill, it states $8,623,000 and in the minister’s opening comments, it states $8.26 million.</seg>
<seg id="863">The $3,000 doesn’t change and the $54,000 seems to have been set aside.</seg>
<seg id="864">Why is that the case?</seg>
<seg id="865">That’s my question.</seg>
<seg id="866">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="867">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="868">The bill is three pages in Inuktitut and we’re trying to get the numbers approved.</seg>
<seg id="869">Those are the actual numbers.</seg>
<seg id="870">As I stated in my Member’s Statement, I have just decreased the numbers in English to try and get them closer to the main estimates. I don’t want to say all the numbers, but we have decreased the numbers.</seg>
<seg id="871">I just want to make sure that the numbers that we’re looking at in the bill are accurate.</seg>
<seg id="872">Total Operations and Maintenance. $491,804,000. Do you agree?</seg>
<seg id="873">Clause 5. Do you agree?</seg>
<seg id="874">Chairman: Do members agree to Bill 2 as a whole?</seg>
<seg id="875">Do members agree that pursuant to Rule 62(2) that Bill 2 can immediately be placed on the orders of the day for third reading?</seg>
<seg id="876">Minister Akeeagok, do you have any closing comments?</seg>
<seg id="877">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would just like to thank my staff for making sure that we have everything ready so that the government can operate until June.</seg>
<seg id="878">I sincerely thank all Members of the Legislative Assembly for their support in approving this budget, and I look forward to sitting in this Chamber during our budget session in May and June.</seg>
<seg id="879">I thank you all.</seg>
<seg id="880">Bill 2 is concluded.</seg>
<seg id="881">I would now like to ask the minister if he can proceed with his opening comments on Bill 3.</seg>
<seg id="882">Bill 03 – Supplementary Appropriation (Operations &amp; Maintenance) Act, No. 3, 2017-2018 – Consideration in Committee</seg>
<seg id="883">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="884">I will have my officials with me at the witness table. Also, I would like to let the members know that when we go to the other departments, I have extra staff available. If we need them, I would like to be invited, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="885">Mr. Chairman, can I proceed with my opening comments?</seg>
<seg id="886">I am here to present Bill 3, Supplementary Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, 2017-2018, No. 3. Through this bill, the government is seeking an increase of $56,602,000 for the following purposes:</seg>
<seg id="887">$49 million to the Department of Health to address over-expenditures in the areas of medical travel, mental health, rehabilitation, elder care, out-of-territory physician services, and tuberculosis research;</seg>
<seg id="888">$6.2 million for the Department of Justice to address over-expenditures in the RCMP, Corrections and Court Services; and</seg>
<seg id="889">$1.402 million in over-expenditures for the Children and Family Services Branch and the Corporate Services Branch.</seg>
<seg id="890">Mr. Chairman, that concludes my opening comments. I would be pleased to answer any questions or comments that members may have.</seg>
<seg id="891">Do members have any general comments?</seg>
<seg id="892">Supplementary Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) 2017-18, No. 3. Family Services. Not Previously Authorized.</seg>
<seg id="893">Total Children and Family Services. $1,402,000.</seg>
<seg id="894">I just saw that number in the substantiation sheet and it still doesn’t give me a clear picture of where you’re focusing your energies.</seg>
<seg id="895">Mr. Savikataaq, are you prepared to answer that question?</seg>
<seg id="896">Hon. David Savikataaq: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="897">I don’t have the breakdown in front of me, but those are the two main areas where we’re sending more inmates out of the territory. We’re also increasing the number of visits out of the territory.</seg>
<seg id="898">For example, there is an elder in Igloolik, I don’t know if it’s in Gjoa Haven or not, who is in Ottawa on medical travel so that he can be visited, so that he can be visited.</seg>
<seg id="899">They’re not assisted by the Department of Family Services, but we do send them to visit their relatives.</seg>
<seg id="900">The majority of our elders are sent out of the territory because they can’t get help in Nunavut. As I said earlier, there are more community visits.</seg>
<seg id="901">With the consolidation of all of the elders’ programs under the Department of Family Services, I’m just wondering if the responsibility for seniors has been transferred back to the Department of Health. Are seniors still under the Department of Family Services?</seg>
<seg id="902">Some of the things that the minister mentioned are not really under the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="903">Some of them are in the care of the Department of Health, the elders are in the care of the Department of Health, and when they want to visit, there are monies available through the Department of Family Services for travel.</seg>
<seg id="904">That was one of the examples I used. (interpretation ends) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="905">I understand that there have to be visits to some of the children that are in foster care. The money is in the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="906">My question is: are there still elders who are receiving assistance from Family Services who have not been transferred to the Department of Health?</seg>
<seg id="907">Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="908">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Based on the information that I have, the positions that were going to be transferred have been transferred to the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="909">The ones that are not transferred to the Department of Health are still managed by the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="910">I’m just wondering if there are any more programs that haven’t been transferred to the Department of Family Services. Looking at this information and looking at our business plan, I think all of them have been transferred. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="911">I don’t know if I’m getting confused, but if the Minister of Family Services can clarify that, I would appreciate it.</seg>
<seg id="912">It’s up to Minister Akeeagok if he wants to refer the question to another minister.</seg>
<seg id="913">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): I’ll try to explain it.</seg>
<seg id="914">I thought the question was: are there still people in the Department of Health that need to be in the Department of Family Services?</seg>
<seg id="915">My response was that it’s under the Department of Health and Social Services right now and it’s under the seniors’ program.</seg>
<seg id="916">They are still under the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="917">The supplementary appropriation is for the Department of Family Services to determine what the over-expenditures are. (interpretation) Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="918">Thank you for the clarification from the minister.</seg>
<seg id="919">I understand a little bit better now.</seg>
<seg id="920">Maybe if I ask it in a different way, it will be clearer.</seg>
<seg id="921">Does the Department of Family Services still care for elders? Does the Department of Family Services still care for elders?</seg>
<seg id="922">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Yes, there are still programs for seniors and I would like the Minister of Family Services to clarify that.</seg>
<seg id="923">Mr. Speaker, I am aware that the government programs, such as the Senior Fuel Subsidy Program, the Senior Citizens Supplementary Benefit, the Senior Citizens Supplementary Benefit, the Senior Citizens Supplementary Benefit, the Senior Citizens Supplementary Benefit, and the Department of Family Services</seg>
<seg id="924">If I missed anything, Minister Savikataaq can assist me in answering the question. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="925">I thank both ministers for clarifying that.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my last question.</seg>
<seg id="927">When they are sent outside of Nunavut, are they still eligible for income support?</seg>
<seg id="928">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Through you, Mr. Chairman, I would like Minister Savikataaq to respond to that. (interpretation ends) Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="929">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="930">It varies depending on the situation.</seg>
<seg id="931">In some cases, they are eligible for income support, but I can’t say that it’s the same for all of them.</seg>
<seg id="932">I have a very detailed question under the Directorate.</seg>
<seg id="933">They have indicated that they are going to be donating some of their surplus funds from other departments.</seg>
<seg id="934">As it stands now, do the other departments in the regions support the whole of Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="935">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) It doesn’t affect all the regions.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the Department of Family Services, almost all of the income support functions were transferred to the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="937">They don’t get a lot of benefits. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="938">I thank the minister for that answer.</seg>
<seg id="939">When do you identify that they may be in a deficit situation and how do you deal with that deficit situation?</seg>
<seg id="940">I don’t know if that has an impact on our meeting, Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="941">The department reports to the Utility Rates Review Council on a monthly basis and at the end of the fiscal year, if there is a slight over-expenditure, then the department requests a supplementary appropriation to correct the over-expenditure. If that is not possible, then we have to use a supplementary appropriation.</seg>
<seg id="942">We are on page 4.</seg>
<seg id="943">Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="944">The documents that we have in front of us indicate that the number of people in residential care is increasing. In the past, there were 189 people in residential care and now there are 243.</seg>
<seg id="945">Do you anticipate that this number will continue to increase?</seg>
<seg id="946">What accounts for the increasing need for residential care?</seg>
<seg id="947">Do you know what the reasons are for the increase in the number of people requiring residential care?</seg>
<seg id="948">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) The number is steadily increasing. In 2013, the number of clients was increasing, so we’re following that trend.</seg>
<seg id="949">It’s a trend that’s been going on for a number of years, so I’m just wondering if that’s something that they’re going to be incorporating into their budget as soon as possible, starting from last year’s budget. I don’t want to be approving supplementary appropriations just for the sake of having accurate budget numbers.</seg>
<seg id="950">Will that be included in the growth figures?</seg>
<seg id="951">I think the trend is increasing. As we go through the page-by-page [review] of the main estimates, it’s going to be noticeable that as we go through the changes, if we don’t keep up with the budget, then we go through the main estimates.</seg>
<seg id="952">We will have questions when we get to the main estimates. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="953">In your substantiation sheet that was provided by the department, there is a surplus.</seg>
<seg id="954">It goes on to say that the department has recently revised its Income Support Program.</seg>
<seg id="955">I’m just wondering if the minister could indicate where that surplus was spent. Was it spent on administration, was it spent on income support workers, or is there going to be more money given to income support recipients?</seg>
<seg id="956">Which areas did you increase the funding for?</seg>
<seg id="957">What I’m trying to understand is where did the surplus go, where did it go?</seg>
<seg id="958">I’m just wondering: in terms of the Income Support Program, is there going to be a reallocation of the paperwork or is there going to be an increase in the Income Support Program? Where did the surplus go?</seg>
<seg id="959">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you. Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="960">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) There are a number of issues with the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="961">They have been hired to administer all of the functions that were transferred from one department to another.</seg>
<seg id="962">Under the Income Support Program, there was also some funding for that, but the government’s response was that they send people out to residential care facilities for various reasons.</seg>
<seg id="963">There are a number of factors that determine how the Department of Family Services has arrived at a budget shortfall for this fiscal year. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="964">I will be there with him.</seg>
<seg id="965">This information indicates that the Income Support Program is spending more money than the budgeted amount for the Income Support Program.</seg>
<seg id="966">Will the money that is being requested be used for staff or will it be used for the income support office?</seg>
<seg id="967">My colleague, Minister Savikataaq, can respond to the question better.</seg>
<seg id="968">Mr. Savikataaq, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="969">Income support adjustments have a significant impact on the budget. I can use an example.</seg>
<seg id="970">In the case of the National Child Benefit Supplement, the person who applied for the National Child Benefit Supplement had their income and social assistance deducted.</seg>
<seg id="971">The National Child Benefit Supplement was deducted from income support. This will no longer be the case. Income support recipients will receive more money from the National Child Benefit Supplement and it will no longer be deducted from their income support.</seg>
<seg id="972">We are on Total Children and Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="973">Not previously authorized. $1,402,000.</seg>
<seg id="974">Go to page 5. Justice. Operations and Maintenance. Not Previously Authorized.</seg>
<seg id="975">Total Department. Not Previously Authorized. $2,600,000.</seg>
<seg id="976">Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="977">Mr. Netser (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="978">Welcome, Mr. Minister.</seg>
<seg id="979">It says here that it’s for the purchase of new drugs. There is going to be a legislative change on marijuana from the federal government this coming summer. Is that planned?</seg>
<seg id="980">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) With your permission, Mr. Chairman, I would like to have my Associate Deputy Minister of Justice go to the witness table and I would like to have my Associate Deputy Minister of Justice go to the witness table.</seg>
<seg id="981">Does the committee agree to bring in the witnesses?</seg>
<seg id="982">Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the witnesses out.</seg>
<seg id="983">For the record, Mr. Akeeagok, please introduce your witness.</seg>
<seg id="984">To my left is the Deputy Minister of the Department of Justice, Bill MacKay.</seg>
<seg id="985">If it’s okay with you, I would like to respond to the question.</seg>
<seg id="986">Mr. Chairman, that’s a very good question for the Minister of Justice with respect to the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="987">It has nothing to do with marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="988">We don’t want the drugs that are called narcotics to come into Nunavut because these are brand new drugs and we need to educate them and implement their education.</seg>
<seg id="989">At the December federal/provincial/territorial finance ministers’ meeting, the funding that will be allocated for marijuana is 25 percent of the funding that will be coming from the federal government to the RCMP for drug investigations.</seg>
<seg id="990">This is a two-part program.</seg>
<seg id="991">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="992">My next question is in regard to the high cost of housing and the shortage of housing in the communities.</seg>
<seg id="993">I’m just wondering if the minister could explain why that amount is there.</seg>
<seg id="994">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="995">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) This is related to the RCMP getting nine additional RCMP officers in different communities and that’s why they provide staff housing.</seg>
<seg id="996">When there are additional RCMP officers, we are required by government contracts to provide housing for them. The additional cost was $300,000. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="997">Mr. Main, did you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="998">Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="999">The minister talked about the $2.6 million that is broken down into $300,000 for housing.</seg>
<seg id="1000">I’m just wondering if you could break that down in more detail.</seg>
<seg id="1001">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): I may be missing a number.</seg>
<seg id="1002">I will ask my officials.</seg>
<seg id="1003">Those are the numbers.</seg>
<seg id="1004">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1005">I would like to thank the minister for his response. $1 million will be used for vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1006">Why was it not anticipated that these vehicles would be purchased?</seg>
<seg id="1007">I believe it should have been included in the budget, if I understood correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1008">What was the reason for the need to purchase new vehicles?</seg>
<seg id="1009">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. That is a very good question.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This $1 million is for vehicle replacement.</seg>
<seg id="1011">We have a contract with the RCMP and there are different requirements that they have to meet.</seg>
<seg id="1012">Last year, the vehicles were not replaced due to lack of funding.</seg>
<seg id="1013">However, this year, due to mechanical issues with their vehicles, they were able to purchase the necessary equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1014">That is why there is a significant increase this year.</seg>
<seg id="1015">They have tried to buy as much as they can, but their equipment keeps breaking down.</seg>
<seg id="1016">Under the RCMP contract, they don’t tell each other what to buy or what not to buy.</seg>
<seg id="1017">However, when we’re talking to them and planning with them, they come to an agreement and that’s why it seems like it has gone up.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Ms. Main (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1019">It’s also mentioned here, although my colleague was talking about it.</seg>
<seg id="1020">These drugs that are brand new are probably the most dangerous and dangerous drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1021">Will the equipment that will be used to do the survey be made available to all the communities or just some of the communities?</seg>
<seg id="1022">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Yes, all the RCMP will be getting this equipment for all the communities.</seg>
<seg id="1023">These are new resources for the RCMP and for the general public that may be in that situation. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1024">With respect to the most dangerous substances, new drugs, such as marijuana, are starting to be found in our communities. Has this been planned or if no new drugs have been found, which communities have been identified by the RCMP to date?</seg>
<seg id="1025">Yes, with the newcomers coming into our communities, it’s very unfortunate and I wish them all the best.</seg>
<seg id="1026">However, with respect to the communities that have been impacted, there have been two communities that have been impacted, as well as other jurisdictions, such as the Northwest Territories.</seg>
<seg id="1027">It’s very dangerous and I’m very afraid that these people will try to get into drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1028">It would be better if you didn’t do that, but these kinds of things are dangerous and I’m glad that the RCMP is making plans.</seg>
<seg id="1029">Ms. Main (interpretation): I thought I was done.</seg>
<seg id="1030">This is my last question.</seg>
<seg id="1031">With respect to the shortage of housing in Nunavut communities, perhaps you can clarify that for me.</seg>
<seg id="1032">In the documents that we have provided, it states that there have been nine additional RCMP members assigned to the six communities in Nunavut that have been decentralized to various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1033">That was just a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1034">Moving on, Mr. Hickes, do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the $2.6 million that you’re requesting, it talks about interpreters for the court circuits. You said that there were seven court circuits. Did you need interpreters as well?</seg>
<seg id="1036">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) At this point in time, no, there are a number of additional interpreter/translators that are required. Once the hiring process is complete, the key is to have trained interpreters within the Department of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1037">I’ll just leave that one alone for now. In the minister’s opening comments, he also talks about the need for new telephones and the ongoing lifecycle renewal of existing equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Knowing that there is going to be a requirement to replace the existing detachments, is there going to be money set aside for the new detachments or is there going to be a request for additional funding once the numbers are known by the RCMP?</seg>
<seg id="1039">Yes, it is in the planning stages for the department and we will be requesting funding for that. It is in the planning stages.</seg>
<seg id="1040">Mr. Chairman, there is a plan in the business plan that the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Public Service will be presenting to the RCMP in the event that the Tobacco Control Act is passed. One of the things that my colleague has talked about is the Motor Vehicle Information System. There is a plan in place, but we don’t have any extra money in the budget for the Tobacco Control Act. (interpretation) Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In terms of overtime in other correctional facilities, if the member is referring to a full-time position within the Baffin Correctional Centre, what is the average amount of overtime in the Baffin Correctional Centre?</seg>
<seg id="1042">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 8.</seg>
<seg id="1043">Did he say eight?</seg>
<seg id="1044">Mr. Hickes (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to ask another question. According to the information provided by the department, overtime costs for the Baffin Correctional Centre are estimated at $180,000.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Can the minister clarify that for me?</seg>
<seg id="1046">Through you, I would like to have Deputy Minister MacKay respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1047">Mr. MacKay: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1048">The supervisor, the nurse in charge, the other supervisor, there are a lot of other people who work there. If the weather permits, they have to stay there for extended periods of time, so that’s part of the overtime costs.</seg>
<seg id="1049">When there’s a blizzard, they’re not able to go home. When the blizzard says that there’s going to be another worker coming in, do they double the number of employees?</seg>
<seg id="1050">Mr. MacKay, can you clarify your question?</seg>
<seg id="1051">If there’s a blizzard, they’re called in right away, but if there’s a blizzard, they’re called in right away.</seg>
<seg id="1052">Mr. Lightstone.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1054">My questions are for the Minister of Justice. First of all, the RCMP has indicated that they will require housing for nine new RCMP members.</seg>
<seg id="1055">When you hire an RCMP officer, do they have separate housing?</seg>
<seg id="1056">I’m happy to say that one of my staff, who was just playing hockey, had his arm amputated by another staff member. I’m sure he’s going to be okay, but my deputy minister can’t write.</seg>
<seg id="1057">There’s going to have to be an entrance.</seg>
<seg id="1058">My question is in regards to the nine RCMP officers, the RCMP get federal staff housing.</seg>
<seg id="1059">As I stated earlier, we work with the RCMP through various contracts.</seg>
<seg id="1060">I want to make it very clear that 70 percent of the RCMP cost is paid by the Government of Nunavut and 30 percent is paid by the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="1061">The RCMP is contracted out to the federal government. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1062">Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1063">I’m just wondering: is the RCMP going to provide housing for all the RCMP officers?</seg>
<seg id="1064">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) The RCMP, when they send a member of their staff to a community, how long do they have to stay in the community?</seg>
<seg id="1065">They operate in a unique way because they don’t keep one RCMP officer out on the land.</seg>
<seg id="1066">They don’t expect to get their own housing in the community for most of the time, depending on the number of RCMP officers that are required in the community.</seg>
<seg id="1067">The RCMP has a very unique system that they operate under.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When they identify a community that needs a new RCMP detachment, they try to include housing for all 25 communities. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1069">It’s unfortunate that the RCMP don’t try to integrate into the communities.</seg>
<seg id="1070">When the RCMP gets their own home, what kind of assistance do they provide?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Lightstone.</seg>
<seg id="1072">I don’t think anyone here should be asking questions like that.</seg>
<seg id="1073">I don’t think we should expect them to own their own homes and that’s why they are provided with housing.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Mr. Akeeagok, it is up to you if you wish to respond.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1076">Those were very good comments, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Yes, even though the RCMP officers are only in the community for three years, they do participate in community fundraising activities.</seg>
<seg id="1078">In the event that an RCMP officer decides to apply for housing, they apply to the federal government for housing.</seg>
<seg id="1079">They get their money through the federal government, not through us. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1080">This will be my last question in regard to the RCMP. What is the value of the contract that you have with the RCMP?</seg>
<seg id="1081">It’s on page 5 of the bill, $40,071,000.</seg>
<seg id="1082">If approved, it will be $42,671,000 for the contract for the 2017-18 fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="1083">Thank you for that clarification.</seg>
<seg id="1084">The third area is the corrections division’s overtime and casual staffing.</seg>
<seg id="1085">Chairman (interpretation): Mr. Lightstone, we’re finally on Law Enforcement. We haven’t gotten there yet. Could you wait a moment for your questions?</seg>
<seg id="1086">We are on Law Enforcement. Are there any further questions on Law Enforcement?</seg>
<seg id="1087">Mr. Lightstone: Yes, the last one is for law enforcement.</seg>
<seg id="1088">In the minister’s correspondence, it indicates that the total budget for the Legal Services Board is $40 million, but the actual budget for the Legal Services Board is $30 million, which is projected to increase to $42 million.</seg>
<seg id="1089">How is this $42 million projected to be spent by the end of the fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="1090">Maybe if I could ask the member if he could indicate which numbers he is looking at.</seg>
<seg id="1091">If he has a number, I would like to get a little bit of help. In the letter that I sent on Friday, I think I found $30 million, but if he can elaborate a little bit more.</seg>
<seg id="1092">A letter dated March 16 to the Chairperson of the Regular Members’ Caucus from the Minister of Finance was provided to me.</seg>
<seg id="1093">The letter that I am referring to is on page 4 and there are five in total.</seg>
<seg id="1094">I would also like to thank the member for referring to the document that we tabled in the House.</seg>
<seg id="1095">The $30 million that has been used for this year is $30 million and the planned amount is $42 million.</seg>
<seg id="1096">The RCMP has a report on what they’re going to be using and how much they’re going to be using. The $2.6 million that we’re requesting is based on the RCMP figures.</seg>
<seg id="1097">I’m looking at $2.6 million for Project 1 in the Legislative Assembly substantiation sheet and it indicates that the RCMP operates the “V” Division for the “V” Division for the “V” Division for the “V” Division for the “V” Division and the “V” Division for the “V” Division for the “V” Division for the “V” Division.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The Legislative Assembly’s business plan indicates that one of its priorities for the coming fiscal year is to “Improve the governance structure of the department.” However, given the unique nature of the department’s operations, an additional $2.6 million is required to cover costs related to employee training, recruitment and retention, as well as departmental initiatives.</seg>
<seg id="1099">On the same page, it talks about $2.6 million for compensation and benefits for employees and casual employees. On the same page, it talks about $2.6 million for CARS services.</seg>
<seg id="1100">Can I get some clarification on that, Mr. Chairman?</seg>
<seg id="1101">This question was already asked by one of my colleagues, but Mr. Akeeagok, if you want to clarify your question, it’s up to you.</seg>
<seg id="1102">If you look at the substantiation sheet, project 3, there is an additional $2.6 million for the Corrections Division.</seg>
<seg id="1103">There are two separate amounts of $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1104">That includes the need for RCMP radios, the need for housing, the need for vehicles, and so on. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1105">Thank you, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="1106">If we’re talking about $2.6 million, what’s the total amount of that, I don’t understand that, can we get some clarification on that?</seg>
<seg id="1107">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="1108">On page 5 of our documents, we are dealing with Law Enforcement, $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1109">Under Corrections, there’s $2.6 million. We’re not dealing with that total right now. We’re dealing with $2.6 million under Law Enforcement.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Do you have any questions?</seg>
<seg id="1111">Mr. Towtongie (interpretation): Thank you for clarifying that.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When I read the Inuktitut version, in English the budget is what it is, but in the Inuktitut version, it seems to be an estimate, an estimate in Inuktitut.</seg>
<seg id="1113">Can the minister clearly explain what this means? Is it an estimate or an estimate for 2017-18?</seg>
<seg id="1114">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) On the left of the main estimates, it talks about $40 million for the Law Enforcement Branch and $11 million for the Directorate Branch that has already been approved.</seg>
<seg id="1115">On my right, (interpretation ends) Not Previously Authorized. (interpretation) We’re still in the 2017-18 fiscal year. (interpretation ends) It’s projected to be able to do that. (interpretation) That’s why we’re trying to get approval for the supplementary appropriation for the Department of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1116">A total of $6.2 million, of which $2.6 million would be for the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="1117">So that’s what we’re requesting from the House. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1118">I was just confused because in the Inuktitut version, it sounds like an estimate.</seg>
<seg id="1119">I think I understand the question now, but I’ll leave it at that.</seg>
<seg id="1120">We are on Law Enforcement. $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1121">The next one is Total Registries and Court Services, $1 million.</seg>
<seg id="1122">Total Justice and Corrections. $2,600,000.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1124">My question is in regard to the Corrections Division. Every year, they go over budget. If memory serves me correct, they go over budget because of overtime.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Am I correct in that?</seg>
<seg id="1126">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1127">The member is correct that the largest amount is for overtime and also for casuals.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Mr. Lightstone.</seg>
<seg id="1129">If my memory serves me correctly, the Baffin Correctional Centre is staffed 12 hours a day. Is that correct?</seg>
<seg id="1130">Given the current overcrowding situation at the Baffin Correctional Centre and the overcrowding situation at the Baffin Correctional Centre, has your department considered introducing a minimum of three to eight hours of overtime for correctional staff?</seg>
<seg id="1131">Perhaps through you, my Deputy Minister, Mr. MacKay, can respond to the question.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The member is correct that they work 12-hour shifts.</seg>
<seg id="1133">That’s how it’s set up. It’s a two-hour shift with 42 hours of overtime.</seg>
<seg id="1134">As a result of the collective agreement, the overtime decreased from $4 million to $2.49 million.</seg>
<seg id="1135">As a result, the Corrections Division’s deficit decreased from $4.5 million to $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1136">We are moving forward with the overtime payments and we will continue to do that.</seg>
<seg id="1137">I remind you to turn off your cellphones and keep them on silent mode.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1139">They operate on an overtime basis and they work 42 hours a week.</seg>
<seg id="1140">Are the employees working 50 hours or 60 hours a week?</seg>
<seg id="1141">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1142">It’s too detailed. We have to provide it to the House and we will provide it in writing.</seg>
<seg id="1143">Our deputy minister cannot respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1144">We don’t have that information.</seg>
<seg id="1145">I don’t know how much information is required for the operation of the facility.</seg>
<seg id="1146">I would like to ask these questions.</seg>
<seg id="1147">What kind of training do they receive?</seg>
<seg id="1148">Through you, I would like Deputy Minister MacKay to respond to that.</seg>
<seg id="1149">I think that answers the member’s question. There is a training and development component of the supplementary appropriation for the Department of Justice under the Corrections Division.</seg>
<seg id="1150">Right now, we don’t provide that training.</seg>
<seg id="1151">We have a trainer that’s contracted out to provide the training and that’s one of the reasons why it’s costing us a lot of money in terms of overtime to provide the training.</seg>
<seg id="1152">We’re also looking at other ways to better plan the budget so that the correctional staff and the court workers can get more training so that we don’t have to rely on contractors.</seg>
<seg id="1153">Ms. Nakasuk.</seg>
<seg id="1154">I was curious to find out about the $2.6 million that was talked about and the staff training.</seg>
<seg id="1155">What types of training will be provided to staff and casuals?</seg>
<seg id="1156">Both the Corrections Division and the Court Services Division provide excellent training for casual and relief workers.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The casuals are hired on a contract basis, but they’re trained for a number of weeks. They’re trained to deal with issues within the corrections system, such as disputes and grievances, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1158">Can the minister clarify what kinds of programs are offered at the Baffin Correctional Centre and, if not, why not?</seg>
<seg id="1159">I don’t know if they have that level of detail, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="1160">Through you, (interpretation ends) Deputy Minister MacKay, (interpretation) I don’t know what they do, but he can elaborate a little bit on that, if you will allow him.</seg>
<seg id="1161">Ms. McKay.</seg>
<seg id="1162">I don’t have the figures in front of me, but I can get back to the member on what type of training is provided to inmates.</seg>
<seg id="1163">Depending on which low-risk inmates are housed at the Baffin Correctional Centre, inmates at the Iqaluit Baffin Correctional Centre receive pre-trades training that will enable them to enter the workforce. These training programs provide inmates with the skills they need to enter the workforce after they leave the correctional facility.</seg>
<seg id="1164">At Akausisarvik, we do have programs that are tailored to each inmate’s needs. Addictions counselling is provided at the facility and anger management counselling is provided on a case-by-case basis to the inmates.</seg>
<seg id="1165">Even though they can’t leave the correctional centre, they are given training so that they can work after they leave the correctional centre, usually they graduate from high school and they are also given trades training in the correctional centre.</seg>
<seg id="1166">In Rankin Inlet, they provide probation services.</seg>
<seg id="1167">There are different types of programs that we provide.</seg>
<seg id="1168">Mr. Nakasuk: I am done.</seg>
<seg id="1169">We’re on page 5.</seg>
<seg id="1170">Justice. Operations and Maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="1171">Total Department. Not Previously Authorized. $6,200,000.</seg>
<seg id="1172">Go to page 6.</seg>
<seg id="1173">Department of Health. Operations and Maintenance. Not Previously Authorized.</seg>
<seg id="1174">Mr. Akeeagok, did you want to make a comment?</seg>
<seg id="1175">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): It’s not a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1176">If it’s okay with you, Mr. Chairman, we will move on to another department. The witness is also available to answer questions. I would like to introduce my witnesses before we proceed with questions. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1177">I was going to give you the opportunity, but if you would like to take this opportunity, it’s okay.</seg>
<seg id="1178">Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the witnesses out.</seg>
<seg id="1179">Does the committee agree to let the official in?</seg>
<seg id="1180">Chairman (interpretation): Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort one witness out and the other witness in.</seg>
<seg id="1181">For the record, Mr. Akeeagok, please introduce your new witness.</seg>
<seg id="1182">To my left is the Deputy Minister of Health and Social Services, Colleen Inuujaq Stockley.</seg>
<seg id="1183">Health. Operations and Maintenance. Not Previously Authorized. Total Directorate. $5.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Mr. Netser: My mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1185">I’ll ask that question when we get to the Travel and Transportation section.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1187">Are there any questions under Directorate.</seg>
<seg id="1188">I don’t have too many questions, but when we’re talking about elders’ facilities in Nunavut, there are three continuing care facilities that are going to be funded from different sources.</seg>
<seg id="1189">A couple of days ago when I was asking questions about the pre-feasibility study for the continuing care centres in Igloolik and Gjoa Haven, they were looking at expanding the facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1190">At that time, the minister was not aware of the number of beds that would be required for the study.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Can the minister update this House on the status of his department’s plans to increase the number of elders’ facilities in Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="1192">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you for the question.</seg>
<seg id="1193">This year, it’s under the preplanning phase. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1194">What is this preplanning study going to entail and what is the status of it at this time?</seg>
<seg id="1195">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Through you, Mr. Chairman, I would like the Deputy Minister of Health to respond because he is more familiar with the capital estimates.</seg>
<seg id="1196">The Department of Health is already planning last year’s capital plan for 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1197">I would like to know if this project can proceed with the Igloolik Health Centre expansion as the minister stated.</seg>
<seg id="1198">With that in mind, after the election, I’m sure the government was going to have new responsibilities and I’m just wondering if the option of expanding the health centre in Igloolik would be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1199">It hasn’t gone too far, but we expect that it will be initiated once we know the mandate of the government.</seg>
<seg id="1200">In conclusion, when we talk about the use of government resources to identify deficiencies in our infrastructure, I would like to take this opportunity to emphasize the department’s role in addressing the issues that arise in the area of elder care.</seg>
<seg id="1201">I am optimistic that this process will continue to evolve to better utilize the existing infrastructure and identify opportunities for Nunavummiut to take advantage of the new infrastructure that is currently on the waiting list.</seg>
<seg id="1202">That was just a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1203">I would like to follow up on my colleague’s questions on the elders’ home operations.</seg>
<seg id="1204">So I would be interested in hearing what the breakdown is of the $900,000.</seg>
<seg id="1205">How is it going to be divided up amongst the communities?</seg>
<seg id="1206">The $900,000 is divided into three categories and it’s $300,000 for each of the three elders.</seg>
<seg id="1207">Ms. Maine (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) I’m just wondering, in the substantiation sheet, it indicates that these units are contracted to a non-profit Nunavut organization.</seg>
<seg id="1208">I’m just wondering: what is the process for the Department of Health to inform the public if they’re going to be over-expended?</seg>
<seg id="1209">The three communities that are operated by the Department of Community and Government Services have recently issued new contracts and this is one of them.</seg>
<seg id="1210">If they need to increase or decrease, the Department of Health and Social Services and these organizations meet together.</seg>
<seg id="1211">When they have to work together, they work together.</seg>
<seg id="1212">They have to abide by federal and territorial laws.</seg>
<seg id="1213">In the substantiation sheet, it states that the three facilities that have just opened are group homes, two- and three-plexes, and there are a number of factors. It states that the majority of the group homes are group homes and aging facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I’m just going to go back to the funding formula. I’m just wondering: in the coming years, is there going to be an anticipated increase in operational costs or is there going to be an end to the funding formula that we have now?</seg>
<seg id="1215">At the beginning of the contract, there were three positions in the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="1216">The Department of Health finally took over the contract in April of 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1217">One of the things that came to our attention was that the Department of Health was a little bit different than the Department of Family Services. We looked at it from a clinical standpoint. We looked at the level of care, the level of care, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1218">That was one of the recommendations that came out of the Nutrition North Canada Advisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When we looked at the contract, the elders’ facilities were not able to provide the level of care that they were supposed to provide.</seg>
<seg id="1220">We’re projecting a deficit of $855,000 last year and we’re requesting $900,000 this year for that purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Correct me if I’m wrong, but when I look at the funding for mental health and addictions, it’s for all of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With respect to trauma, we tend to experience trauma.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Is there any talk of setting aside some money for mental health treatment?</seg>
<seg id="1224">We’re here. We’re just talking about additional funding for O&amp;M. We’re not talking about actual costs.</seg>
<seg id="1225">I don’t think that is appropriate in this House or any other place.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Do you have any further questions, Ms. Towtongie?</seg>
<seg id="1227">Thank you for that clarification.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The mental health contract for 2017-18 is $16.7 million. I believe it’s $6.2 million. What is the status of that?</seg>
<seg id="1229">That is my last question. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1230">Mr. Chairman, the $5.9 million is included in the $43.1 million that the member is asking about.</seg>
<seg id="1231">The details of the $16 million and the $10 million are in there.</seg>
<seg id="1232">I would like Deputy Minister Stockley to elaborate on the details of why they’re asking for an additional $10 million. If you can allow him to respond.</seg>
<seg id="1233">I think it’s good to hear that Nunavummiut are asking for help and I think it’s a good communication tool. You can call your health centre, you can go to the health centre, you can go online, and you can ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="1234">We have seen an increase in the number of clients coming to the treatment centre.</seg>
<seg id="1235">I know people with mental health problems and addictions.</seg>
<seg id="1236">There are also costs that are outside of the Department of Health and Social Services that are covered through the Department of Justice. There are also court-ordered treatment programs that are covered through the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Before we proceed to the Directorate, we will take a five-minute break.</seg>
<seg id="1238">&gt;&gt;Committee recessed at 18:03 and resumed at 18:10</seg>
<seg id="1239">I would like to call the committee meeting back to order.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Total Health and Social Services. $43,100,000.</seg>
<seg id="1241">Under the out-of-territory long-term elder care, you have identified palliative care as one of your priorities.</seg>
<seg id="1242">I think that would increase because we don’t have a palliative care facility in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1243">That’s what I would like to hear.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Are they looking at this issue so that we can have an epidemiology laboratory in Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="1245">It is one of the priorities, but it is not at the top of the list.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Those are the types of things that are being worked on at this time.</seg>
<seg id="1247">On the same page, (interpretation ends) Out-of-Territory, (interpretation) the last bullet talks about out-of-territory funding for the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="1248">It kind of woke me up to the fact that the minister’s letter, broken down by department, didn’t include any of the contents of the over-expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="1249">My question for the minister: can the minister tell the House if his department will be spending its entire budget in this area?</seg>
<seg id="1250">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On page 6, the first bullet, $5.9 million, not previously authorized, is for the out-of-territory long-term care facility for elders within the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="1251">That’s what we’re requesting this year for seniors’ care. We’re requesting $5.9 million for seniors’ care so that we can send them out to the appropriate facilities. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1252">My question was more related to the Department of Health and Social Services over-expenditures in other areas of their budget.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Perhaps through you, Mr. Chairman, if I make a mistake, Deputy Minister Stockley can correct me.</seg>
<seg id="1254">I don’t know if there was a question there, but I can respond by saying that the over-expenditures have not been removed from the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="1255">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you for clarifying that.</seg>
<seg id="1256">If there are any unspent funds within the department, then we transfer those unspent funds to the appropriate department.</seg>
<seg id="1257">With the current over-expenditures that we’re trying to balance out, the surplus for the Department of Health is $49 million.</seg>
<seg id="1258">The letter that I just sent out today will be translated into Inuktitut today and it was sent out in English on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1259">That’s a very small amount compared to the over-expenditure that we’re asking for in this supplementary appropriation. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1260">I appreciate the fact that you mentioned an appendix, but what I was trying to get at was in the correspondence that we received from the minister on page 4, there is a breakdown of various programs and funding.</seg>
<seg id="1261">Under the Department of Family Services, are they showing what they have left over that they can use again?</seg>
<seg id="1262">Why hasn’t the Department of Health and Social Services done that?</seg>
<seg id="1263">There was no indication from the Department of Health that there was going to be a surplus.</seg>
<seg id="1264">On page 5 of the business plan, it indicates that the Department of Health and Social Services will require $49 million in additional funding. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1265">The member is not referring to the divisions of the Department of Health; he is referring to the programs.</seg>
<seg id="1266">In the Department of Health, I know for a fact that there’s a surplus in the regions for nursing recruitment, staffing, and IT. There has been a surplus of over $1 million in the past few years.</seg>
<seg id="1267">Can the minister provide me with a breakdown of all the Department of Health programs that have surpluses that are deducted from their budgets?</seg>
<seg id="1268">You’re asking for very detailed information that may not be available at this time.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Minister Akoak…</seg>
<seg id="1270">…Mr. Akeeagok, please.</seg>
<seg id="1271">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank you for recognizing me.</seg>
<seg id="1272">We don’t have that level of detail in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="1273">We can table it in the House at a later date. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Let me move on to the elders’ facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1275">On the second bullet, it indicates that “Currently, elders’ facilities are operated through contracts with non-profit Nunavut organizations.”</seg>
<seg id="1276">I just want to say that this is a very good program that is available to any organization in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1277">Hopefully, we will be able to get as many contracts as possible.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Moving on to the next page, under 24-hour care, it states that the Department of Health provides 24-hour care seven days a week.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The elders have to be looked after according to the minimum standards.</seg>
<seg id="1280">My question is: does the Department of Health and Social Services ensure that elders’ facilities meet the minimum requirements?</seg>
<seg id="1281">I responded to that question a little bit earlier.</seg>
<seg id="1282">A new contract has been awarded and the increase is due to the Department of Health’s Code of Values and Ethics.</seg>
<seg id="1283">If there is no compliance, then the interpreter/translators and the Department of Health meet with each other to make sure that there is compliance.</seg>
<seg id="1284">Mr. Whitstone.</seg>
<seg id="1285">Can you clarify whether or not these elders’ facilities meet the minimum level of care required?</seg>
<seg id="1286">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1287">As it is a new contract, we have increased the amount from $900,000 to $5.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="1288">The three organizations have indicated that they’re going to try and keep up with the current needs, but they haven’t really reached the level of care that the elders require.</seg>
<seg id="1289">As the minister indicated, they’re trying to catch up on that. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Mr. Netser: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1291">I’m starting to get a sore throat because I’m so quiet.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In regard to medical travel, they’re asking for $50 million and I have brought this up many times in the House that medical travel patients, even though they go to the hospital, they don’t have an appointment, especially in my constituency, there are patients who go to Winnipeg and then they find out that they don’t have an appointment.</seg>
<seg id="1293">I’m just wondering if the Department of Health has a list of patients that were sent down to Winnipeg that were cancelled because they weren’t informed of their appointments. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) I’m just wondering if the Department of Health has a list of how much it cost those patients that were sent down to Winnipeg that didn’t have an appointment and how much it cost them for their travel and accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you for the question.</seg>
<seg id="1295">The Minister of Health has committed to reviewing all medical travel clients, including those who have missed their appointments or have had their appointments changed.</seg>
<seg id="1296">One of the objectives of this government is to undertake a comprehensive review of the Liquor Act so that we can find out where the wrongdoing occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1297">The member has been asking questions and he has said that he has seen those kinds of things and we would like to include that in our review.</seg>
<seg id="1298">I would like to thank the member for raising that issue and it’s something that we can look into collectively.</seg>
<seg id="1299">That will be part of the review of patients who have gone to the doctor without an appointment. (interpretation) Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1300">Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation) I look forward to the results of the review.</seg>
<seg id="1301">At this time, $5.5 million was allocated for tuberculosis in Qikiqtarjuaq and just recently, on February 26, I believe, the federal government allocated a large amount of money to Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami. I believe it was $82 million or $80 million that was allocated for tuberculosis research.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Has the Department of Health and Social Services made a request to Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami to provide funding to fight tuberculosis? Has the government discussed this matter with the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami to see if they can contribute to the fight against tuberculosis?</seg>
<seg id="1303">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1304">That’s a very good question.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Currently, the federal government’s 2018-19 budget provides funding to support Inuit-specific initiatives related to tuberculosis and it also states that Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami will be allocated funding over a five-year period to work with Inuit communities on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Currently, it states that there is a steering committee comprised of representatives from the Inuit homelands and the Department of Health and Social Services is involved.</seg>
<seg id="1307">At this time, the additional funding will be provided by the federal government and I, as the Minister of Finance, have not seen the details.</seg>
<seg id="1308">If Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami is doing their job properly, they will understand us. The Department of Health and Social Services is responsible for that.</seg>
<seg id="1309">That is how it is set up.</seg>
<seg id="1310">As we get more information on the contents of the bill, we will be kept informed by the minister in regard to your excellent question.</seg>
<seg id="1311">I would like to ask another question regarding medical travel patients.</seg>
<seg id="1312">It says here that medical travel is out of control because of interest rates, contract increases, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1313">It’s a $15 million deficit and I’m just wondering if the department has an idea of why it’s going up so much.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The 5.6 percent is projected to increase on an annual basis, so what accounts for that increase?</seg>
<seg id="1315">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Through you, I would like to ask my Deputy Minister, Mr. Stockley, to respond to that.</seg>
<seg id="1317">Medical travel and medical evacuations are increasing every year.</seg>
<seg id="1318">The number of people going to the health centre on a regular basis is also increasing, which could be a good thing because they are diagnosed very early and then they are sent out.</seg>
<seg id="1319">Tuberculosis is a serious issue in Nunavut and is one of the lowest rates of vaccination in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1320">I’ll use an example.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Approximately 60 people had to be medevaced to the hospital in December.</seg>
<seg id="1322">We have seen an increase in the number of medevacs on a weekly basis, but at this time of year, in the springtime, people with respiratory illnesses have to be medevaced.</seg>
<seg id="1323">The combination of scheduled medical travel and emergency medical travel has all increased.</seg>
<seg id="1324">Mr. Chairman, I’m not going to get into the details. I’m just trying to get a sense of what the rationale is for the increase.</seg>
<seg id="1325">I’m just wondering if the population that we have in Nunavut is going to be getting healthier.</seg>
<seg id="1326">I don’t know if I can get an explanation or if my question is too broad, but are we on track or are we being left behind?</seg>
<seg id="1327">I’ll ask Deputy Minister Stockley to respond to that.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Unfortunately, according to the Canada-Nunavut Public Health Strategy, food insecurity is one of the biggest causes of overcrowding. Overcrowding is one of the leading causes of health problems in Nunavut and we have made some progress in addressing that, but I’m hopeful that it will alleviate some of the housing issues.</seg>
<seg id="1329">We also increased the storage capacity at the Qikiqtani General Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="1330">What we’re trying to do is reduce the amount of medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="1331">We are moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="1332">In the other regions, the telehealth system will be used in the three regions.</seg>
<seg id="1333">You will be hearing more about our proposed operations and maintenance budget.</seg>
<seg id="1334">I thank the minister for that answer.</seg>
<seg id="1335">I look forward to the day when we deal with the main estimates for this department.</seg>
<seg id="1336">When you look at the mental health over-expenditures of $10.5 million, the other thing you hear is that it’s an ongoing project, but these are very serious issues.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Looking at the substantiation sheet, it doesn’t say what the reason is for the $10.5 million increase.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Has there been a push by your department to increase the number of people with autism and, if so, what is the reason for that?</seg>
<seg id="1339">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) It’s a combination of assessment and autism.</seg>
<seg id="1340">During the Fourth Session of the Legislative Assembly, the issue of suicide was raised as an urgent priority for the government to take action.</seg>
<seg id="1341">When we’re hiring physicians to provide services in our communities, we will continue to do that and we will continue to do that. We don’t have a training program for physicians to diagnose patients.</seg>
<seg id="1342">It is going to change the lives of our people and I would like the members to keep bringing this up in the House and to the public.</seg>
<seg id="1343">My last question is: under the Mental Health and Addictions Framework for Action, how many clients are currently receiving care outside of the territory for mental health issues?</seg>
<seg id="1344">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 64.</seg>
<seg id="1345">How is it 64? Is it more or less? How does it change from the past?</seg>
<seg id="1346">We don’t have that kind of information in front of us, but if the member wants that information, we will be able to provide it to him perhaps during the main estimates process.</seg>
<seg id="1347">I would like to move on to another subject regarding the Qikiqtarjuaq tuberculosis study. I’m sure all of us will agree that this is very encouraging to hear.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Will the equipment and the equipment be retained by the Department of Health and Social Services in other communities for research purposes or is it too small? Will the equipment stay in the community?</seg>
<seg id="1349">Through you, I’ll have Deputy Minister Stockley respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Will the property assessment be done through the capital estimates?</seg>
<seg id="1351">I am lost.</seg>
<seg id="1352">It’s under capital, so I’m just wondering if I could get a clarification on that.</seg>
<seg id="1353">Through you, I would like Deputy Minister Stockley to respond to that.</seg>
<seg id="1354">The bulk of the assets came from the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="1355">The equipment that we received from the federal government, such as the canoes, the rails, the mattresses, the beds, and so on, is used by the Department of Health and Social Services for their cultural activities.</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1357">My last question, I am sure it is the last one.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Under the Department of Health and Social Services’ Nursing Recruitment and Retention Strategy, it talks about the recruitment of agency nurses and contract nurses. The department has been very successful in reducing the number of agency nurses.</seg>
<seg id="1359">I would like to ask, from this year’s expenditures to the previous years, what has been the change in the amount of money that has been expended on these?</seg>
<seg id="1360">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) They are stable.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Instead of hiring agency nurses, we are using agency nurses here in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1362">From last year to today, we are using more agency nurses.</seg>
<seg id="1363">This is my last question.</seg>
<seg id="1364">If I could get a breakdown of the $8.6 million, I would appreciate it.</seg>
<seg id="1365">Broken down by fiscal year, the 2017-18 full-time staffing shortfall was $52.5 million, with casual staffing expenditures exceeding $45.3 million, overtime expenditures exceeding $15.7 million, and agency nurses exceeding $0.1 million, for a total over-expenditure of $8.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1366">I just have one quick question with respect to the breakdown of what you’re talking about, but I would like to add to Mr. Main’s question.</seg>
<seg id="1367">I don’t have that level of detail in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="1368">If there’s a nurse in Sanikiluaq who has to be medivaced in the middle of the night, and someone has to leave, I know that they have to be overtime.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) All of those are for agency nurses.</seg>
<seg id="1370">I know the minister was answering questions today on what the department is doing to recruit nurses.</seg>
<seg id="1371">I’ll leave that one alone for now.</seg>
<seg id="1372">I just want to make a comment. When we’re reviewing the budget for the Department of Health, we’re looking at physicians, contractors, mental health workers, and medical travel. It’s always reflected in the supplementary appropriations that are put forward every year.</seg>
<seg id="1373">The number for mental health and addictions has changed significantly from last year. I believe it was $6.8 million to $7.8 million in last year’s supplementary appropriation.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Earlier in my Member’s Statement about the budget process and what changes have been made, the Minister of Finance indicated that they haven’t made any changes at this time, but I believe that fundamental changes need to be made because we’re always going back and forth for approval for supplementary appropriations.</seg>
<seg id="1375">When you know that they’re going to have to go over budget, when they’re actually putting the main estimates together, they should be able to come up with the amount that they’re supposed to be using instead of just adding to it.</seg>
<seg id="1376">That was just a comment, but I would like to hear from the minister on that comment.</seg>
<seg id="1377">I’m thinking along the same lines. We’re taking a realistic look now that the Fifth Legislative Assembly is considering these issues and we’ve had discussions with some of the departments, such as Health and Social Services and Justice, that have repeatedly come back for supplementary appropriations.</seg>
<seg id="1378">I’m very pleased that we’re talking about this in the budget and I’m working very closely with my cabinet colleagues on this.</seg>
<seg id="1379">I’m responding to some health-related questions. Ever since I have been the minister, the Department of Health has always been called the Department of Health. It’s a very sensitive department.</seg>
<seg id="1380">I think that’s something that we have to work on, to make sure that the main estimates are accurate and correct, and I’m sure that there are going to be some adjustments made without changing the budget process. We have to recognize that it’s a process that we have to go through.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Only through this Legislative Assembly will we be able to make those changes.</seg>
<seg id="1382">One of our colleagues in the Regular Members’ Caucus made a very good observation.</seg>
<seg id="1383">I am also saying that we have to work closely together as Members of the Legislative Assembly, because we are very much in need of this.</seg>
<seg id="1384">The 2017-18 over-expenditures are one of the challenges that we’re facing and I look forward to working with the Premier and the Members of the Legislative Assembly on some of those processes. We don’t have to sit here and say, “Well, if we know exactly how much money was spent by the departments, we don’t have to come back here and say, “Well, we know how much money was spent.”</seg>
<seg id="1385">I just wanted to make that comment and thank you, Mr. Chairman, for giving me the opportunity to make my comments.</seg>
<seg id="1386">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1387">I applaud the minister for recognizing that there needs to be an improvement.</seg>
<seg id="1388">I just wanted to reiterate, as he stated earlier, that this is something that the Legislative Assembly has always approached our colleagues on a regular basis. The issue of overtime for nurses and other health professionals has always come back and forth. The supplementary appropriation for overtime is something that I have raised and will continue to raise for the next three and a half years.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Again, I think there needs to be some real recognition from the Minister of Human Resources as to how we can fill the capacity within the government.</seg>
<seg id="1390">As we move forward in filling the positions that are already in place within our organizational structure, if we were to fill those positions where there are weaknesses, as Mr. Main was talking about in terms of the challenges that we face in filling positions within the government that are causing stress and illness to some of our employees, we need to take a step back and re-evaluate how we can move forward in filling those positions where our strengths are and not just trying to catch up.</seg>
<seg id="1391">When I talk about overtime, I’m going to want to know a little bit more as we move forward and see where the priorities are and what the initiatives are so that we can look forward to what we can do.</seg>
<seg id="1392">That was just a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Mr. Mikkungwak, did you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1394">Mr. Mikkungwak (interpretation): Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1395">I just have one question in regard to the Mental Health and Addictions Contract. On the fourth bullet, it says that the Department of Justice pays for the costs of medical travel. Is that included in the $10.5 million?</seg>
<seg id="1396">I’ll make it very brief. Yes, they are included.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Mr. Lightstone, do you have any further questions?</seg>
<seg id="1398">My last question is in regard to Mr. Main and Mr. Hickes’ questions.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last one is on the hospital staffing deficit of $8.6 million. It’s a shortfall of $143 million. You’re indicating $151 million to reach that 8.6.</seg>
<seg id="1400">Is that for all the salaries and benefits of the department?</seg>
<seg id="1401">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Yes, those are for compensation and benefits.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1403">Is this $151 million 100 percent accurate?</seg>
<seg id="1404">There is a $25 million increase in compensation and benefits.</seg>
<seg id="1405">I don’t think the funding has ever been at 100 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1406">I was talking about indeterminate, casual, and overtime. I think what we have been trying to do is we’re asking for $8.6 million in our main estimates for compensation and benefits. I think that’s the closest we can get to that.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It’s not 100 percent accurate in our accounting. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1408">It’s quite a long list.</seg>
<seg id="1409">Moving on to the minister’s opening comments on page 4, there is a budget for medical travel of $63.8 million for fiscal year 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1410">I’m just wondering why the money was set aside for the 2016-17 fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’ll wait for 2016-17. I don’t have that information in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="1412">I can get that information if you wish. (interpretation ends) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1413">Mr. Lightstone, we’re dealing with 2016-17, not 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1414">I’ll keep that in mind for 2016-17.</seg>
<seg id="1415">I asked about the medical travel budget last year and I would like to know how much the department is planning to allocate for 2018-19.</seg>
<seg id="1416">This is for 2017-18 and it’s not anticipated for next year because Mr. Akeeagok may not have the numbers.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) I don’t think it’s too early. In May, we will be discussing the budget for 2018-19.</seg>
<seg id="1418">We are voting on an interim appropriation for 2017-18. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1419">To reiterate, there is a problem with the funding formula and that’s one of the things that the minister provided. There are a lot of inconsistencies in the funding formula. It was done on an annual basis and prior to any adjustments being made, it should be in the next fiscal year, but at that time, I will be making a formal request to the Department of Health for the operations and maintenance budget.</seg>
<seg id="1420">As a Member of the Legislative Assembly, I don’t want to see a supplementary appropriation every year.</seg>
<seg id="1421">It’s going to be the same as the way it was before, so I would like to know the details of the operations and maintenance part of it.</seg>
<seg id="1422">That was just a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Chairman (interpretation): Mr. Qirngnuq, do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1424">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1425">I have one question under Travel and Transportation. If I were to say it in English, I would like to get clarification on Travel and Transportation. The third bullet for April indicates that the number of scheduled medical evacuations has increased from the previous year. Can the minister clarify that for me?</seg>
<seg id="1426">The member is referring to medical travel. There has been an increase in the use of medical travel for terminally ill patients. There has also been an increase in the number of births.</seg>
<seg id="1427">However, the number of patients requiring medical travel is increasing.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Mr. Mikkungwak, do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1429">I am sorry, I thought you had your hand up.</seg>
<seg id="1430">We are on Health. Operations and Maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="1431">We have completed $43,100,000. If you go to the bottom, Total Department. $49 million.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Not previously authorized.</seg>

<seg id="1435">I am sorry, let me go back a bit.</seg>
<seg id="1436">Bill 3, Supplementary Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, No. 3, 2017-2018.</seg>

<seg id="1442">Minister Akeeagok, do you have any closing comments?</seg>
<seg id="1443">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) I would like to take this opportunity to thank the members for their questions on the budgeting process for the upcoming fiscal year, as well as the hard work of our staff in putting together the best estimates that we can.</seg>
<seg id="1444">With that, we will be able to make changes to the budget.</seg>
<seg id="1445">Before we go to the next bill, I would like to ask the minister to escort the witnesses out.</seg>
<seg id="1446">I would also like to thank him for his good work and he will now be able to stand up.</seg>
<seg id="1447">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you. Did you want to bring in another witness?</seg>
<seg id="1448">Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the witness out.</seg>
<seg id="1449">Moving on, Bill 4.</seg>

<seg id="1460">We’re trying to be as transparent as possible to the public out there.</seg>

<seg id="1520">As Speaker of this House and Chair of the Order of Nunavut Advisory Council, it is with great pride that I announce this year’s recipients of the Order of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1521">On January 1, 2010, the Order of Nunavut Act came into force.</seg>
<seg id="1522">It is meant to recognize individuals who have made outstanding contributions to our territory and to our communities.</seg>
<seg id="1523">The Order of Nunavut is the highest honour of any Government of Nunavut official that receives an award, medal, or medal.</seg>
<seg id="1524">To date, 15 individuals have been honoured with the Order of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1525">They have been recognized for their hard work and dedication to a wide range of areas, including public service broadcasting, education, language advocacy, diversity leadership, and economic development.</seg>
<seg id="1526">I am especially proud to announce the two recipients of the Order of Nunavut this year, Ms. Betty Brewster and Mr. Ludy Pudluk.</seg>
<seg id="1527">I am very pleased that Mr. Pudluk is here with us today.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Welcome, Mr. Pudluk.</seg>
<seg id="1529">As members are aware, Betty Brewster is well known for her work as an interpreter for many years.</seg>
<seg id="1530">In 2016, she was also recognized for her work and accomplishments by the Inuit Uqausinginnik Taiguusiliuqtiit with the Language Award.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Mr. Pudluk was a Member of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories from 1975 to 1995.</seg>
<seg id="1532">During his many years of service, Mr. Pudluk represented the High Arctic communities and was an integral part of the leadership that led to the creation of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1533">I am pleased to announce that the Order of Nunavut will be presented to Ms. Brewster and Mr. Pudluk during the spring 2018 sitting of the Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="1534">The ceremony will take place in the Chamber of the Legislative Assembly and will be televised across the territory.</seg>

<seg id="6">“Religious Rev. Evangelist who is best known for his activism, zero tolerance for climate change and his fundraising efforts to help the world eliminate Christianity came to Iqaluit’s cathedral on Aug. 27.”</seg>
<seg id="7">“Rodney Harvard-Brown, a Saudi from South Africa who moved to the United Nations, told attendees at a rally near Tomba Bay last year that international leaders honoured Lucyva and drank her human blood.”</seg>
<seg id="8">He preached for more than an hour at Iqaluit’s cathedral to more than 100 people.</seg>
<seg id="9">But their messages are not for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="10">“The whole Arctic is currently reeling from what happened last night.</seg>
<seg id="11">“If you want that light, please stand here (at the prayer table), or you can leave.”</seg>
<seg id="12">“It’s up to you,” Herbert-Brown said after two and a half hours of work.”</seg>
<seg id="13">About 50 people attended.</seg>
<seg id="14">“I didn’t fly thousands of miles to play.</seg>
<seg id="15">“I did not come here to be liked, and I did not come here to ask for your permission... Remember: when Jesus died alive, he asked people to leave the room.”</seg>
<seg id="16">“The turnout was higher among Inuit and infants, teenagers and elders.”</seg>
<seg id="17">“Inside the Christian Fellowship Church in Iqaluit’s Ruth Du Nuvi area, children running between chairs.”</seg>
<seg id="18">“From the outside, the church and Masque face each other directly beyond the parking lot, which faces Ted Dawg Lake.”</seg>
<seg id="19">“Harvard-Brown’s mission was part of an organized event organized by the Bill Prankard Evangelistic Association’s Arctic Hope Project, based in Ottawa.”</seg>
<seg id="20">The organization did not respond to Nunatsiaq News’ request for comment on the matter.</seg>
<seg id="21">“This Evangelist event, which is the 119th of its 300 scheduled community events, kicked off after an hour of activity.”</seg>
<seg id="22">“In the first place, the Iqaluit-based choir launched this evening in Iqaluit after the late Evangelist Reverend Louis Arreak, who helped start the Christian Fellowship Church.”</seg>
<seg id="23">“Eric Gagnon, co-founder of the Howard-Brown Rifle Association of Churches in Indianapolis, spent 40 minutes speaking to the president.”</seg>
<seg id="24">“Louie Arreak, the Iqaluit Evangelist and singer, sang before Rodney Hubert-Brown spoke.”</seg>

<seg id="26">“God loves someone who gives so much”</seg>
<seg id="27">Gagnon asks attendees to submit their email addresses by registering and follow Herbert-Brown on Instagram.</seg>
<seg id="28">She handed out vouchers for Howard-Brown religious goods.</seg>
<seg id="29">“And he published Howard-Brown’s forthcoming book, The Killing of the Planet, in which he describes the experiences of a troubled economy over the past 200 years.”</seg>
<seg id="30">“This is about someone who dislikes Christ, that’s what he should be talking about,” Gagnon said.”</seg>
<seg id="31">Gagne then shows an 18-minute video of Howard-Brown’s adventures (evangelical).</seg>
<seg id="32">“In the end of the video, Howard-Brown prayed that those who donate money to his church will receive God’s protection for the souls of his church.”</seg>
<seg id="33">“God loves a generous donor”, Howard-Brown said in her video.”</seg>

<seg id="58">“When asked to respond to Howard-Brown’s numerous media barrages, in which he also suggested that the United States Supreme Court should shoot down an American law that is unconstitutional, Netser said, “What happens in America is not my responsibility.”</seg>
<seg id="59">My main concern is for my people and the people of Nunavut.”</seg>

<seg id="131">“The Anglican Church works on the principle of conscience, and works with other prayer groups, Parsons said.”</seg>
<seg id="132">“But there is good faith in each other, and it doesn’t do anything that would be incompatible with the religion and the people who go to church there.”</seg>

<seg id="134">“I’m not here to pursue my religious dreams.</seg>

<seg id="4">“At the federal election tomorrow, the Liberal government released its long-awaited Northern Policy Framework.”</seg>
<seg id="5">(File photo)</seg>
<seg id="6">By Jim Bell</seg>
<seg id="7">“On the day before the national election campaign kicks off, the Liberal government, with little attendance, launched its long-awaited Northern and Northern Policy Framework on September 10.”</seg>
<seg id="8">“This document, which presents the first results of the ongoing process, replaces former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s 2009 Arctic Strategy and the Harper government’s 2010 statement on Canada’s Arctic foreign policy.”</seg>
<seg id="9">This is intended to guide federal policy in the Arctic until 2030 – but there is no implementation plan or political framework to guide future actions.</seg>
<seg id="10">“Those will be done in the second phase, the strategy says.”</seg>
<seg id="11">“Despite all of this, this initiative comes as Carolyn Bennett, the minister of Crown-Indigenous Affairs and Northern Development, said this policy document marks a “significant change in direction for the federal government.”</seg>
<seg id="12">The release of this policy has been delayed more than expected.</seg>
<seg id="13">“This winter, Bennett said he hopes to have that policy in place by June.”</seg>
<seg id="14">CBC reported earlier this month that a news conference scheduled to take place in Yellowknife in August had been cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="15">“The Liberals have eight “strategies,” which include a set of goals, and 10 “principles.”</seg>
<seg id="16">“They discussed a wide range of policy issues, including community and regional economic development, infrastructure development, Indigenous rights, environmental protection, national security and foreign policy.”</seg>
<seg id="17">“Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, in his December 20, 2016, announcement that his government would propose new policies, promised a “reconciliation” process between northern governments and Indigenous groups.”</seg>
<seg id="18">“As a result, more than 25 Indigenous groups, including the Government of Nunavut, the Northwest Territories, the Yukon, Manitoba, Quebec and Newfoundland-Labrador, joined the coalition.”</seg>
<seg id="19">“Through the co-development of Canada’s Arctic and Northern Policy Framework, our partners have helped us understand and raise awareness of the unprecedented rights and responsibilities of different territories, responsibilities and residency rights across the Arctic,” Bennett said in a release.</seg>
<seg id="20">“And some of the partners also wrote their terms of reference, which are presented in separate policy documents.”</seg>
<seg id="21">Some of the comments do not address federal policy</seg>
<seg id="22">“For example, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the Government of Nunavut, the Government of the Northwest Territories and the three territorial governments have jointly issued personal statements.”</seg>
<seg id="23">But there is something going on.</seg>
<seg id="24">Such correspondence submitted by participants may not represent federal policy.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is a sign that the federal government may be running into obstacles in agreeing to a deal with more than 31 parties.</seg>
<seg id="26">“While this strategy document is part of the overall strategy, it does not necessarily reflect the views of the federal government or other partners,” the strategy document said.”</seg>
<seg id="27">The document also said the approval process was fraught.</seg>
<seg id="28">“These ideas, objectives and goals and aspirations are the product of a meeting of many minds and ideas.”</seg>
<seg id="29">This means there is an occasional agreement between the federal government and Indigenous parties to seek our approval.”</seg>
<seg id="30">You can find garbage trucks with Arctic policies on display here.</seg>
<seg id="31">8 Goals</seg>
<seg id="32">“There are eight objectives in the strategy, which reflect the federal government’s commitment.”</seg>
<seg id="33">“A strong, sustainable, diversified and sustainable local and regional economy.”</seg>
<seg id="34">• Ensuring Canada’s Arctic and Arctic Indigenous peoples are sustainable and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="35">• Ensuring Canada’s Arctic and Arctic Inuit are safe and protected.</seg>
<seg id="36">• A stronger institution where differences can be reconciled with those elsewhere in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="37">• A legislative framework for the Arctic provides an effective framework for new opportunities and opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="38">• Technical and understanding guidelines for decision-making.</seg>
<seg id="39">• Keep Canada’s Arctic and Arctic ecosystems healthy and vibrant.</seg>
<seg id="40">• Co-development helps sustain and restore trust between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people.</seg>
<seg id="41">These goals start with a series of “projects” outlined in more detail.</seg>
<seg id="42">Ten principles</seg>
<seg id="43">“As well as addressing these goals and objectives, the policy document lays out a set of principles underneath, which are designed to “continue to guide the implementation of the program”:”</seg>
<seg id="44">“Decisions about the Arctic will be made in a spirit of cooperation and northern participation, reflecting rights, needs and Arctic aspirations.”</seg>
<seg id="45">“The rights and positions of federal, provincial, Indigenous and municipal governments will be respected.”</seg>
<seg id="46">“Development must be practical and robust, socially, culturally, economically and environmentally minded.”</seg>
<seg id="47">“Continued reconciliation with Indigenous peoples, using the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission as a starting point, will be the key to success.”</seg>
<seg id="48">“To address the reality of climate change in this region, action will be taken by a wide range of stakeholders, including its impact on Indigenous peoples, who continue to depend on land and wildlife for culture, economic development and food security.”</seg>
<seg id="49">“The policy and program will highlight inequalities and inequality, and apply resources such as a gender-specific survey (Gender-Based Analysis Plus) to address issues that may affect different ethnic groups.”</seg>
<seg id="50">“This is a framework that takes into account multilateral principles that ensure the rights, interests and status of Inuit, Arctic Indigenous and Métis peoples are respected, defined and implemented.”</seg>
<seg id="51">“The Government of Canada recognizes the Inuit, Indigenous and Métis Indigenous peoples of Canada, in many ways, as rights-conscious communities, with their own histories, along with those of the federal government.”</seg>
<seg id="52">“• Working towards a partnership based on rights, respect, partnerships that reflect the aspirations, priorities and circumstances of each individual.”</seg>
<seg id="53">“Both organizations, from the private sector to universities and colleges, along with non-profit organizations, community organizations and independent Canadians, have a critical role to play in building a stronger Canada in the Arctic.”</seg>

<seg id="6">“The Conservative candidate says that if a Conservative government were to be formed, they would abolish the carbon tax because “it raises the cost of everything.”</seg>
<seg id="7">Leona Aglukkaq begins her election campaign tour of Nunavut communities.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Nunavut MP kicked off his election campaign in Iqaluit with an event on September 12 at the Frobisher Hotel.</seg>
<seg id="9">He later flew to Rankin Inlet the next day before returning to Iqaluit next week.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nunatsiaq News was able to speak with Aglukkaq while she was in Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="11">“The carbon tax “boosts the cost of air travel, shipping, hunting and homeownership,” says Aglukkaq’s campaign poster.</seg>
<seg id="12">Aglukkaq also told Nunatsiaq News that the tax has a negative impact on daycares and elders’ homes by increasing heating costs.</seg>
<seg id="13">“Every single product is affected by this smoke tax.”</seg>
<seg id="14">Aglukkaq said.</seg>
<seg id="15">“The carbon tax when we can’t afford it is like not being able to speak to a computer.”</seg>
<seg id="16">“However, George Hickes, Nunavut’s finance minister, announced in May that under an agreement with Ottawa, electricity and aviation fuels that once belonged to Nunavut were exempt from this tax.”</seg>
<seg id="17">The Government of Nunavut also contributes half of the cost of the carbon tax to Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="18">“Aglukkaq’s candidates for Nunavut have four priorities: affordability, housing, mental health and job creation.”</seg>
<seg id="19">“How can we as a government and the private sector and the Government of Nunavut work together to address the huge housing needs across the Arctic?”</seg>
<seg id="20">“Housing Aglukkaq’s campaign priority is to develop a strategy that includes housing for those in need, elders’ housing and disability housing.”</seg>
<seg id="21">“Federal and territorial governments must also focus on promoting homeownership, he said.”</seg>
<seg id="22">Aglukkaq also mentioned the creation of northern facilities and mental health education for Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="23">“Nunavut is a large territory with excellent coastlines in Canada and we are still left with much needed marine infrastructure in our territory, so we have to consider large-scale projects like this in the Arctic,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="24">“We must address housing needs, training Nunavummiut to access mental health services so we can support our communities.”</seg>
<seg id="25">“When asked if it would impede the federal government’s Nutrition North program, Aglukkaq said the carbon tax has caused food prices to rise through increased freight costs.”</seg>
<seg id="26">“When asked if he would consider using that program, and if not, what he would do other than a carbon tax, he said he would discuss it with the Nutrition North Advisory Board.”</seg>
<seg id="27">“She said that if the Conservative government became government, that board would remain in place.”</seg>
<seg id="28">“It’s important to have people in the north who can advise the government on how to improve the program.</seg>
<seg id="29">This is not a very good project.</seg>
<seg id="30">Not everything is perfect in the world.</seg>
<seg id="31">But there has to be a subsidy for Arctic food.”</seg>
<seg id="32">“Aglukkaq did not want to be specific about what she would say about Nutrition North, but said there should be subsidies for food and “repeal” would not help.”</seg>
<seg id="33">“Most recently, a study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal found that food is harder to eat in Nunavut under the Nutrition North Canada Program, as outlined in the Canadian Community Health Survey.”</seg>
<seg id="34">“Aglukkaq said her work as minister of the environment would help combat climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but she did not elaborate on how she would do so.”</seg>
<seg id="35">He said he would support the Kivalliq transport link (hydro-fibre link) and the Green Bay railway and the Kitikmeot port.</seg>
<seg id="36">“Are we likely to eliminate our dependence on fossil fuels in the near future?</seg>
<seg id="37">“No,” she said.”</seg>
<seg id="38">“When Conservative prime minister Andrew Scheer visited Iqaluit this past June, he stressed the need for Nunavut to develop a recycling program, saying it is “a real challenge” under the current Liberal government.”</seg>
<seg id="39">Aglukkaq said she believes policies have already been put in place to engage Inuit in discussions about recycling development and it’s unclear whether they will be put in place now.</seg>
<seg id="40">“The Nunavut Land Claims Agreement provides clarity on how business should be conducted in the Arctic. The land claims agreement, in my view, is the most important part of the environmental plan.”</seg>
<seg id="41">“It protects our land, it protects our water, it protects our wildlife.”</seg>
<seg id="42">“There is already a set of requirements for how projects should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="43">And it has become a legal imperative and we should be very proud of it.</seg>
<seg id="44">“Any decisions about the Arctic must come from the people of the Arctic, not from Ottawa.”</seg>
<seg id="45">“Aglukkaq left her headquarters to go to Pond Inlet and Arctic Bay on September 19, her office said.”</seg>
<seg id="46">“He also plans to travel to Pangnirtung, Qikiqtarjuaq and Clyde River before heading to the Kivalliq and Kitikmeot regions.”</seg>

<seg id="2">Helen Klanberg quits her job due to health issues</seg>
<seg id="3">“Nunavut MLAs will soon begin the search for a new Nunavut Languages Commissioner, after Helen Klanenberg leaves her position.”</seg>
<seg id="4">Klanberg has served as the Languages Commissioner since 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">By Nunatsiaq News</seg>
<seg id="6">“Nunavut MLAs will soon begin the search for a new Languages Commissioner, following the resignation of Helen Klanberg from that position.”</seg>
<seg id="7">“Klansberg, who served as Nunavut’s Languages Commissioner starting in June 2017, resigned recently due to health reasons.”</seg>
<seg id="8">“Because the Languages Commissioner is an official of the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut and reports directly to the Legislative Assembly, the current Legislative Assembly will choose Klanberg’s replacement.”</seg>
<seg id="9">“This would be done through the Management and Services Board, the committee of MLAs that oversees the legislative assembly’s administrative functions, Speaker Simeon Mikkungwak said in a brief statement this past September 17.”</seg>
<seg id="10">“I anticipate that the Management and Services Board will begin the recruitment process in the near future and will make an announcement if necessary on an acting basis,” Mikkungwak said.</seg>
<seg id="11">“The role of the Languages Commissioner, under the terms outlined in the Official Languages Act, is to act as a language rights watchdog in Nunavut.”</seg>
<seg id="12">“Klansberg was appointed in 2017 after a lengthy search that lasted almost a year, following the sudden resignation of Sandra Inutiq in June 2016.”</seg>
<seg id="13">Inutiq resigned from his position a month later after submitting a report on the Qikiqtani General Hospital that found the hospital does not have a language policy and does not provide adequate services to Inuktitut- and French-speaking patients.</seg>
<seg id="14">He also said the deputy health minister had applied for a year’s worth of records.</seg>
<seg id="15">“Subsequently, MLAs advertised for the position three times prior to the appointment of Klanberg.”</seg>
<seg id="16">“In 2017, the Languages Commissioner’s job was paid anywhere from $119,000 to $170,000 a year, with a northern allowance of $15,016 a year, 25 days of paid leave a year and a variety of other benefits.”</seg>

<seg id="1">Canadian Inuit Association to Expand Strategy on Inuit Nunangat</seg>
<seg id="2">“ITK’s campaign priorities included reducing inequality, building infrastructure, Inuit entrepreneurship”</seg>
<seg id="3">The Canadian Inuit representative group wants a broader economic strategy for Inuit Nunangat “to track the development of a national railway or railway that connects eastern Canada to western Canada.”</seg>
<seg id="4">The Canadian Inuit Association has made a major announcement to whoever becomes Canada’s next federal governor: the creation of a major sovereignty corridor in Inuit Nunangat “to track the development of a national railway or railway network connecting eastern Canada to western Canada.”</seg>
<seg id="5">“In support of this, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami released a list of nine topics that priority MLA candidates should consider during the current federal election campaign.”</seg>
<seg id="6">“Inuit Nunangat is one of the most undeveloped regions in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="7">“Inuit are experiencing unfair treatment compared to other Canadians, as well as other Canadians living in Inuit Nunangat,” ITK said in a release.”</seg>
<seg id="8">“In addition to this, ITK has also released a list of proposals for the next federal government’s 2020 budget, which is expected to be released in February or March.”</seg>
<seg id="9">The budget submission strongly recommends that the next government of Canada continue to implement Inuit Nunangat policies with Inuit-specific benefits.</seg>
<seg id="10">“ITK tells all provincial and territorial governments to work towards the implementation of Inuit land policy at all levels of government, so that Inuit can access and benefit from policies, programs and initiatives intended to benefit our people,” ITK President Nathan Obed said in a release.”</seg>
<seg id="11">Each of the two documents contains the following demands:</seg>
<seg id="12">• Launch in all 51 Inuit Nunangat communities using fibre optic telecommunications by 2031.</seg>
<seg id="13">• eliminate technical problems in Inuit Nunangat by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="14">• End the housing backlog in all four Inuit Nunangat communities within two years.</seg>
<seg id="15">• Develop more substance abuse treatment facilities.</seg>
<seg id="16">• Develop more family violence shelters and temporary housing.</seg>
<seg id="17">• More investment in people with mental illness and suicide prevention.</seg>
<seg id="18">The nine specific Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami language priorities are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="19">1.</seg>
<seg id="20">Work on social justice and suicide prevention.</seg>
<seg id="21">Item 2.</seg>
<seg id="22">Work on housing to ensure that all those on the waiting list are eligible for housing in the Inuit homeland within two years of being elected.</seg>
<seg id="23">Item 3.</seg>
<seg id="24">“To address energy and climate change, Canadians must eliminate greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.”</seg>
<seg id="25">4.</seg>
<seg id="26">Work to strengthen Inuit-Crown relations.</seg>
<seg id="27">Item 5.</seg>

<seg id="2">“We will do everything we can to make sure this happens before the polar bear hunting season”</seg>

<seg id="6">Cambridge Bay – GN approves new polar bear management plan</seg>
<seg id="7">This was announced by the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board members at the Kitikmeot Wildlife Management Board’s annual general meeting in Cambridge Bay last week.</seg>
<seg id="8">“The starting point for this new polar bear management plan is a balanced male and female polar bear hunt for Nunavut’s polar bears, Nunavut Wildlife Management Board Chairman Dan Shewchuk, told delegates.”</seg>
<seg id="9">“The meeting in Cambridge Bay is the first of three regional wildlife board meetings that he and Jason Akeeagok, the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board’s executive director, plan to attend.”</seg>
<seg id="10">Akeeagok said the polar bear management plan was “a lot of work.”</seg>
<seg id="11">“We’re going to do everything we can to make sure that happens before the polar bear hunting season,” he said.”</seg>
<seg id="12">“This plan has been under consideration for nearly five years, and was announced in a plan to be developed this past March in Iqaluit at the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board meeting.”</seg>
<seg id="13">The plan will be in place until 2029.</seg>

<seg id="17">“Of all the Arctic regions in the world’s 19 regions where polar bears live, 12 are concentrated in Nunavut.”</seg>
<seg id="18">Polar bear quotas have been set by region (e.g. male-only) of the polar bear population – and the killing of polar bears in protected areas is included in the yearly polar bear quota set by communities.</seg>
<seg id="19">“Although the new plan will not increase the total allowable harvest at this time, a new total allowable harvest may be considered when new data is collected.”</seg>
<seg id="20">“Under the previous plan, Nunavut communities were allowed to harvest one female polar bear out of every two males harvested through annual community polar bear tags.”</seg>
<seg id="21">“This was done only in the Baffin Bay polar bear population, where there is equal access to female and male polar bears. Under the new plan, it will not matter whether a polar bear harvested in Nunavut is male or female but must be treated equally.”</seg>
<seg id="22">At least half the names would be tagged.</seg>
<seg id="23">This new balanced male/female polar bear quota will allow community polar bear protection to continue if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="24">“Increased polar bear visits to communities have been a concern in Nunavut following the deaths of two polar bears in the Kivalliq region last year – however, under the current management plan, a protected kill of a polar bear, if it was a female, would result in the use of two tags.”</seg>
<seg id="25">As a result, some communities no longer have tags to protect polar bears.</seg>
<seg id="26">“This new plan could prevent more communities from importing polar bears, Shewchuk told Nunatsiaq News.”</seg>
<seg id="27">“But he has previously said that polar bear encounters are dangerous to Inuit culture and way of life, because they damage cabins, bird habitats and seals.”</seg>
<seg id="28">Attendees at the meeting in Cambridge Bay welcomed the changes to the polar bear management plan.</seg>
<seg id="29">They were also pleased that the dog team would soon have five more tags for grizzly bears.</seg>
<seg id="30">A large gull was seen and shot as it got too close to several houses in Mount Bailey.</seg>
<seg id="31">“On the other hand, with this new polar bear management plan they may have a different perspective.”</seg>
<seg id="32">“The future of polar bears is uncertain because of climate change, according to a 2018 study by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Species in Canada (COSEWIC). The committee, COSEWIC, further assessed polar bears as “a matter of serious concern.”</seg>
<seg id="33">It means that polar bears are at risk of extinction due to a combination of invasive species and designated threats.</seg>

<seg id="1">Inuktitut Roman orthography – Strategy and Appeal</seg>
<seg id="2">Our contributions today to our children and future generations</seg>
<seg id="3">This is Roman orthography – applicable to all Inuit languages across the country.</seg>
<seg id="4">Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami says it will not replace syllabics and that Inuit Nunangat’s traditional use of syllabics and other materials will remain intact.</seg>
<seg id="5">Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami has also said Inuit will not have to replace traditional writing systems.</seg>
<seg id="6">By the correspondence of Mayor &lt;unk&gt;man</seg>
<seg id="7">“I was very proud to hear that the board of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami unanimously approved the creation of a new Inuktitut writing system, named after the syllabic version of Inuktitut that was released earlier this month.”</seg>
<seg id="8">Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami means “the unity of the Canadian people” and there are few better examples of the power our people have long shared to ensure the survival of our culture and language.</seg>
<seg id="9">That to me at this point in time is encouraging.</seg>
<seg id="10">“In June 2011 • as the president of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, we launched a courageous renewal campaign to change our education system.”</seg>
<seg id="11">“We launched a national campaign for Inuinnaqtun education with 10 ambitious recommendations that reflected our shared vision of giving our children the right to the education they deserve, safeguarding their language and culture and language.”</seg>
<seg id="12">Our recommendations included the creation of a centralized public registry.</seg>
<seg id="13">Individual Canadians have spent decades trying to reach that goal and we are reaching a new chapter in our history.</seg>
<seg id="14">Inuinnaqtun language conservationists in every community in the Inuit homeland paved the way for the creation of Inuktitut Roman orthography.</seg>
<seg id="15">This means that we will have a single writing system in which all Inuit learn their language in a meaningful way.</seg>
<seg id="16">The use of this new system will be gradual.</seg>
<seg id="17">“My vision for Inuinnaqtun writing systems will not replace or preserve the traditional community writing system, as it is designed to participate in existing writing systems to improve Inuinnaqtun communications.”</seg>
<seg id="18">Our contribution today is to our children and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="19">I can now imagine that Inuinnaqtun-speaking Canadians will be better able to communicate and share humorous materials and teaching materials so that high-quality teaching is no longer an issue and our children will graduate from high school with the ability to write and speak both languages.</seg>
<seg id="20">“We face a global development challenge as ordinary people. Our attempts to uphold Western values have severely limited our social culture, family structure, and language.”</seg>
<seg id="21">But we are here today.</seg>
<seg id="22">Over the years we have had to look back at our history to understand who we are today and why we are where we are today.</seg>
<seg id="23">I believe that with our switchboard-like system are we going to have to keep looking backwards or are we going to focus on the future.</seg>
<seg id="24">The use of Inuktitut and Roman orthography in Canada’s civil society sends a message that we want to move forward together as a united people.</seg>
<seg id="25">“It has been eight years since we launched the national campaign for Inuit education, where we have been able to promote the word “Inuktut” to mean all Inuit in each language, regardless of their origin or different dialect.”</seg>
<seg id="26">That leads me to see that by uniting the Inuit people, we can overcome all of the system’s unrealistic barriers.</seg>
<seg id="27">“We are blessed with our language and our identity, and the health of our language keeps us healthy.”</seg>
<seg id="28">I’m hopeful that we can use Inuktitut in all languages and writing systems going forward. • We share the challenges of filling our vacancies with ordinary people.</seg>

<seg id="3">“Quebec Premier Francois Legger apologized to Indigenous Indians and Inuit of Quebec on October 2, following news reports of discrimination in the ongoing work of the Public Service.”</seg>
<seg id="4">(Screen grab)</seg>
<seg id="5">“Thus, the Quebec government has not fulfilled its obligations to Indigenous peoples, Leggo said.”</seg>
<seg id="6">“Liego made his apology – the first of 142 recommendations in the report – at the National Indigenous Roundtable on Wednesday, October 2, two days after former Supreme Court Justice Jack Wainwright, the commission’s executive director, delivered his report.”</seg>
<seg id="7">“It’s not fit for purpose, Leggett said.”</seg>
<seg id="8">He said he would review all of the decisions and look into the reasons for the discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="9">“Many of the laws, policies, practices or institutional practices that perpetuate inequality and prejudice have resulted in serious deficiencies in the delivery of services to Indigenous First Nations and Inuit,” Wines said in her September 30 report.</seg>

<seg id="18">The need to fund and administer health and social services was also raised by members during the inquiry.</seg>
<seg id="19">“We look forward to the Quebec government acting on the report’s recommendations, and in a manner that is collaborative in its design and use,” said executive director Minnie Gray in an October 2 press release.”</seg>
<seg id="20">The committee also thanked the commission for putting the Quebec Arbitration Commission in charge of implementing the 142 recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="21">Makivik President Charlie Watt also spoke at the inquiry into Nunavik’s actions and said in an October 1 news release that Inuit were able to provide feedback on the research.</seg>
<seg id="22">“On many occasions, in tears, my fellow Inuit spoke to the commission about their experiences in the areas of health, justice, social services, youth protection, historical problems and other Quebec government services,” Watt said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Three legislative proposals promise to eliminate Nunavut’s dependence on diesel fuel by 2030</seg>
<seg id="2">“This is a lot of work”</seg>
<seg id="3">Students walked across four corners of Iqaluit on September 27 to participate in a global climate change protest.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three legislative candidates for the federal government say they want to eliminate Nunavut’s dependence on fossil fuels for electricity by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="5">(Photo courtesy of Dustin Pattar)</seg>
<seg id="6">By Dustin Pattar</seg>
<seg id="7">“During this federal election campaign, three legislative candidates announced that Nunavut’s use of diesel fuel for electricity would be banned by 2030.”</seg>
<seg id="8">“Currently all 25 communities in Nunavut have diesel-fueled power plants operated by the Qulliq Energy Corp., the only power company in Canada that does not have refined electricity in their communities.”</seg>
<seg id="9">Changing that would be a huge and expensive task.</seg>
<seg id="10">“This is a very ambitious project,” said Martha Lien, Arctic renewable energy specialist for the World Wildlife Fund.”</seg>
<seg id="11">“It’s probably possible, just with a little bit of luck.”</seg>
<seg id="12">The Green Party’s campaign promise is to “implement a renewable energy system.</seg>
<seg id="13">“By 2030, all of Canada’s electricity will come from renewable sources.”</seg>
<seg id="14">This includes banning outpost camps in northern communities from using teaspoons of fuel to generate electricity.”</seg>
<seg id="15">“The Liberal Party says it will “move forward financially by eliminating Inuit communities from fossil fuels but generating electricity using clean, renewable energy – like hydro, wind and solar power – by 2030.”</seg>
<seg id="16">The New Democratic Party (NDP) said “the goal is to enable Canada to generate electricity from non-carbon sources of energy by 2030... this low carbon energy investment will focus on communities and create jobs.</seg>
<seg id="17">“We would support initiatives such as community-owned and operated clean energy projects to create jobs for residents and skilled people, and work with Indigenous and Arctic communities to eliminate the use of fossil fuels.”</seg>
<seg id="18">“According to an Environment and Climate Change Canada report released earlier this year, greenhouse gas emissions in Nunavut account for less than 1 per cent of this impact.”</seg>
<seg id="19">“In 2012, Nunavut produced 0.6 megatonnes of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide), equivalent to 18,000 cars per capita.”</seg>
<seg id="20">“In the same year, Alberta, which is considered Canada’s top greenhouse gas emitter, produced 84 million passenger vehicles.”</seg>
<seg id="21">“Despite this, Nunavut has seen greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles rise by more than 30 per cent since 2005, the biggest gain in Canada and Alberta by almost two-thirds, which is the second-highest increase over the same period.”</seg>
<seg id="22">“Even if energy changes were made by the three MLA candidates to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the impact on Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions would still be small.”</seg>
<seg id="23">The community seems to have something to gain from this.</seg>
<seg id="24">“Nunavut pays the largest amount of electricity than any other jurisdiction in the country, and funding for renewable energy will help reduce this.”</seg>
<seg id="25">“However, what to do with renewable energy projects is likely to be a disproportionate share of the current cost of generating electricity.”</seg>
<seg id="26">“Last month, the World Wildlife Management Board released a report outlining how renewable energy could provide electricity to each of the 25 communities in Nunavut.”</seg>
<seg id="27">“It found that by reducing costs by 8 per cent – primarily due to the risk of redundancy or other redundancies – Baker Lake, Coral Harbour, Iqaluit and Rankin Inlet would save money by switching to 20 per cent renewable energy, along with direct payments over the next 15 years.”</seg>
<seg id="28">The survey also showed that 16 other communities receive a 4 per cent subsidy – roughly what the Qulliq Energy Corp. can afford to borrow – as well as an average of $2 million in subsidies and a 20 per cent budget transfer.</seg>
<seg id="29">“But the report only talks about the viability of these projects, suggesting that shifting to renewable energy would be cheaper than current energy prices.”</seg>
<seg id="30">But moving communities to areas capable of using renewable energy would be a tremendous undertaking.</seg>
<seg id="31">“It’s going to take a lot of consultation, and it’s going to take at least a year to reach the energy goals of all the communities,” said Lien.”</seg>
<seg id="32">“They would have to go to the communities, work with them on what they want to do, and how the communities envision energy, to find out what their priorities are and what the communities consider to be the most important areas for transport and harvesting.”</seg>
<seg id="33">“This does not include the development of multiple assets for solar power or wind, which will take at least two years to fully integrate, or any work by the Qulliq Energy Corp. to ensure that renewable energy is reliable to its customers.”</seg>
<seg id="34">“To move all communities to 100 per cent renewable energy, in the spirit of the three MLA candidates, would not only prolong the process but also cost huge sums of money.”</seg>
<seg id="35">“The New Democratic Party (NDP) and the Liberal Democrats have not yet announced how much money they will contribute to the relocation, as the Green Party announced last week.”</seg>
<seg id="36">“As part of its campaign expenditure statement, the Green Party promised $150 million over five years for decentralization to all outpost camps and northern communities – not just in Nunavut – to reduce dependence on fossil fuels.”</seg>
<seg id="37">But it’s not good enough.</seg>
<seg id="38">“Lien explained that if a community like Arctic Bay were to relocate even 60 per cent of its electricity, it would require an operating expenditure of about $27.8 million.”</seg>
<seg id="39">“According to the same report, for other communities to achieve a 60 per cent reliance on renewable energy, they would have to use a higher proportion.”</seg>
<seg id="40">“In Iqaluit, it’s estimated to cost about $148 million.”</seg>
<seg id="41">“Although this is obviously smaller than the $250-500 million worth of energy considered by the city, this would only apply to one community that the Green Party is proposing to subsidize.”</seg>
<seg id="42">“Lien does not expect the federal government to pay for all of these projects, but he acknowledges that the scope and scope of the work will be complex and complex.”</seg>
<seg id="43">“Looking at the 2030 deadline, it’s not going to be a lot of time.”</seg>
<seg id="44">“In terms of solar energy, I think it’s going to take two to five years.”</seg>
<seg id="45">“In terms of wind energy, I would imagine it would take five to seven years,” said Lien when asked about the scope of the energy project.”</seg>
<seg id="46">“Looking at those deadlines and dividing them into 25 communities and working simultaneously in remote communities and where land isn’t always available, Lien wondered how it would be accomplished. Given the magnitude of the potential, he says it’s a real possibility.”</seg>
<seg id="47">“I think to reach those goals, that’s going to make a big difference.”</seg>
<seg id="48">“Even if we don’t reach 100 per cent, there is a lot of enthusiasm.”</seg>
<seg id="49">“Please note: this article discusses the federal election campaigns of the Green Party, Liberal Party and New Democratic Party (NDP).”</seg>
<seg id="50">“At the time this book was prepared, the Conservative Party had not yet announced its candidacy, so it is not included in this report.”</seg>

<seg id="1">Subject: Underlying systemic early childhood and daycare issues</seg>
<seg id="2">We must recognize the vital role that early childhood and daycare workers play in Nunavut’s vital workforce.</seg>
<seg id="3">“Lakuluk Williamson Patry, the chair of the Footprints Daycare Board, is seeking additional support from the Government of Nunavut for quality early childhood education and childcare based on Inuit language and culture.”</seg>
<seg id="4">By Nunatsiaq News</seg>
<seg id="5">Letters to Nunavut Premier Joe Savikataaq and Education Minister David Joanasie-Savikataaq and Minister Joanasie</seg>
<seg id="6">I am one of those people who feel very strongly about our language and culture.</seg>
<seg id="7">“I chair the board of directors of Footprints Daycare, the only Inuktitut-language school for early childhood education in Iqaluit and the only one in the Iqaluit headquarters in Nunavut that provides daycare to children who already speak Inuktitut.”</seg>
<seg id="8">“Footprints Daycare closed on Aug. 21-September 12, 2019 due to staff shortages that forced it to close and, in addition, has been operating with a staff shortage for nearly a year.”</seg>
<seg id="9">“Very few people apply for jobs at Footprints Daycare because they don’t get paid enough (Iqaluit has the highest daycare costs), the staff don’t get subsidized, they don’t get housing because they’re seen as a low-wage woman’s job in daycare.”</seg>
<seg id="10">“The centre is now open again, but its urgent operation is now under strain: we have lost an excellent employee who was tired of quitting.”</seg>
<seg id="11">“We now have a part-time administrative staff member, a full-time daycare manager, two daycare workers and each parent who works on a case-by-case basis at the daycare (all of whom have criminal records checks and security clearances), all working full-time, while we look for a full-time, qualified employee.”</seg>
<seg id="12">“This process is not uncommon, but for those of us who have children, we believe that our children are safe and that the Inuktitut-speaking questionnaire is open.”</seg>
<seg id="13">There is still a risk of it closing permanently.</seg>
<seg id="14">“Nunavut’s daycare operations are currently unprofitable. Daycare workers are often expected to provide one of the most important child-related services in order to provide quality early childhood education, based on Inuit culture and language, which is often undercut by low costs and inadequate support.”</seg>
<seg id="15">The non-profit organization relies on numerous sources of limited annual funding and parent volunteers to manage the daycare at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="16">“Primary care workers often suffer from low pay and no benefits, no adequate training for their jobs and no housing for staff.”</seg>
<seg id="17">Daycare workers are now being asked to work for less than what they need to sustain themselves or their families.</seg>
<seg id="18">The crisis facing our daycares is due to the unique need for staff with the necessary skills to promote and preserve the Inuit language and culture at an early age for our children; Tumulik hires only those who are fluent in Inuktitut.</seg>
<seg id="19">We are 100 per cent Inuit employed.</seg>
<seg id="20">But our high turnover has caused us to struggle with staff shortages due to a lack of competition and bonuses for staff who have quit.</seg>
<seg id="21">“That, in turn, affects early childhood and early childhood education.”</seg>
<seg id="22">Inuit need to be properly supported and valued so that our language and culture are taught to our children.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Government of Nunavut must consider how best to support quality early childhood education and ensure that daycare is based on Inuit language and culture.</seg>
<seg id="24">“Effective value-added early childhood education and child care workers are paid competitive rates and receive public subsidies, which include housing on the job, vacation time, training at work and in school.”</seg>
<seg id="25">Footprints’ vision is to expand the daycare’s reach to the general public and increase programs to accommodate more Inuit children.</seg>
<seg id="26">“We are now looking for a larger, daycare facility to fulfill our vision, which is why we have raised nearly $80,000 for the new space that has been collected.”</seg>
<seg id="27">It proposes the following reforms for the Government of Nunavut:</seg>
<seg id="28">“To integrate early childhood and daycare workers into the GN workforce to ensure that they receive the same rate of pay as GN employees, consistent with the GN’s pay structure in eight categories, as applied to employees in the Nunavut school system;”</seg>
<seg id="29">• Incorporate the operations and maintenance of daycares in Nunavut into the education system;</seg>
<seg id="30">“Provide subsidies to early childhood and daycare workers but do not apply to short-term expenses that include long-term sick leave, vacations, bilingual bonuses, maternity leave and housing”</seg>
<seg id="31">• Establish an organization to support all daycares in Nunavut;</seg>
<seg id="32">• Working with daycares to immediately address urgent challenges will allow us to jointly develop a long-term plan to transform the operation of daycares.</seg>

<seg id="8">“In the Montreal boardroom there was a lot of noise on Thursday, October 3, when Inuit attending the 21st Inuit Cultural Education Summit walked into the room to hear two Inuit leaders talk about why speaking Inuktitut in Nunavut is a basic human right and that right appears to have been denied.”</seg>
<seg id="9">“NTI President Aluki Kotierk and Louis Tapardjuk, a former GN minister and member of the Inuit Uqausinginnik Taiguusiliuqtiit, the Nunavut Language Authority, showed up on time and sat in the chairs in front of the Inuit people.”</seg>
<seg id="10">“Photographers organized a live broadcast on Nunavut Tunngavik Inc.’s Facebook page, featuring video from a variety of websites featuring English-speaking speakers, and attendees were almost entirely Inuk as they listened to the speech.”</seg>
<seg id="11">“Kotierk welcomed attendees and began speaking in Inuktitut, with those who spoke Inuktitut occasionally shaking their heads and clapping.”</seg>
<seg id="12">“Those who couldn’t speak Inuktitut, including this writer, just sat there with their eyes open.”</seg>
<seg id="13">Some people just walked out.</seg>
<seg id="14">Some are just trying to listen to their mobile phones while they wait for English translations.</seg>
<seg id="15">There was no English translation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Welcome to an amazing community for so many people in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="17">“It’s called the Inuit Cultural Education Program so it was like, especially when we talked about the Inuit language, we wanted to use the Inuit language,” Kotierk said at the launch.”</seg>
<seg id="18">“Louie and I talked about it and we knew there wouldn’t be an interpreter but we felt it was important to use our language when we talked about the need to support and sustain our language development.”</seg>
<seg id="19">“The International Conference, which brings together Arctic experts from the north and south, has, in recent years, begun to involve more Inuktitut speakers and activists, making the conference more focused on Inuit needs and increasing interaction between Inuit and non-Inuit educated people.”</seg>
<seg id="20">“This Inuktitut hearing, with its emphasis on language as a human right, appears to have been the turning point in that process.”</seg>
<seg id="21">Kotierk’s speech outlined the many pieces of legislation needed to promote and protect the Inuktitut language in a territory where there are more Inuit and more speakers of Inuktitut.</seg>
<seg id="22">“There are provisions in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (Ala.) that call for action and legislative action by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the National Inquiry into Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls, as well as Nunavut’s language legislation.”</seg>
<seg id="23">“Kotierk described many recent Inuit deaths, at least in part, related to language and cultural harbours, such as Annie Kotierk, who died of liver failure in 2017, and 15-year-old Eileen Kuniliusie, who died of tuberculosis that same year.”</seg>
<seg id="24">“Inuit want to live adequate lives and have basic human rights.</seg>
<seg id="25">“Canadian Inuit do not deserve to die in the absence of access and services on a par with other Canadians,” Kotierk wrote in her prepared remarks.”</seg>
<seg id="26">“In his prepared remarks, Tapardjuk referred to a recent incident in Iqaluit in which an RCMP officer approached an elder to report that his adopted son had been shot to death at a youth centre.”</seg>
<seg id="27">This woman is single and unilingual.</seg>
<seg id="28">Tapardjuk said the RCMP had to stop the vehicle to ask for help in relaying the bad news.</seg>
<seg id="29">“There are a number of things that could have been done through this story if this person had an assistant whose life was going to change, who didn’t even have an interpreter,” Kotierk told Nunatsiaq News.”</seg>
<seg id="30">“Many of us Inuit who speak English and Inuktitut are invited to work.</seg>
<seg id="31">“We are expected to be interpreters at all times, even if we don’t know the Inuit.”</seg>
<seg id="32">Sometimes for privacy reasons.</seg>
<seg id="33">“That, by the way, I would say is a violation of human rights.”</seg>
<seg id="34">“Kotierk said even those who speak Inuktitut in Nunavut should have access to professional services in their language in the areas of health, justice and education.”</seg>
<seg id="35">Even those aren’t available.</seg>
<seg id="36">She and other leaders continue to call on the federal government to protect their language and people’s homes.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ottawa passed a new Indigenous Language Act in June that has drawn criticism from NTI and Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami who say its decisions have been ignored.</seg>
<seg id="38">“Kotierk said he wants people to know, “We are the authorities.”</seg>
<seg id="39">Let’s speak in Inuktitut when we go to the store.</seg>
<seg id="40">Let’s speak in Inuktitut when we go to the bank.</seg>
<seg id="41">Let’s speak in Inuktitut when we go to school.</seg>
<seg id="42">“If we speak more Inuktitut and don’t think about those who can’t understand it, then they can get a bigger share of what they need.”</seg>

<seg id="1">Qikiqtani Inuit Association announces fee for tourism operators on Inuit owned lands</seg>
<seg id="2">Fees to be applied immediately</seg>
<seg id="3">“Tourism operators who visit the islands in Nunavut will now have to pay tourism bills if they want access to Inuit Nunangat, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association announced at its annual general meeting in Iqaluit from October 8 to 10.”</seg>
<seg id="4">“Commercial tourism operators must now pay for Inuit to travel to their own communities in the Qikiqtani region, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association announced at its annual general meeting in Iqaluit on Wednesday, October 9.”</seg>
<seg id="5">The islands attract the largest number of cruise ship passengers in the entire territory.</seg>
<seg id="6">“In Pond Inlet 17 passenger ships were visited this summer, while Iqaluit was visited by four.”</seg>
<seg id="7">“Inuit in Qikiqtani communities have been concerned about the increasing number of tourism activities in our region, especially by passenger cruise ships.”</seg>
<seg id="8">“The Qikiqtani Inuit Association has decided to set up a tourism operator compensation fund to help people in communities affected by cruise ships,” P. J. Akeeagok, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association president, said in a news release.”</seg>
<seg id="9">The news comes after the Qikiqtani Inuit Association’s Land and Recycling Division announced new spending.</seg>
<seg id="10">The new fees apply to:</seg>
<seg id="11">• Aircraft landing in Inuit Nunangat: $150</seg>
<seg id="12">• Helicopters landing on Inuit land: $100 per landing</seg>
<seg id="13">• Commercial camps in Inuit communities: $50 a day</seg>
<seg id="14">• Commercial access to visitors for less than six hours on Inuit lands: $25.00 a day</seg>
<seg id="15">“Half of the wedding expenses will go to the hunters and trappers organizations that are closest to the tourism industry’s resources, the release said.”</seg>
<seg id="16">Half of the other half would go to the Qikiqtani Inuit Association.</seg>
<seg id="17">“The number of ships carrying Inuit cargo to Nunavut ranges from 150 to 400 passengers, Roseanne Terry, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association’s director of land and recycling, said at the Qikiqtani Inuit Association board meeting.”</seg>
<seg id="18">The $25 per day fee would apply to all passengers flying Inuit cargo to Inuit Owned Lands – or IOL (Inuit Owned Lands).</seg>
<seg id="19">“No matter how many people are on the cruise ship to get to Inuit communities on their own, they will be charged according to the number of people on the cruise ship,” Terry told the board.”</seg>
<seg id="20">Terry said ships carrying Inuit passengers to the islands will have to submit to the Qikiqtani Inuit Association the number of Inuit passengers per month or before they start sailing.</seg>
<seg id="21">“If the ship carried 350 people, we would charge $25 per day per person.”</seg>
<seg id="22">“Any larger Inuit cargo ship would have to pay anywhere from $10,000 to $20,000 to land on Inuit owned land,” Terry said.”</seg>
<seg id="23">“In communities where many cruise ships carry Inuit passengers during the summer months, like Pond Inlet, the hunters and trappers organization would receive anywhere from $50,000 to $70,000 in compensation, he added.”</seg>
<seg id="24">The new fees will also support the Qikiqtani Inuit Association’s online land use registry.</seg>
<seg id="25">“Finally, tourism operators will be notified when they apply for new fees for access to Inuit owned land.”</seg>
<seg id="26">Terry said the Qikiqtani Inuit Association set the fee based on what other organizations spend on tourism.</seg>
<seg id="27">“For example, Parks Canada charges $25 per person to enter a national park.”</seg>
<seg id="28">“Municipalities also charge passengers and cruise ship operators to travel to their communities, Terry said.”</seg>
<seg id="29">“Cruise ships carrying Inuit passengers who are able to travel to their own communities are charged this fee unless Inuit directly enter our territory,” he said.”</seg>
<seg id="30">“Joe Ataguttaaluk, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association secretary/treasurer, asked if it was possible that these payments would increase in the future.”</seg>
<seg id="31">“Terry said there would be an opportunity for change, but it would require discussion and a decision by the Qikiqtani Inuit Association Board of Directors.”</seg>
<seg id="32">“This is an exciting strategy.</seg>
<seg id="33">“We are once again leading the way for Inuit to make a difference in their communities,” Akeeagok told the council.”</seg>
<seg id="34">“The payments will take effect immediately, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association said.”</seg>

<seg id="1">Baffinland’s huge rail cargo is causing concern in Pond Inlet</seg>
<seg id="2">“Is Baffinland thinking about it when we don’t know if the Nunavut Impact Review Board or the government will pre-approve the project?”</seg>
<seg id="3">“The cargo ship Biglift Barents anchored in Primeau Heaven, Germany during the summer of last year.”</seg>
<seg id="4">“In the quarry you can see two specially constructed units, 33 and 34 metres high, that Baffinland Iron Mines acquired from Thyssenkrupp and shipped to the Mary River mine this summer.”</seg>
<seg id="5">Two smaller units are also being transported in the front yard.</seg>
<seg id="6">“This will be used for the railway expansion, which has not yet been approved by the legislature.”</seg>
<seg id="7">(Photo by Thyssenkrupp)</seg>
<seg id="8">Community leaders in Pond Inlet are upset about a huge ship carrying railroad parts to Baffinland Iron Mines Corp.’s Mary River iron mine this summer.</seg>
<seg id="9">“Concerned about this, Baffinland’s proposed rail expansion in Phase II of the plan, which has not yet been approved by authorities, Baffinland brought two huge 10-floor structural engineering units to Premiershaven, Germany, from the company’s port on Mary River in north Baffin this summer.”</seg>
<seg id="10">“They also brought in two smaller houses that could be built and large pieces of rail that would be used in construction, such as railroad tracks and land turbines.”</seg>
<seg id="11">“In Baffinland, in November 2018 they contacted the rights group and its partners in the Qikiqtani Inuit Association about bringing it in, through their public registries with the Nunavut Impact Review Board and the Nunavut Water Board.”</seg>
<seg id="12">But the people of Pond Inlet are finally realizing that.</seg>
<seg id="13">When the ship Belvedere Brunts arrived at the Baffinland port of Mary River this past August, it was carrying structural materials that would be used for rail expansion.</seg>
<seg id="14">When people in Pond Inlet saw a ship passing near their community for the first time, two more ships carrying railway parts arrived shortly thereafter and more ships are expected to arrive in the summer of 2020.</seg>
<seg id="15">“We only found out about three or four weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="16">“We see cargo coming through the Pond Inlet area,” Joshua Arreak, executive director of the Pond Inlet Hunters and Trappers Organization told Nunatsiaq News.”</seg>
<seg id="17">“We wondered why and who they were and how they were doing it.</seg>
<seg id="18">“We have not received any information from the Nunavut Impact Review Board, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association or anyone else.”</seg>
<seg id="19">“This is not something we were expecting at all,” Arreak said.”</seg>
<seg id="20">“We haven’t been informed by the Qikiqtani Inuit Association or the Nunavut Impact Review Board.</seg>
<seg id="21">I don’t know.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have an Inuit organization problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">“They don’t communicate with us,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Nunavut Impact Review Board knew about the sealift this winter</seg>
<seg id="25">“Neither Nunavut authorities nor any federal minister have approved Baffinland’s expansion plans, which would create a 110-kilometre railway from Mary River to Mary River, produce an additional 12 million tonnes a year, and transport up to 200 times a year’s worth of iron ore.”</seg>
<seg id="26">This project cannot be formally approved by the federal government until a final public hearing that the NIRB has scheduled for Nov. 2 in Iqaluit and concludes on Nov. 8 and 9 in Pond Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="27">“The NIRB, in a statement that did not seek comment from stakeholders, announced the resupply of the railway equipment in a letter sent to Baffinland this past July 25.”</seg>
<seg id="28">“The NIRB advised the company that if Phase 2 is not approved, Baffinland would be responsible for shipping the materials, likely worth many millions of dollars, out of the mine.”</seg>
<seg id="29">It also said its shipping would not affect the NIRB’s decision on the project.</seg>
<seg id="30">“In an email dated October 17, the NIRB’s executive director, Ryan Barry, outlined the legal basis under which the NIRB can approve or disapprove shipping activities.”</seg>
<seg id="31">“The NIRB was prepared to say that these activities would be included in the evaluation process and that all materials for construction would have to be transferred if the proposal was rejected after the board’s review,” Barry wrote.</seg>
<seg id="32">This aerial photo of Belvedere Point. This summer the ship was carrying structural materials for the Mary River mosque that will be used for Baffinland’s rail expansion.</seg>
<seg id="33">“One of the units, referred to as “the demolition unit,” is 33-metres high, 23.5 metres wide and weighs 1,470 tonnes.”</seg>
<seg id="34">“Another area, referred to as “the Soyuz Centre,” is 34 metres high.”</seg>
<seg id="35">“Each of these units, which are part of a prefabricated demolition and decontamination facility, are equivalent to a 10-floor building – perhaps even higher than those built in the eastern Arctic.”</seg>
<seg id="36">But Baffinland has not been granted permission to use them.</seg>
<seg id="37">“Quebecland will identify these assets only for Phase 2 – not use them” until Phase 2 proposal consideration is complete,” the company wrote in its July 19 report to the NIRB.”</seg>
<seg id="38">Materials housed on Inuit own land</seg>
<seg id="39">“In their joint submission to the authority, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association and Baffinland wrote that the assets will be housed on Inuit owned land, in accordance with the Qikiqtani Inuit Association’s commercial lease agreement with the company.”</seg>
<seg id="40">“In the case of Arreak and others, an action like this makes it more likely that Baffinland has already been approved for the project.”</seg>
<seg id="41">“The people of Pond Inlet are not happy.</seg>
<seg id="42">Baffinland “is probably Baffinland’s idea when we don’t know whether the Nunavut Impact Review Board or the government will pre-approve the project?</seg>
<seg id="43">“I don’t know,” she said.”</seg>
<seg id="44">“Dr. Frank Dexter, a technical advisor with the Municipality of Pond Inlet, was given permission by Pond Inlet’s mayor, Joshua Schak, to speak to Nunatsiaq News on behalf of the hamlet.”</seg>
<seg id="45">“Quebecland has been working with a view to approving Phase 2,” Tester said in an email.”</seg>
<seg id="46">“If the NIRB even had the authority to do that, the final implication would be to put pressure on the NIRB to step in as a supervisor and approve the proposal.”</seg>
<seg id="47">“This is an issue,” Tester said on behalf of the hamlet.”</seg>
<seg id="48">“Besides the circumstances, the hamlet feels that this should not have happened.”</seg>
<seg id="49">“This has been done financially and on the assumption that Baffinland will be approved for Phase 2,” he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="50">“Our primary concern is the wildlife, the marine mammals and their habitat.”</seg>
<seg id="51">We would be the most affected community.</seg>
<seg id="52">That’s our concern.</seg>
<seg id="53">“The money is not going to bring the animals back,” Joshua Arreak said on behalf of the hunters and trappers organization, citing an issue that has been raised in Pond Inlet over the years regarding marine transportation in Baffinland’s plans.”</seg>
<seg id="54">“And for non-governmental organizations like Oceans North, who have expressed interest in holding hearings on Baffinland’s expansion plans, they say they support “responsible development” at the Mary River mine.”</seg>
<seg id="55">“But they also say Baffinland shipped too much by fax without considering the environmental impacts, and they object to Baffinland’s decision to ship large quantities of mercury from the Mary River mine south of Arctic Bay, which was allowed to happen in 2012.”</seg>
<seg id="56">“It’s no coincidence that residents are not satisfied with the large volume of imported rail parts coming into the Mary River mine prior to legislative approval of this expansion,” said Chris Debicki, vice president of policy and regulatory affairs for Oceans North.</seg>
<seg id="57">Pre-built equipment acquired from Thyssenkrupp</seg>
<seg id="58">These materials shipped to the Mary River mine are part of an existing fleet of rail cars that Baffinland acquired from Thyssenkrupp Multinational Corp. in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="59">“The two massive buildings, the first of which arrived, were designed in Primohaven, while the third structure, a railway loading dock, was designed in Stadien, Berlin, Thyssenkrupp said in a news release.”</seg>
<seg id="60">“ Baffinland also brought in a shipping container, a crane for transport and multiple pieces of equipment to use for rail transportation.”</seg>
<seg id="61">“Property details Baffinland submitted to the Nunavut Impact Review Board and the Nunavut Water Board included a railway dump and access road, as well as plastic bags and garbage cans.”</seg>
<seg id="62">“Thyssenkrupp’s first shipment to Baffinland, a vessel called the BigLift Barentsz, weighed 5,500 tonnes of goods, and departed from Primohaven in early August.”</seg>
<seg id="63">“Another two cargo ships delivered additional supplies this summer, and more are scheduled to arrive in the summer of 2020, Discovery said.”</seg>
<seg id="64">“In a joint venture agreement with the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, Baffinland agreed to put an additional 18 million dollars into a compensation fund for the cleanup of the Mary River mine if the project stalled, the Water Board document said.”</seg>

<seg id="2">Inuit women make up 15 per cent of attendees at the Women’s Centre</seg>
<seg id="3">“Marina Pooler-Winton, the executive director of the Chez Doris, a women’s shelter, and Cathy Wong, a city councillor representing the Peter-Maggie community and a spokesperson for the Montreal city council, discussed plans for a 22-bed homeless shelter for homeless women in Montreal’s downtown on October 16 at a press conference on the women’s shelter.”</seg>
<seg id="4">(Photo courtesy of the city of Montreal)</seg>
<seg id="5">“Montreal’s downtown area allows Bill-Murray to begin an expansion project that began with the Women’s Centre, a day centre for homeless women, which was transformed into a landmark building that was acquired last year.”</seg>
<seg id="6">“The landowner’s decision, announced on Wednesday, October 16, will allow the creation of a new facility not far from the centre, which will serve as an emergency night centre for women.”</seg>
<seg id="7">“The Women’s Centre, a women’s day centre at 1430 Samiti Road in Montreal, is open every day of the week to women with special needs.”</seg>
<seg id="8">Many of them are Inuit.</seg>
<seg id="9">“The women’s centre is currently located on Samiti Road, not far from the intersection of Antwerp Road and Kapu Iceway, a gathering place for Inuit in Downtown.”</seg>
<seg id="10">“The women’s centre is well known to many Inuit women, who make up 15 per cent of the centre’s population.”</seg>
<seg id="11">“Scheduled to open in the winter of 2021, this facility’s emergency night centre was purchased with a donation of $1 million from Montreal businessman Andrew Harper through the Jewish Community Foundation of Montreal.”</seg>
<seg id="12">“Thanks to our new facility, we will now be able to house 22 beds for homeless women,” Marina Pooler-Winton, the executive director of Siege Creek, said in a news release after the event at the women’s shelter.”</seg>
<seg id="13">“Currently, women make up 25 per cent of the homeless population in Montreal, but the resources available to women are often inadequate.”</seg>
<seg id="14">This project is a positive step.”</seg>
<seg id="15">“This good news about the centre’s expansion came to light less than a week after the person staying at the centre, Clara Ukatuatsiak, originally from Nunatsiavut, died on October 11 at the hospital.”</seg>
<seg id="16">Bowler-Winton told Nunatsiaq News that the shutdown after her daughter committed suicide while in prison caused her to suffer from chronic pain.</seg>
<seg id="17">“The majority of drop-in clients are people who end up in cities because of housing shortages and legal problems, Bowler-Winton said.”</seg>
<seg id="18">“Many of those who come to the women’s centre occasionally go to sleep during the day because there are six beds available, where they get a few hours of sleep and then spend the night outside.”</seg>
<seg id="19">That will now change with the introduction of a new night sleep facility.</seg>
<seg id="20">“Right now, the Women’s Centre, which serves approximately 100 women every day, provides services and programs to women whose needs include homelessness, food insecurity, mental illness and substance abuse.”</seg>
<seg id="21">Bowler-Winton said the number of Inuit women entering the program has remained relatively unchanged since 2018.</seg>
<seg id="22">“Nevertheless, we hear from women who need more help with their basic needs such as clothing and bathtubs,” she said.”</seg>
<seg id="23">“As the only women’s day centre in Montreal, the St. Doris Women’s Centre is now open seven days a week from 8:30 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. during the day.”</seg>
<seg id="24">“Because they were able to run their programs, the women’s centre stopped providing weekend services for six months in 2014 due to a lack of funding.”</seg>
<seg id="25">“We’re hoping to get some financial support from Makivik, but we don’t know if we’re going to get it this time around,” said Bowler-Winton.</seg>
<seg id="26">“The Women’s Centre also administers the Inuit Support Program – but the Women’s Centre raises funds to carry out this work, which accounts for about 70 per cent of its operating budget of $1.7 million a year.”</seg>
<seg id="27">“Cathy Wong, a city councillor representing Peter-McGill’s community and a spokesperson for the Montreal City Council, said the announcement will create a new nightclub and provide more women with “the services offered by people who want them to feel safe and secure.”</seg>

<seg id="2">“In terms of serious questions, the Liberals offered very little”</seg>
<seg id="3">Mamulaq Qaqqaq’s victory on October 21 demonstrates the unwillingness to accept Liberal Party policy for Nunavut and the North.</seg>
<seg id="4">Do you remember the Liberal newspaper?</seg>
<seg id="5">They put out press releases on a regular basis.</seg>
<seg id="6">More than we can remember.</seg>
<seg id="7">“That doesn’t matter, because the majority of Nunavut voters delivered something on October 21, they didn’t deliver anything.”</seg>
<seg id="8">“Since 2012, Justin Trudeau and other Liberal governments in Nunavut have issued numerous press releases.”</seg>
<seg id="9">At least some of that information prompted new discussions.</seg>
<seg id="10">“But in the end, the people of Nunavut just said “I’m here.”</seg>
<seg id="11">“In the end, it was the thinner side of politics that, since 1961, Canadians have turned to for change: the New Democracy Party.”</seg>
<seg id="12">“The victory of the notorious Mamilak Mountain is a sign of dissatisfaction with Trudeau’s approach in the north and north of Canada, which includes disapproval of repeated references to Inuit-Crown relations.”</seg>
<seg id="13">“Since 2015, Trudeau has worked with leading organizations like Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, Nunavut Tunngavik Inc., the Qikiqtani Inuit Association and others.”</seg>
<seg id="14">But this week’s election reveals to Nunavummiut that the Inuit-Crown partnership is not worth it.</seg>
<seg id="15">“That’s hardly surprising, because in the end the people of Nunavut couldn’t really answer the basic questions the Liberals asked.”</seg>
<seg id="16">“It’s no secret to most people in Nunavut that the biggest concerns are economic and social issues: chronic housing shortages, food insecurity, the high cost of store-bought food and transportation, the prevalence of tuberculosis and suicide that occurs almost daily.”</seg>
<seg id="17">“But during his last visit to Nunavut on October 8, Trudeau did not have much good news to share on these issues.”</seg>
<seg id="18">He spoke in South Baffin about climate change and conservation.</seg>
<seg id="19">“This is a national issue, but if I have an election this year, Nunavummiut want to hear their concerns about housing and the high cost of living.”</seg>
<seg id="20">“What happened instead was that the Sylvia Grinnell River was the site of a photo op, not for Nunavut voters, but for southern Canadians.”</seg>
<seg id="21">“In doing so, he failed to respond to the needs of Nunavummiut and the Nunavut Liberals’ candidate Megan Pizzo-Lyall, without even offering her the support she should have received from the president of the Liberals.”</seg>
<seg id="22">“In terms of food prices and poor nutrition, the Liberals did something, setting higher subsidies for the Nutrition North Canada Program, and giving more money, $12.5 million a year to Indigenous hunters in Nunavut and other parts of the Northwest Territories.”</seg>
<seg id="23">But hunting subsidies have to come in and nobody can tell you why that’s the case.</seg>
<seg id="24">“Last August 1, Trudeau played a key role in Iqaluit and Arctic Bay, signing an agreement to create the Tallurutiup Imanga Marine Protected Area and promising to create a new protected area called Tuvaijuittuq.”</seg>
<seg id="25">“That’s why he’s putting hundreds of thousands of dollars into communities in North Baffin, for small craft harbours and conservation jobs.”</seg>
<seg id="26">He also spoke strongly about conservation issues such as reconnecting with Indigenous peoples.</seg>
<seg id="27">“The inappropriate way to deal with this is this: by repeatedly coughing up tuberculosis in an overcrowded facility, this “connection” makes no sense.”</seg>
<seg id="28">“With that in mind again, do you remember the Liberal government’s big announcement on tuberculosis?”</seg>
<seg id="29">“This happened in early 2018, when Jane Philpott, then Canada’s health minister, announced that tuberculosis would be eliminated in Inuit Nunangat by 2030.”</seg>
<seg id="30">But Mr. Philpott, the federal minister who promised to address this issue, no longer exists.</seg>
<seg id="31">“Due to Trudeau’s conduct towards Judy Wilson Rebaud and his controversial handling of the SNC-Lavalin deal, Philpott resigned from the House.”</seg>
<seg id="32">“Since then, the Liberals have not heard a word about eliminating tuberculosis.”</seg>
<seg id="33">“Like the original Hunters and Trappers Assistance Program, it appears to be stuck in an Inuit-Crown relationship. It now appears that the much talked about ban on tuberculosis is in jeopardy.”</seg>
<seg id="34">“And the public knows that tuberculosis is caused by poverty, malnutrition and inadequate housing.”</seg>
<seg id="35">“But when it comes to housing, Trudeau delivered an already warm and repeated message this summer.”</seg>
<seg id="36">“As well as the Government of Canada’s social housing program, “co-developed” by ITK, there have been no predictable results.”</seg>
<seg id="37">We would also like to congratulate Mamilak Qaqqaq on his victory.</seg>
<seg id="38">“To become one of the fourth-largest body of MLAs in Parliament, she will need all the support she can get to hear it.”</seg>
<seg id="39">Let Nunavummiut just give it a chance and support it.</seg>
<seg id="40">“Qaqqaq has won two prestigious awards, for Leona Aglukkaq and Megan Pizzo-Lyall.”</seg>
<seg id="41">I hope that both of them can reflect on their defeats and continue to serve Nunavummiut and the North.</seg>

<seg id="1">MLAs asked ministers about the $80 million expansion of the Weber Arctic road project</seg>
<seg id="2">“Looking at my colleagues, we’re more than willing to consider an $80 million investment”</seg>
<seg id="3">“Joelie Qauniq, the MLA for Amittuq, was one of a number of MLAs in the Nunavut legislature who questioned the government on the $80 million expansion of the Iqaluit-Nuuk corridor for the Weber Arctic project.”</seg>
<seg id="4">Some Nunavut lawmakers are now asking for unspecified funding for the expansion of the Nuuk-Iqaluit Weber Arctic project.</seg>
<seg id="5">“Last August, the federal government committed $151 million to the project, which will stretch 1,700 kilometres from Weber Arctic to Nuuk, Greenland, via Baffin Bay to Iqaluit.”</seg>
<seg id="6">From there, it will be shipped to Kimmirut.</seg>
<seg id="7">“The GN will develop the framework and start the project, which should be completed by 2023.”</seg>
<seg id="8">“Last year, MLAs approved this project, which cost $126 million.”</seg>
<seg id="9">“This year, we were informed that the project’s cost had risen in line with inflation and was now estimated at $209 million,” John Main, MLA for Arviat North – Whale Cove, said in a member’s statement on Wednesday, October 23.”</seg>
<seg id="10">“There’s an $80 million difference, Main said.”</seg>
<seg id="11">“Looking at my colleagues, we can definitely make a decision on spending $80 million,” Main said.”</seg>
<seg id="12">Federal funding goes to the Rural and Northern Community Investment Canada Plan (Canada Funding Plan).</seg>
<seg id="13">The project is now before the legislative assembly for its review of the budget for 2020/21.</seg>
<seg id="14">“Later in the day during question period, Joelie Qauniq, the MLA for Amittuq asked Quassa Kusugak, the Minister of Community and Government Services, whether the $80 million increase in the government’s pre-planning budget was a business case.”</seg>
<seg id="15">“This process, as defined in the GN’s capital planning contribution, “is aimed at ensuring that the project has a clear definition, and access to relevant information about its development, appropriate cost details and timeline, prior to commencing the capital planning process.”</seg>
<seg id="16">“Is it a preplanning project, yes or no?”</seg>
<seg id="17">Qauniq asked Kusugak.</seg>
<seg id="18">“The planning process has been completed and cost estimates are still being assessed.</seg>
<seg id="19">“When we were informed, we realized it was going to cost a lot more,” Kusugak said.”</seg>
<seg id="20">“Maine, who sits beside Qauniq in the House of Commons, stands up to ask another question of Kusugak.”</seg>
<seg id="21">“Can the minister indicate how this huge project has seen its cost increase over the course of the year?”</seg>
<seg id="22">“Kusugak reiterates that after the budget request was approved last year, the department revisited the project and the cost increased as a result of that review.”</seg>
<seg id="23">“Kusugak reiterated that, in May 2019, his department felt its funding request should increase to $201.6 million to “maximize federal funding available for the project if needed.”</seg>
<seg id="24">“The next day, on October 24, Main rose again for question period to testify against Finance Minister George Hickes on the same issue.”</seg>
<seg id="25">“Through the Financial Management Board, what steps were taken and what steps were taken to notify the department of the $80 million cost increase in this expenditure process?”</seg>
<seg id="26">Main asked.</seg>
<seg id="27">“Hickes said that due to increased federal funding for the project, and the addition of a highly beneficial marine research facility, the GN has also increased its contribution.”</seg>
<seg id="28">“The Department of Community and Government Services referred it back to the Financial Management Board for this purpose when it became aware of the payment shortfall.”</seg>
<seg id="29">“Hickes also said that about a quarter of the GN (25 per cent) contributes to the program, while the federal government contributes 75 per cent.”</seg>
<seg id="30">“As a territorial government, we don’t have to pay the full $80 million, and we would have to pay 25 per cent of that.”</seg>
<seg id="31">“What we’re going to try to do is find... in the next few years ... additional resources to complete this project,” he added.</seg>

<seg id="1">“Nunavut needs its own federal regulator, says Makivik president”</seg>
<seg id="2">Charlie Watt on the election of a federal government calling for change</seg>
<seg id="3">“Charlie Watt, president of the Makivik Corp., issued a news release following the October 22 federal election, saying Nunavik needs its own federal regulator.”</seg>
<seg id="4">By Elaine Ancer</seg>
<seg id="5">“Makivik President Charlie Watt did not mince his words about Nunavik’s legal status in his congratulatory message to the new MLA, Shevi Parubimi.”</seg>
<seg id="6">“We will look to the Electoral Boundaries Commission to clarify that, in other words, Nunavik should have its own bureaucracy that applies to our territory, which is preferable now given our self-determination program,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="7">“We need this at the provincial level.”</seg>
<seg id="8">“Appleby-James Bay-Nunavik-Eyo is the largest federal political precinct in Quebec, stretching from southern Nunavik to La Valley-De-Wa in the far north of the country, where four of the six 2019 federal candidates are residents, including Poppy for Black Quebecois.”</seg>
<seg id="9">Nunavik leaders have sought self-government for their territory since 1972.</seg>
<seg id="10">“In 2002, Kativik’s entire municipal government including Makivik went to the federal Electoral Boundaries Commission on this issue and appeared again in 2011.”</seg>
<seg id="11">“Since then the split was expanded in 2013, adding two more locations in the south.”</seg>
<seg id="12">“The districts were redrawn, at least by the commission, in an effort to balance the population.”</seg>
<seg id="13">“Across Quebec, there are about 100,000 Inuit in the region, while Appleby-James-Nunavik-Eyo has less than 85,000 people.”</seg>
<seg id="14">“Nunavut’s population is about 13,000, far below Nunavik’s, but its leaders respond to this by emphasizing Nunavik’s individuality.”</seg>
<seg id="15">“The smallest federal jurisdiction is Labrador, with a population of about 26,000, while Newfoundland has a population of about 80,000.”</seg>
<seg id="16">“Rubio won northern Quebec, picking up more than 11,000 votes, or 40 per cent, behind the Liberal and Conservative candidates.”</seg>
<seg id="17">“Ford congratulated Green Party candidate Kara Capana-Whiteley, an Inuk from Kuujjjuaq, who came in fifth with more than 1,000 votes.”</seg>
<seg id="18">“At the urging of Watt, he invited Ruby to visit Nunavik as soon as possible.”</seg>
<seg id="19">“I look forward to coming together, and I appreciate his support for self-determination, as well as for issues such as the implementation of the United Nations Act on the rights of Indigenous peoples,” Watt said.</seg>
<seg id="20">“It was a message to Black Quebecois President Eve-Francois Blanchard, whose divisive Party won 32 seats for Quebec.”</seg>
<seg id="21">“We look forward to supporting us in the development of our business in Nunavik – through the regulatory and economic sectors – and through the legislative process in order to establish an appropriate partnership,” said Ford.</seg>
<seg id="22">“However, in the spirit of Quebec independence, Inuit have long contributed to the unification of Canada.”</seg>
<seg id="23">“Mr. Watt organized the election, which left the Liberals without a seat in the new government, as an opportunity for the different parties to come together and bring the country together.”</seg>
<seg id="24">“Justin Trudeau has a strong government in which he does not hold a seat, and he can work with other parties (parliamentarians) – NTP, Black Caucus, Greens, Conservatives and independent candidates – to pass legislation and bring it to parliament, and in the process to hold it together,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="25">“As for Nunavut’s elected NTP MLA, Mamilak Qaqqaq of Baker Lake, he offered some hopeful words.”</seg>
<seg id="26">“I remember the NTI meeting in Baker Lake in 1871 with Tagak Curley,” Watt said.”</seg>
<seg id="27">“Back then we were young people.</seg>
<seg id="28">“They will do a great job, Mamulak, and I look forward to seeing you and working with you on issues like Inuit self-determination at the same time, for generations to come.”</seg>

<seg id="1">“To reinforce the prevention of RSV in Nunavut, thousands say”</seg>
<seg id="2">“In general, you save money by reducing the number of people with lung cancer”</seg>
<seg id="3">This aircraft from Emergency Services Nunavut Lifeline stands at the Iqaluit airport this summer during an air show for passengers.</seg>
<seg id="4">“In some years, when children suffer from chronic lung disease (RSV, respiratory syndrome virus), they have to be evacuated and this can cost airlines and hospitals huge sums of money.”</seg>
<seg id="5">“Dr. Anna Banerjee and her fellow teachers at Toronto’s Université de Health Studies in 1989 first raised the issue through Change.org at the end of September, and attracted more than 1,000 signatures.”</seg>
<seg id="6">“By the time this article was finally published, it had gathered 23,322 names – and now hopes to reach 25,000 signatures.”</seg>
<seg id="7">The campaign says the GN will prevent many premature deaths and reduce the need for hospitalization for infants by implementing a preventative program called Palivizumab for all infants under 6 months of age.</seg>
<seg id="8">“Palivizumab is an anti-vaccine, though not a vaccine, and is marketed under the brand name Synagis.”</seg>
<seg id="9">“It has been proven that infants have a higher risk of lung disease starting with RSV, short for “respiratory syncytial virus,” which enters the lungs, and causes them to develop a devastating disease called bronchitis.”</seg>
<seg id="10">“Nonetheless, Dr. Michael Patterson, the chief medical officer for Nunavut, told Nunatsiaq News in an interview that the GN provides Palivizumab to 11 percent to 12 percent of babies under the age of 2.”</seg>
<seg id="11">“We use it more often for babies who are at high risk of developing RSV, and for those who support international donations of Palivizumab,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="12">“Those include infants born alive, under 35 weeks of age of pregnancy, or babies with chronic lung disease or heart disease.”</seg>
<seg id="13">“Banerjee, an associate professor of pediatrics at the Toronto Université of Medicine, has been writing scholarly articles for 15 years on the prevalence and cost of RSV in the Arctic.”</seg>
<seg id="14">“According to the survey, she strongly criticizes the current Nunavut policy and says all Nunavut infants deserve this preventative measure.”</seg>
<seg id="15">“Dr. Anna Banerjee, an associate professor of pediatrics at the Toronto Université of Medicine, said in a recent study that immunizing Inuit infants with a preventative vaccine called Palivizumab would benefit both socially and financially.”</seg>
<seg id="16">Nunavut pricing system is worthwhile</seg>
<seg id="17">He said in his analysis that the RSV disease is prevalent and widespread and has resulted in multiple airline schedules and hospital visits for the territory’s health care providers.</seg>
<seg id="18">“Cancer prevention is very expensive: about $5,600 per treatment.”</seg>
<seg id="19">“Although it costs that much, Bannerjee and many others believe it’s a drop in the bucket.”</seg>
<seg id="20">“The reality in Nunavut is that the disease spreads quickly and medevacs are the most efficient, efficient way to respond.”</seg>
<seg id="21">“We’ve done a lot of feasibility studies that have shown that if we give the North more of the Palivizumab, it’s going to save money,” he said in an interview.”</seg>
<seg id="22">“A cost analysis, published in 2013, found a high rate of lung cancer in Kitikmeot infants: a rate of 389 out of every 1,000.”</seg>
<seg id="23">“Our analysis, which was conducted from January 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010, found that the average cost of a hospital stay for this disease rose to $57,535.”</seg>
<seg id="24">“In the Qikiqtani region, the incidence of lung cancer in infants was 2002 per 1,000 newborns and in the Kivalliq region, 230 per 1,000 newborns.”</seg>
<seg id="25">That means the GN spent $5.9 million on critical care in the Qikiqtani region for infants and roughly $5.7 million in the Kivalliq region for pediatric patients that was the case during the study.</seg>
<seg id="26">“However, the Kivalliq region had the highest number of lung cancer patients admitted to the hospital: $63,686.”</seg>
<seg id="27">“To me, it saves a lot of money, because the incidence of lung cancer is high,” she said.”</seg>
<seg id="28">Parent of Ontario nurse supports petition</seg>
<seg id="29">“Inuit infants are ten times more likely to require hospital treatment for lung disease than “high-risk” infants and the disease is even more devastating.</seg>
<seg id="30">“Despite the severity of this problem, Inuit infants in Nunavut do not receive any preventative care,” Gandhi wrote in the submission.”</seg>
<seg id="31">“The same situation for professionals has been identified at the Northwestern School of Medicine, the Canadian Medical Association and the Canadian Medical Research Institute for Indigenous Peoples.”</seg>
<seg id="32">But healthy infants in Nunavut at the end of childbirth do not receive this preventative care – even if they come from high-risk communities other than Iqaluit and often suffer from chronic lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="33">Bannerjee says that’s what they’re doing wrong.</seg>
<seg id="34">“I have worked very hard.</seg>
<seg id="35">And I have shown my details to the public.</seg>
<seg id="36">“Carolyn Bennett, Jane Webb, they have seen my article and they say it’s credible,” she said.”</seg>
<seg id="37">Nunavik vaccinates all infants</seg>
<seg id="38">“It also revealed that, unlike in Nunavut, health officials in Nunavik have prescribed Palivizumab to all infants over the last three years.”</seg>
<seg id="39">“In the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut on October 18, Health Minister George Hickes said in response to questions from Iqaluit-Niaqunnguu MLA Pat Angnakak, that the Government of Nunavut should take a close look at Nunavik’s practices.”</seg>
<seg id="40">“We’re monitoring that program,” said Hickes.”</seg>
<seg id="41">Angnakak said the RSV epidemic has a devastating impact on families.</seg>
<seg id="42">“Quite recently, I know her baby had to be sent to an RSV clinic and it has a devastating effect on the family, especially when the child is so young.”</seg>
<seg id="43">But Hickes defended the GN’s current system and said it’s not because the government saves Inuit money but because it provides it.</seg>
<seg id="44">“This is not a legal or policy decision on cost.</seg>
<seg id="45">“It’s consistent with the best practices in health care,” Hickes said.”</seg>
<seg id="46">Patterson reiterates Nunavik’s success three years earlier in allowing abortions to begin in infants under 6 months of age.</seg>
<seg id="47">“We’re still waiting for those numbers, and if we can find out the cost savings of using Palivizumab, then we’ll implement it as quickly as possible,” Patterson said.”</seg>
<seg id="48">“But, in his view, there is still not enough evidence to justify enforcement in Nunavut.”</seg>
<seg id="49">“There are two things that I don’t agree with in the plebiscite and the other thing is to show that it’s done, or that there’s a scientific basis for it.”</seg>
<seg id="50">“A lot of people still have questions,” she said.”</seg>
<seg id="51">The widespread use of palivizumab in Nunavut goes back centuries.</seg>
<seg id="52">“In 2008, the Government of Nunavut refused to even participate in Bannerjee’s study of the RSV, even if officials from Greenland, Nunavik and the Northwest Territories wanted to participate.”</seg>

<seg id="5">The first batch of small houses built in Nunavik arrived by ship in Kuujjuaq this summer.</seg>
<seg id="6">“I wanted to show how good we were building in the north,” said Willie Godfrey, co-founder of Nunavik Construction, a residential design and construction firm with offices in Kuujjjuaq and Norfolk, Quebec.”</seg>
<seg id="7">“Ten years before that, Godfrey, a Kuujjuaq plumber, stove repairman and construction worker was locked in a battle with housing expert Claude Yaniel.”</seg>
<seg id="8">“That’s when we started talking about affordable housing in the North,” Godfrey said.”</seg>
<seg id="9">“Housing in the North is too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="10">That’s where it started.”</seg>
<seg id="11">From this they have developed the design of a small building that takes into account Arctic weather patterns.</seg>
<seg id="12">The houses have steel siding and roofs that can withstand strong winds and reduce length of use.</seg>
<seg id="13">“There are built-in insulation for floors, ceilings and ceilings and three-way windows to keep the heat outside.”</seg>
<seg id="14">“There are floor heaters, not wall-to-wall heating systems, to keep the temperature in line with the rest of the house.”</seg>
<seg id="15">“I think that’s the only way to do it in the Arctic,” Godfrey said.”</seg>
<seg id="16">“There are a lot of problems with boilers and the heating goes out of proportion.</seg>
<seg id="17">People say their feet are freezing.</seg>
<seg id="18">Their houses are well insulated but they walk in.”</seg>
<seg id="19">A design by Nunavik Construction for a one-bedroom cabin.</seg>

<seg id="21">“Because he has built boilers and pipes throughout Nunavik, Godfrey is responsible for ensuring that houses are built in a structured way, that everything is properly designed and maintained.”</seg>
<seg id="22">“Nunavut Construction has a variety of conditions with very small units, up to four bedrooms, and separate units that are easily connected to each other.”</seg>
<seg id="23">“They can add an extra bedroom and expand it, for example, when their children are older.”</seg>
<seg id="24">“The house on display in Kuujjuaq is a one-bedroom unit, ranging in size from five metres to one metre and 10 metres to one metre in diameter.”</seg>
<seg id="25">There is an entrance at the end of the house to the kitchen and living area.</seg>
<seg id="26">Just beyond the bedroom and beyond is the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="27">The plant is located in another building just over a mile away.</seg>
<seg id="28">It took about two hours for the building to be finished and put in place and the electrical and plumbing fixed.</seg>
<seg id="29">“This house can be bought for $228,000, for the garbage and everything inside, says Godfrey.”</seg>
<seg id="30">“Nunavut’s average house costs between $500,000 and $600,000, he said.”</seg>
<seg id="31">“We’re trying to build houses that are affordable to live in and have problems with water access,” said Godfrey.</seg>
<seg id="32">“I’ve been a plumber, dentist for many years and a lot of the things that have been built have been fixed properly, there’s not enough plumbing, there’s not enough heating.”</seg>
<seg id="33">I’ve been building these things for many years and now we have something that’s more suitable for the Arctic.”</seg>
<seg id="34">“The houses are built in Superbrook, Quebec, and they’re built in a month, Godfrey said, and they’re delivered by truck and then they go by ship.”</seg>
<seg id="35">“Once we receive the order and the booking is on schedule for sealift, the facility could be on site later in the summer.”</seg>
<seg id="36">“In the future, if this goes well, we hope to build facilities in the North,” he said.”</seg>
<seg id="37">“But that requires a lot of money.”</seg>
<seg id="38">He added that the facilities across the Arctic would be suitable and they would be more than happy to receive orders from Nunavut or from Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="39">“We’re open and waiting for payment requests and plans to build houses,” said Godfrey.</seg>
<seg id="40">“We’re ready to help people who need housing.”</seg>

<seg id="1">“In the Canadian Arctic, sea ice levels are at their lowest right now”</seg>

<seg id="9">“When he tried to do the same thing a year later, he had to go by boat.”</seg>

<seg id="11">“This freeze is the first time I’ve seen it in my entire life,” said Willie Aglukkaq, a resident of Gjoa Haven for nearly 40 years.”</seg>
<seg id="12">That’s correct.</seg>
<seg id="13">“As of October 15 the sea ice thickness stood at 5.118 million square kilometres, the lowest since record-keeping began in 1968.”</seg>
<seg id="14">“Depending on where we are, we may be a month behind where we were a year ago,” said Josh Laggie, a broker with Geological Services Canada.”</seg>

<seg id="16">April also had the lowest sea ice on record.</seg>
<seg id="17">That followed July’s record-breaking high.</seg>
<seg id="18">“In August, the rate of ice loss slowed down.”</seg>

<seg id="24">“If there’s ice-free water and the temperature is colder than the ocean, then even when the temperature is outside it will get colder and the water will get colder or freeze up,” said Langie.”</seg>
<seg id="25">“Nevertheless Arctic temperatures in October have been unusually cold, with above average temperatures over the past six months.”</seg>
<seg id="26">“It was a hot summer,” said Mayer.”</seg>
<seg id="27">“As of April, the monthly average was the third warmest in the Arctic – on record, while May and August were the highest.”</seg>

<seg id="29">This year’s event will feature a bigger theme.</seg>
<seg id="30">“Through global warming from the increasing use of human-powered vehicles, we have seen a decrease in sea ice thickness since 1979,” said Pascal Patojie, director of GRID-Geneva, in a release issued by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP).”</seg>
<seg id="31">“Due to what is happening now this year in the Arctic, declining sea ice has contributed to Arctic warming over the last several decades.”</seg>
<seg id="32">“According to this news release, “Temperatures rose by an average of 0.5 degrees Fahrenheit per decade between 1982 and 2017, largely due to the effects of the solar eclipse that began to break out in 1979.”</seg>
<seg id="33">This is twice as fast as global consumption.”</seg>
<seg id="34">This summer has been no exception.</seg>
<seg id="35">“Although the year-to-year trend continues, sea ice is now receding.”</seg>
<seg id="36">“The ice is just starting to freeze,” she said.</seg>
<seg id="37">“Over the past 10 days, since October 20, sea ice has grown by an average of 1.5 million square kilometres, including the waters near Gjoa Haven.”</seg>
<seg id="38">“If current freezing trends continue, 2019 is likely to be higher than 2012.”</seg>

<seg id="1">Iqaluit welcomes new fire chief</seg>
<seg id="2">“For me this is a joyous occasion”</seg>
<seg id="3">Gord Howard took over as Iqaluit’s fire chief two weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">“She has been reading and doing a lot of research, but she says her new job is something she can do more of.”</seg>
<seg id="5">(Photo courtesy of Dustin Patta)</seg>
<seg id="6">“When Gordon Howard appeared before the city council on October 22 as the new chief fire officer, he did not expect to be questioned.”</seg>
<seg id="7">“Do you support the Montreal Canadiens?”</seg>
<seg id="8">Asked by Councillor Joanasie Akumalik.</seg>
<seg id="9">“After a long silence, Howard replied, “No.”</seg>
<seg id="10">They are here laughing hysterically.</seg>
<seg id="11">“A week later, in an interview with Nunatsiaq News, Howard said, “That’s when I decided to make sure my supporters weren’t heard.”</seg>
<seg id="12">“Harvard, who grew up in Hamilton, came to Iqaluit via Meyford, Ont., a community near Collingwood in Georgian Bay.”</seg>
<seg id="13">“Although he lived here for the first time, he also lived in the Arctic.”</seg>
<seg id="14">“In 10 years as an emergency medical technician with the Canadian Forces, the village of Arviat has been camped out in the dead of winter.”</seg>
<seg id="15">“That’s my understanding of the snow, I understand the cold, but there are also things that have to be done.”</seg>
<seg id="16">Here you feel like you’re in a different world and that’s why I came here.</seg>
<seg id="17">“And the facility is very dynamic,” said Howard, referring to the Iqaluit fire department’s collection of firefighters – some of whom are professional firefighters and some of whom are volunteers.”</seg>
<seg id="18">That’s the only reason Howard didn’t make it to Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition to their experience as firefighters and emergency responders – a rare occurrence in other jurisdictions – this was also due to the frequency of fires in Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="20">“The history of this department is horrendous,” said Howard.”</seg>
<seg id="21">“That’s where it takes a lot of work, and the resources are always in place.”</seg>
<seg id="22">“Changes in the department’s performance on these issues, and now Howard’s, the new one here, range from water problems and a lack of support, to fires and the fire hall being too small.”</seg>
<seg id="23">“We can’t change this overnight and there doesn’t seem to be much that we want to change overnight.</seg>
<seg id="24">“If we keep moving forward and don’t look back, I’ll be happy,” said Howard.</seg>
<seg id="25">“For me, it’s an exciting project.”</seg>
<seg id="26">“It’s exciting, what we’re trying to do and what we know we can do better.”</seg>
<seg id="27">“One of the first questions asked of the city’s newly appointed director of emergency management, “I’m a Toronto assistant,” said Howard with a smile.</seg>
<seg id="28">“It’s good to see some people supporting the fire hall in Toronto.</seg>
<seg id="29">“I brought a flag, so I hope we can show it in our vehicle if they win the Stanley Cup in the next 20-30 years.”</seg>

<seg id="1">Bedbug sightings have become a concern for Nunavik patients travelling to Montreal</seg>
<seg id="2">The hotel manager says they do inspections but never find anything.</seg>
<seg id="3">This one just wants to eat something you wouldn’t want to see in your living room: a bedbug.</seg>
<seg id="4">“In recent days, bedbugs have been seen at the Quavalliq Boarding Home where patients from Nunavik stay when they travel to the city.”</seg>
<seg id="5">Sightings of bedbugs in Nunavik’s boarding homes during medical trips to Montreal are of particular concern to patients and their families.</seg>
<seg id="6">This photo shows the bedbug that Cecilia Dutschka saw last month on the bed in her mother’s room at the Quilty Hotel in Kirt D. Lees Dorval.</seg>
<seg id="7">(Photo courtesy of Cecilia Dutska)</seg>
<seg id="8">“In mid-October, when Cecilia Koutska was visiting her mother at the Quilty Lodge in Cape Dorval, she was extremely nervous: she looked under a blanket and saw a bedbug, which she took a photo of.”</seg>
<seg id="9">“Kazuka reported seeing the bedbug to a patient on Nunavik’s watch list at the Ulivik Boarding Home, where there are multiple rooms, 39 in total, on the first floor when it’s overflowing.”</seg>
<seg id="10">Kudzaka called his mother and told her he would never be there again.</seg>
<seg id="11">“The hotel’s president, Seth Abdel Nir, told Nunatsiaq News last week that he’s dealing with bedbug sightings.”</seg>
<seg id="12">“In this case recently, when it was inspected, and it had an autopsy report, they couldn’t find anything.”</seg>
<seg id="13">“One room inspection found there was bedbugs in there, but they’re not there anymore.”</seg>
<seg id="14">Abdul Nunn also shared emails from survivors who witnessed bedbugs in their homes.</seg>
<seg id="15">“Due to the seriousness of the Uluvik Boarding Home operation, Abdul Nung said all rooms were inspected this year and continued to be inspected and maintained as required.”</seg>
<seg id="16">Nunatsiaq News has not been able to contact the Nunavik Community Health Board or the Module du Nord-québécois that deals with Nunavik health centres in Montreal about bedbugs and what they are doing about it.</seg>
<seg id="17">The MNQ has sent its concerns in an email to Abdel Nuuk.</seg>
<seg id="18">“This appears to be due to passengers seeing bedbugs and deciding not to stay at the hotel,” wrote George Delattula, president of Ublivik on October 16.”</seg>
<seg id="19">“Please let me know what it is and how and when it will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="20">We need to keep patients informed about the treatment of bedbugs.”</seg>
<seg id="21">Ublivik always takes care of patients’ dressing rooms/bags before they go in.</seg>
<seg id="22">There are bedbugs in Montreal: a bedbug infestation forced the closure of government offices in Complexe Guy-Favreau last month.</seg>
<seg id="23">“If there was an outbreak of bedbugs among patients in the Arctic, this would not be the first, as happened in 2010 in Winnipeg.”</seg>
<seg id="24">“Igloolik bedbugs are extremely unpleasant: they are relatively small, but can cause severe diarrhea, vomiting and skin irritation after licking the skin.”</seg>
<seg id="25">These bedbugs are injected with umbilical cord fluid into the bloodstream to reduce blood thickness and separation sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="26">“In another utilidor, the bedbug pumps blood, sometimes for as long as five minutes, then melts, explodes and appears to have burst into flames.”</seg>
<seg id="27">“Bedbugs eat bedbugs every five to 10 days and can survive for up to a year, staying at the bottom of pots, pans and other surfaces that are hot, dark and show up when they want to eat.”</seg>
<seg id="28">“The good news is that bedbugs do not live in cold climates, resulting in sleep deprivation and premature death.”</seg>
<seg id="29">So you can kill your bags when they’re outside for more than two days if it’s not warm enough.</seg>
<seg id="30">“To avoid bedbugs while out on the land, check the head of the house, look at the bottom and keep your bags out of the bed.”</seg>
<seg id="31">“And when you get home, wash your clothes before entering your room and check your bags for bedbugs.”</seg>
<seg id="32">“If you see a bedbug in a Montreal hotel, you can call 311 to tell the city about your problem.”</seg>

<seg id="2">“Inuit have to be involved in the process.</seg>
<seg id="3">“It has an impact on all aspects of Inuit life,” said NTI president”</seg>
<seg id="4">“Representatives from Igloolik and Pond Inlet are hearing from Aluki Kotierk, the president of Nunavut Tunngavik Inc., on a motion to cancel the Nunavut Impact Review Board’s final hearing on Baffinland’s proposed Phase 2 expansion on Wednesday, Nov. 6 in Iqaluit.”</seg>

<seg id="7">“The NIRB meeting on Baffinland Iron Mines’ proposal to expand the Mary River mine has suddenly stopped, forcing a two-day meeting in Pond Inlet to be cancelled.”</seg>
<seg id="8">“On Wednesday, Nov. 6, NTI President Aluki Kotierk passed a motion calling for the immediate cancellation of this latest public meeting and for the meeting to continue for eight months to a year.”</seg>
<seg id="9">Loud voices echoed across the room as witnesses looked on, with members screaming for Baffinland to react to the situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">“Brownland officials covered their faces, sometimes stroking their arms and staring straight into the desk when Kotierk made his motion.”</seg>
<seg id="11">“We are concerned that this public hearing could be completed without the strategy being finalized.</seg>
<seg id="12">People need to be heard and have a meaningful discussion.</seg>
<seg id="13">“Anybody in this room wants to understand everything that’s being raised and how it affects NTI and the organization,” Kotierk said, adding that the room is full of people who want to talk about issues and people.”</seg>
<seg id="14">“It has an impact on every aspect of Inuit life,” she said.”</seg>
<seg id="15">“The motion was tabled on the fifth day of the public hearing in Iqaluit, approximately an hour after its conclusion.”</seg>
<seg id="16">The Nunavut Impact Review Board’s first agenda was scheduled to continue hearings in Pond Inlet for community participation on Nov. 8 and 9.</seg>
<seg id="17">“The NIRB accepted NTI’s resolution, cancelled the meeting and the Pond Inlet gathering has also been cancelled.”</seg>
<seg id="18">“Throughout the week, Baffinland representatives repeatedly asked for input on plans to build a railway running north from Mary River to the Mary River port.”</seg>
<seg id="19">“This railway and other parts of the port, should make it easier for the company to produce more than its current 6 million tonnes of iron ore a year production of up to 12 million tonnes.”</seg>
<seg id="20">“Another highlight of the week is Baffinland’s proposal to amend its performance permit by removing its production cap and instead imposing a limited export ban, 20 times rail traffic and 176 shipments a year.”</seg>
<seg id="21">“The motion to adjourn the meeting was supported by all those who wished to have their say, many of whom expressed concerns about the uncertainty surrounding the project.”</seg>
<seg id="22">“P. J. Akeeagok, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association president, told Nunatsiaq News that he believes the NIRB process provides “an opportunity for Inuit to ask questions on these issues” and “an opportunity for residents to voice their concerns on an ongoing basis.”</seg>
<seg id="23">“Akeagok also said the resolution was not expected, but it was in good shape on the last day of the session.”</seg>
<seg id="24">Baffinland officials watch as Kotierk makes a motion to lift the ban.</seg>
<seg id="25">“I think it’s because there are too many questions that haven’t been resolved yet.</seg>
<seg id="26">“In my view, if you’re going to make a decision about your future, then you have to make an informed decision.”</seg>
<seg id="27">There wasn’t enough here.”</seg>
<seg id="28">Representatives from the North Baffin communities also unanimously approved the motion.</seg>
<seg id="29">“There needs to be more information and research,” said Amanda Hanson Main, a researcher with the Pond Inlet Hunters and Trappers Organization.”</seg>
<seg id="30">He said the project “has potentially serious implications for our values and our humanity and our place in the world.”</seg>
<seg id="31">“Some participants at the table said they were not satisfied with the Mary River project, and would like Baffinland to continue its work in Nunavut, but they had many questions and concerns about the proposed expansion.”</seg>
<seg id="32">“We hear it’s too personal and inappropriate,” said Peter Ivalu, who represents the hamlet of Igloolik.”</seg>
<seg id="33">“Every piece of information has to be translated.</seg>
<seg id="34">Everything has to be transparent.”</seg>
<seg id="35">“The Government of Nunavut also agreed with the resolution, stressing that there is a fundamental disagreement between those who wish to have their say and those who wish to have their say.”</seg>
<seg id="36">“The federal government also supported the motion, but said it was up to the Nunavut Impact Review Board to decide how long the moratorium would last.”</seg>
<seg id="37">“Through its legal team, Baffinland has expressed its dissatisfaction with the motion to suspend the ban for eight months and is disappointed that the motion has not been heard.”</seg>
<seg id="38">“Those present at the briefing could have been held as early as November 2,” said Brad Armstrong, a lawyer for Baffinland.”</seg>
<seg id="39">“Neither party has indicated any plans to start on that date.</seg>
<seg id="40">There was no way that any of those comments would have deterred them from coming out.”</seg>
<seg id="41">“Megan Lord-Howell, vice president of recycling for Baffinland, said the delay would have an impact on the “immediate problems” with the project.”</seg>
<seg id="42">“But we will do whatever it takes to maintain and protect 3,000 Canadian jobs, 476 of which are Inuit.”</seg>
<seg id="43">We have to know that Inuit will work with us.</seg>
<seg id="44">“We need time to work out how much of a problem the project would be,” Lord-Howe said.”</seg>
<seg id="45">“Although the Qikiqtani Inuit Association has said it is unable to support Phase 2, Akeeagok said it will continue to work on the Inuit communications project and the project’s economic potential will remain limited.”</seg>
<seg id="46">“We’re not opposed to Mary River.</seg>
<seg id="47">We are working with them.</seg>
<seg id="48">We own the Inuit land where they work.</seg>
<seg id="49">“We support Inuit employment,” she said.”</seg>
<seg id="50">“We have spent a lot of money and effort to make this project commercially viable over a long period of time.</seg>
<seg id="51">“With that in mind, there is a balance to be found.”</seg>
<seg id="52">But there are none at this time.”</seg>
<seg id="53">Akeeagok also said the community’s uncertainty about the railway’s impact on our caribou herd is important.</seg>
<seg id="54">“As an Inuk, these issues have a profound impact on our cultural rights.”</seg>
<seg id="55">“This was a clear signal to the elders here that they are not only thinking about themselves, this is also about the future.”</seg>
<seg id="56">And that’s what I’m focused on.</seg>
<seg id="57">“The decisions I make now are not just for the present, but for the next.”</seg>
<seg id="58">Do I leave them with a better foundation than I did before?</seg>
<seg id="59">“That’s really the basis of decision-making, no matter what your culture is,” she said.”</seg>
<seg id="60">“By request, the Nunavut Impact Review Board has given all interested parties an opportunity to submit their comments in writing by Nov. 15.”</seg>
<seg id="61">“From there, the Nunavut Impact Review Board will provide a written submission to the motion and a timeline.”</seg>

<seg id="1">Nunavut MLAs approve amendments to income tax legislation</seg>
<seg id="2">“Our government is making a concerted effort to recoup carbon expenditures and turn a profit”</seg>
<seg id="3">“MLA Adam Maitstone questioned Finance Minister George Hickes on Bill 26, an Act to Amend the Income Tax Act, during a legislative session on Wednesday, Nov. 6.”</seg>
<seg id="4">Nunavut MLAs have updated the Nunavut Income Tax Act to amend the Carbon Tax Rate Act.</seg>
<seg id="5">“The changes, which received third reading on Wednesday, Nov. 6, included an increase in the mortgage interest rate from $13,325 to $16,000.”</seg>
<seg id="6">“This means taxpayers will make nearly $3,000 a year before they have to pay Nunavut income tax.”</seg>
<seg id="7">“The other change is to increase the cost of living tax credit from $1,200 to $1,500.”</seg>
<seg id="8">“That means taxpayers who make more than $60,000 a year in their jobs will get an additional $300 in income tax.”</seg>
<seg id="9">And the territorial corporate tax rate for small businesses is down from 4 per cent to 3 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="10">“This government is working hard to make carbon reimbursement a profitable business”, said Finance Minister George Hickes.”</seg>
<seg id="11">“The federal government’s fixed carbon tax came into effect in Nunavut on July 1, to make fuel prices more reasonable – it would have increased by 5 cents per litre – the GN introduced a carbon rebate program, which reduced the cost of fuel by half.”</seg>
<seg id="12">“During discussions on income tax reform, Nunavut MLAs agreed that carbon tax revenues should be returned to Nunavummiut.”</seg>
<seg id="13">But they couldn’t agree on the best way to do that.</seg>
<seg id="14">“Adam Lightstone, the MLA for Iqaluit-Manirajak, expressed concern that, by reducing income tax payments, the government would have to rely on carbon tax revenues to fund government operations.”</seg>
<seg id="15">“It is my understanding that we require significant federal investment and that our own revenues make up only 10 per cent to 15 per cent of our gross domestic product.</seg>
<seg id="16">“We really have to use our own revenues to operate,” said Lightstone.</seg>
<seg id="17">“Why is the government trying to use carbon tax revenues to subsidize government operations?”</seg>
<seg id="18">“The carbon tax revenue that we’re generating is going to be a small portion of the GN’s revenue and Caribbean is trying to make it suitable for our own coffers,” replied Hickes, adding, “I don’t think we’re going to be satisfied if we just put the carbon revenue into other revenue streams and don’t give that money back to the payer.”</seg>
<seg id="19">Lightstone also said that reforming the Income Tax Act would be the most efficient way to reimburse Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="20">“They also stressed that the carbon tax subsidy going to the Government of Nunavut is being used to its intended effect, reducing Nunavut’s carbon footprint.”</seg>
<seg id="21">“Climate change is a big concern to me and it requires a lot of work now and into the future.</seg>
<seg id="22">“Having said that, I have put forward some ideas to our government on how we can develop or do something to make Nunavut more energy efficient,” said Lightstone.</seg>
<seg id="23">“Why haven’t these ideas been considered and proposed for the use of carbon tax revenues?”</seg>
<seg id="24">Hickes responded by saying each department – responsible for specific projects – is listening.</seg>
<seg id="25">“Some departments have been working with departments, including the Qulliq Energy Corp., which has the mandate to produce energy-efficient LED lights for all street lights in Nunavut and that was approved at the meeting shortly thereafter.”</seg>
<seg id="26">“In 2019/20, the Government of Nunavut is projected to generate $12 million in carbon tax revenue.”</seg>
<seg id="27">It would be broken down as follows:</seg>
<seg id="28">• Two million dollars to the government for higher heating costs for public housing and government buildings such as schools and health centres.</seg>
<seg id="29">• $3.6 million for the new Nunavut Carbon Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="30">• 6.2 million dollars returned to Nunavummiut and Nunavut jobs this year through the creation of an amendment to the Income Tax Act.</seg>
<seg id="31">But for Lightstone this is not a good mathematical mix.</seg>
<seg id="32">“Based on a 50 per cent rebate from the gas station and another 50 per cent rebate from the carbon tax, why is there so little room for energy efficiency measures?”</seg>
<seg id="33">“Hickes replied that the federal government’s standard carbon tax will increase every year for the next five years, and even if the 50 per cent deduction for fuel storage continues, a year of increased tax revenue would generate additional revenue for other projects.”</seg>
<seg id="34">The bill passed its second reading on Nov. 6 and had its third reading the night before.</seg>
<seg id="35">“Even now, Lightstone, yesterday’s newborn son told the legislature that he only slept for three hours and walked out.”</seg>
<seg id="36">“In a recent email to Nunatsiaq News, Lightstone said he was not satisfied that he would have voted for the legislation.”</seg>
<seg id="37">“I do not agree with the outcome of Bill 26, which I feel is a flawed fiscal policy,” wrote Lightstone, who was scheduled to make a statement to the legislature.”</seg>
<seg id="38">“The purpose of the carbon tax is to reduce emissions of fossil fuels and carbon dioxide from industries and address climate change.</seg>
<seg id="39">“If this legislation includes an energy-related tax credit for individuals and businesses who want to reduce their consumption, or if the Government of Nunavut had created a program to help people purchase and install energy-efficient appliances, I would have been more than happy to vote in favour of the legislation.”</seg>
<seg id="40">Despite Mr. Lightstone’s objections, the bill was passed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Hickes said he’s open to hearing ideas on how to use carbon tax revenues to reduce Nunavut’s carbon footprint.</seg>
<seg id="42">“I strongly encourage anyone to write to their MLAs or government with ideas for action in this area.”</seg>

<seg id="4">(Photo by Emma Toronto)</seg>
<seg id="5">“From April to September, 2018, more than 51,000 people visited Nunavut from outside the territory.”</seg>
<seg id="6">“This is stated in the Nunavut Annual Tourism Report for 2018-19 by the Department of Economic Development and Transportation, which was tabled in Parliament earlier this month.”</seg>
<seg id="7">“The same people who came here spent a total of $271,383,000 on participation and travel expenses.”</seg>
<seg id="8">The report does not give an exact figure for expenditures other than travel.</seg>
<seg id="9">“On a balanced basis, there were an average of 16,750 visitors from non-residents of Nunavut from May to October 2015, based on that year’s Nunavut Visitors Exit Survey.”</seg>
<seg id="10">“The Baffin and the Kivalliq regions are the most visited regions from July to September, 2018.”</seg>
<seg id="11">“Qikiqtaaluk was visited by 95,600, of which just over half (53.2 per cent) came to Iqaluit at a cost of $75.1 million.”</seg>
<seg id="12">Pond Inlet and Pangnirtung are the second and third most visited communities in the Baffin region.</seg>
<seg id="13">“In the Kivalliq region, Rankin Inlet received 33,600 visits and spent $68 million, followed by Baker Lake and Arviat.”</seg>
<seg id="14">Cambridge Bay was the most visited region in the Kitikmeot.</seg>
<seg id="15">Passengers on the Wan Ocean Expedition voyage from Judeak to Kimmirut in August 2019.</seg>
<seg id="16">“And in 2018, 3,404 cruise ship passengers travelled to Nunavut over the course of two and a half months.”</seg>
<seg id="17">“Cruise ship operators spent $388,351 on community service requests, the report also states.”</seg>
<seg id="18">But weather and ice affected more than half of the ships that wanted to visit Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="19">“The agency received results from eight passenger coaches on 23 round-trip Nunavut stops from July to September, 2018.”</seg>
<seg id="20">“This ship carried 3,404 passengers in total.”</seg>
<seg id="21">“Less than half, or 59 per cent, of all cargo carried by Inuit to Pond Inlet landed in Nunavut.”</seg>
<seg id="22">“Iqaluit was the second most visited cruise ship at 8.3 per cent, followed by Qikiqtarjuaq, which received 6.1 per cent of visits and Grise Fiord at 5.9 per cent.”</seg>
<seg id="23">“Cruise ship visitors to Pond Inlet not only spent a total of $245,565, but these visitors spent the most per 100 hours of the 189.5 hours of cruise ship visits in Nunavut, according to the report.”</seg>
<seg id="24">“Cambridge Bay, Gjoa Haven, Kimmirut and Kugluktuk did not receive any cruise ship visits in 2018.”</seg>
<seg id="25">“According to reports, both Cambridge Bay and Gjoa Haven were expecting up to seven visits, but all were cancelled due to weather.”</seg>
<seg id="26">“The report listed Cambridge Bay and Gjoa Haven as impacted by cancelled cruise ship visits with a combined loss of approximately $25,000.</seg>
<seg id="27">“The feedback from the report comes from the Visitor Exit Survey 2018, which surveyed cruise ship operators and other visitors to Nunavut over the last year.”</seg>
<seg id="28">“In 2018, the Government of Nunavut had to respond to community concerns from Pond Inlet and Clyde River about vessels passing through hunting areas.”</seg>
<seg id="29">“In the report, the Government of Nunavut consulted with the Association of Arctic Research Vessel Operators and all passenger ship operators avoided the area.”</seg>
<seg id="30">“He also said that while tourism is an independent industry, it requires government support for its development.”</seg>
<seg id="31">“In Nunavut, that means training and employment for Nunavummiut in the tourism sector.”</seg>
<seg id="32">“There is always a lack of committed and trained people in various sectors of the tourism industry.</seg>
<seg id="33">“In the absence of trained professionals, tourism has not fully realized its potential.”</seg>
<seg id="34">“Skills training has been known to play a key role in tourism in Nunavut,” the report said.”</seg>
<seg id="35">“The firm, the Nunavut government’s Inuit Sealift Training Program, trains 12 people a year to work on Inuit cargo ships as part of its research program, the report said.”</seg>
<seg id="36">“According to the report, all GN tourism inspectors are Inuit.”</seg>
<seg id="37">“Historically, tourism data is rare, which creates uncertainty about the size of the economy and its ability to contribute to Nunavut’s economy,” the report said.”</seg>
<seg id="38">“The department has contributed to 115 projects related to tourism in 2018, at a total cost of $1,272,822.”</seg>

<seg id="1">“Mary River: If it’s a matter of economic viability, let it be a reality”</seg>
<seg id="2">MLAs should demand Baffinland release its earnings</seg>
<seg id="3">Participants sit in Iqaluit’s Cadet Hall on the fourth day of the NIRB’s public hearing on Baffinland’s iron ore mine railway expansion proposal in Mary River.</seg>
<seg id="4">“Nunavut’s system for enforcing regulations on industrial development, stemming from the 1993 Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, has not worked except for a series of high-profile, contradictory environmental and socio-economic assessments of the Mary River iron mine over the past decade.”</seg>
<seg id="5">“This was demonstrated in Iqaluit earlier this month, when the Nunavut Impact Review Board held its final public hearing on the $900 million railway expansion proposal from Baffinland Iron Mines Corp. in a sudden outburst of confusion and misunderstanding.”</seg>
<seg id="6">The final two days of the seven-day meeting scheduled for Pond Inlet have been cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="7">“At the same time, Baffinland’s multi-billion dollar, multinational iron ore mine is in a state of uncertainty.”</seg>
<seg id="8">“At the time of writing, the NIRB had yet to make a decision on a resolution from NTI that would, if approved, delay the review by eight to 12 months.”</seg>
<seg id="9">“And Baffinland’s landlord, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, said in the near future that it could not support or approve a railway expansion.”</seg>
<seg id="10">“But the Qikiqtani Inuit Association’s business department, the Qikiqtaaluk Corporation, says it fully supports it.”</seg>
<seg id="11">They are also Arctic Co-operatives.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is a very complex process.</seg>
<seg id="13">“In the case of Baffinland, the vice-president of recycling, Megan Lord-Howell, stressed that the company remains concerned about the viability of the project, saying, “We will do whatever it takes to sustain and protect Canada’s 3,000 jobs, 476 of which are Inuit.”</seg>
<seg id="14">“Last week, Baffinland told Nunatsiaq News that it has laid off 490 southern contractors and 96 contract Inuit workers.”</seg>
<seg id="15">That brings us to one of the biggest unanswered questions about the project: Mary River’s financing.</seg>
<seg id="16">“ Baffinland says the mine’s economic viability is uncertain unless regulators allow it to build a 110-kilometre railway to Mary River and boost its production to 12 million tonnes a year, which would allow it to travel 176 times through the sensitive Elipse Sound.”</seg>
<seg id="17">“The problem is, they haven’t produced a public report to support that.”</seg>
<seg id="18">“And at some point, most professionals stopped asking about it.”</seg>
<seg id="19">“Last year, despite the lack of evidence, that did not stop stakeholders from believing what they were saying.”</seg>
<seg id="20">“For example, in the summer and fall of 2018, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association sided with Baffinland, protecting them from the Nunavut Impact Review Board.”</seg>
<seg id="21">“On August 31 of that year, the Nunavut Impact Review Board recommended that the federal government not approve an earlier and smaller yearly production target – from 4.2 million tonnes of iron ore to 6 million tonnes.”</seg>
<seg id="22">“That’s when Baffinland and its partner, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, started working hard.”</seg>
<seg id="23">“Over the past few weeks, correspondence has been sent to the chief decision maker on this issue, Dominic LeBlanc, the former federal northern affairs minister, asking for the council’s decision to be reversed..”</seg>
<seg id="24">Why?</seg>
<seg id="25">To the dollar.</seg>
<seg id="26">“Inuit organizations expressed alarm about the viability of the Mary River mine, which will require substantial donations and contributions, worth more than $20 million under the new Inuit Impact and Benefit Agreement.”</seg>
<seg id="27">Ottawa agreed.</seg>
<seg id="28">“In light of QIA’s concerns about the financing viability of the mine, the federal government approved Baffinland’s proposal last year.”</seg>
<seg id="29">“We are also concerned about the long-term viability of the Mary River mine and are aware of the Qikiqtani Inuit Association’s concerns that investment in the project would be subject to adverse proposals,” LeBlanc wrote in a September 30, 2018 letter signed by federal-Indigenous affairs minister Carolyn Bennett.</seg>
<seg id="30">“Perhaps, the most important member of the public – the federal government – accepts that prosperity is a fundamental and fundamental right.”</seg>
<seg id="31">And they did it even though there was no financial evidence to back it up.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="33">“Perhaps if it’s true that the project is unprofitable, the legislator should be willing to look at what the owner says to be true.”</seg>
<seg id="34">“In all aspects of the Mary River project, Baffinland’s staff – as required – must produce multiple contributions to address these environmental impact statements.”</seg>
<seg id="35">“Regardless of the project’s financial achievements, the Nunavut Impact Review Board is unlikely to release any public certificates.”</seg>
<seg id="36">“For example, the Nunavut Impact Review Board has recommended that a lengthy set of financial documents obtained by Oceans North is “not valid” and should not be published in the board’s public register.”</seg>
<seg id="37">(The document is still on our website).</seg>
<seg id="38">The Nunavut Impact Review Board recommended this option after releasing the document – and then withdrew it at Baffinland’s request.</seg>
<seg id="39">“In this way, Baffinland was willing to submit, privately, shorter financial statements explaining why Mary River could generate more revenue through higher production.”</seg>
<seg id="40">This desire to be independent may be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="41">Even Baffinland has made amends for that.</seg>
<seg id="42">“In response to this, the NIRB reached a different conclusion, which makes no sense.”</seg>
<seg id="43">“If the federal government is going to invest in our economy, then the Formula Financing Board has to do the same.”</seg>
<seg id="44">“Fortunately, the Nunavut Impact Review Board and other regulators should make another effort to obtain such evidence.”</seg>
<seg id="45">They have to be ambitious.</seg>
<seg id="46">“And also Baffinland’s landlord, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association.”</seg>
<seg id="47">“As well as preventing such issues from happening again, the federal government should amend the federal legislation governing the Nunavut Impact Review Board’s business practices, the Nunavut Planning Commission and the Project Assessment Act, to clarify how financial information should be handled in the future.”</seg>
<seg id="48">“Although I wish I had the opportunity to speak, there are still many questions that remain unanswered about Baffinland’s latest expansion proposal, relating to the railway’s impact on caribou, the impact of ships on whales, the project’s lack of Inuit employment, and much more.”</seg>
<seg id="49">“Many questions hang over the Arctic Bay-South rail port proposal, which Baffinland approved in 2013 for production capacity, and 18 million tonnes a year. It remains unclear why Baffinland was asked to build it in 2013 when it was allowed to produce 18 million tonnes a year.”</seg>
<seg id="50">It remains unclear why Baffinland has not proceeded with that plan.</seg>
<seg id="51">But the biggest question is how to make that program sustainable.</seg>

<seg id="5">“On Nov. 7, 2019 those subsidies were eliminated, with the childcare fee set at $8.25 a day.”</seg>
<seg id="6">(Photo courtesy of nunavikchildcare.ca)</seg>
<seg id="7">By Elaine Ancer</seg>
<seg id="8">“The rebalancing of the economy in Quebec has led to more funding for family and child care services in Quebec, including Nunavik.”</seg>
<seg id="9">“Quebec’s economy grew by an estimated 2.4 per cent in 2018-19, which is 0.6 per cent more than previously thought.”</seg>
<seg id="10">“Subsequently, Quebec’s finance minister, Eric Jarrett, announced on Nov. 7 that the $857 million figure would be consistent with previous years’ projections.”</seg>
<seg id="11">There are two major outcomes that have already been envisaged for the Child Care Benefit and the Child Benefit.</seg>
<seg id="12">“The renewal of Quebec’s economy and economy has demonstrated Quebec’s success in this area,” Gerrard said in the release.”</seg>
<seg id="13">“Economic growth in Quebec gives us the opportunity to reduce the deficit and meet government commitments.”</seg>
<seg id="14">“With this subsidy, Quebec is eliminating the additional support for family childcare that was implemented by Philippe Couillard’s Liberal government in 2016.”</seg>
<seg id="15">“Through this program, an additional allowance for childcare is added to a day’s income.”</seg>
<seg id="16">That subsidy was increased to $15 a day for higher income earners.</seg>
<seg id="17">“Families making less than $50,000 did not receive an increase in the subsidy.”</seg>
<seg id="18">“The November 7 announcement will reinstate Quebec’s daycare fee of $8.25, eliminating the surcharge for all income earners.”</seg>
<seg id="19">This new fee in Nunavik will be used through the Kativik All Communities Government Program in Nunavik for child welfare.</seg>
<seg id="20">“According to a Quebec news release, the new fee will be for this fiscal year, and this newspaper’s Montreal Gazette reported that it will be effective Jan. 1, 2019.”</seg>
<seg id="21">“As of last week, the head of childcare services at the Kativik Regional Government, Julie-Anne Peaty, has not been informed of how or when these payments will start in Nunavik.”</seg>
<seg id="22">Premier Francois Legault’s government first pledged to slowly phase out the subsidy and abolish it by 2022.</seg>
<seg id="23">A healthy economy and an emerging budget surplus of $4 billion for the 2019/20 fiscal year are helping to accelerate the process.</seg>
<seg id="24">“As well as eliminating payments for child care, the Quebec government is moving forward with a child benefit increase that is scheduled to take effect in 2021.”</seg>
<seg id="25">“Starting in January 2020, the Quebec government announced that families here will receive an increase in their child benefit of $779 a year.”</seg>
<seg id="26">“This allowance is linked to income, ranging from a minimum of $1,000 in savings to a maximum of $2,515 a year.”</seg>
<seg id="27">“This new regulation is about child equality, nothing less than allowing the Liberals to avoid paying more child benefit to the oldest child.”</seg>
<seg id="28">“Today, we will complete the implementation of a series of measures for the benefit of Quebec residents,” Gerrard said.”</seg>
<seg id="29">“We’re bringing money back to Quebec faster.”</seg>

<seg id="1">Former Nunavut MLA Peter Kattuk dies following a long illness</seg>
<seg id="2">“Peter was widely respected for his commitment to service and environmental contributions”</seg>
<seg id="3">“Sanikiluaq’s statue has been erected in front of the Nunavut legislature since Wednesday, Nov. 20, the evening, in honour of former MLA and cabinet minister Peter Kattuk, who passed away that morning after a long illness.”</seg>
<seg id="4">“The Sanikiluaq Community Centre was erected on Wednesday, November 20 in front of the Nunavut Court of Justice in Iqaluit, in memory of Peter Kattuk of Sanikiluaq, who died that morning after a long illness.”</seg>
<seg id="5">“Kattuk, 69, a respected MLA, mayor and community leader from his home community, joined Nunavut in the early hours of February 15, 1999, when voters in Hudson Bay elected the first Nunavut legislature and the party held its first session on April 1 that same year.”</seg>
<seg id="6">“Peter Kattuk (second from left) with former Nunavut Commissioner Peter Irniq on April 12, 2000, when Kattuk was sworn in as Nunavut’s first minister.”</seg>
<seg id="7">“Earlier this assembly, Kattuk was appointed Culture, Language, Elders and Youth minister on April 12, 2000 to replace MLA Donald Havioyak, who stepped down from the role.”</seg>
<seg id="8">“On December 17, 2001, Kattuk was relieved of his duties as Minister of Community and Government Services, which he held until 2004.”</seg>
<seg id="9">“And in 2004, Sanikiluaq voters re-elected Kattuk to the Hudson Bay constituency, where he served as an MLA until 2008.”</seg>
<seg id="10">“Peter represented Hudson Bay for eight years in two by-elections and I send my condolences to his family,” Nunavut Speaker Simeon Mikkungwak said in a release.”</seg>
<seg id="11">“Born on June 2, 1950, Kattuk spent many years in Sanikiluaq working on the environment, as mayor and community leader.”</seg>
<seg id="12">“In the early 1990s, he was a member of the Sanikiluaq Impact Review Board, which collected community data on the impacts of huge hydroelectric hydroelectric projects built near Northern Quebec on the impact of sea ice and oceans on Sanikiluaq’s surrounding islands.”</seg>
<seg id="13">That resulted in a report titled “Hudson Bay Voices: Cultural Knowledge of Inuit and Indians in the Hudson Bay Area.”</seg>
<seg id="14">“As mayor of Sanikiluaq, Kattuk also spoke out against the now-disused Churchill hydroelectric power plant parking proposal.”</seg>
<seg id="15">“Prior to that Kattuk was a member of the Nunavut-Hudson Bay Working Group, formerly known as the Nunavut Hudson Bay Regional Roundtable.”</seg>
<seg id="16">“This group, formed by the Government of Nunavut, Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. and the Municipality of Sanikiluaq, monitors developments in the Sanikiluaq area for the second hydroelectric power transmission proposal, which has been on hold since then, along the rivers Eastmain and Rupert Rivers.”</seg>
<seg id="17">“And in 1996, Kattuk was a member of the Nunavut Family Services Board, a body set up in 1993 under the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement.”</seg>
<seg id="18">“Peter Kattuk speaks in the Nunavut legislature on February 19, 2008, at the end of his second term in the legislature of Hudson Bay.”</seg>
<seg id="19">“Koonoo Tattuinee, the president of Arctic Co-operatives Limited, remembers Kattuk “doing a lot of things,” as he prepared the sea urchins for Sanikiluaq’s food supply.</seg>
<seg id="20">“It was Paul Okalik, then the premier of Nunavut, who appointed Kattuk as minister of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth in April 2000, saying Kattuk had created Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit before it was widely known.”</seg>
<seg id="21">“Peter was involved in the study of Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit long before this was widely known,” Okalik said in a news release in April 2000.”</seg>
<seg id="22">“Before he became a career minister in 2001, Kattuk had to deal with “horrible” laughter.”</seg>
<seg id="23">That happened when NTCL shipped gasoline to Nunavut and caused damage to snowmobile engines in the Baffin and Kivalliq regions.</seg>
<seg id="24">“During his tenure, Kattuk took a different tack: reacting to the Government of Nunavut’s decision not to use NTCL and reassigning the fuel distribution company to Woodward Partners Labrador.”</seg>
<seg id="25">“He ran for re-election in October 2017, but came in third shortly after Allan Rumbolt.”</seg>
<seg id="26">“Peter was widely respected for his commitment to career services and environmental initiatives,” Mikkungwak said in a statement.”</seg>

<seg id="5">The new MLA for Nunavik wants to hear directly from Inuit leaders to get to know their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="6">MLA Shelby Parubi won the Sanikiluaq-Jam Bay-Nunavik-Yaya by-election in last fall’s federal election with 37.7 per cent of the vote.</seg>
<seg id="7">“When Black Kopakoak MLAs spoke more French, he said he was looking for an Inuktitut interpreter to work with him.”</seg>
<seg id="8">“I want to be very clear about the needs of Indigenous communities,” she said.”</seg>
<seg id="9">“So far, Parubi said there are two major urgent needs in Nunavik that he knows about: health and housing.”</seg>
<seg id="10">“Although health care is a provincial program, it’s subsidized by the federal government, says Parubi.”</seg>
<seg id="11">“In order to expand its health care subsidy program, the federal government must consider how it allocates its funding.”</seg>
<seg id="12">Parubi has been working in the health care field for more than 30 years.</seg>
<seg id="13">“During the Black Quebecois campaign, the party said the province needs 10,000 housing units over the next 10 years.”</seg>
<seg id="14">“As far as Brophy is concerned, he wants to design different types of houses.”</seg>
<seg id="15">“If we want this new Liberal government to move forward, it’s up to us to find a solution,” Parubi said.”</seg>
<seg id="16">“This new MLA is unlikely to be seen in Nunavik, but he looks forward to attending the next annual general meeting of Makivik, which will be held in March.”</seg>
<seg id="17">“Following the election of Purpleie, Makivik President Charlie Watt issued a news release inviting Purpleie to visit Nunavik as soon as possible.”</seg>
<seg id="18">“I look forward to meeting with him, and we welcome his support in our efforts to support entrepreneurship and in areas such as the implementation of the United Nations Empowerment for Indigenous Peoples,” Watt said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Discussions with Inuit leaders would help in his work to support Makivik’s goal of entrepreneurship.</seg>
<seg id="20">“Barbie fully supports Bill C-262, which would bring Canada into compliance with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.”</seg>
<seg id="21">“There are two different pieces of legislation proposed by his predecessor, NDP MLA Romeo Saganas.”</seg>
<seg id="22">“Introduced in 2018, Bill C-262 was suspended by the Conservative Senate this spring but the Liberal government representative in the Senate, Senator Peter Hunter, said that if re-elected, the Liberal government would have to enact the legislation.”</seg>
<seg id="23">“It’s important for me to continue working on Bill C-262 in line with the Constitution of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the work of my predecessor Romeo Caganas,” Parubi said.</seg>
<seg id="24">“I will continue to support this project and look forward to assisting Rome in future initiatives.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trudeau government 2.0: Don’t expect too much.</seg>
<seg id="2">“If you can be comfortable don’t expect too much”</seg>
<seg id="3">“Jane Webb was then Indigenous services minister on March 23, 2018, along with Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami President Nathan Obed, when she announced that the federal government would phase out Inuit Nunangat by 2030.”</seg>
<seg id="4">Less than a year later he resigned as a federal councillor.</seg>
<seg id="5">Did you even notice during the federal election campaign that neither he nor any of the premiers talked much about Nunavut’s values and those of the rest of the Arctic?</seg>
<seg id="6">That’s not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="7">“Most important lawmakers seem to be concerned that the majority of Canadians, due to their southern roots, do not get enough votes to speak northern languages that the majority of Canadians have never heard of.”</seg>
<seg id="8">“The Liberal government made this known, inadvertently dropping and leaving behind the release of a deadlocked northern and northern policy framework the day before the election campaign began.”</seg>
<seg id="9">“During the election campaign, key Indigenous issues, many of which overlook northern issues, were not taken seriously.”</seg>
<seg id="10">“Given the new decline of Justin Trudeau’s government, and the fact that councillors were sworn in to their roles last November 20, it seems likely that they will continue to do so reluctantly.”</seg>
<seg id="11">Here is one possible explanation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It deals with one of the most notable promises made to the North since the Toronto government became prime minister in 2015: eliminate at least 50 per cent (half) of tuberculosis cases in Inuit Nunangat by 2025 and eradicate it completely by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="13">“This included an initial contribution of $27.5 million over five years, the use of which will be “developed” by the four members of ITK.”</seg>
<seg id="14">“But the announcement seems to smell like a broken promise. Starting with that, it’s the former tuberculosis specialist for the federal government, Jane Webb, the former Indigenous services minister who made that promise.”</seg>
<seg id="15">He resigned from Trudeau’s legal team last March 4 in protest at Trudeau’s poor performance under Jody Wilson-Roberts.</seg>
<seg id="16">That happened less than four days before Trudeau was scheduled to travel to Iqaluit to apologize for Canada’s inappropriate treatment of Inuit who suffered from tuberculosis in the 1950s and 1960s.</seg>
<seg id="17">“From then on, they remained silent on the Arctic tuberculosis issue.”</seg>
<seg id="18">“Despite a lot of campaigning, it didn’t get much attention.”</seg>
<seg id="19">“And so far, the fight against tuberculosis has stalled.”</seg>
<seg id="20">“For example, in the Northwest Territories, where the incidence of tuberculosis between 2006 and 2016 was recorded at 248.5 per 100,000 people, health officials surveyed only one community.”</seg>
<seg id="21">“This happened in Nan, in 2018, when there was an outbreak of tuberculosis and a 14-year-old boy died while a patient was in the hospital with Jane Johns.”</seg>
<seg id="22">“In Nunavut, 313 people became ill with tuberculosis between 2006 and 2016, along with tuberculosis in Inuit Nunangat, 234 diagnoses per 100,000 people.”</seg>
<seg id="23">“But there does not appear to have been a community-wide survey in Nunavik since 2018, when Philpott issued his news release.”</seg>
<seg id="24">“It’s no wonder Nunavut’s most recent population survey was conducted after the outbreak of tuberculosis, when Stephen Harper and his Conservative Party were prime minister, long before Trudeau’s Liberals were elected.”</seg>
<seg id="25">“In Nunavut, where there were approximately 670 people infected with tuberculosis between 2006 and 2016, it rose to 171.8 out of 100.000 and there has been a lot of work done in that area.”</seg>
<seg id="26">(One area that has not been affected is the Inuvialuit region of the Northwest Territories.</seg>
<seg id="27">“In the past, there were no cases of active tuberculosis reported between 2007 and 2016.”</seg>
<seg id="28">Tuberculosis is a disease caused by a lack of resources.</seg>
<seg id="29">That’s how it’s being reported now.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it’s true.</seg>
<seg id="31">“If people do not have adequate food and housing, tuberculosis can develop.”</seg>
<seg id="32">“With that in mind, the crisis in Cape Dorset, in this case the 12-week tuberculosis surveillance program ended in May.”</seg>
<seg id="33">In 2016 the unemployment rate was 27.3 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="34">“In 2012-15 the median income of those over the age of 15 was just over $18,933.”</seg>
<seg id="35">“Out of the 370 units, 120 units had to be completely rebuilt.”</seg>
<seg id="36">“Throughout Canada’s overcrowding crisis, 140 units out of 370 units were classified as “not housing” by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. regulations.”</seg>
<seg id="37">That means there are not enough bedrooms per capita for each household.</seg>
<seg id="38">There are also a small number of Canadian Inuit living in less than adequate housing.</seg>
<seg id="39">“It is no coincidence that over the last 20 years (20), tuberculosis has been declared an emergency in Nunavut and other parts of the Arctic.”</seg>
<seg id="40">And it is unlikely that tuberculosis can be eradicated in these communities unless drastic changes are made to increase the supply and quality of housing.</seg>
<seg id="41">“But during the last election campaign, Trudeau’s MLAs made no offer for Inuit housing, only to renege on their 2016 and 2017 budget commitments.”</seg>
<seg id="42">“In this case, they could not even be convicted of contravening their testimony, nor did they raise any concerns about their testimony.”</seg>
<seg id="43">“This also demonstrates the scale of the national disease emergency, where the incidence of tuberculosis in Inuit Nunangat is 300 times higher than that of non-Indigenous Canadians born in Canada.”</seg>
<seg id="44">“In Nunavut, it may be worse.”</seg>
<seg id="45">Last year’s report found that one in 100 infants born in Nunavut may have this disease.</seg>
<seg id="46">“Given the lack of urgent concerns about this disease, what concerns does the Trudeau Liberal government have about other issues such as mental health, community housing, education and more?”</seg>
<seg id="47">“If you can be optimistic, don’t expect too much.”</seg>
<seg id="48">“If you don’t, be prepared for bankruptcy.”</seg>
<seg id="49">“Please note: the latest statistics on tuberculosis progress are from ITK’s “Inuit Tuberculosis Reduction Framework”, released in November 2018.”</seg>

<seg id="17">“The second part of the training program is nine hours long and requires full RCMP training, says LaRose.”</seg>
<seg id="18">That is expected to be completed by the start of the new fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="19">Surveillance cameras will be required for officers</seg>
<seg id="20">Another addition that was received by the RCMP and applauded by members was the requirement for body cameras for RCMP officers on duty.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is for surveillance purposes and they are using six cameras right now.</seg>
<seg id="22">“This work was inspired by Nunavik’s desire for the Kativik Regional RCMP to be more transparent in their work,” Lawrence said.”</seg>
<seg id="23">“Kativik’s community-wide police force is focused on reaching out to Inuit through their activities and creating a more harmonious society.”</seg>
<seg id="24">Kuujjuaq Councillor Jobie Takiapik hoped the cameras would help people who have been in trouble with the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="25">“We hear from the RCMP about inappropriate behaviour and they don’t want to admit it.</seg>
<seg id="26">“They are afraid of the police,” Takiapik said.”</seg>
<seg id="27">“The body cameras are mandatory.”</seg>
<seg id="28">“She goes on to say that if only one or two RCMP officers mistreat Inuit, that has a huge impact, and it’s causing a lot of concern across the RCMP.”</seg>
<seg id="29">“It’s hoped that these cameras, which take pictures of what the police are doing, could be put into use as soon as possible.”</seg>
<seg id="30">LaRose said those cameras will be in place in January.</seg>
<seg id="31">He added that bad behaviour and inappropriate actions will not be tolerated by the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="32">“I just fired an RCMP officer last week for not complying with our mandate in Nunavik,” she said.”</seg>
<seg id="33">“We don’t want to have too many RCMP officers in Nunavik.”</seg>

<seg id="2">“Representatives from Greenland, Canada and the United Kingdom share ideas and insights”</seg>

<seg id="5">Renewable energy experts from the Arctic gathered in Iqaluit on Nov. 21 and 22 to share ideas and insights from their work in the Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="6">“Presenters from Nunavut, the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, Greenland and the United States discussed the failures experienced by multinationals in their respective jurisdictions.”</seg>
<seg id="7">“The conference, called Optimizing Operations, Integrating New Technologies and Engaging Stakeholders (Improving Operations, Incorporating New Resources and Engaging Stakeholders), was organized by U.S. officials in collaboration with the Government of Nunavut and the Qulliq Energy Corporation.”</seg>
<seg id="8">“Bruno Pereira, president of the Qulliq Energy Corp., said the gathering was an opportunity to share experiences.”</seg>
<seg id="9">“Throughout the process of adopting renewable energy in our communities, we’re very interested in finding out what others are doing, and finding out about their successes or failures,” Pereira said.</seg>
<seg id="10">“Pereira also said that while it’s important to get representatives together to talk about reducing fossil fuel use, there’s a lot going on in Nunavut other than here in Alaska.”</seg>
<seg id="11">“Some communities have access roads so there’s not a lot of Inuit living in Nunavut communities.</seg>
<seg id="12">“But just like us, they face challenges, in terms of being able to fit in, being able to work in the community, so we can see similar challenges.”</seg>
<seg id="13">“Chris Roos, executive director of the Institute for Renewable Energy in Alaska, said the Alaska Energy Subsidy Program has contributed to renewable energy development.”</seg>
<seg id="14">“We have now been able to build 80 communities using renewable energy on top of fossil fuels using teas.</seg>
<seg id="15">“That’s where we think we know how to make a difference,” Roos said.”</seg>
<seg id="16">“This subsidy, which is designed to promote renewable economic development projects, also helps Alaskans enjoy lower energy costs.”</seg>
<seg id="17">“Rose said that in southwestern Alaska, five communities are working together to install wind turbines and use them to generate electricity.”</seg>
<seg id="18">“There is now an integrated knowledge base on how to operate and maintain wind farms and they can support each other in designing them,” Roos said.</seg>
<seg id="19">“Alaska, like Nunavut, has high home energy bills.”</seg>
<seg id="20">Roos said communities are using wind turbines not only for lighting but for heating as well.</seg>
<seg id="21">“What they’ve done is put small furnaces in people’s houses that are covered in diamonds that look like carpet.</seg>
<seg id="22">“When it’s more windy, they turn on the heat, and they have a small device that can detect the heat and alert the power company,” Roos said.</seg>
<seg id="23">“Those are covered by a heat shield, which keeps it warm.”</seg>
<seg id="24">“They can be shut off or burned in homes to a satisfactory standard, and if they get stuck they can use a different heating system.”</seg>
<seg id="25">“However in Greenland, installing wind turbines has been difficult, according to News Corp.’s Eric Hagguest, technical advisor for recycling in Nuuk.”</seg>
<seg id="26">“Cold temperatures and long darkness make it difficult for wind turbines built in the south to reach the north, says Hagguest.”</seg>
<seg id="27">“Hagguest also said two wind machines were successfully installed in a different location in northern Greenland, but were unable to do so.”</seg>
<seg id="28">“We can say that Greenland has been more selective in its ability to invest in its resources.</seg>
<seg id="29">“Even two wind tunnels were installed at 200 different sites to be inspected and another at 150 sites to be inspected,” he said.”</seg>
<seg id="30">“One of the windshields collapsed, while on the other, the fuel rod was too thick to withstand the cold and caused engine damage, Hagguest said.”</seg>
<seg id="31">“During the 2019 federal election campaign, the three main political parties promised if elected that Nunavut would be phased out of fossil fuels by 2030.”</seg>
<seg id="32">“Although it may take some time to develop recycling programs that work in the Arctic, Hagguest said eliminating fossil fuels is an urgent priority.”</seg>
<seg id="33">“We have to do something to get away from fossil fuels, climate change, because there’s already something wrong with it.”</seg>
<seg id="34">This is a legal issue because you need a fuel-efficient program but you don’t have the money.</seg>
<seg id="35">“It’s a well-funded project, he said.”</seg>
<seg id="36">Pereira said he found it reassuring to talk to Nunavut’s neighbours who live in the Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="37">“I think it’s something that we should consider in other ways, like how to start working on recycling and implementing it.”</seg>
<seg id="38">Some Inuit have used technology and experienced problems in the south that they were capable of but couldn’t in the north.</seg>
<seg id="39">“If we were financially viable we would be able to track those deficiencies,” Pereira said.”</seg>

<seg id="1">GN should involve Inuit in Education Act development: Nunavut Tunngavik Inc.</seg>
<seg id="2">“This is an important policy change that will affect thousands of Inuit parents and Inuit babies in Nunavut”</seg>
<seg id="3">“Aluki Kotierk, president of Nunavut Tunngavik Inc., speaks during the Standing Committee on Legislation hearing on Bill 25, an Act to Amend the Education Act and the Inuit Language Protection Act.”</seg>
<seg id="4">“By Aluki Kotierk President, Nunavut Tunngavik Inc.”</seg>
<seg id="5">Subject: Minister Joanasie’s letter to Nunatsiaq News on Bill 25 consultation</seg>
<seg id="6">“Mr. Joanasie wrote a letter published by Nunatsiaq News on Nov. 25, 2019 detailing discussions between the Department of Education and Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. on Bill 25, stressing that those discussions were conducted in good faith and offering NTI every opportunity to voice its concerns.”</seg>
<seg id="7">The minister sees it as an opportunity to encourage NTI to participate in public hearings and NTI’s hearings as the GN looks to build on its previous work with NTI.</seg>
<seg id="8">That’s not the case.</seg>
<seg id="9">“Inuit have the right under Article 32 of the Nunavut Agreement to participate in the development of social and cultural policies, as well as the development of social and cultural programs and services, including governance.”</seg>
<seg id="10">It’s a different principle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bill 25 calls for amendments to the Education Act and the Inuit Language Protection Act to create a framework for the policy and administration of Inuit language instruction.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is a fundamental policy change that will affect many Inuit families and Inuit children in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="13">“In this case, Inuit have the right to participate in its development and development.”</seg>
<seg id="14">NTI did not have a timeline for participating in the development of the policy proposals outlined in the proposed Bill 25.</seg>
<seg id="15">“Not only does it violate the government’s obligations outlined in the Nunavut Agreement, its history shows that the partnership has reached its goal of passing legislation that better incorporates Inuit goals and objectives.”</seg>
<seg id="16">“TI has been co-developing legislation with the Government of Nunavut, such as the Inuit Language Protection Act, the Official Languages Act and the Wildlife Act.”</seg>
<seg id="17">“Knowing that it could work, NTI contacted the premier and the newly elected government to coordinate work and collaboration on Inuit priorities, including education, language and culture.”</seg>
<seg id="18">“The Department of Education did not submit the proposed legislation to NTI until Aug. 31, 2018, at which point the department submitted a list of planned community consultations.”</seg>
<seg id="19">NTI was given less than a week to study Bill 25 and plan and prepare for the Nunavut consultation tour.</seg>
<seg id="20">That’s not a relationship.</seg>
<seg id="21">“The department managed the consultation from a short-term perspective, and did not seek to resolve or accommodate the issues raised by Inuit, NTI and other organizations such as the DEA (DEA) and the Coalition of Nunavut District Education Authorities (CNDEA) were also present.”</seg>
<seg id="22">“I urge the Minister of Education that in the Nunavut Agreement there are clear obligations to fulfill Article 32, and that the department must operate within reason, obligation and obligation and adopt the spirit of the Queen when it comes to partnership with Inuit.”</seg>
<seg id="23">“TI believes the rewriting of the Education Act to ensure Inuit participation in the program requires a fundamental shift in departmental governance, as well as wide recognition of Inuit rights,” he wrote.</seg>
