<seg id="66">&gt;&gt;House commenced at 13:33</seg>
<seg id="67">Speaker (Hon. Joe Enook) (interpretation): Mr. Quassa, please say the opening prayer.</seg>
<seg id="68">Speaker (interpretation): Good afternoon, Premier, Members, Nunavummiut who are listening to the radio broadcast, and those watching the televised proceedings. Welcome to your committee.</seg>
<seg id="69">We will proceed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="70">Our Nunavut Premier, Mr. Quassa.</seg>
<seg id="71">Minister's Statement 046 - 5 (1): Nunavut's 2018 Youth Award (Quassa)</seg>
<seg id="72">Hon. Paul Quassa (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="73">Good day to my fellow residents of Igloolik, my colleagues, and all Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="74">I would also like my colleagues to join me in congratulating Dr. Donna Main-Kimmaliardjuk for her 2018 Bachelor of Arts in Winnipeg.</seg>
<seg id="75">She is the very first Inuk doctor to be recognized.</seg>
<seg id="76">Mr. Speaker, Dr. Kimmaliardjuk, who was born in Chesterfield Inlet, is the first Inuk cardiologist to pass on this knowledge...</seg>
<seg id="77">In this fourth year, she is studying for six years at the University of Ottawa.</seg>
<seg id="78">Mr. Speaker, Dr. Kimaliarjuk was admitted to the United States in 2014 as the only Canadian doctor to receive a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="79">In 2016, he became a member of the National Aboriginal Council on AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="80">During his tenure, he served on the Inuit Health Committees and he also promoted Inuit culture.</seg>
<seg id="81">Mr. Speaker, the recipients of the Order of Canada are: Representing the highest honour of aboriginal peoples to this House and its peoples.</seg>
<seg id="82">The program celebrates 25 years of 2018 and has proudly celebrated 350 Aboriginal, Inuit and MÃ©tis people who have demonstrated excellence.</seg>
<seg id="83">The awards ceremony celebrates cultural diversity among aboriginal Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="84">This year, the awards will be held on March 23 in Winnipeg.</seg>
<seg id="85">I would like my colleagues to join me in congratulating Dr. Kimmaliardjuk on his well-deserved recognition.</seg>
<seg id="86">She has worked tirelessly on this subject, and she is very proud of the fact that Inuit have a strong role in health and well-being.</seg>
<seg id="87">I know that when I talk about how proud we are of Dr. Kimmaliardjuk, I'm sure that his efforts will be very important to us.</seg>
<seg id="88">Minister of Justice, Ms. Ehaloak.</seg>
<seg id="89">Minister's Statement 047 - 5 (1): Rankin Inlet Healing Facility sewing (Iqaqrialu)</seg>
<seg id="90">Hon. Jeannie Ehaloak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="91">The inmates who participate in this program include sealskin, sealskin, and other items, such as tentars, mittens, sealskin pelts, badges, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="92">Rosemary Angugassak is run by Sandy, a respected elder, and a world-renowned artist.</seg>
<seg id="93">He recently went to Norway to teach the sealskins.</seg>
<seg id="94">He was a student at Nunavut Arctic College's Fur Production and Design Program and initiated the Miqqut Program with the Literacy Council of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="95">Rosemary's contribution to inmates reflects the cultural and physical fitness of the Inuit language and cultural healing process.</seg>
<seg id="96">Mr. Speaker, the purpose of the seamstresses is to work with and support the on-the-land program. Individuals who are incarcerated go out on the land to learn how to hunt and how to properly skin and prepare their food.</seg>
<seg id="97">The Fur Production and Design Program is an ongoing program.</seg>
<seg id="98">Programs such as this help to inmates in the communities to become more active and engaged when their sentence is over, to attract, rather than to criminal activity.</seg>
<seg id="99">I recently visited the Rankin Inlet Healing Facility and I was pleased to note the positive impact that the cultural program has had on the community, particularly with elders like Rosemary Sand.</seg>
<seg id="100">Minister of Family Services, Minister Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="101">Minister's Statement 048 - 5 (1): Red Seal certification Campaign (Savikataaq)</seg>
<seg id="102">Hon. Joe Savikataaq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="103">Mr. Speaker, the certified heavy equipment operator and heavy duty mechanics and heavy equipment operator remains a key component of this project.</seg>
<seg id="104">In September 2016 the heavy equipment operator course was offered in three parts of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="105">This allows Nunavut to offer on-the-job training and certification programs.</seg>
<seg id="106">In November of 2017 Nunavut received the Red Seal certification for heavy equipment operators and operators.</seg>
<seg id="107">As part of the Heavy Equipment Operators Program, the graduates of the Certificate Program offer a wide range of knowledge and skills that enables them to work anywhere in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="108">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to announce that we have been able to offer this program to Nunavutmiut at the national level as an award of excellence for Nunavutmiut.</seg>
<seg id="109">Minister of Education, Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="110">Minister's Statement 049 - 5 (1): New Funding for Early Childhood Programs (Joanasie)</seg>
<seg id="111">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon, my colleagues, residents of Cape Dorset and Kimmirut.</seg>
<seg id="112">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to announce today that the Department of Education will provide O&amp;M support to eligible daycares.</seg>
<seg id="113">Mr. Speaker, the increase is a result of a three-year program plan that my department developed for early childhood education and child care, which was signed in September 2017 with the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="114">Mr. Speaker, this fiscal year, we will see eligible daycares receive an increase of $1,918.80 with the maximum amount of $45,494.80 based on the number, type, and location of the daycare.</seg>
<seg id="115">As long as the daycares don't increase their childcare and additional costs they will be eligible for similar funding in the next fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="116">Mr. Speaker, this funding will not only assist day care operators with operating costs, it will also help families with child care without incurring additional costs.</seg>
<seg id="117">Mr. Speaker, we are proud to be able to provide this funding to daycares and their families.</seg>
<seg id="118">I also believe, and it's clear that we also believe that this funding will have a positive impact without changing all the funding and daycare costs.</seg>
<seg id="119">Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="120">Minister's Statement 050 - 5 (1): Nunavut Mining Symposium (Shewchuk)</seg>
<seg id="121">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik (interpretation): Good day, Nunavummiut and my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="122">Mr. Speaker, mining plays a critical role in Nunavut's economic development.</seg>
<seg id="123">My department has been very supportive of mining activities in Nunavut and we're very supportive of that.</seg>
<seg id="124">Mr. Speaker, Canada is hosting the 21st Annual Nunavut Mining Symposium from April 9 to 12, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="125">This forum provides an excellent opportunity for people to explore new areas of Nunavut's mineral exploration and mining industry to ensure that our communities are aware of and involved in the mining and exploration sectors in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="126">We expect that this year's mining symposium will continue to attract all of the well-established residents of Nunavut and we expect more than 400 participants.</seg>
<seg id="127">Mr. Speaker, I look forward to welcoming the mines, Inuit organizations, exploration, community members, and others involved in this important meeting.</seg>
<seg id="128">Finally, Mr. Speaker, I encourage all members and the public to participate in this important public meeting on April 11.</seg>
<seg id="129">It's not just an opportunity to get good results, but it also impacts the search and rescue.</seg>
<seg id="130">Members' Statements. Member for Hudson Bay, Mr. Rumbolt.</seg>
<seg id="131">Member's Statement 096 - 5 (1): Happy Fifth Birthday to Grandchild (Rumbolt)</seg>
<seg id="132">Mr. Speaker, five years ago to this day, the Speaker of the House rose in this House to recognize my first grandson.</seg>
<seg id="133">Happy birthday, Jayden.</seg>
<seg id="134">Member for Netsilik, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="135">Member's Statement 097 - 5 (1): Midwifery in the Kitikmeot (Qirngnuq)</seg>
<seg id="136">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="137">I will be speaking about youth and how they can plan for their future.</seg>
<seg id="138">I rise today to share some good news with my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="139">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to inform the House that Inuit youth from across the Kitikmeot will be gathering in Cambridge Bay next week to encourage the 2018 Kitikmeot Youth Achievement Conference.</seg>
<seg id="140">Mr. Speaker, this gathering provides an opportunity for Kitikmeot youth to get together and discuss their priorities, concerns, and ideas about youth.</seg>

<seg id="143">Youth Centres;</seg>

<seg id="160">Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, Mr. Lysytheon.</seg>
<seg id="161">Member's Statement 098 - 5 (1): Anti-smoking Legislation (Lighthizer)</seg>
<seg id="162">Mr. Lysytheon: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="163">I rise today to raise concerns that have been brought to my attention by constituents regarding the harmful effects of marijuana legalization.</seg>
<seg id="164">I just received a letter stating, "My family as Iqaluit residents are in public housing units next year.</seg>
<seg id="165">Over the past two years with smoke, we have had to move away from the smell, the smoke coming into my house is very strong."</seg>
<seg id="166">The letter further states, and I quote, "I am deeply concerned about the impacts of smoking on children because I am putting my children first and others at risk."</seg>
<seg id="167">Mr. Speaker, as residents of Iqaluit and my family, we also live in a multiplex unit.</seg>
<seg id="168">Mr. Speaker, air pollution affects other groups of smokers.</seg>
<seg id="169">You haven't been smoking for a long time, but when someone else is smoking, the illness has been known by the government and they have made their own rules.</seg>
<seg id="170">As a father and father when you have children, I don't want them to be affected by these health hazards that are related to tobacco, tobacco, and nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="171">As my colleague from Pangnirtung pointed out, the member had asked the Minister of Health about the health benefits of cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="172">In talking to my constituents, they have the same concerns.</seg>
<seg id="173">Mr. Speaker, I recognize that when it comes to such issues, we must be flexible.</seg>
<seg id="174">The federal government's ban on the sale of tobacco products will come into force in a few months.</seg>
<seg id="175">I would like to ask for unanimous consent to conclude my statement.</seg>
<seg id="176">The member is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statement today. Are there any nays?</seg>
<seg id="177">Mr. Lysytheon, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="178">Thank you, colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="179">However, the government will have to develop a regulatory framework for the regulation of smoking within a community.</seg>
<seg id="180">Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet noted last week that the government's own consultations and results indicate that there is concern over agriculture and the treatment of condominiums and apartments.</seg>
<seg id="181">Mr. Speaker, I believe that once the legislation is introduced in the House, it will be important to clearly identify these concerns and to ensure that the appropriate decisions are made.</seg>
<seg id="182">Before we proceed, as you are aware, Mr. Akoak is not here due to illness.</seg>
<seg id="183">Mr. Akoak, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="184">Member for Baker Lake, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="185">Member's Statement 099 - 5 (1): Increase in Educational Opportunities in Baker Lake (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="186">Mr. Mikkungwak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="187">I say "hello" to the people of Baker Lake and all Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="188">I rise today to encourage our government to increase the training opportunities in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="189">Mr. Speaker, Baker Lake is a rapidly growing community. It will be important at this time to support more training and employment opportunities that will benefit the community of Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="190">Mr. Speaker, the Piqqusilirivvik Cultural School operates the programs in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="191">This could be expanded further so that the public is more informed about Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit.</seg>
<seg id="192">Mr. Speaker, the idea of establishing a university in Nunavut has been expressed, and Agnico-Eagle Mines has indicated that they would be willing to support such an initiative.</seg>
<seg id="193">I think it would be best if we put it in the middle of Nunavut because it's in the middle of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="194">Mr. Speaker, as one of my colleagues stated, it's important that we take these things very seriously.</seg>
<seg id="195">The government's wheels are very slow on the roads, but we need to encourage and encourage whenever something is available in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="196">Mr. Speaker, since this is our first day as the Fifth Legislative Assembly, I too would like to see us move forward.</seg>
<seg id="197">The expansion of programs in communities such as Baker Lake would be a positive step forward.</seg>
<seg id="198">Member for Kugluktuk, Ms. Kamingoak.</seg>
<seg id="199">Member's Statement 100 - 5 (1): Issues with the Larga Boarding Home (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="200">Mr. Kamingoak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="201">Good afternoon, colleagues, Kuglukturmiut, and Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="202">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage the government to improve its monitoring of the day-to-day operations of boarding homes.</seg>
<seg id="203">Mr. Speaker, a number of my constituents have brought forward concerns that have been addressed in the past.</seg>
<seg id="204">The food chain has been in operation for many months.</seg>
<seg id="205">Mr. Speaker, it is important that the government ensures that services paid for by Nunavummiut are delivered in a timely manner.</seg>
<seg id="206">I understand that the boarding homes require a lot of billets on a daily basis but it is important however that they are comfortable and well looked after.</seg>
<seg id="207">Mr. Speaker, it is unclear if the boarding homes will be included in the review.</seg>
<seg id="208">I would really like to see the review and the recommendations to improve the services and the condition of the boarding homes.</seg>
<seg id="209">Member for Aivilik, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="210">Member's Statement 101 - 5 (1): Congratulations to Rosaline Ejangiaq (Netser)</seg>
<seg id="211">Mr. Netser (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="212">He has worked tirelessly and has received numerous awards, including the Hercules Elder Scholarship.</seg>
<seg id="213">Mr. Speaker, the Hercules Elder Scholarship is a national scholarship program that provides scholarships to high school students who find it very difficult to be successful.</seg>
<seg id="214">Mr. Speaker, I would like to acknowledge Ms. Ejangiaq for her dedication and commitment to furthering her education.</seg>
<seg id="215">Our youth face many challenges and obstacles in achieving their post-secondary education.</seg>
<seg id="216">I ask all members to join me in congratulating him on his achievements. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="217">Member for Pangnirtung, Mrs. Nakasuk.</seg>
<seg id="218">Member's Statement 102 - 5 (1): Poosie Mike Recognized Under Canada 150</seg>
<seg id="219">Mr. Akesuk: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="220">Good afternoon, my colleagues, my family, and the people of Pangnirtung.</seg>
<seg id="221">I rise this afternoon to congratulate a constituent of mine from Pangnirtung who was recognized by Dennis Patterson.</seg>
<seg id="222">I would also like to congratulate him for 18 years of volunteer search and rescue services in Pangnirtung.</seg>
<seg id="223">My final supplementary, Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="224">Member's Statement 103 - 5 (1): Budget Reflections (Mike)</seg>
<seg id="225">Ms. Main (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="226">I say "good day" to the people watching the video.</seg>
<seg id="227">I rise today to offer some reflections and recommendations on the government's financial management practices.</seg>
<seg id="228">Mr. Speaker, as a new generation here, over the last couple of weeks, we have learned a great deal.</seg>
<seg id="229">Mr. Speaker, as the Chair of the Regular Members' Caucus of the Legislative Assembly, I would like to express my appreciation to all of my colleagues for the collegial manner in which we have been able to work together since the beginning of the new Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="230">Mr. Speaker, I am proud to say that we made a very strong public statement on Friday that the Legislative Assembly will no longer just accept and accept the value of the government's own procurement practices.</seg>
<seg id="231">Ms. Main (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My colleague from Iqaluit-Tasiluk tabled a very important motion on Friday and we will proceed with the review of the Legislative Assembly during the spring sitting.</seg>
<seg id="232">Mr. Speaker, we are a territory-wide government and it's not always an effective government.</seg>
<seg id="233">For example, as I noted last week in my opening comments, when we were dealing with the college's capital budget, the government listened to our concerns and made significant changes to the budget.</seg>
<seg id="234">I look forward to seeing more of that happening in the coming weeks and years.</seg>
<seg id="235">Mr. Speaker, over the last few weeks, MLAs have asked a lot of questions on a daily basis.</seg>
<seg id="236">I think it's very clear that we need to re-evaluate the government's spending.</seg>
<seg id="237">It's just not enough.</seg>
<seg id="238">I would like unanimous consent to conclude my statement, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="239">The member is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statement. Are there any nays?</seg>
<seg id="240">Mr. Main, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="241">Ms. May: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="242">Mr. Speaker, I am talking about examples of emerging technologies.</seg>
<seg id="243">Mr. Speaker, I believe that this information should be made public to the Legislative Assembly so that we, as elected members, can make informed decisions on whether or not any of our expenditures should be increased, decreased, or decreased, or deleted, as we all know, due to limited resources.</seg>
<seg id="244">Mr. Speaker, I will use these as an example.</seg>
<seg id="245">I think it's fair to say that we can all agree that the government's administration of the Fuel Tax Rebate Program, or the government's own programs, or the government's own programs, is lacking in support of harvesters.</seg>
<seg id="246">The Department of Environment is responsible for administering the government's harvester support programs. The government needs to take a close look at its programs to determine how to improve the targets for harvesters to assist them with the cost of fuel.</seg>
<seg id="247">Mr. Speaker, I will also take another example of the government's grants and contributions spending.</seg>
<seg id="248">We know that the government has spent a considerable amount of money on developing and promoting programs.</seg>
<seg id="249">We know that there have been some funds that have been borrowed by the private sector.</seg>
<seg id="250">We know who received the funding.</seg>
<seg id="251">We don't know what this money was used for.</seg>
<seg id="252">We don't know how many Inuit were hired from Nunavut in that fund and we don't even know what the money was used for.</seg>
<seg id="253">Mr. Speaker, as you know, I could go on for so long, but I'll leave it at that.</seg>
<seg id="254">In addition, I would like to see better budget management in the Legislative Assembly and I look forward to working with all members to strengthen our budget by supporting all communities and constituents.</seg>
<seg id="255">Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="256">Member's Statement 104 - 5 (1): Two Additional Inuit Patients for Care (Tootoo)</seg>
<seg id="257">Mr. Towtongie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="258">I rise today to pay tribute to the people of Rankin Inlet North and Chesterfield Inlet. Today, one of our elders, Annie Tatty, is sent to Ottawa on a plane.</seg>
<seg id="259">Also one of our elders, Amarok, when I rose in the House today, he was sent to Gjoa Haven because he is not an elder.</seg>
<seg id="260">I would like an update on Rankin Inlet North and Chesterfield Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="261">As soon as I was elected in November, I was looking at the budget and I asked the Minister of Health about the roof. Where are the plans for the establishment of an elders' facility in Rankin Inlet or in Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="262">I was told by the Minister of Health that all of us, as MLAs, are very concerned about our elders.</seg>
<seg id="263">At our next meeting in Pond Inlet, this issue will be brought up.</seg>
<seg id="264">I am waiting.</seg>
<seg id="265">The other day I rose in the House to speak about the capital budget. I didn't see it in the budget.</seg>
<seg id="266">I was told that I should not talk about this because I have to stop.</seg>
<seg id="267">However, I was grateful to our Chairman, Allan Rumbolt, that I was able to proceed with the tabling of my feelings on this matter.</seg>
<seg id="268">Now I stand up for myself as an elected member because I am not satisfied.</seg>
<seg id="269">The issue of sending elders south to other jurisdictions is not acceptable.</seg>
<seg id="270">As Members of the Legislative Assembly, we want to be a government that respects our elders and sends them out of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="271">Member for Amittuq, Mr. Kownirk.</seg>
<seg id="272">Member's Statement 105 - 5 (1): Recognition of Hall Beach and Igloolik Volunteer Search and Rescue (Rankin Inlet)</seg>
<seg id="273">Mr. Cloutier (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="274">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my pride in one of my fellow residents.</seg>
<seg id="275">The search and rescue teams work really hard to search for people when there is an emergency.</seg>
<seg id="276">It's just for their operations.</seg>
<seg id="277">I rise today to congratulate the search and rescue members in my community of Hall Beach. They are the chairperson of the search and rescue society, Kyle Issigaitok, and the coordinator is George Innuksuk, Martha Gibbons Tupik.</seg>
<seg id="278">Abraham Ullulaq is an elder.</seg>
<seg id="279">As I stated before, he is the first one to go out for search and rescue. Here is an elder.</seg>
<seg id="280">Our elders tell the truth.</seg>
<seg id="281">We don't think they're the future.</seg>
<seg id="282">I'm here now. I'm always disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="283">When you go out on the land, please be patient.</seg>
<seg id="284">Mr. Irniq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would also like to recognize the Igloolik search and rescue group. They had a meeting this week in Hall Beach and it's springtime now.</seg>
<seg id="285">For that reason, Mr. Speaker, if you're going out on the land, please SPOT and if you're going out on the land, ask your elders wherever they want to go, then I'll catch up.</seg>
<seg id="286">Those kinds of things.</seg>
<seg id="287">I rise today to reiterate that the search and rescue organization has one snowmobile and they have never received a response.</seg>
<seg id="288">I would like to see more assistance for search and rescue operations.</seg>
<seg id="289">That's it.</seg>

<seg id="292">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="293">I would like to thank the minister for listening to some of the good news from the Sam Pudlat School in Cape Dorset that they're going to be doing. I'm sure there will be individuals who will be invited to participate in the music program as well.</seg>
<seg id="294">I would like to take this opportunity to thank the singers for giving us the opportunity to travel to Cape Dorset with the help of the Hamlet of Cape Dorset.</seg>
<seg id="295">There are none.</seg>
<seg id="296">Member for Quttiktuq, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="297">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="298">I would like to recognize four individuals in the Gallery.</seg>
<seg id="299">First of all, I would like to recognize the Parks Canada Coordinator for Nunavut, Jenna Bern, and her assistant, who always looks after me and my children, my wife, Carol Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="300">I would like to thank all of you for being able to come to Iqaluit from the High Arctic. We are very grateful that my sister, Naomi Kokak-Kulluruqtuq.</seg>
<seg id="301">I would also like to recognize an individual who is here for school, Jaden Natanine.</seg>
<seg id="302">Let me provide some background.</seg>
<seg id="303">When I was a child, I was still a child...</seg>
<seg id="304">...I was expecting the first lake.</seg>
<seg id="305">I don't think many people expected to get their seal meat from the lake because we lived in a sandy island.</seg>
<seg id="306">They helped a lot and they were my mom.</seg>
<seg id="307">I would like to thank them for being able to come here again.</seg>
<seg id="308">Welcome to your Legislative Assembly, Mr. Uttak.</seg>
<seg id="309">Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="310">Mr. Towtongie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="311">My parents were given photographs of the Ukkusiksalik Park.</seg>
<seg id="312">I would also like to thank Theresa Uttak for providing me with tea and Louise Uttak. I would like to thank you for having a good meal and I will be billeting with you again.</seg>
<seg id="313">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="314">Welcome to the Gallery.</seg>
<seg id="315">Member for Kugluktuk, Ms. Kamingoak.</seg>
<seg id="316">Mr. Kamingoak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="317">I would like to recognize Naomi Kokak-Kugluktuk and Carol Akeeagok, who are my relatives.</seg>
<seg id="318">I would like to recognize Naomi from Grise Fiord. I don't have many relatives every day.</seg>
<seg id="319">Welcome to your Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="320">Member for Pangnirtung, Mrs. Nakasuk.</seg>
<seg id="321">Mr. Nakashuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would also like to recognize and congratulate my husband, Andrew Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="322">Please welcome him.</seg>
<seg id="323">Mr. Nakashuk, welcome to our Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="324">Recognition of Visitors in the Gallery. I have no more names on my list.</seg>
<seg id="325">We will move on in our orders of the day.</seg>
<seg id="326">We will begin with the Hon. Member for Iqaluit-Tasiluk, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="327">Question 123 - 5 (1): Private Sector Legislation (Hickes)</seg>
<seg id="328">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="329">My questions are for the Minister of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="330">Mr. Speaker, I've had an opportunity with my colleagues over the last couple of weeks to go through some of the training for corrections officers.</seg>
<seg id="331">I would like to ask the minister if this government is going to introduce legislation on waste management.</seg>
<seg id="332">Minister of Justice, Minister Ell.</seg>
<seg id="333">Hon. Jeannie Ehaloak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker and Mr. Hickes for the question.</seg>
<seg id="334">As of today, the Government of Nunavut does not have a Code of Values and Ethics.</seg>
<seg id="335">My department is aware of the company that is providing security services in our communities such as health centres.</seg>
<seg id="336">We are currently in the process of reviewing the policy for the establishment of the Nunavut Business Credit Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="337">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="338">As the minister is saying, one of the last jurisdictions in Canada that doesn't have a Business Incentive Policy, we want to make sure that they have the ability and the ability to be accountable and provide that service.</seg>
<seg id="339">We have established standards in all the regions.</seg>
<seg id="340">My next question is: once the review is done, will there be a legislative proposal for that?</seg>
<seg id="341">Mr. Iqaqrialu.</seg>
<seg id="342">Hon. Jeannie Ehaloak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Mr. Hickes, yes, we can work towards developing policies or regulations for the private sector.</seg>
<seg id="343">Your final supplementary, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="344">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="345">I thank the minister for that commitment.</seg>
<seg id="346">Mr. Speaker, at this time, I would just like to state that the Department of Justice has oversight over the enforcement aspects. If the enforcement officials work with the Department of Community and Government Services in coordinating the contract, they should be contracted by the Government of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="347">Hon. Jeannie Ehaloak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Regulations or policies are prepared by the Department of Justice or any other department.</seg>
<seg id="348">I don't have the information in front of me, but I will look into it and get back to you.</seg>
<seg id="349">Question 124 - 5 (1): Status of Site Clean-up in Baker Lake (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="350">Mr. Mikkungwak (interpretation): Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="351">My questions are for the Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="352">So these are questions that I asked the minister last week regarding the clean up of the contaminated site in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="353">In one of his responses to my questions, the minister indicated that this "final report" was prepared and submitted to the Qulliq Energy Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="354">Will the minister commit to providing a copy of the report to both the Hamlet Council of Baker Lake and as the MLA for the community?</seg>
<seg id="355">Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation, Minister Iqaluaq.</seg>
<seg id="356">Hon. Jeannie Ehaloak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Yes, Mr. Mikkungwak, I can commit to doing that.</seg>
<seg id="357">Your first supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="358">I thank the minister for that commitment.</seg>
<seg id="359">One of the things that the minister is rising today is to talk about how the Qulliq Energy Corporation can work with the Hamlet of Baker Lake to clean up this mess. Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to hear that when I go back to the community next week and I will encourage the hamlet staff, the Qulliq Energy Corporation staff, to meet with their staff.</seg>
<seg id="360">Mr. Speaker, I don't think that would be too hard to do because the Qulliq Energy Corporation storage facility is located in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="361">The minister indicated that the Qulliq Energy Corporation has already spent $1.68 million to date on the clean-up.</seg>
<seg id="362">Can he clarify how much it would cost to clean the remaining site?</seg>
<seg id="363">Minister Iqaqrialu.</seg>
<seg id="364">Hon. Jeannie Ehaloak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) The total cost of the clean-up would be approximately $10 million.</seg>
<seg id="365">Our intention is to work with the Hamlet of Baker Lake to clean up the contaminated site.</seg>
<seg id="366">Your final supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="367">Mr. Speaker, as I indicated in my last question last week, the federal government and the Government of Nunavut have not come to a final price yet.</seg>
<seg id="368">Mr. Speaker, I am in support of the Qulliq Energy Corporation's position that the damage was done because it was under the responsibility of the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="369">Will the Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation commit to working with the Minister of Justice to explore and clarify the legal options that may be open to such an approach?</seg>
<seg id="370">Hon. Jeannie Ehaloak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Yes, as the Minister of Energy and the Minister of Justice, we will work together to resolve this issue.</seg>
<seg id="371">Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, Mr. Lysytheon.</seg>
<seg id="372">Question 125 - 5 (1): Early Childhood Education Leave Policy (McLean)</seg>
<seg id="373">My questions are for the Minister responsible for the Public Service Act.</seg>
<seg id="374">In previous years, the government's annual reports on the administration of the Public Service Act have indicated that a significant number of individuals took advantage of the government's FANS program.</seg>
<seg id="375">Unfortunately, the 2016-17 annual report did not include that information.</seg>
<seg id="376">Can the minister provide the House with this information?</seg>
<seg id="377">Minister of Finance, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="378">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="379">I think the member wants us to go through the annual report and I'm sure that they will be able to table that annual report.</seg>
<seg id="380">I don't know if the patient's needs are going to be there.</seg>
<seg id="381">Your first supplementary, Mr. Lightstone.</seg>
<seg id="382">I would just like to ask the minister if he could provide the House with an update as to how many employees took advantage of the FANS program in 2016-17.</seg>
<seg id="383">Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="384">Speaker (interpretation): The question has been taken as notice.</seg>
<seg id="385">Member for Pangnirtung, Ms. Nakasuk.</seg>
<seg id="386">Question 126 - 5 (1): Status of the old Pangnirtung Health Centre (Nakashuk)</seg>
<seg id="387">Mr. Nashook (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="388">My questions today are for the Minister of Community and Government Services.</seg>
<seg id="389">I have asked the minister in the past about the old Pangnirtung Health Centre that is no longer in use after the new health centre was renovated.</seg>
<seg id="390">The old health centre has been unoccupied for some time, but the door is still open.</seg>
<seg id="391">My question is: what kind of plans does the minister have for the old health centre?</seg>
<seg id="392">Minister of Community and Government Services, Minister Kusugak.</seg>
<seg id="393">Hon. Lorne Kusugak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="394">I thank my colleague for that question.</seg>
<seg id="395">When a building is no longer being used by the government, it becomes a question of the owner of the building.</seg>
<seg id="396">The old health centre was built in 1975 in Pangnirtung and it went through that process.</seg>
<seg id="397">The Department of Health no longer wishes to spend it.</seg>
<seg id="398">We consulted with various government departments and we didn't hear from anyone who was interested.</seg>
<seg id="399">We're now making plans to see if they can be taken over by the hamlet council.</seg>
<seg id="400">If they don't want to get it, we would go to the non-profit community to get it.</seg>
<seg id="401">We have to go through the process of disposal of assets.</seg>
<seg id="402">That's where we are at right now.</seg>
<seg id="403">Your first supplementary, Ms. Nakasuk.</seg>
<seg id="404">If I understand the question correctly, the communities have been asked if they would like to start incarceration or what the situation is.</seg>
<seg id="405">Hon. Lorne Kusugak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="406">We haven't heard from the government that they want it.</seg>
<seg id="407">At this time, we're planning to see if the hamlets would like to get a conservation officer.</seg>
<seg id="408">That is where we are right now.</seg>
<seg id="409">Your final supplementary, Ms. Nakasuk.</seg>
<seg id="410">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="411">I'm not sure if the hamlet is interested in getting a building, but if it can't be built from there, what happens if the government buildings are no longer being used?</seg>
<seg id="412">Thank you for that question.</seg>
<seg id="413">There are four main barriers that we use.</seg>
<seg id="414">For example, when the old health centre in Pangnirtung was no longer in the public interest, we asked if it was in the interest of other government departments.</seg>
<seg id="415">The hamlet didn't want it, so we're going to check with the hamlet to see if they want it.</seg>
<seg id="416">That's what we use.</seg>
<seg id="417">Member for Aivilik, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="418">Question 127 - 5 (1): Social Services Client Travel Policy (Netser)</seg>
<seg id="419">Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="420">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="421">I would first like to say "good afternoon" since I have been here. I didn't say "good afternoon" to them.</seg>
<seg id="422">We will be going home very soon.</seg>
<seg id="423">Mr. Speaker, it is regrettable that some of Nunavut's most vulnerable residents have to travel south to receive care, even away from their families.</seg>
<seg id="424">I agree with you. When you're visited, it changes a lot.</seg>
<seg id="425">The Department of Family Services' Medical Travel Policy, which is on the government's website, was tabled in June 2013, effective March 31, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="426">I was led to understand that the previous Minister of Family Services committed to making changes to the family travel policy.</seg>
<seg id="427">Can the minister indicate if there have been any changes to the Social Assistance client travel policy since 2013 and, if there have been no changes since March 31 of this year?</seg>
<seg id="428">Minister of Family Services, Minister Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="429">Hon. Joe Savikataaq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="430">Mr. Speaker, I can't speak for the previous minister of mine, but what I can say is that the policy will be in place until March 2018 to the end of the year and it will remain in place until a new policy is introduced.</seg>
<seg id="431">I haven't heard anything from the Department of Family Services officials about any changes to the policy.</seg>
<seg id="432">If there is a need to change it, then we can look at it and say, "We can't change it."</seg>
<seg id="433">If there seems to be a change that is going to be beneficial to the income support recipients and to the government then we can look into it.</seg>
<seg id="434">Your first supplementary, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="435">Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and thank you, Minister.</seg>
<seg id="436">The Department of Family Services' client travel policy states that an elder who is under the care of a social services client can be visited by two family members or guardians on an annual basis.</seg>
<seg id="437">Can the minister indicate if this policy has been revised to allow for two visits per year?</seg>
<seg id="438">There are two return tickets; two travel tickets at the same time or one travel two times.</seg>
<seg id="439">Just to be clear, two return tickets per person, two return tickets per year per dependant.</seg>
<seg id="440">Your final supplementary, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="441">Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Will the minister commit to considering changing the family travel policy for adults who are in care?</seg>
<seg id="442">The policy is expiring very soon and at the end of the day, we will have to review it, but I can't commit to anything right now until the review is done on the policy itself.</seg>
<seg id="443">I'm sure that there will be a review of all the medical travel that is paid for by Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="444">We will have to work with the Department of Health to make sure that the policies are adhered to, but I can't say yes other than that because the Medical Travel Policy will be expiring soon.</seg>
<seg id="445">Member for Netsilik, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="446">Question 128 - 5 (1): Update on Medical Travel Office (Qirngnuq)</seg>
<seg id="447">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="448">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Health.</seg>
<seg id="449">Mr. Speaker, from time to time, many of my constituents have come to my office seeking help in dealing with their health issues.</seg>
<seg id="450">The minister frequently advises me and he even issued a phone call last week that Nunavummiut can call the patient relations office if they have concerns.</seg>
<seg id="451">Mr. Speaker, language and where you come from, it becomes a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="452">Can the minister tell us how much more can the patient relations office do?</seg>
<seg id="453">Minister of Health, Ms. Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="454">Hon. Patterk Angnakak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="455">I understand your concern and we do try to encourage people to call a toll-free number so that we can get an immediate response.</seg>
<seg id="456">I don't have that information in front of me, but we do have an email address and we also have a fax number.</seg>
<seg id="457">Your first supplementary, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="458">Mr. Qirngnuq: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation) I don't know if he answered my question or not, but I'll ask it anyways.</seg>
<seg id="459">Mr. Speaker, the Information and Privacy Commissioner has raised concerns about the issue of confidentiality, and I understand that there is an urgent need to address the issue of confidentiality.</seg>
<seg id="460">The patient relations office has a form that outlines complaints or concerns.</seg>
<seg id="461">However, if you don't have a fax machine, you can't send it on your own. You don't have all the computers, so you can't take a picture of a computer that is going to be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="462">Can the minister clearly explain why the Office of Patient Relations is not required to have a fax machine?</seg>
<seg id="463">An Hon. Member: Good question.</seg>
<seg id="464">Ms. Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="465">That's a very good question.</seg>
<seg id="466">I think the reason why we're seeing a decrease in the use of facsimile machines is because we're seeing a lot of advancement in technology across the government.</seg>
<seg id="467">According to my substantiation sheet, the government has a website that can be accessed, www.patientrelations@gov.nu.ca. All communities have health centres.</seg>
<seg id="468">If you want to send out the application forms by fax, you can send them out.</seg>
<seg id="469">They can be faxed to our headquarters office.</seg>
<seg id="470">If the patient relations office doesn't have fax machines, I can look into it.</seg>
<seg id="471">Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="472">Question 129 - 5 (1): Income Support Policies (Tootoo)</seg>
<seg id="473">Mr. Towtongie: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="474">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="475">Mr. Speaker, some of the questions that were asked by the Member for Kugluktuk in regard to income support.</seg>
<seg id="476">The minister indicated that the Income Support Program, which is signed by the department on a program basis, is part of a productive choice program.</seg>
<seg id="477">Can the minister clearly explain how the search for this position would be conducted in a fair and transparent manner?</seg>
<seg id="478">Minister of Family Services, Minister Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="479">With respect to the report on the improvements to the selection process, I personally would have thought that if there is no job opening at all, yes, it's useless, but at times, they can only get a job because they are short-staffed.</seg>
<seg id="480">Perhaps it would be better if he was able to go and look for an individual who could go to the appropriate department.</seg>
<seg id="481">Your first supplementary, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="482">The Income Support Program is a policy, not a policy of the Nunavut government.</seg>
<seg id="483">If it's a policy, we wouldn't be able to make changes.</seg>
<seg id="484">I see, when you don't have a job to do, when you have a young person who wants to get out of work and wants to get out of work on a monthly basis, that's what they're doing; how they're going to do it; how they're doing it; how they're doing it; how they're doing it; how they're doing it; how they're doing it; and how they're</seg>
<seg id="485">Can the minister clearly explain what specific aspects of Nunavut's situation should be addressed by establishing an outpost camp policy?</seg>
<seg id="486">At this time, he's only focusing on Nunavut and not Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="487">This policy is for Nunavut only.</seg>
<seg id="488">This is just for Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="489">There was an assessment done on income support and that's why the policy was changed.</seg>
<seg id="490">At this time, there is still a lot of money available for income support and also for the children who are on income support.</seg>
<seg id="491">The position has been advertised and it will be reviewed again.</seg>
<seg id="492">If you don't have a job, you won't be able to get a job. However, with respect to the benefits, yes, you have to make proper choices.</seg>
<seg id="493">Question 130 - 5 (1): Mine Training (Irqittuq)</seg>
<seg id="494">Mr. Irniq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="495">I rise today to direct my question to the Minister of Economic Development and Transportation.</seg>
<seg id="496">Mr. Speaker, I firmly believe that the mining companies when they're trying to develop a career and they're responsible for the environment, the benefits are great.</seg>
<seg id="497">My question today is in regard to the employment of students.</seg>
<seg id="498">Last year, your department's 2017-18 main estimates for the Department of Economic Development and Transportation included $200,000 in funding for the Nunavut Mine Training Program.</seg>
<seg id="499">Can the minister provide an example of how much funding has been used to date in 2017-18?</seg>
<seg id="500">I hope I was understandable.</seg>
<seg id="501">Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Ms. Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="502">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="503">Thank you for your questions.</seg>
<seg id="504">What I can say is that we don't have a breakdown of how the program was used.</seg>
<seg id="505">The department is working with Family Services, Nunavut Arctic College, the federal government, our mining industry, and Inuit organizations to develop a number of programs to prepare Nunavummiut for opportunities in the mining sector. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="506">Your first supplementary, Mr. Kownirk.</seg>
<seg id="507">Mr. Irniq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="508">I thank the minister for that answer.</seg>
<seg id="509">Will the Department of Finance be increasing its budget or decreasing its budget for the 2018-19 fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="510">Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="511">I can't respond to that right now, but I apologize if I can go back to the member's question about the $200,000.</seg>
<seg id="512">Kitikmeot Corporation: $61,000; Qikiqtani Inuit Association, Literacy for Baffin; $60,000; and the Hamlet of Arviat, Labour Market Development Training; $78,000 for heavy equipment;</seg>
<seg id="513">Thank you for that clarification.</seg>
<seg id="514">Mr. Speaker, as you will recall, last week, I tabled a copy of a recent exchange with the mining company that was named Erie Diamond Mine.</seg>
<seg id="515">They will be working near Hall Beach this spring.</seg>
<seg id="516">Will the minister commit to working with the Department of Economic Development and Transportation, not just the Department of Europe, but all mining companies in the north to explore ways to promote economic development opportunities in my region or in the High Arctic?</seg>
<seg id="517">To add to that, Hall Beach is a small community and they will be able to use a lot of money, but they go through the mining companies.</seg>
<seg id="518">You also stated that you will be supporting the mining sector.</seg>
<seg id="519">My question, Mr. Speaker, is: will the department be able to manage the Mary River project properly?</seg>
<seg id="520">In the Baffin region, in the Kivalliq region, they're doing the gold.</seg>
<seg id="521">Are you going to be able to do that properly?</seg>
<seg id="522">For example, if I wanted to get a higher grade, how can I get training and how can the Department of Economic Development help me?</seg>
<seg id="523">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would also like to thank the member for posing excellent questions.</seg>
<seg id="524">There is an interdepartmental group, the Department of Education has a mining training group and it's important to recognize that mining development varies from project to project.</seg>
<seg id="525">Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="526">Oral Questions.</seg>
<seg id="527">Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="528">Question 131 - 5 (1): Support for Medical Staff (Main)</seg>
<seg id="529">Ms. Main (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="530">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Health.</seg>
<seg id="531">Let me first say that my question is directed to many communities, not just my community.</seg>
<seg id="532">I think it's all over Nunavut that we have nurses working in the health centres.</seg>
<seg id="533">Mr. Speaker, I believe that there is a lot of pressure put on the nurses, especially in the smaller communities, because there is too much work to be done.</seg>
<seg id="534">Due to the lack of staff, there are not too many positions available.</seg>
<seg id="535">It seems obvious that this is a very difficult issue.</seg>
<seg id="536">I hope I was understandable in Inuktitut.</seg>
<seg id="537">I'll speak in English. (interpretation ends) Mr. Speaker, the workload is increasing due to a lack of capacity.</seg>
<seg id="538">My question for the minister: can the minister tell the House what specific actions his department is taking to provide additional support to health care staff in communities who are already facing high rates of workload?</seg>
<seg id="539">Minister of Health, Ms. Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="540">I thank the member for that very important question.</seg>
<seg id="541">The issue of staffing at the health centre is very important and it's something that we've been working very hard on as a department to make sure that we don't have a shortage of staff at the health centre.</seg>
<seg id="542">I hope that's the case, but we're always short.</seg>
<seg id="543">I know the nurses are very patient.</seg>
<seg id="544">Our department works to the best of its ability.</seg>
<seg id="545">We just recently did that in the community, when the nurse is tired we sent out an extra nurse to provide support.</seg>
<seg id="546">If the nurse finds out that there's too much work to do, they can go to the health centre to find out.</seg>
<seg id="547">When nurses are in a situation where there's a vacation, or a sickness, or a sickness of a nurse, we look at those situations to see where we can get an escort from the community.</seg>
<seg id="548">We want to make sure that we don't reduce the number of nurses that are providing health care in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="549">Your first supplementary, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="550">Ms. Main: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="551">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="552">I think we're all concerned about the department's statistics. For example, in my community, it's evident that there are still too many vacant positions at the health centres.</seg>
<seg id="553">Of the 70 percent vacancy rate, Arviat is 44 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">I know it's a challenge.</seg>
<seg id="555">I would like to ask the minister if he could explain the challenges that his department faces in ensuring that the additional staffing levels at community health centres are met in a timely manner.</seg>
<seg id="556">Ms. Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="557">We can't retain them after 30 months, when they're trained, or when they're not up to date, or when they're not, it's very difficult to retain them.</seg>
<seg id="558">I think it's important that you look at the whole issue of how we're going to help the communities.</seg>
<seg id="559">Your final supplementary, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="560">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="561">Let me say this in another way. Mr. Speaker, we all know that there are problems in the communities. There is always a great deal of workload and a shortage of health professionals.</seg>
<seg id="562">What are the problems in the communities and what is being done? What are the concerns about the problems in the communities?</seg>
<seg id="563">What is being done to ensure that our nurses and other health care professionals are supported by the department?</seg>
<seg id="564">Hon. Patterk Angnakak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="565">To be clear, I don't have that level of detail.</seg>
<seg id="566">If we're going to have an emergency, we don't have the luxury of having an emergency where they can't make an appointment because they're overworked or they're overworked.</seg>
<seg id="567">In our department, as I said, we're trying to fill all of our positions. It's a challenge because we're competing against national competitions.</seg>
<seg id="568">That's what we're trying to do. I know that they work with people from the north who have experience, not in the north but in northern Manitoba.</seg>
<seg id="569">I know that the Department of Health is well aware of the challenges that nurses face.</seg>
<seg id="570">We try to provide as much assistance as we can. It's not that easy to fix it right away, but we have to keep working on it.</seg>
<seg id="571">Question 132 - 5 (1): Insurance Policy for Government Equipment (Hickes)</seg>
<seg id="572">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="573">My questions are for the Minister of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="574">Mr. Speaker, as we all know, in all Nunavut communities, there are different types of infrastructure, such as airports, health centres, schools, and offices.</seg>
<seg id="575">My question to the minister is: when it comes to contingency plans, is the infrastructure at uniform or is it on a case-by-case basis?</seg>
<seg id="576">Minister of Finance, Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="577">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Our contingency plans are broken down into different components depending on the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="578">Each of our infrastructure has different policies and some don't even have policies. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="579">I recently saw on the news that one of the schools in our community was burned down.</seg>
<seg id="580">The Department of Finance is trying to find a way to ensure that the infrastructure is adequately insured. We have also learned that the cost of doing business in Arctic Bay is $10 million.</seg>
<seg id="581">How will it affect the Workers' Compensation Board if there is another fire in the school? (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="582">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Today, the insurance coverage has increased from $10 million to $20 million.</seg>
<seg id="583">We continue to encourage the Department of Education and all of us to continue to lobby the federal government to continue to address the high cost of fires and unfortunately, the high cost of fire.</seg>
<seg id="584">I think we all have to try and demonstrate that we have a better way of doing business. We have to show that the cost of doing business is increasing and that we have our own insurance premiums now. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="585">I can understand how frightened I feel when it comes to municipal insurance coverage.</seg>
<seg id="586">I had a question.</seg>
<seg id="587">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="588">The new budget includes $20 million for school fires.</seg>
<seg id="589">Schools and other facilities have to pay up to $1 million.</seg>
<seg id="590">There is a difference.</seg>
<seg id="591">I can't say how many schools would have to burn, they don't have insurance.</seg>
<seg id="592">I hope that we don't have fires in this government, and I appreciate that we have to keep lobbying all Members of the Legislative Assembly because this is a school for our children and the public...</seg>
<seg id="593">It's not just for the schools, it's also for health centres because these are very important services that we provide.</seg>
<seg id="594">Any damage is a challenge to our clients and I will continue to push for these facilities.</seg>
<seg id="595">That's a reminder.</seg>
<seg id="596">It's a public building. It's for all the students and the public. It's for schools, health centres, and garages.</seg>
<seg id="597">Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="598">Question 133 - 5 (1): Increase in Education Opportunities in Baker Lake (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="599">My questions are for the Minister responsible for Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="600">Mr. Speaker, in his Member's Statement, he talked about the fact that as a fifth Legislative Assembly of Nunavut, we have the opportunity to make a new contribution to our territory in a brighter future.</seg>
<seg id="601">Can the minister tell the House if he would be willing to reopen the idea of establishing a university in your community with the private sector and other partners?</seg>
<seg id="602">Minister responsible for Nunavut Arctic College, Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="603">I thank the member from Baker Lake for that question.</seg>
<seg id="604">With respect to Nunavut Arctic College, we advertised various post-secondary institutions outside of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="605">We have heard about various organizations, such as Agnico-Eagle, who have established a university for Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="606">We have asked for this to proceed, but to date, we have negotiated an agreement with a third party from Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's very important that we provide funding for educational expansions from Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit to Piqqusilirivvik programs.</seg>
<seg id="608">I feel that Baker Lake would be a great place to expand.</seg>
<seg id="609">Can the minister clarify whether he and his officials have spoken to the Board of Governors of Nunavut Arctic College to envision ways of providing post-secondary education opportunities to Nunavummiut?</seg>
<seg id="610">Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="611">Nunavut Arctic College would like to see more opportunities for Nunavut Arctic College students to attend post-secondary institutions in their communities. We are aware that there are opportunities for online learning.</seg>
<seg id="612">Further, with respect to the member's comment about the Piqqusilirivvik Cultural School and how it can be expanded further, we are looking at that.</seg>
<seg id="613">Yes, the Nunavut Arctic College Board of Governors will be involved, along with my officials at Nunavut Arctic College, the president, and the vice-president. They will be planning on moving forward with this.</seg>
<seg id="614">Your final supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="615">Mr. Mikkungwak: Mr. Speaker, I recognize that the previous government accepted the recommendation that Nunavut Arctic College not be created at this time.</seg>
<seg id="616">Will the minister commit to getting back to me and reporting back to the House on his findings?</seg>
<seg id="617">Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="618">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thank Mr. Mikkungwak for the question.</seg>
<seg id="619">The option to build a university in Nunavut is a multi-purpose concept.</seg>
<seg id="620">Agnico-Eagle has also committed $5 million to a new university if there is an interest in it.</seg>
<seg id="621">I think the discussions are ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="622">In the next four years, I don't know if we're going to be able to go through that process.</seg>
<seg id="623">Members, please note that the time for question period has expired.</seg>
<seg id="624">Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="625">Motion 015 - 5 (1): Extension of Question Period (Mike)</seg>
<seg id="626">Ms. Main (interpretation): Pursuant to Rule 39 (7), I move, seconded by the Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, that question period be extended.</seg>
<seg id="627">The motion is in order and the motion is not debatable.</seg>
<seg id="628">All those in favour of the motion.</seg>
<seg id="629">All those opposed.</seg>
<seg id="630">We have extended the time for question period by 30 minutes starting from now.</seg>
<seg id="631">Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="632">Question 134 - 5 (1): Grants and Contributions (Mike)</seg>
<seg id="633">Ms. Main (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="634">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Environment.</seg>
<seg id="635">I rise today to ask the Department of Environment about the Harvester Support Program.</seg>
<seg id="636">In reviewing the government's main estimates for 2017-18, there are three categories.</seg>
<seg id="637">I'll speak in English so that I can make myself clear.</seg>
<seg id="638">The department has been allocated $150,000 for this year.</seg>
<seg id="639">Mr. Speaker, I would first like to ask if the minister can clarify how his department measures and evaluates the effectiveness of its operations.</seg>
<seg id="640">Minister of Environment, Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="641">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="642">That's three times a year and we're hoping that we will have good competition right now in the beginning of March. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="643">Your first supplementary, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="644">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="645">Mr. Speaker, the information that has been provided to the Members of the Legislative Assembly over the years, I really wanted to see it and I think it's important for the hunters as well.</seg>
<seg id="646">In 2011, the Department of Environment stated that the average price for sealskins was $800,000.</seg>
<seg id="647">In 2012, it was $1.1 million and in 2013, it was $1.04 million.</seg>
<seg id="648">Mr. Speaker, can the minister provide me with an update on the sale of sealskins this year and provide me with an update on the status of this year's sales? I would like to know if there is an update on this year's sales or if there is an update on the status of this program.</seg>
<seg id="649">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="650">I can't say where they are at right now because I don't have the latest bids.</seg>
<seg id="651">What I can tell you is that the Aqsarniit Middle East fur sales tend to go up and that's probably going to be the case and we will see the results of the auction. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="652">Your final supplementary, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="653">I also thank the minister.</seg>
<seg id="654">This will be my last question, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="655">The Department of Environment is looking at ways to provide more funding to the hunters so that they can provide more support.</seg>
<seg id="656">We know about the fox pelts as Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="657">I believe the funding that is used for one year is too small, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="658">I thought it was too small.</seg>
<seg id="659">I would like to ask the minister if he agrees with me and if he can look into this over the coming months.</seg>
<seg id="660">I agree with you, and I look forward to bringing forward an increase in the amounts if you support it.</seg>
<seg id="661">Question 135 - 5 (1): Compensation for Hunters and Trappers (Keyootak)</seg>
<seg id="662">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Environment.</seg>
<seg id="663">Mr. Speaker, as we are all aware in Nunavut, hunters are damaged by polar bears and their cabins are damaged by damage.</seg>
<seg id="664">Mr. Speaker, there is a compensation program for damages. However, it is very difficult to replace the damaged equipment.</seg>
<seg id="665">I'm wondering if the funding for compensation for damaged equipment has been depleted this year.</seg>
<seg id="666">Minister of Environment, Ms. Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="667">I'm sorry I didn't hear everybody.</seg>
<seg id="668">Can he repeat his question?</seg>
<seg id="669">Speaker (interpretation): Please repeat your first question, Mr. Keyootak.</seg>
<seg id="670">Our equipment, snowmobiles, and cabins are damaged by polar bears, especially when we are away.</seg>
<seg id="671">Mr. Speaker, as we all know, there are compensation packages that are in place to compensate individuals for damages that occur during the course of the year.</seg>
<seg id="672">My question was: have these materials that were damaged this year have been used?</seg>
<seg id="673">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you for the clarification.</seg>
<seg id="674">Minister of Environment, Ms. Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="675">Your first supplementary, Mr. Keyootak.</seg>
<seg id="676">The minister said he would get back to me with that information.</seg>
<seg id="677">Can the minister indicate how much has been spent in the Baffin, Kivalliq, and Kitikmeot regions?</seg>
<seg id="678">Yes, I will provide that to the member.</seg>
<seg id="679">Question 136 - 5 (1): Child Care and Early Childhood Services (Hickes)</seg>
<seg id="680">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Education.</seg>
<seg id="681">The Minister of Education stated this afternoon that all licensed daycares will be able to receive additional space based on their location.</seg>
<seg id="682">How many licensed daycares are they looking at?</seg>
<seg id="683">Minister responsible for the Nunavut Housing Corporation, Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="684">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="685">I thank Mr. Hickes for the question.</seg>
<seg id="686">The Department of Education's Executive Committee approved a P3 Agreement for a three-year term. Over the past three years, it has been split into four categories.</seg>
<seg id="687">I would like you to clarify what the amount is, the O&amp;M total is $1.1 million per year, that's broken down by that year.</seg>
<seg id="688">Those are the numbers that I have.</seg>
<seg id="689">I thank the minister for that explanation.</seg>
<seg id="690">Mr. Speaker, when I look at the Child Care Regulations in Nunavut, it's written in the preschool section, section 17, which deals with staffing and so on. All staff working on the day-to-day operations of the child care system need professional training.</seg>
<seg id="691">Mr. Speaker, I know that the Department of Education is responsible for Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="692">Is there an evaluation process that's followed to ensure that the training is up to par?</seg>
<seg id="693">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="694">Training is part of an agreement for a three-year term.</seg>
<seg id="695">It's just outside the $1.1 million.</seg>
<seg id="696">We want to get more certified teachers who can teach at the daycare.</seg>
<seg id="697">That's one of the things that we're looking at expanding on with the training of apprentices over the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="698">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="699">I look forward to continuing to provide that information to the House.</seg>
<seg id="700">When I look at the early childhood staff and the training that's provided to them, I always hear that when the staff is being trained, it seems like they're more effective.</seg>
<seg id="701">Mr. Speaker, I have also heard concerns that there is a lack of wages for childcare workers who are often working at the daycare.</seg>
<seg id="702">While the consistency of early childhood education programs is important to maintaining stability in the workplace, it is also important to ensure that the right conditions are met.</seg>
<seg id="703">The purpose of this funding is to help day cares provide employees with better wages so that they can continue to work there and not work there.</seg>
<seg id="704">I totally agree with Mr. Hickes. I understand and agree with him wholeheartedly that we want to make sure that our kids are ready to learn and succeed in life before they enter the school system.</seg>
<seg id="705">That's what we're trying to do. We're trying to support the daycare workers.</seg>
<seg id="706">Part of the agreement is that as long as the parents don't increase the cost of providing daycare services, I think we can do something to ensure that the staff at the daycares are getting the best value for their money.</seg>
<seg id="707">At this time, we're still working on it to make sure that we have daycare operators throughout Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="708">Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="709">Question 137 - 5 (1): Inuit Labour Requirements for Government Contracts (Mine)</seg>
<seg id="710">On Friday, March 16, I asked the Minister of Community and Government Services a question regarding this issue.</seg>
<seg id="711">There are more Inuit working within the government and there are more Inuit working within the government.</seg>
<seg id="712">Mr. Speaker, the minister seemed to agree that he was in support of increasing Inuit employment numbers.</seg>
<seg id="713">The 20 percent is included in the capital estimates for the Baffin Correctional Centre and ports in Iqaluit and Pond Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="714">If I understand the question correctly, the numbers are 20 percent and 15 percent.</seg>
<seg id="715">Can the minister explain how we can change the RFP process to increase the number of companies that bid on the contract?</seg>
<seg id="716">Minister responsible for Community and Government Services, Minister Kusugak.</seg>
<seg id="717">I think the member understands that when it's done through Community and Government Services, they help the department.</seg>
<seg id="718">If we're talking about a correctional facility, it would be the Department of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="719">Those are the types of things that we work with. We work with the contractors to make sure that the contracts are adhered to.</seg>
<seg id="720">We work with the client departments to see how many Inuit employees there are.</seg>
<seg id="721">We work with the departments to make sure that they're not over-committing.</seg>
<seg id="722">I can't state at this time that after the tenders have been let, they will be tendered out and I believe that it's impossible to change them at this time, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="723">Let me ask this question.</seg>
<seg id="724">If there is no change to the contract, what about the other services that would be provided to Inuit?</seg>
<seg id="725">Can the Department of Community and Government Services work on this?</seg>
<seg id="726">I hope I was understandable, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="727">Can the minister tell me then, perhaps, tell the House what the issue is when employees from other communities want to work in construction projects, do employees from Nunavut get the same benefits as employees from outside of Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="728">Hon. Lorne Kusugak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="729">I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="730">Mr. Speaker, the Nunavummi Nangminiqaqtunik Ikajuuti (NNNI) Contracting Policy provides for the establishment of an evaluation framework for the evaluation of factors, including Inuit labour content. It establishes the criteria:</seg>
<seg id="731">the scope of work;</seg>
<seg id="732">Eligibility for Inuit labour force training;</seg>
<seg id="733">There are also other community programs that can affect Inuit employment opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="734">Mr. Speaker, we encourage contractors in the communities to hire locally from the regional centres before they go out for recruitment.</seg>
<seg id="735">We do encourage people coming into Nunavut to apply for those positions.</seg>
<seg id="736">We do encourage that.</seg>
<seg id="737">Again, we work very closely with our client departments to make sure that they're meeting the targets.</seg>
<seg id="738">Your first supplementary, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="739">Ms. Main (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="740">For my final question, I would like to ask the minister to commit to working with his department to ensure that the larger construction projects are undertaken in the future.</seg>
<seg id="741">Will the minister commit to working with the service providers in that department to ensure that job opportunities are created and that people can apply for jobs when they're building houses from outside of the regions?</seg>
<seg id="742">Will the minister commit to doing this again so that Nunavummiut can be considered for bids on contracts?</seg>
<seg id="743">Mr. Speaker, I believe that the Government of Nunavut as a whole encourages the people out there in the communities to find work for the people of Nunavut first.</seg>
<seg id="744">That's the way it has always been.</seg>

<seg id="780">In Committee of the Whole, we have the following items to deal with: Bills 2, 3, and 4.</seg>
<seg id="781">Ms. Main.</seg>
<seg id="782">Ms. May: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="783">We are now reviewing Bill 2, followed by Bill 3 and the supporting documents.</seg>

<seg id="787">Bill 02 - Interim Appropriation (Operations &amp; Maintenance) Act, April 1, 2018 - June 30, 2018 - Consideration in Committee</seg>
<seg id="788">Bill 2 is in your legislation binder.</seg>
<seg id="789">We will move on. Mr. Akeeagok, do you have witnesses that you would like to bring to the table?</seg>
<seg id="790">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="791">Chairman (interpretation): Does the committee agree to bring in the witnesses?</seg>
<seg id="792">Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the witnesses in.</seg>
<seg id="793">Mr. Akeeagok, for the record, please introduce your witnesses.</seg>
<seg id="794">On my left is my Assistant Deputy Minister, Dan Carleon.</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am here to present Bill 2, Supplementary Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, No. 2018-2019.</seg>
<seg id="796">This bill makes supplementary appropriations for the Government of Nunavut to defray the operations and maintenance expenses of $491,804,000 for the fiscal year April 1, 2018 and June 30, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="797">Mr. Chairman, over the course of this fiscal year, the Minister of Finance has been here for the whole fiscal year, but as MLAs, we are in the fifth assembly.</seg>
<seg id="798">For 2018-19 fiscal year, we will be doing the planning for 2018-19 fiscal year. We will be putting it in Cape Dorset during the spring session in May and June.</seg>
<seg id="799">To that end, Mr. Chairman, in the interim appropriation, the department will be able to fulfill its mandate to provide services to Nunavummiut over the coming months.</seg>
<seg id="800">The issue of attendance is about putting money aside for this year's election.</seg>
<seg id="801">Mr. Chairman, all departments and territorial corporations have had an opportunity to review these interim appropriations. Our ranking system is based on departmental spending and budget processes over the past four years.</seg>
<seg id="802">We are satisfied that this amount will be sufficient to support the operations of the Legislative Assembly's review and passage of the annual budget.</seg>
<seg id="803">The major components of the Act are:</seg>
<seg id="804">$8.62 million for the Office of the Legislative Assembly;</seg>
<seg id="805">$11.66 million for the Public Service;</seg>
<seg id="806">$29.08 million for the Department of Finance;</seg>
<seg id="807">$49.1 million for the Department of Family Services;</seg>
<seg id="808">$32.44 million for the Department of Justice;</seg>
<seg id="809">$10.77 million for the Department of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth;</seg>
<seg id="810">$64.1 million for the Department of Education;</seg>
<seg id="811">$85.77 million for the Department of Health and Social Services' Old Office Building;</seg>
<seg id="812">$8.32 million to the Department of Environment for office space;</seg>
<seg id="813">$82.73 million for the Department of Community and Government Services' old office buildings;</seg>
<seg id="814">$23.29 million for the Department of Economic Development and Transportation's office building;</seg>
<seg id="815">$73.39 million for the Nunavut Housing Corporation; and</seg>
<seg id="816">$12.54 million for Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="817">Mr. Chairman, this concludes my opening comments.</seg>
<seg id="818">At this time, we are open to any questions or comments.</seg>
<seg id="819">Do members have any general comments?</seg>
<seg id="820">Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="821">Mr. Towtongie: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="822">I was reading the Inuktitut version. $32.44 million for the Department of Justice to provide the Inuktitut version of the bill.</seg>
<seg id="823">There is a difference in the Inuktitut version of the $8.62 million. In Inuktitut, it's $8.62 million for the Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="824">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): For clarification, the Office of the Legislative Assembly is requesting $8.62 million and the Department of Justice is seeking $32.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="825">I apologize if it's not translated properly.</seg>
<seg id="826">The English version is correct.</seg>
<seg id="827">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="828">Just a question in regard to the interim appropriations, we're not talking about percentages, but we're talking about the past expenditures and then general elections.</seg>
<seg id="829">I know that we did a lot of consultations on the financial controls, but the minister has indicated that there are some real changes that need to be made to ensure that we have the right institutions to provide the services that they're mandated to provide to Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="830">Mr. Chairman, it's not directly related to this bill.</seg>
<seg id="831">I'm just wondering if there have been any changes to the way that the funding is allocated to the municipalities in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="832">Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="833">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="834">To date, there have been no changes to the O&amp;M, but I'm sure that we will be seeing some changes in the capital estimates in the fall. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="835">Are there any more general comments?</seg>
<seg id="836">I suggest to members that wherever possible you ask your detailed questions during the page-by-page review of the departmental estimates.</seg>
<seg id="837">If not we'll continue with the clause by clause review.</seg>
<seg id="838">Go to Bill 2 in your white legislation binder.</seg>
<seg id="839">Bill 2, Interim Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="840">Chairman: Clause 2. Do you agree?</seg>
<seg id="841">Chairman (interpretation): Go to Schedule on page 2.</seg>
<seg id="842">Vote 1: Operations and Maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="843">Mr. Main, do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="844">Ms. May: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="845">I think I should have brought this up earlier, but I do have a question on departmental grants and contributions.</seg>
<seg id="846">It's my understanding that the numbers are based on the percentage of the total year, but some of the grants and contributions have been used in the past and that's going to be used for the full year as soon as April 1 comes around.</seg>
<seg id="847">I just want to get some clarification on the grants and contributions. Is it the economic development officer or is it the Nunavut Housing Corporation that's responsible for administering that program? I know it's not for an entire year, but some of the programs are done annually.</seg>
<seg id="848">Chairman: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="849">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): That's a very good question.</seg>
<seg id="850">Under the allocation of funding, as I mentioned in my opening comments, the last quarter, when you look at the department's budget, some are for the first three months of the year for grants and contributions.</seg>
<seg id="851">I can say that Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation are one of the largest departments. As you can see, the grants and contributions are for operations.</seg>
<seg id="852">If they have to go through an application process, the department has a variety of processes, and in the last four years, all the departments' gambling cycles are reviewed quarterly by the Department of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="853">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="854">I guess my follow-up question to that is: can the minister indicate if there are any projects that have been delayed or are they just going to go through the normal process?</seg>
<seg id="855">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="856">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) The department is operating the same way.</seg>
<seg id="857">Hopefully tomorrow, we will be able to see some of the work that we have to do in the future with the budget. We were able to put that in place in the Fifth Assembly with the direction from the department and the ministers. The next three months will be the same.</seg>
<seg id="858">Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="859">I'm sorry. Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="860">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="861">In the main estimates, there's $491,804,000 above that.</seg>
<seg id="862">For example, in the bill, it states that $8,623,000 will be used. The minister stated that $8,623,000 will be used.</seg>
<seg id="863">The $3,000 has not changed and the total amount seems to be $54,000.</seg>
<seg id="864">Why is that?</seg>
<seg id="865">I would like clarification on that.</seg>
<seg id="866">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="867">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="868">The bill has three pages of Inuktitut and we're trying to get the actual numbers approved.</seg>
<seg id="869">Those are the actual numbers.</seg>
<seg id="870">As I stated in my Minister's Statement, I have only reduced the numbers in English to the actual figures. We try to keep it as close to the actual figures as possible.</seg>
<seg id="871">When we look at the numbers that are in the bill, they're not always correct.</seg>
<seg id="872">Total Branch. Not Previously Authorized. $491,804,000. Do you agree?</seg>
<seg id="873">Clause 5. Do you agree?</seg>
<seg id="874">Chairman: Do you agree to Bill 2 as a whole?</seg>
<seg id="875">Do you agree that pursuant to Rule 62 (2) that Bill 2 can immediately be placed on the orders of the day for third reading?</seg>
<seg id="876">Minister Akeeagok, do you have closing remarks?</seg>
<seg id="877">Hon. David Akeeagok: Mr. Chairman, I just want to thank my staff for preparing this so that the government can have this operation by June.</seg>
<seg id="878">Thank you very much to all the members for helping us to approve this budget, and I look forward to sitting in this House for the rest of our budget session in May and June.</seg>
<seg id="879">Thank you all.</seg>
<seg id="880">Bill 2 is completed.</seg>
<seg id="881">I would now like to ask the minister if he has any opening comments on Bill 3.</seg>
<seg id="882">Bill 03 - Supplementary Appropriation (Operations &amp; Maintenance) Act, No. 3, 2017-2018 - Consideration in Committee</seg>
<seg id="883">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="884">I will keep my officials here. I would like them to know that as soon as we go to the other departments, I will be able to ask them to come in.</seg>
<seg id="885">Mr. Chairman, can I begin with my opening comments?</seg>
<seg id="886">I am here to present Bill 3, Supplementary Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, No. 3, 2017-2018. Through this bill, the government is seeking to increase the maximum contribution of $56,602,000 for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="887">$49 million to the Department of Health to cover over-expenditures in medical travel, mental health, rehabilitation, elder care, medical care, and tuberculosis programs;</seg>
<seg id="888">$6.2 million to the Department of Justice to cover a budget shortfall in the policing, corrections and court services; and</seg>
<seg id="889">$1,402,000 in over-expenditures for the Children, Family Services and Banking Services Branch.</seg>
<seg id="890">Mr. Chairman, that concludes my opening comments. I look forward to responding to any questions or comments that members may have.</seg>
<seg id="891">Do members have any general comments?</seg>
<seg id="892">Supplementary Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) 2017-18, No. 3. Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="893">Total Children and Family Services. $1,402,000.</seg>
<seg id="894">I just saw the substantiation sheets and it still doesn't really give me a good picture of where you're facing more than that.</seg>
<seg id="895">Hon. Joe Savikataaq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="896">Hon. David Savikataaq: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="897">I don't have the breakdown of how many we have right now, but there are two main categories where we send more children out of the territory for residential care.</seg>
<seg id="898">For example, there's an elder in Igloolik, I don't know if it's in Gjoa Haven or not, and he got a ticket from Ottawa so that he could go and visit the community.</seg>
<seg id="899">It's not just the family services department that gets visited.</seg>
<seg id="900">The majority of our elders are sent outside of Nunavut to receive care and treatment in Nunavut. As I said earlier, we do have more elders visiting the communities.</seg>
<seg id="901">With the integration of all the elders' programs and services, the responsibility for seniors and elders was transferred back to the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="902">Although the minister mentioned some of them, they're not really under Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="903">Some of them are in the care of Health and Social Services and some of them are elders who are in the care of Health and Social Services, so if they want to visit some of these communities, there is funding available through Family Services for travel.</seg>
<seg id="904">That's one of the examples I used. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="905">I understand that some of the clients have to be visited because the money is transferred to Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="906">I am asking if there are still elders who are receiving social assistance that have not been transferred over to the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="907">Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="908">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation) According to the information that I have, the positions that were supposed to be transferred to the Department of Health have been transferred.</seg>
<seg id="909">The non-decentralized communities are still managed by the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="910">I'm just wondering if there are any other programs that haven't been transferred over to Family Services yet. Looking at the substantiation sheets and the business plan, I think all of them have been transferred. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="911">Maybe I'm confused, but if the Minister of Family Services could clarify that for me, I would appreciate it.</seg>
<seg id="912">It's up to Minister Akeeagok if he wants a different answer.</seg>
<seg id="913">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="914">I thought the question was: do we still have people in the Department of Health and Social Services?</seg>
<seg id="915">My response was that it's under the Department of Health right now and the seniors' program is there.</seg>
<seg id="916">We are still on Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="917">The purpose of the supplementary appropriation is for the Department of Family Services to figure out what was overspent. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="918">I thank the minister for that clarification.</seg>
<seg id="919">I understand a little better now.</seg>
<seg id="920">Maybe I'll rephrase my question to make it clearer.</seg>
<seg id="921">Does the Department of Family Services still care for elders?</seg>
<seg id="922">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Yes, we still have programs for elders and I would like the Minister of Family Services to clarify that.</seg>
<seg id="923">Mr. Speaker, I am aware that the government's programs, the Senior Fuel Subsidy Program, the Senior Fuel Subsidy Program, the Senior Fuel Subsidy Program, the Senior Fuel Subsidy Program, the Senior Fuel Subsidy Program, and the Department of Family Services may have over 60 years of age that it is administered by the Senior Fuel Subsidy Program.</seg>
<seg id="924">If I missed anything, Minister Savikataaq can help me to respond to the question. (interpretation ends) Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="925">I thank the minister and his officials for clarifying that.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my last question.</seg>
<seg id="927">When people are sent outside of Nunavut, are they still eligible for income support?</seg>
<seg id="928">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Through you, Mr. Chairman, I would like to have Minister Savikataaq respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="929">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="930">There are different circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="931">In some cases, it's the same thing for income support, but I can't guarantee that for every single one of them.</seg>
<seg id="932">I have detailed questions on this page.</seg>
<seg id="933">It indicates that they will be issuing surpluses from other departments.</seg>
<seg id="934">That's the way it is right now. Do the other departments that are in here support all of Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="935">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="936">Most of that was transferred to the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="937">It's not that much of a subsidy. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="938">I thank the minister for that answer.</seg>
<seg id="939">When do you identify that they may be in a deficit position and how do you deal with that deficit?</seg>
<seg id="940">I'm not sure if that affects our meeting, but Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="941">The department provides reports on a monthly basis and at the end of the fiscal year, it's a little overdue to ensure that the department's overspending is re-profiled. If that's not possible, then we have to go through a supplementary appropriation.</seg>
<seg id="942">We're on page 4.</seg>
<seg id="943">Ms. Main.</seg>
<seg id="944">The document that we have before us indicates that residential care is based on population growth. The total number of children in residential care was 189.</seg>
<seg id="945">Are you anticipating that this number will continue to increase?</seg>
<seg id="946">What is the increase for?</seg>
<seg id="947">Do you have an idea of what the reason is for the increasing number of people needing care?</seg>
<seg id="948">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) This is an increase from 2013. The number of clients has increased and we're following that growth.</seg>
<seg id="949">So I'm just wondering if that's something that's been changing over the last number of years. Will that be included in this budget, as soon as possible, from this current year's budget? I don't want to be asking for a supplementary appropriation to be approved so that we can have accurate numbers in the budget.</seg>
<seg id="950">Is that going to be included in there?</seg>
<seg id="951">Maybe if we go through each page of the business plan, it's going to be obvious that we're going to have to talk about some of the changes that we're making. If we're not keeping up with the budget, we will certainly look at the budget.</seg>
<seg id="952">We will have questions when we get to the main estimates. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="953">In the document that was provided to us, it says that there is an internal surplus.</seg>
<seg id="954">It also makes reference to the department's recent restructuring of the Income Support Program.</seg>
<seg id="955">I'm just wondering if the minister can indicate if any of the surplus tags that were used to fill the positions at the income support office, were they used to fill the positions at the income support office or were more funds going to go to income support?</seg>
<seg id="956">Which increase did you increase it to?</seg>
<seg id="957">I'm trying to understand where the surplus went, where did it go?</seg>
<seg id="958">I'm just wondering: in terms of the Income Support Program, is that paperwork being paid back or is that an increase to the Income Support Program?</seg>
<seg id="959">Chairman: Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="960">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="961">Some of these individuals were hired to work as managers for the transfer of responsibilities from one department to another.</seg>
<seg id="962">The government's response to the member's question was in regard to the residential care program.</seg>
<seg id="963">There are a number of factors that contribute to how the Department of Family Services has been able to meet its budget shortfall for this fiscal year. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="964">I will be there.</seg>
<seg id="965">Information provided by the department indicates that it is, and I quote, ..."working with the department to maximize and maximize the amount of money that is budgeted for income support," and that this document says, ..."provides more money for income support."</seg>
<seg id="966">Will the money that is being requested for staff housing be used for income support?</seg>
<seg id="967">My colleague, Mr. Savikataaq, can respond to that question better.</seg>
<seg id="968">Mr. Savikataaq, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="969">The Income Support Program has had an impact on the Income Support Program.</seg>
<seg id="970">The National Child Benefit Supplement was calculated based on income and income.</seg>
<seg id="971">If the income support recipients get deducted from their income support, that's not going to be the case now. The more people are on income support, the more people are on income support, the more people are on income support.</seg>
<seg id="972">We're on Total Children and Family Services.</seg>

<seg id="979">What it states here is that it's for the purchase of new drugs. Is there any plan to change the legislation to the federal government this coming summer?</seg>
<seg id="980">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Like you, Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask the Deputy Minister of Justice to go to the witness table and remove my deputy minister.</seg>
<seg id="981">Does the committee agree to bring in the witnesses?</seg>
<seg id="982">Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the witnesses out.</seg>

<seg id="985">With your permission, I would like to respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="986">Mr. Chairman, that's a very good question.</seg>
<seg id="987">This is not for smoking.</seg>
<seg id="988">We want to make sure that the drugs that are prescribed in Canada are not coming to Nunavut because these are new drugs that we have to take a look at and implement.</seg>
<seg id="989">In December, during the Finance Ministers' Meeting, the funding that's going to be provided by the federal government will be 25 percent of the funding that's going to be provided to the RCMP for the assessment of drugs.</seg>
<seg id="990">There are two parts to this.</seg>
<seg id="991">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="992">Another question I have here is in regard to the high cost of housing in the communities.</seg>
<seg id="993">I'm just wondering if the minister could explain why that's in there.</seg>
<seg id="994">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Minister Netser.</seg>
<seg id="995">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation) It's in relation to that. The RCMP received nine more officers in various communities and that's why they provide staff housing.</seg>
<seg id="996">When there's an additional RCMP member, we have to get them through the government contract to get housing. The additional cost of that is $300,000. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="997">Mr. Main, did you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="998">Ms. May: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="999">The minister mentioned that there's $2.6 million broken down by $300,000 for housing.</seg>
<seg id="1000">Can you break that down in more detail?</seg>
<seg id="1001">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1002">I'll ask my officials.</seg>
<seg id="1003">Those are the numbers.</seg>
<seg id="1004">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1005">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="1006">Why didn't you expect to purchase these vehicles?</seg>
<seg id="1007">I believe it was supposed to be included in the budget.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Was this the reason for the purchase of new vehicles?</seg>
<seg id="1009">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. That's a very good question.</seg>
<seg id="1010">That $1 million is for vehicle replacement.</seg>
<seg id="1011">We do have a contract with the RCMP to provide the equipment that is needed at the community level.</seg>
<seg id="1012">He had indicated last year that the vehicles weren't replaced due to lack of funding.</seg>
<seg id="1013">However, this year, we had to deal with the vehicles that were broken down due to the fact that they had to purchase their vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1014">That's why it has gone up so much this year.</seg>
<seg id="1015">However, their equipment is still deteriorating.</seg>
<seg id="1016">Under the contract with the RCMP, we try to prevent each other from buying their own shares.</seg>
<seg id="1017">In talking with our partners here, they seem to come to an agreement and that's how it has gone up.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Ms. Main (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1019">As per my colleague's statement, this is an issue we have to resolve.</seg>
<seg id="1020">These substances are listed as new drugs, with the most dangerous substances listed.</seg>
<seg id="1021">Will the equipment be made available to the communities or just some of them?</seg>
<seg id="1022">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Yes, all RCMP officers will receive this equipment for all communities.</seg>
<seg id="1023">Those are the new positions that we're working on for the RCMP and for the public that may be in that situation. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1024">With respect to drugs that are considered to be the most dangerous substances, when they're starting to find tea in our communities, is there a plan in place to deal with them? If there was no discovery in the community, which communities have you found?</seg>
<seg id="1025">The people who are arriving into our communities are not very pleased and I hope they stop.</seg>
<seg id="1026">However, we now have two impacted communities and most of the materials coming in from Canada are now in the Northwest Territories.</seg>
<seg id="1027">It's very dangerous and I'm very scared of the people who will be trying to get into drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1028">It would be better if you didn't deal with it, but it's a dangerous situation and I'm very pleased that the RCMP is making plans.</seg>
<seg id="1029">Ms. May: I thought we were done.</seg>
<seg id="1030">That's my last question.</seg>
<seg id="1031">In here, it talks about the lack of housing in Nunavut communities.</seg>
<seg id="1032">Within the document that we have provided, there are nine additional RCMP Officers. There are nine or six communities in Nunavut that have been decentralized to the communities.</seg>
<seg id="1033">That was just a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1034">Moving on, Mr. Hickes, do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the $2.6 million that you're requesting, it talks about the court circuits where seven judges were sentenced. Did you also require an interpreter?</seg>
<seg id="1036">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) At this time, no, (interpretation) there are a number of interpreter/translators at this time.</seg>
<seg id="1037">I'll just leave that alone for now. In his opening comments, he talks about the need to purchase new phones and the need to keep these aging telephones going.</seg>
<seg id="1038">In light of the fact that they're going to have to replace the existing phone system, will there be any money set aside for the new system or will there be additional funding requested once they know the number?</seg>
<seg id="1039">It's in the planning stages for the department. The funding that we requested is in the planning stages.</seg>
<seg id="1040">The Minister of Finance's business plan indicates that one of the things that the Minister of Finance wanted to do was to have the government's Public Service Act implemented, and the RCMP's business plan indicates that the Tobacco Control Act was passed. As my colleague has indicated, it's for driver's testing and that's in the planning stages, but there's nothing in the supplemental budget for smoking. (interpretation) Thank you</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the other correctional facilities, it talks about overtime and there is a full-time staff member at the Baffin Correctional Centre. What is the average day to day staffing at the Baffin Correctional Centre?</seg>
<seg id="1042">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1043">Is that eight?</seg>
<seg id="1044">Mr. Hickes (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to direct my question to the minister. The information provided by the overtime report indicates that the Baffin Correctional Centre's cost is $180,000. Is that correct?</seg>
<seg id="1045">Can the minister clarify that for me?</seg>
<seg id="1046">Through you, I would like to have Deputy Minister MacKay respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1047">Mr. McKay: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1048">The nurse in charge, the supervisor, and the supervisor have a lot of other staff who work there. If there is a weather, they have to stay there.</seg>
<seg id="1049">If there's a blizzard, they can't go home, so the employee just said that they're going to be back to work. Does that mean there's only two employees coming in during the blizzard?</seg>
<seg id="1050">Mr. MacKay, can you clarify that, please.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Yes, there are now two employees. If it's a blizzard, they're not supposed to come in right away.</seg>
<seg id="1052">Mr. Lysytheon.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Mr. Lysytheon: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1054">My questions are for the Minister of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1055">When you get an RCMP Officer do you provide housing separately?</seg>
<seg id="1056">I am happy to say that one of my staff members, who was playing hockey, got tired of the other staff member, but I'm sure that it's going to be okay, but my deputy minister can't write it down.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You have to have a wheelchair.</seg>
<seg id="1058">My question is in regard to the nine RCMP officers that are receiving federal housing.</seg>
<seg id="1059">As I stated earlier, we work with the RCMP through contract.</seg>
<seg id="1060">I just want to clarify for the committee members that 70 percent of the RCMP cost is paid by the Government of Nunavut and 30 percent is paid by the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="1061">The RCMP is contracted out to the federal government. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1062">Mr. Lysytheon: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1063">I just wondered whether the RCMP will be providing housing for all the RCMP officers.</seg>
<seg id="1064">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) When the RCMP detachment assigns an employee to a community, they are in the community.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They don't always have one RCMP officer on the land to go camping.</seg>
<seg id="1066">They don't think they're going to get their own housing.</seg>
<seg id="1067">The RCMP operates differently.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When a community identifies that they need a new RCMP member, they try to allocate housing for all 25 communities. (interpretation) Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1069">It's unfortunate that the RCMP doesn't try to get the community involved.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Once the RCMP gets their own homes, how do they get subsidized?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1072">I don't think it's appropriate to ask questions in this House.</seg>
<seg id="1073">I don't think we should expect them to own their own homes, but they are provided with housing.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Mr. Akeeagok, it's up to you.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1076">Very good comments, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Although the RCMP only stays in the community for three years, they are also involved in the community raising.</seg>
<seg id="1078">If the RCMP requests a unit from the federal government, then they have to apply for a home.</seg>
<seg id="1079">It's not through our department, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1080">My final question is: how much is this contract for the RCMP?</seg>
<seg id="1081">Bill 5. $40,071,000.</seg>
<seg id="1082">If the contract is approved, it will be $42,671,000 for 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1083">Thank you for that clarification.</seg>
<seg id="1084">Thirdly, corrections officers' overtime and casual employment.</seg>
<seg id="1085">Chairman: Mr. Lysytheon, we're finally here from the law enforcement. We haven't got to that stage yet. Could you hold on to your questions.</seg>
<seg id="1086">Are there any further questions?</seg>
<seg id="1087">Mr. Lysytheon: Yes, finally to the law enforcement.</seg>
<seg id="1088">In the minister's letter, he further explained that the total amount of funding that we receive from the federal government was $40 million and that legal fees totalled $30 million and it would have to go up to $42 million.</seg>
<seg id="1089">How do you expect the $42 million to be spent by the end of this fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="1090">Maybe I could ask the member if he can tell me which number he is talking about.</seg>
<seg id="1091">I just wanted to get some clarification. I sent out a letter on Friday and I think I found the $30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The letter of March 16 date was addressed to the Chairperson of the Regular Members' Caucus, the Minister of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="1093">This document I am referring to is on page 4 and there are five in total.</seg>
<seg id="1094">I would like to thank the member for his response.</seg>
<seg id="1095">The figure listed here is $30 million for this fiscal year and the total budget is $30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1096">We have requested $2.6 million for the RCMP detachment to be used by the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="1097">I'm looking at $2.6 million in the business plan on page 1, but in the substantiation sheets, it indicates that the RCMP operates on historical sites, including radios.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The department's proposed business plan indicates that the Legislative Assembly is proposing to restructure the division's organizational structure. However, given the unique nature of its operations, the department is requesting an additional $2.6 million to fund an increase to the division's budget for its employee training and development programs.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The line item that he's talking about is $2.6 million for additional staff and casual salaries. On the same page, $2.6 million, it's talked about earlier that there's a radio station.</seg>
<seg id="1100">Can you clarify that, Mr. Chairman?</seg>
<seg id="1101">Mr. Akeeagok, if you want to elaborate further, it's up to you.</seg>
<seg id="1102">If you look at the substantiation sheets that I mentioned earlier, there's another breakdown of the project by $2.6 million for correctional facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1103">There are two separate amounts here, $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1104">The RCMP requires radios, housing, vehicles, and other things. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1105">Thank you, Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="1106">If we're talking about the $2.6 million, what's the total of that, I don't understand that. Could you clarify that please?</seg>
<seg id="1107">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="1108">On page 5 of our documents, we're dealing with the law enforcement branch of $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1109">Further down, the $2.6 million for the Corrections Division is not part of our overall budget. At this time, we have $2.6 million for the Law Enforcement Branch.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Do you have any questions?</seg>
<seg id="1111">Mr. Towtongie (interpretation): Thank you for that clarification.</seg>
<seg id="1112">According to the Inuktitut version, the English version of the budget is the way it is, the Inuktitut version is (estimated), it seems to be an estimate, it is an estimate in Inuktitut.</seg>
<seg id="1113">Can the minister clarify what this means, projections, or projections for 2017-18?</seg>
<seg id="1114">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) On my left is a budget line item. It talks about $40 million for law enforcement and $11 million has already been approved by his office.</seg>
<seg id="1115">To my right, they have not been approved yet because we're still in the 2017-18 fiscal year. Your estimates are that they will be able to do that and they will be a little over budget. That's why we're trying to get approval from the Legislative Assembly for supplementary appropriations for the Department of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1116">A total of $6.2 million, of which $2.6 million will be directed to the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="1117">That's what we're requesting from you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1118">I just got confused because it sounds like they're just guessing in Inuktitut.</seg>
<seg id="1119">I almost understood my question, so I'm done.</seg>
<seg id="1120">We're on Law Enforcement. $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Next on the list is Total Offices and Court Services, $1 million.</seg>
<seg id="1122">Total Court Services. Corrections. $2,600,000.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Mr. Lysytheon: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1124">My question is in regard to the correctional facilities because every year they go over budget. If I remember correctly, they just go over budget.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Is that correct?</seg>
<seg id="1126">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1127">The member is correct. The majority of it is for overtime and for casual employees.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1129">If memory serves me correctly, the correctional facilities have 12 hours. Is that correct?</seg>
<seg id="1130">Given the fact that the current correctional facility is always full and there's no overtime for staff, has your department given any consideration to opening up a three-hour correctional facility in Nunavut and, if so, would that not be possible?</seg>
<seg id="1131">Perhaps I'll get my Deputy Minister to respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The member is correct. It's a 12-hour shift.</seg>
<seg id="1133">The rate is set at 42 hours per day for 42 hours per week.</seg>
<seg id="1134">As part of the collective agreement, we reduced the overtime from $4 million to $2.49 million.</seg>
<seg id="1135">As a result, the department's budget deficit was $4.5 million and its budget was $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1136">We are moving forward with the overtime and we will continue to do that.</seg>
<seg id="1137">I remind you to shut off your cellphones and put them on silent mode.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Mr. Lysytheon: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1139">It's a 42-hour work week.</seg>
<seg id="1140">Are employees working 50 or 60 hours a week?</seg>
<seg id="1141">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1142">It's too detailed and we have to provide it to the House.</seg>
<seg id="1143">Our deputy minister cannot respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1144">We don't have that information.</seg>
<seg id="1145">I don't know what kind of information is required for the operation of the facility.</seg>
<seg id="1146">I would like to ask these questions.</seg>
<seg id="1147">What kind of training?</seg>
<seg id="1148">With your permission, I would like Deputy Minister MacKay to respond.</seg>
<seg id="1149">I think that answers the member's question. There is an increase in the training and development costs under the justice system.</seg>
<seg id="1150">At this time, we don't provide training.</seg>
<seg id="1151">We have trainers that are on contract, so it's costing them a lot of money to run the program, to run the overtime, to run the program, to replace it with someone else.</seg>
<seg id="1152">We're also looking at other avenues to see if there could be a better plan in the budget to make sure that the staff at the correctional facilities and court services are better trained so that we don't have to hire contractors.</seg>
<seg id="1153">Ms. Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="1154">I was curious to find out about the $2.6 million when it was mentioned and staff training.</seg>
<seg id="1155">I'm just wondering if the minister could give us an indication of what type of training that they're going to be offering on a casual basis.</seg>
<seg id="1156">Both correctional facilities and the court system provide excellent training for casual and relief workers.</seg>
<seg id="1157">We do have a casual employee who is hired on a contract basis, but we do have a number of training sessions over the next few weeks to train people to work in correctional facilities, for example, to deal with disputes.</seg>
<seg id="1158">Can the minister indicate what programs are offered at the correctional facilities?</seg>
<seg id="1159">I don't know if Mr. Akeeagok has that level of detail.</seg>
<seg id="1160">Through you, Mr. Chairman, I'll have Deputy Minister McKay respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1161">Ms. McKay.</seg>
<seg id="1162">I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I can get back to the member on what type of training is provided to inmates.</seg>
<seg id="1163">Depending on which low-risk offenders and inmates are housed at the Iqaluit Utaqqivik Correctional Centre, a trades training program is being offered to prepare inmates for employment, training, and development.</seg>
<seg id="1164">At the same time, the Akausisarvik Mental Health Treatment Program is a program that we have in place for each of the inmates based on their needs for addictions counselling and so on, to try and mitigate some of the anger that may have been involved in the counselling that's offered to the inmates based on the type of counselling that's offered to them.</seg>
<seg id="1165">They can't leave a jail, but they are also taught that if they leave a jail, they will be able to work and they usually graduate from high school. They also have a trades school.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The Rankin Inlet Correctional Centre provides support to inmates.</seg>
<seg id="1167">There are different programs that we provide.</seg>
<seg id="1168">Mr. Akesuk: I am finished.</seg>
<seg id="1169">We are on page 5.</seg>
<seg id="1170">Justice, operations and maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="1171">Total Department. Not Previously Authorized. $6,200,000.</seg>
<seg id="1172">Page 6.</seg>
<seg id="1173">Department of Health. Operations and Maintenance. Not Previously Authorized.</seg>
<seg id="1174">Mr. Akeeagok, would you like to make a comment?</seg>
<seg id="1175">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): It's not a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1176">If you don't mind, we will move on to another department. The person will be available to answer questions, so I would like to change my witnesses at the witness table before we go into questions. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1177">I was going to give you an opportunity, but I'll give you an opportunity at this time.</seg>
<seg id="1178">Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the witnesses out.</seg>
<seg id="1179">Does the committee agree to bring in the witnesses?</seg>
<seg id="1180">Chairman (interpretation): Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort one of the officials out.</seg>
<seg id="1181">For the record, Mr. Akeeagok, please introduce your new witness.</seg>
<seg id="1182">To my left is the Deputy Minister of Health and Social Services, Colleen Inuujaq Stockley.</seg>
<seg id="1183">Not Previously Authorized. Directorate. Total Directorate. $5.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Mr. Netser: My mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1185">I'll be asking questions when we get to the medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Minister.</seg>
<seg id="1187">Any questions under Directorate.</seg>
<seg id="1188">I don't have too many questions, but when we're talking about elders' facilities in Nunavut, there are three facilities that will be funded under this budget.</seg>
<seg id="1189">As I stated yesterday in my questioning, the preplanning studies for the continuing care centre in Igloolik and Gjoa Haven are ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="1190">At that time, the minister wasn't aware of the number of beds that were going to be used for the facility.</seg>
<seg id="1191">I'm just wondering if we can get an update as to where things are at with the increased demand on the adult group home.</seg>
<seg id="1192">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1193">It's in the preplanning stage this year. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1194">What is the status of this preplanning initiative?</seg>
<seg id="1195">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Through you, Mr. Chairman, I would like the Deputy Minister of Health to respond because he knows more about the capital estimates.</seg>
<seg id="1196">The Department of Health and Social Services has already planned capital projects for 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Can the minister provide an update on the status of this project?</seg>
<seg id="1198">Just to keep that in mind, after the election, the government was probably going to have a new role to play in deciding whether or not there would be an option to expand the Igloolik facility.</seg>
<seg id="1199">It's not that far from that, but we're expecting to move forward once we know what the government's mandate is.</seg>
<seg id="1200">A general comment to conclude. When we talk about the use of government programs, we're talking about inadequate infrastructure and I would like to suggest to the department that it is the responsibility of the government to take care of the elders.</seg>
<seg id="1201">I look forward to progress being made with respect to replacing existing housing stock and identifying options to replace existing housing stock in Nunavut with a variety of options for new housing stock that is currently on the waiting list.</seg>
<seg id="1202">That was more of a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1203">I would like to follow up on my colleague's questions regarding the operations of the elders' home.</seg>
<seg id="1204">I would be interested in hearing how the breakdown of that $900,000 is.</seg>
<seg id="1205">Which infrastructure is going to be divided amongst the group homes?</seg>
<seg id="1206">The $900,000 is divided into three regions and $300,000 is allocated for each of the three elders.</seg>
<seg id="1207">Ms. Main (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1208">How does the Department of Health inform the public if they're going to be overexpended?</seg>
<seg id="1209">It's not just the government that recently issued a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="1210">If there is a need to increase or decrease, the Department of Health and Social Services and the other organizations meet together.</seg>
<seg id="1211">When they have to work together, they discuss these issues.</seg>
<seg id="1212">They are following the Canadian and Nunavut laws.</seg>
<seg id="1213">As noted in the opening comments, there are three new residential care facilities that need to be replaced in level 2 and 3. There are a number of factors that indicate that the majority of these facilities are aging.</seg>
<seg id="1214">Going back to the funding, are you anticipating within the next few years that the costs will continue to increase or will the costs continue to increase as a result of the operational cap?</seg>
<seg id="1215">At the beginning of the contract, three of them were with Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="1216">The Department of Health's contract was awarded in April 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1217">The information that we had provided to the member was that the Department of Health was a little bit different from the Department of Family Services. We looked at it from a clinical standpoint.</seg>
<seg id="1218">There were a number of recommendations made in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When we did see the contract, the elders' facility was not able to provide the services that were required.</seg>
<seg id="1220">The deficit was $1.3 million last year and we're projecting $855,000 last year, so we're requesting almost $900,000.</seg>
<seg id="1221">If I'm mistaken, you can correct me if I'm wrong, when I look at the funding that's allocated to mental health services across the territory.</seg>
<seg id="1222">We usually go through a crisis situation.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Is there any talk about putting money aside for mental health treatment?</seg>
<seg id="1224">We are here, we are just talking about additional funding for operations and maintenance because we are not talking about actual costs.</seg>
<seg id="1225">I don't think it's appropriate in this House or in another way.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Do you have another question, Ms. Towtongie?</seg>
<seg id="1227">Thank you for that clarification.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The Mental Health Contract for 2017-18 is $16.7 million, I believe, for $6.2 million. What is the status of that?</seg>
<seg id="1229">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1230">Mr. Chairman, the $5.9 million is included in the $43.1 million.</seg>
<seg id="1231">It's under the details of the $16 million and $10 million.</seg>
<seg id="1232">If I can, through you, Deputy Minister Stockley, explain why there is an additional $10 million for this line item.</seg>
<seg id="1233">That's very good to hear because Nunavummiut ask for help and that's good to hear. Please call your health centre and go online and ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="1234">There has been an increase in the number of clients coming to the treatment centre.</seg>
<seg id="1235">I know there are mental health issues and addictions.</seg>
<seg id="1236">There are also costs outside of the Department of Health and Social Services, which falls under the Department of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Before we proceed to the Directorate, we will take a five-minute break.</seg>
<seg id="1238">&gt;&gt;Committee recessed at 18:03 and resumed at 18:10</seg>
<seg id="1239">I would like to call the committee meeting back to order.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Total Health Insurance Programs. $43,100,000.</seg>
<seg id="1241">In terms of long-term care for elders, you have identified aging care.</seg>
<seg id="1242">We don't have a memory studio in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1243">That's what I'm interested in.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Are they looking at getting a laboratory in Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="1245">It's not at the top of the list.</seg>
<seg id="1246">We're now starting to work on mental health issues.</seg>
<seg id="1247">At the same time, outside of Nunavut, there is a long-term, long-term, and the last sentence that we have here is outside of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1248">I was a little surprised to hear that the minister's own letter that was sent to the regional office indicated that his department didn't include anything in there because of the over expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Is his department going to be spending all of their money up here?</seg>
<seg id="1250">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you. On page 6, the first item there, $5.9 million, not previously authorized.</seg>
<seg id="1251">We are requesting $5.9 million for the continuing care of elders. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1252">My question was more along the lines of the Department of Health's over-expenditures in other areas of the budget.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Perhaps through you, Mr. Chairman, if I make a mistake, Deputy Minister Stockley can correct me.</seg>
<seg id="1254">I can respond by saying that the Department of Health is using the over-expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="1255">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you for the clarification.</seg>
<seg id="1256">The money has not been spent internally. It's being carried over.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The balance of the Department of Health's budget is $49 million.</seg>
<seg id="1258">The letter that I just sent today will be translated today, it's in English and it was sent on Friday, but the attachment doesn't have a number.</seg>
<seg id="1259">That's a very small amount and when you look at the budget shortfall, that's when you look at the supplementary appropriations. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1260">I appreciate that you mentioned appendix I guess, but what I was trying to get at with the letter that we received from the minister on page 4 was a breakdown of programs and funding.</seg>
<seg id="1261">Under Family Services, they're showing a surplus for their recycling program.</seg>
<seg id="1262">If not, why not?</seg>
<seg id="1263">There was no indication that there would be a surplus.</seg>
<seg id="1264">On page 5, under Health Insurance Programs, there's an additional $49 million in funding. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1265">It doesn't say anything about the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="1266">Within the Department of Health and Social Services, I know that there's a budget surplus for nurses, staff, and computer programs that have been over a million dollars in the last few years.</seg>
<seg id="1267">Can the minister provide us with a breakdown of all the programs that Health and Social Services currently has that are surplused as a result of deficit?</seg>
<seg id="1268">You're asking for very detailed information that might not be available right now.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Mr. Akoak.</seg>
<seg id="1270">...Mr. Akeeagok, go ahead.</seg>
<seg id="1271">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for recognizing me.</seg>
<seg id="1272">We don't have that level of detail.</seg>
<seg id="1273">We can table it in the House later.</seg>
<seg id="1274">I'll move on to the elders' facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1275">In the second bullet, it indicates that "The current Elders' Facility is operated under contract by a non-profit Nunavut organization."</seg>
<seg id="1276">I would just like to say that this is a very good tool that is available to any Nunavut organization.</seg>
<seg id="1277">I would hope that the department would be able to contract out thousands of dollars to do that.</seg>
<seg id="1278">I'll move on to a different topic. On the same page of the business plan, the department provides 24-hour care to elders and it states that the department provides 24-hour care and 7-days a week.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The seniors have to be governed according to the legislation.</seg>
<seg id="1280">I would like to ask the Department of Health and Social Services if they have the minimum criteria for the elders' facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1281">I responded to that earlier.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The department has entered into a new contract with an expanded scope of services related to the terms and conditions of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="1283">If there is a misconduct between the interpreter/translators and the Department of Health, they meet with each other to make sure that they're following the proper procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1284">Mr. Mike.</seg>
<seg id="1285">Can you clarify if these elders' facilities meet the minimum level of need?</seg>
<seg id="1286">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1287">It's a new contract. We have increased it from $900,000 to $5.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="1288">The three organizations have been informed that they will be trying to keep up with the demand, but they haven't really reached the level of care they need.</seg>
<seg id="1289">As the minister stated, we're trying to catch up with the communities. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Mr. Netser: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1291">It's starting to get so thick that I'm getting so quiet.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In regard to medical travel, they're asking for $50 million and I have brought this up many times in the House that patients who go to the hospitals don't have appointments, especially in my constituency, when somebody goes down to Winnipeg, they find out that they don't have an appointment.</seg>
<seg id="1293">Does the Department of Health have a list of the patients that went to Winnipeg that were cancelled because they weren't informed of their appointments? Does the Department of Health have a list of those patients and how much they were allowed to pay for them?</seg>
<seg id="1294">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1295">The Minister of Health has committed to reviewing all medical travel patients who have not been seen or have had their appointments changed.</seg>
<seg id="1296">One of the things that the government is looking at is identifying where there has been an incident.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Our member has been asking those questions and he has seen those types of issues and we hope to include those in the review.</seg>
<seg id="1298">I would like to thank the member for bringing that up and I'm sure we can look at it collectively.</seg>
<seg id="1299">That will be part of the review, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1300">Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation) Yes, I look forward to the review.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Just recently, on February 26, the federal government allocated $5.5 million for the Tuberculosis Program. I think it was $82 million.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Has the government or the Department of Health ever requested assistance or has Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami been able to provide assistance? We were given funding by the federal government. Has our government discussed this matter with them to see if they can be compensated for tuberculosis?</seg>
<seg id="1303">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1304">That's a very good question.</seg>
<seg id="1305">At this time, the federal government has stated that in the 2018-19 fiscal year, the funding will be used to help people with tuberculosis, but it also states that Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami will be allocated funding for five years to deal with this issue.</seg>
<seg id="1306">At this point in time, the policy states that the committee is an interdepartmental committee comprised of representatives from Inuit communities.</seg>
<seg id="1307">At this time, the additional funding will be provided by the federal government and I, as the Minister of Finance, have not seen the details.</seg>
<seg id="1308">I look forward to seeing more details on this matter. Further, I want to ensure that Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami is fully aware of their roles and responsibilities.</seg>
<seg id="1309">That is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="1310">The ministers will be kept informed as to the details related to your question.</seg>
<seg id="1311">I would like to ask another question in regard to medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="1312">Here in the report, it speaks to medical travel patients who don't have any control over their travel, especially with regard to the increase in interest rates and contracts.</seg>
<seg id="1313">It's a $15 million deficit, but does the department understand why it's going up?</seg>
<seg id="1314">Given that 5.6 percent is projected to increase on an annual basis, what specific factors account for this increase?</seg>
<seg id="1315">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Through you, I would like my Deputy Minister, Mr. Stockley, to respond to that.</seg>
<seg id="1317">Medical travel and medivacs are increasing each year.</seg>
<seg id="1318">The number of people going on medical travel is also increasing, so it's a good thing that they can get diagnosed early enough.</seg>
<seg id="1319">The vaccination rate has been very high in Nunavut and it's getting worse in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1320">I will use an example.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Approximately 60 medevacs were scheduled for December.</seg>
<seg id="1322">We're constantly reviewing it.</seg>
<seg id="1323">A combination of both medical and duty travel increases.</seg>
<seg id="1324">Mr. Chairman, I'm not going to get into the details of the increases, but I'm just trying to get an idea of what the increases are for.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Will our population in Nunavut be good for their health?</seg>
<seg id="1326">Can you explain to me if this question is too broad, are we catching up or are we getting left behind?</seg>
<seg id="1327">I'll have Deputy Minister Stockley respond to that.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, in all jurisdictions in Canada, the Department of Health has the highest amount of overcrowding in Nunavut, which has the greatest impact on our health and well-being, and we have moved forward on that, but I'm sure that when the housing shortage does occur, it will improve.</seg>
<seg id="1329">At the same time, we have expanded the marshalling services at the Baffin hospital.</seg>
<seg id="1330">We try to reduce the amount of transport for patients.</seg>
<seg id="1331">We are moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="1332">The other region is the Telehealth system.</seg>
<seg id="1333">You will be hearing more about the operations and maintenance budget.</seg>
<seg id="1334">I thank the minister for that answer.</seg>
<seg id="1335">I'm looking forward to dealing with the main estimates when we get to the appropriate page.</seg>
<seg id="1336">The mental health facility is over budget, $10.5 million, but the other thing that we hear is that it's very attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1337">If you look at the substantiation sheets, it doesn't say exactly what the increase is for.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Is there a pressure from your department to increase the number of people with mental health issues?</seg>
<seg id="1339">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) It's both assessment and mental health assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1340">During the Fourth Legislative Assembly, the issue of suicide was raised as an urgent issue.</seg>
<seg id="1341">We will continue to promote those practices. We haven't trained any physicians to diagnose those individuals.</seg>
<seg id="1342">It's going to make a difference for our people and I want the members to continue to table it in the House to the public.</seg>
<seg id="1343">My final question on mental health and addictions is: how many clients are currently receiving care outside of the territory?</seg>
<seg id="1344">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) 64.</seg>
<seg id="1345">How does it change from before?</seg>
<seg id="1346">We don't have that information in front of us, but it's an increase and if the member wants that information, we will be able to provide it during the main estimates session.</seg>
<seg id="1347">Let me move on to another subject regarding the TB study that was recently completed in Qikiqtarjuaq. I'm sure all of us agree that this is very encouraging to hear.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Will the equipment and furniture be retained by the Department of Health in other communities for testing or will they remain in the community?</seg>
<seg id="1349">Through you, I'll have Deputy Minister Stockley respond.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Will the assets assessment be done through the capital estimates?</seg>
<seg id="1351">I'm lost.</seg>
<seg id="1352">It's under capital, so I would like clarification on that.</seg>
<seg id="1353">I'll have Deputy Minister Stockley respond to that.</seg>
<seg id="1354">The majority of these assets came from the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="1355">The federal funding that we received, for example, the Red Seal, the MVIS, the MVIS, the MVIS, the MVIS, the MVIS, the MVIS, the MVIS, the MVIS, the MVIS, the MVIS, the MVIS, the MVIS, the MVIS, the MVIS,</seg>
<seg id="1356">Ms. May: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1357">My last question, probably the last one.</seg>
<seg id="1358">You say that you're hiring agency nurses and contract nurses. My department has been very successful in reducing the number of agency nurses.</seg>
<seg id="1359">I would like to ask, in this year's payments in the past, what's the change in the amount of funding that is paid to them?</seg>
<seg id="1360">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Instead of hiring agency nurses, we are using agency nurses.</seg>
<seg id="1362">From last year to today, we have been using more of our own nurses.</seg>
<seg id="1363">My very last question.</seg>
<seg id="1364">If I get the breakdown of the $8.6 million, I would appreciate it.</seg>
<seg id="1365">Broken down by fiscal year 2017-18, the number of full-time indeterminate positions was inadequate to cover the remaining $52.5 million, with the casual staffing budget exceeding $45.3 million from overtime, waitlist costs of $15.7 million, and agency nurses exceeding $0.1 million, for a total of over $8.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1366">I just have one quick question. I'm going to go through the breakdown of the information that you're talking about, but Mr. Main has a supplementary question.</seg>
<seg id="1367">I don't want to get into the details.</seg>
<seg id="1368">If a nurse is in Sanikiluaq and there's an emergency during the night, if someone has to leave, they have to be overtimed.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) All of them are for agency nurses.</seg>
<seg id="1370">I know the minister was answering questions today about what the department is doing to recruit nurses.</seg>
<seg id="1371">I'll leave that alone for now.</seg>
<seg id="1372">I just want to comment that when we're reviewing the main estimates for the Department of Health, we're always looking at the medical travel contracts, physician travel, mental health, and medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="1373">The number of mental health and addictions has changed significantly from last year's amount of $6.8 million to $7.8 million.</seg>
<seg id="1374">When I was talking earlier about the budgeting process, I don't know what kind of changes were made, but the Minister of Finance said that they haven't made any changes at this time, but I believe that there are some real changes that have to be made.</seg>
<seg id="1375">So I'm asking the minister, while he's aware of the over-expenditures, to really make sure that the budget is realigned so that we can have an actual O&amp;M budget, to be able to bring forward the actual amounts based on need rather than just adding to it.</seg>
<seg id="1376">That's just a comment, but I would like to hear from the minister on that comment.</seg>
<seg id="1377">That's exactly what I'm thinking, and that's another reality that we're looking at. As MLAs, in the Fifth Assembly, we have been deliberating on these issues and debated on them. Some departments, such as Health and Social Services and Justice, have been consistently coming back for supplementary appropriations.</seg>
<seg id="1378">I'm very pleased that we're discussing this in the main estimates and I'm working closely with my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="1379">I can respond by saying that since I've been the Minister of Health, there has been a lot of focus on the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="1380">I think it's very important that we do that because we need to make sure that we're budgeting the operations and maintenance accurately, and I think it's very clear that we need to re-profile these budgeting processes.</seg>
<seg id="1381">We will have to go through the Legislative Assembly to make changes.</seg>
<seg id="1382">One of our Members of the Regular Members' Caucus made some very observant comments.</seg>
<seg id="1383">I am also in the same situation where we have to work closely together as Members of the Legislative Assembly because we really need this.</seg>
<seg id="1384">I'm willing to work with the Premier and the Members of the Legislative Assembly to make sure that we don't have to be here because we know how much money each department spends.</seg>
<seg id="1385">I just wanted to make that comment and I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for giving me this opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="1386">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1387">I appreciate the minister recognizing the need for improvements.</seg>
<seg id="1388">I just wanted to reiterate that, as the member has stated, this is a legal matter that is constantly being dealt with by the current Members of the Legislative Assembly. The issue of overtime for nurses and other professionals is a recurring one.</seg>
<seg id="1389">I believe that they have to be recognized by the Minister of Human Resources.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If we're going to build up the capacity of the existing positions within our organizational structures, if we fill them where there are weaknesses, as Mr. Main alluded to earlier, how challenging positions are in the government, which puts some stress and anxiety on some of our employees, then we have to go back and take a look at how we can move forward in filling the positions where our strengths are and where</seg>
<seg id="1391">I'm going to go on to the overtime. I'm going to want to know a little bit more about moving forward on what the priorities are and what the initiatives are so that we can look forward to what we can do.</seg>
<seg id="1392">That was just a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Mr. Mikkungwak, did you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1394">Mr. Mikkungwak: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1395">I just have one question in regard to the Mental Health and Addictions Contract. On the fourth bullet, it says, ..." covers the costs of legal fees for medical travel." Is that part of the $10.5 million?</seg>
<seg id="1396">I'll make it brief. Yes, they are included.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Mr. Minister, do you have any further questions?</seg>
<seg id="1398">My last question is in regard to Mr. Main and Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Just for clarification, the $8.6 million shortfall is $143 million. You're indicating $151 million to $8.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1400">Is that for all the salaries of the department?</seg>
<seg id="1401">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Yes, these are for compensation and benefits.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Mr. Lightning: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1403">Is the $151 million 100 percent accurate?</seg>
<seg id="1404">It's a $25 million increase in salaries.</seg>
<seg id="1405">I don't think the funding has ever been at 100 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1406">As I stated earlier, we're requesting $8.6 million for compensation and benefits. I believe that we can be the closest.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. That's not 100 percent accurate in our accounting.</seg>
<seg id="1408">When it's at the right time, it has a lot of things on it.</seg>
<seg id="1409">Moving on, in the minister's opening comments on page 4, there's $63.8 million for medical travel starting this year in 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1410">I'm just wondering why the money was set aside in 2016-17.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm just waiting for the 2016-17 business plan because I don't have the information in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1413">We're dealing with 2016-17, not 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1414">I'll remember in 2016-17.</seg>
<seg id="1415">I was asking about the medical travel budget for last year. What I would like to know is: what is the department's budget for the fiscal year 2018-19?</seg>
<seg id="1416">Mr. Akeeagok might not have the figures for 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) I think it's premature for May to make a budget speech for 2018-19.</seg>
<seg id="1418">We're voting on the interim appropriation for 2017-18. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1419">What I'm trying to say is that in our accounting system, there are problems with the way the minister was providing the funding. There are so many variations in the budget from year to year and it's likely that this will be in place for the next fiscal year, so at that time, I will be requesting for the O&amp;M budget of the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="1420">I don't want to keep seeing supplementary appropriations every year.</seg>
<seg id="1421">It's just the same process as the other departments, so I'm going to get the details on the O&amp;M.</seg>
<seg id="1422">That was just a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Chairman: Mr. Qirngnuq, do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1424">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1425">I will ask a question in English so that I'll be clear in my mind. The third bullet indicates, "The actual number of medevacs has increased from last year."</seg>
<seg id="1426">It's talking about the patients who have to be sent out to the hospital. It has increased the number of patients who have to be sent out for medical purposes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">However, it's still going up.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Mr. Mikkungwak, do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1429">I'm sorry, I thought you had your hand up.</seg>
<seg id="1430">We're on Health. Operations and Maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="1431">We are done with $43,100,000. If you go down to the bottom, total department, $49 million.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Not previously authorized.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Schedule 1. Operations and Maintenance Appropriation. $56,602,000.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Go to Bill 3 in your legislation binder.</seg>
<seg id="1435">I'm sorry, let me go back.</seg>
<seg id="1436">Bill 3, Supplementary Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, No. 3, 2017-2018.</seg>
<seg id="1437">Schedule. Supplementary Appropriation. 2017-18. Vote 1: Operations and Maintenance. Total Appropriation. $56,602,000. Agreed?</seg>
<seg id="1438">Clause 4. Agreed?</seg>
<seg id="1439">Chairman: Clause 5. Do you agree?</seg>
<seg id="1440">Chairman: Do members agree to Bill 3 as a whole?</seg>
<seg id="1441">Chairman (interpretation): Do members agree that pursuant to Rule 62 (2) that Bill 3 can immediately be placed on the orders of the day for third reading?</seg>
<seg id="1442">Minister Akeeagok, do you have any closing comments?</seg>
<seg id="1443">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) I really appreciate the questions that were asked in the Budget Address for the next fiscal year and the hard work of our staff in putting together the best estimates that we can have for this fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="1444">Through that process, we will be able to change the budget.</seg>
<seg id="1445">Before we go to the next bill, we will take the minister out.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Thank you for a job well done and now he can stand up.</seg>
<seg id="1447">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you. Were you asking for another witness?</seg>
<seg id="1448">Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the minister out.</seg>
<seg id="1449">Moving on, Bill 4.</seg>
<seg id="1450">Mr. Akeeagok, please proceed with your opening comments.</seg>
<seg id="1451">Bill 04 - Supplementary Appropriation (Capital) Act, No. 4, 2017-2018 - Consideration in Committee</seg>
<seg id="1452">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1453">I am here to present Bill 4, Supplementary Appropriation (Capital) Act, No. 4, 2017-2018.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Through this bill, the government is requesting an additional $96,000 in 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1455">This appropriation will provide the Department of Community and Government Services with a non-financial contribution of $96,000 for interest adjustments during the budget debate, for the negotiation of a lease with the Nunavut Construction Corporation for the Legislative Assembly Building, and nine Government of Nunavut office buildings across Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1456">I would be pleased to take questions.</seg>
<seg id="1457">Are there any general comments on the minister's opening comments?</seg>
<seg id="1458">This is the first time I have ever done this. I would like to understand why we should do this.</seg>
<seg id="1459">Isn't the Department of Community and Government Services able to come up with its own capital plan?</seg>
<seg id="1460">The interest has to be accounted for.</seg>
<seg id="1461">No one would get the money, but when they have to pay it off, the interest rates are higher than expected. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Reverend from the Church visits Nunavut</seg>
<seg id="2">"The Arctic is now linked to an event tonight"</seg>
<seg id="3">"Rodney Howard-Brown, Reverend Evangelis from Florida, is hosting the event in Iqaluit August 27."</seg>
<seg id="4">(Photographer Thomas Roneau)</seg>
<seg id="5">By Thomas Roneau Nunatsiaq News</seg>
<seg id="6">"Reverend Evangelist who is better known for his actions, climate change disbelief and economic prosperity will dissolve the Christian faith in Iqaluit on August 27."</seg>
<seg id="7">Rodney Howard-Brown, from South Africa to the Jonathan States, said in a delegation here in the Tompa Bay area last year that these world-class leaders honoured Luisva and drinked her blood donation."</seg>
<seg id="8">He chased for over an hour at the Iqaluit Church with over 100 people.</seg>
<seg id="9">But the information is not for everybody.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The north is now connected to what is happening tonight.</seg>
<seg id="11">"So, if you want the light (in), stand up here at the church table, or you can leave."</seg>
<seg id="12">"It's up to you," Howard-Brown said during his first two and a half hours.</seg>
<seg id="13">There were over 50 participants.</seg>
<seg id="14">"I didn't fly for thousands of miles to play.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I didn't come here to be liked, and I didn't come here to ask for consent ... Remember: Jesus at home died, he invited people out of the room."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Attendees were more people with infants, youth and elders."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Inside the church of Christian Fellowship of the Church of the Rhodes near Iqaluit, children are running around in armchairs."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Outside of the building, the church and Mosk are both facing each other in a vehicle just behind the parking lot, both of which are facing Ted Doug Lake."</seg>
<seg id="19">"The Governor-General of the Arctic Hope Project was one of the founding members of the Bill Prankard Evangelistic Association's Arctic Hope Project in Ottawa."</seg>
<seg id="20">The coalition did not respond to a Nunatsiaq News request for comment on the issue.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The historic Yvonnellis event, which ranks 119th out of 300 scheduled community events, began after hour."</seg>
<seg id="22">"First of all, the Iqaluit Church choir launched the evening in Iqaluit shortly after Evangelist Reverend Louis Arreak, who helped launch the Christian Fellowship."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Eric Garnier, who is an Anglican Minister here at the Howard-Brown Rebel Church in Indonesia, spent 40 minutes talking about the President."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Louis Arreak, Iqaluit's Evanjalist and singer, sings Rodney Howard-Brown before he speaks."</seg>
<seg id="25">(Photograph by Rebel Parish Industry)</seg>
<seg id="26">"God loves the gift"</seg>
<seg id="27">Ghanian is asking attendees to email us via registration and to follow the Howard-Brown Instagram post.</seg>
<seg id="28">He handed out a voucher to Harvard-Brown Church.</seg>
<seg id="29">"And he tabled Howard-Brown's book, the Killing the Planet, where he quoted from the experience of the crisis in the last 200 years."</seg>
<seg id="30">"This guy is talking about a guy who doesn't like Christianity, he should be talking about that," Ghanian said.</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr. Garney hosted an 18-minute movie called Howard-Brown.</seg>
<seg id="32">"At the end of the film, Howard-Brown prayed that donors of money to the church of God would be provided for by the church's protection."</seg>
<seg id="33">"God loves the gift," Howard-Brown said in his video.</seg>
<seg id="34">Ghana was very honoured with her parents at the end of the video.</seg>
<seg id="35">"One breaks the sky and one collects and together we celebrate the vegetation, so if you're holding a barge in there, it goes to the church and it goes to your fund."</seg>
<seg id="36">This is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="37">"He then submitted the bags to be placed and these people told him that they had the right to receive "best gifts for soul," either financially, as a cash transfer to RMI Canada, either on a credit card or by cellphone."</seg>
<seg id="38">"I've always told people, instead of putting the largest profit on a keen or a new phone ... give you access to the church for promotion and spirituality."</seg>
<seg id="39">Is that it?"</seg>
<seg id="40">A lot of people filled out the packages and put the packages in the blue for summer barrel.</seg>
<seg id="41">Some people just looked at the bag and held the bag.</seg>
<seg id="42">When one woman puts it in her wardrobe, it is empty.</seg>
<seg id="43">What I'm trying to get at with this program is that in most countries, it's very difficult for a lot of people. Over half of the population in Nunavut is on income support, including food security and housing.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Harvard-Brown did not respond to an interview with Nunatsiaq News, so it is unclear how much money he made."</seg>
<seg id="45">Their earnings are kept secret but the website says that it trains 158 sites.</seg>
<seg id="46">It also states that individuals wishing to participate in the Aviation Subsidy Program can be taxed income.</seg>
<seg id="47">Ghanian said he would ask the attendees to raise their hands in the awards to the Rebel Church.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Father, we thank you for this gift, and we appreciate you being the representative for your soul, going to our bank account," Mr. Garion said.</seg>
<seg id="49">Three hundred and one litres of fuel was collected.</seg>
<seg id="50">Rodney Howard-Brown is portraying the woman with the top tier.</seg>
<seg id="51">Reverend Patterk Netser calls him a friend</seg>
<seg id="52">"The Reverend Evangelist is already very much based in Nunavut, escorted by most communities."</seg>
<seg id="53">"The thicket of conferences occurs every year and, by the year 2000, the number continues to increase."</seg>
<seg id="54">"One of the leading advocates of these types of conferences, Roger Ambaster, told Nunatsiaq News in 2004 that the symposium is a massive hot spot for survivors of family violence and abuse."</seg>
<seg id="55">But Mr. Harvard-Brown's mentorship of investment in recycling and real estate may be a new direction for Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="56">"Patiq Netser, a long time advocate for religious issues and now Nunavut's Minister responsible for Housing and Nunavut Arctic College, now referred to Howard-Brown as his "Askimo friend" who told him that climate change was completely untrue."</seg>
<seg id="57">"Mr. Netser did not want to be interviewed in the Nunatsiaq News but he said, "Ronnie is a friend of mine and we talk to each other."</seg>
<seg id="58">"When asked to respond to Harvard-Brown's multiple times in the media, I have also told the U.S. Supreme Court that shootings in the U.S. are not acceptable," Mr. Netser says. "The actions in America are not my responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="59">My main concern is for my constituents and Nunavummiut."</seg>
<seg id="60">"Rodney Howard-Brown, Reverend Evangelis from Florida, is premiering here in Iqaluit on August 27. (Photographer Thomas Roneau)</seg>
<seg id="61">"Tonight on Ice"</seg>
<seg id="62">"Over the past hour of what has happened, Harvard-Brown - the main mission - went to the cathedral."</seg>
<seg id="63">"Tonight's light will be on the sea ice," the Reverend says. "More than 100 people, most of them Inuit, age different."</seg>
<seg id="64">"If you don't want the light, just run to the door while you can."</seg>
<seg id="65">"At that time, Howard-Brown's voice sounds quiet and quiet."</seg>
<seg id="66">He stopped short of what was going to happen and he called me to say something and he made some humorous comments.</seg>
<seg id="67">"I know I don't feel like I'm from Africa, I do because my parents kept me indoors, never let me out," he says with a laugh.</seg>
<seg id="68">"Moses was the first one from that office.</seg>
<seg id="69">The first person broke down and had to go back and pick up another person.</seg>
<seg id="70">And Adamee and Evie came in first place in the Apple production."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Harvard-Brown became a well-known figure, primarily due to the fact that he was making fun of the proceedings and the attendees were laughing."</seg>
<seg id="72">"His grandson went to an exit at the age of two, laughed after 12 minutes," Howard-Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="73">Mr. Howard-Brown has made numerous complaints about other Yvonnes in the world.</seg>
<seg id="74">Mr. Speaker, Herbert Browne's response to the complaints was that she was simply not satisfied with the breathing and the safety of the family.</seg>
<seg id="75">"Mr. Arreak, from Iqaluit is Evanjalis and she is a singer who helped with this situation, who laughed at the members when she was mentoring."</seg>
<seg id="76">"This is not a funeral. Why are people so sad?"</seg>
<seg id="77">Howard Browne said that.</seg>
<seg id="78">Mr. Arreak is laughing.</seg>
<seg id="79">"We serve Jesus and he is alive."</seg>
<seg id="80">Mr. Arreak has a loud laugh.</seg>
<seg id="81">"I like this missionary," said Mr. Arreak, and his laughing sounds better."</seg>
<seg id="82">Harvard-Brown is having a laugh while others are laughing.</seg>
<seg id="83">"They're having fun.</seg>
<seg id="84">"Be happy in the water, from the water to the water."</seg>
<seg id="85">When Mr. Arreak started laughing all of a sudden, the price went down.</seg>
<seg id="86">"This is real.</seg>
<seg id="87">No one will be arrested this evening."</seg>
<seg id="88">"Mr. Arreak, the Nunatsiaq News reporter says he doesn't want to talk to the reporter, so he's laughing."</seg>
<seg id="89">Harvard-Brown also made some unclear statements, indicating that the language was understood as an aboriginal language in this Papua New Guinea priest."</seg>
<seg id="90">'Man-Ga-g-a-p-a-p.</seg>
<seg id="91">"Ron-Pamp-Go-a," he says.</seg>
<seg id="92">Rodney Howard-Brown invites guests to the church's desk so they can get a warm air.</seg>
<seg id="93">Some people are not laughing.</seg>
<seg id="94">But many Harvard-Brown don't like the direction they're given.</seg>
<seg id="95">There was a sudden spike in the resignation.</seg>
<seg id="96">"After failing to touch the detectives, Howard-Brown had two people complaining before they went out."</seg>
<seg id="97">"Where are you going to go?</seg>
<seg id="98">H.</seg>
<seg id="99">Yes!</seg>
<seg id="100">Are you leaving?"</seg>
<seg id="101">Howard-Brown says to one of the men that he was quietly leaving the church.</seg>
<seg id="102">"They came in, they took a few pictures and got out of the phone."</seg>
<seg id="103">Are you reporting daily news here?"</seg>
<seg id="104">Attendees are laughing.</seg>
<seg id="105">"What would it take for me to go and get my adopted child back ... and find out who he is and why he is taking a picture and why he is out," said one of his employees.</seg>
<seg id="106">"After requesting them to go to the clergy room after he delivered his ordeal, Harvard-Brown suddenly grabbed two female seats because they didn't like the latter."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Have you recovered?</seg>
<seg id="108">"What are you, Jehova Whitneys?"</seg>
<seg id="109">The attendees are laughing now.</seg>
<seg id="110">"I have never seen people sitting right across the border that can't change.</seg>
<seg id="111">"So you can jump on others, or maybe you're better than others."</seg>
<seg id="112">When these two women stood up they went out.</seg>
<seg id="113">"I'm just asking.</seg>
<seg id="114">"That's what I do, it's my job."</seg>
<seg id="115">I know the human condition.</seg>
<seg id="116">Please do not care for me.</seg>
<seg id="117">It's not funny.</seg>
<seg id="118">The Arctic is now directly linked to events tonight."</seg>
<seg id="119">The Action Team tells attendees not to take a picture or record it.</seg>
<seg id="120">"However, the group took pictures of the whole event."</seg>
<seg id="121">For example, whenever a patient is crying, they take photographs of the patient who is crying.</seg>
<seg id="122">"Photos from the Rebel Church of Indonesia posted to social media show a number of attendees who were in their teens at the time of the incident - their face injuries, ice injuries, their mouths shut, or are simply on the floor."</seg>
<seg id="123">A lady from Harvard-Brown's hand fell on the floor below the thin ice.</seg>
<seg id="124">"In front of him, Howard-Brown and his staff are going to to touch this couple."</seg>
<seg id="125">This event was originally geared towards St. Jude's.</seg>
<seg id="126">"This event originally was intended to be held at St. Jude's Anglican Church in Iqaluit, but it was changed."</seg>
<seg id="127">"This change was changed by invitation from Harvard-Brown," Secretary of St. Joamie said.</seg>
<seg id="128">David Parsons, the Anglican Bishop for the Arctic, said he did not know that Harvard-Brown was going to be mentoring Saint Jude."</seg>
<seg id="129">"If he had known, he said he would have stopped it because Harvard-Brown was way too much."</seg>
<seg id="130">"As a result, the Anglican Church did not meet the requirement for the approval of the Bishop at the event, Mr. Parsons said."</seg>
<seg id="131">"The Anglican Church is responsible for the awareness of respect, and they deal with other churches," Parsons said.</seg>
<seg id="132">"Unfortunately there is a sense of belief in one another, and it is unacceptable to religion and to go to church."</seg>
<seg id="133">Howard Browne's work seems to be different.</seg>
<seg id="134">"I am not here to do what the religious people want.</seg>
<seg id="135">"If religious issues were to take place in the north, something would have happened in the north," he says to attendees.</seg>
<seg id="136">"I don't come for an invitation.</seg>
<seg id="137">"Eligibility ... If you have a good light, you should feel welcome."</seg>

<seg id="1">"Without much attendance, Canada is quietly launching a new northern policy document."</seg>
<seg id="2">Liberals say this new policy creates a "major change of direction"</seg>
<seg id="3">"Many Uppermines grew from Cape Dorset, Clyde River, Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="4">"Following the day of the federal election campaign, the Liberal government unveiled a long-awaited northern policy agenda."</seg>
<seg id="5">(Photographed)</seg>
<seg id="6">By Jim Bell</seg>
<seg id="7">"Just days before the federal election campaign began, the Liberal Government, in an unprecedented manner, launched a long-awaited northern and northern policy agenda on September 10."</seg>
<seg id="8">"This document, which introduces a preliminary framework for action, will replace the former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper's 2009 Northern Strategy and the Harper Government's 2010 Comments on Canadian Northern Policy."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is intended to guide federal policy in the north by 2030 - but there is no implementation plan or political direction for future action.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Those will be dealt with in phase two, the action plan says."</seg>
<seg id="11">"In spite of that, this initiative came from Carolyn Bennett, Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, who stated that this policy document showed a "significant change in the direction of the federal government."</seg>
<seg id="12">The introduction of this policy has been delayed from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="13">"This winter, Mr. Bennett said that this policy will be introduced in June."</seg>
<seg id="14">CBC News reported earlier this month that a news release from Yellowknife would be released in August.</seg>
<seg id="15">Liberals' policy consists of eight "objects," which include "objects," and ten (10) "Friends."</seg>
<seg id="16">"It addresses a number of policy issues, including community and regional economic development, housing, aboriginal rights, environmental protection, national defence and foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="17">"President Justin Trudeau on December 20, 2016, in announcing his government's intention to develop a new policy, he even stated that a "strategic partnership" would be undertaken between the territorial government and the aboriginal organizations."</seg>
<seg id="18">"As a result, more than 25 Aboriginal groups, including the Government of Nunavut, the Northwest Territories, the Yukon, Manitoba, Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador, took part in the formation."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Through our collaboration with Canada's Northern and Northern Policy Initiative, our partners helped us understand and raise awareness of the unprecedented rights and interests of different jurisdictions, responsibilities and land rights across the north," Mr. Bennett said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"And some of the partners also wrote their practices, which are reflected in separate policy documents."</seg>
<seg id="21">Some of the comments don't mention federal policy.</seg>
<seg id="22">"For example, the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the Nunavut Government, the GNWT and the three territorial governments have shared their own language."</seg>
<seg id="23">However, events are happening.</seg>
<seg id="24">These letters that were submitted by the parties involved may not represent the federal policy.</seg>
<seg id="25">For example, a symbol of the federal government's potential for conflict of interest provisions would be accepted by over 31 partners.</seg>
<seg id="26">"While the Action Plan documents are part of the process, they are not necessarily symbolic of the views of the federal government or any other party," the Action Plan states.</seg>
<seg id="27">The article also states that approval was difficult.</seg>
<seg id="28">"The ideas, goals and aspirations of this forum reflect many ideas and ideas."</seg>
<seg id="29">What that means is there is an agreement with the federal government and the aboriginals."</seg>
<seg id="30">You can find a link to northern policies in the advertisement.</seg>
<seg id="31">8 Objectives</seg>
<seg id="32">"The following eight objectives are actionable, demonstrating the Federal Government's commitment."</seg>
<seg id="33">"Strong, sustainable, diversified and sustainable communities and regional economies."</seg>
<seg id="34">â¢ Canada's northern and northern indigenous peoples should continue to apply and do well.</seg>
<seg id="35">â¢ Canada's Arctic and northern peoples should be safe and well protected.</seg>
<seg id="36">â¢ Strengthening institutional inequality in another country.</seg>
<seg id="37">â¢ Its laws are based on a northernly effective approach to innovation and opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="38">â¢ Knowledge and Understanding Guidelines for Innovation.</seg>
<seg id="39">â¢ Canada's Arctic and Arctic livelihoods be healthy and sustainable.</seg>
<seg id="40">Collaboration helps to retain and build trust among aboriginal and aboriginal peoples.</seg>
<seg id="41">These objectives begin with a variety of "projects" that have been further defined.</seg>
<seg id="42">Ten principles</seg>
<seg id="43">"In order to achieve the goals and objectives, the manual outlines the principles under which they are established to "continue to guide the implementation of the mandate."</seg>
<seg id="44">"The decisions about the north will be made in partnership and involving northerners, in the context of rights, needs and interests."</seg>
<seg id="45">"The rights and positions of federal, territorial, provincial, aboriginal and municipal governments will be respected."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Development must be a source of value, social, cultural, economic and environmental thinking."</seg>
<seg id="47">"Consolidation of Aboriginal Affairs on an ongoing basis, with the experience of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission as a starting point, will be a success."</seg>
<seg id="48">"While climate change is a reality in this land, action will be taken on a wide range of stakeholders, including its impact on indigenous peoples, who depend on the land and wildlife for their cultural, economic and food security."</seg>
<seg id="49">"The policy and programming will mark diversity and fairness, as well as provide resources such as a gender-based research (Gender-Based Analysis Plus) approach that may affect a variety of society."</seg>
<seg id="50">"â¢ This approach will take into account a wide range of foundation initiatives such as rights, interests and circumstances in such areas as Inuit, circumpolar Indigenous and MÃ©tis peoples respectively, clearly defined and implemented."</seg>
<seg id="51">"The Government of Canada recognizes that Inuit, First Nations and MÃ©tis are aboriginal peoples of Canada, by definition, a skilled community, with its own history, along with the federal government."</seg>
<seg id="52">"Working together on the principles of rights, respect, co-operation should reflect the needs, priorities and aspirations of each person."</seg>
<seg id="53">"Both organizations, from the private sector to the universities and colleges, including non-profit organizations, community groups and individuals from across Canada, have a significant role to play in building a stronger Canada's North."</seg>

<seg id="2">Leona Aglukark talks about her campaign promises for Nunavut</seg>
<seg id="3">"Leona Aglukark, Nunavut Conservative candidate, shows Conservative president Andrew Snow grew up in Iqaluit at Serbia Grinnell Park when he visited the city on June 19."</seg>
<seg id="4">(Photographer Emma Toronto)</seg>
<seg id="5">By Emma Tander</seg>
<seg id="6">"A Nunavut Conservative candidate says that if the Conservatives were to form a government, they would eliminate the carbon tax because it "costs everything up."</seg>
<seg id="7">Leona Aglukark began her nomination to the Nunavut communities.</seg>
<seg id="8">Nunavut MP began her campaign in Iqaluit on September 12 at the Frobisher Inn.</seg>
<seg id="9">After that she flew to Rankin Inlet the next day and will return to Iqaluit next week.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Nunatsiaq News had an opportunity to talk to Ms. Aglukkaq when she was in Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="11">"This carbon tax "promotes air fares, goods, shipping, hunting and homeownership," says Aglukkaq's campaign poster.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ms. Aglukkaq also told the Nunatsiaq News that this tax has a negative impact on day cares and on the elders' home promotion.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Everything is affected by the dust."</seg>
<seg id="14">Ms. Aglukkaq.</seg>
<seg id="15">"When we can't pay the carbon tax, it's like the brain can't tell the other side of the house."</seg>
<seg id="16">"However, Mr. George Hickes, the Nunavut Minister of Finance, announced in May that an agreement in Ottawa, the power and aviation fuels in Nunavut have been deemed exempt from this tax."</seg>
<seg id="17">The Government of Nunavut provides a half-payment tax credit to Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Margaret's campaign for Nunavut has four priorities: affordable housing, mental health and industry."</seg>
<seg id="19">"How can we as a government and the private sector and the Government of Nunavut work together to address this significant housing need across the north?"</seg>
<seg id="20">"Housing Ms. Aglukkaq's campaign priority is to "Develop options including housing for income support, seniors' housing and disabled persons."</seg>
<seg id="21">"The federal and territorial governments should also consider ways to promote homeownership."</seg>
<seg id="22">Ms. Aglukkaq also mentioned northern employment and mental health education for Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Nunavut is a vast territory with great coastal resources in Canada and we are still abandoned by the need for marine infrastructure in our territory, so we must consider large-scale projects like this in the Arctic," he says.</seg>
<seg id="24">"It is our responsibility to provide housing, training Nunavummiut for mental health services so that we can help our communities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"When asked if he would reverse the federal Nutrition North program, Ms. Aglukkaq said the carbon tax has resulted in food prices going up in the air."</seg>
<seg id="26">"When he was asked if he thought that the process was binding, and if not, what he would do other than the carbon tax, he said he would talk to the Nutrition North Advisory Board."</seg>
<seg id="27">"He indicated that once the Conservative government was formed, the council would still exist."</seg>
<seg id="28">"It is very important to have someone from the north who can tell the government how to improve the program.</seg>
<seg id="29">This is not a perfect project.</seg>
<seg id="30">Not everything is perfect in the world.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, there is a need for northern subsidies."</seg>
<seg id="32">Ms. Aglukkaq refused to specify exactly how to approach the Nutrition North Canada Program, however, stressed the need for a subsidy on food and the "reduction" would not help.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Recently, research published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal found that food insecurity in Nunavut under the Nutrition North Canada Program was attributed to the Canadian Community Health Survey."</seg>
<seg id="34">"Ms. Aglukkaq said the work she has done as the Minister of Environment would contribute to climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but she did not specifically say how she would do it."</seg>
<seg id="35">He stated that he would be in support of the Keewatin Water License (hydro-fibre link) and the Greece Bay route and the Kitikmeot port for ships.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Will we be able to avoid fuel in the near future?</seg>
<seg id="37">"No," he said.</seg>
<seg id="38">"When Conservative Prime Minister Andrew Shell came to Iqaluit last June, he stated that Nunavut needs to develop a recycling program, saying that "it is very difficult" through the current Liberal Government.</seg>
<seg id="39">Ms. Aglukkaq stated that she believes that the policies have already been developed to consult with the public about recycling economic development and that it is unclear at this time.</seg>
<seg id="40">"The Nunavut Land Claims Agreement provides information on how business should be done in the north... The Land Claims Agreement, in my view, is the most important environmental strategy."</seg>
<seg id="41">"It protects our land, protects our waters, protects our wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="42">"It is already set out the requirements for how projects should be done.</seg>
<seg id="43">It has become a legal issue and we have to be very proud of it.</seg>
<seg id="44">"And the decision on the north should come from the people of the north, not from Ottawa."</seg>
<seg id="45">"Ms. Aglukark left the headquarters in Pond Inlet and Arctic Bay on September 19, her office said."</seg>
<seg id="46">"He has also planned to travel to Pangnirtung, Broughton Island and Clyde River to the Kivalliq and Kitikmeot regions."</seg>

<seg id="2">"We will do what we can to make it happen before the polar bear hunt."</seg>

<seg id="6">Cambridge Bay - The Government of Nunavut agrees with the new polar bear management plan.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was a message from the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board Members at the Kitikmeot Wildlife Management Board meeting in Cambridge Bay last week.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The initial stage of the new polar bear management plan is the equalization of the harvesting and harvesting of Nunavut polar bears," Nunavut Wildlife Management Board Chairperson Dan Shewchuk, said at the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Meeting in Cambridge Bay is the first of three regional wildlife boards to have a meeting between him and Jason Akeeagok, the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board's executive director, to attend."</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Akeeagok said that the polar bear management plan was "a lot of work."</seg>
<seg id="11">"We will do what we can to make it happen before the polar bear hunt," he says.</seg>
<seg id="12">"This plan has been under consideration for almost five years, and it is being discussed in the plan to develop a plan at last March's Iqaluit Nunavut Wildlife Management Board meeting."</seg>
<seg id="13">The plan runs until 2029.</seg>
<seg id="14">This young lady had a polar bear that landed on the ocean near Arctic Bay while the four floors were watching.</seg>

<seg id="17">"In all of the circumpolar countries in the 19 provinces the polar bears, 12 are more in Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="18">Polar bear quotas have been established in the regions (for example the only male bears) of these polar bears - and the Mission Polar Bear Protects are included in the annual total allowable harvest set by the communities.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Although the new plan does not increase the total allowable harvest at this time, it may result in a new total allowable harvest being considered for a new quota."</seg>
<seg id="20">"According to our plan, Nunavut communities were allowed to harvest only one female polar bear in two male polar bears each year under the Community Polar Bear tag system."</seg>
<seg id="21">"This was done only in Baffin Bay for polar bears, where there is a stabilization rider in place.</seg>
<seg id="22">The names would be tagged in half.</seg>
<seg id="23">The new equalization allowance for male/female polar bear harvesting in the communities for the protection of polar bear populations should continue as required.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The increased polar bear trafficking in the communities has been a concern in Nunavut since the tragic death of two polar bears in the Kivalliq last year - however, under the current management plan, the protection of the polar bear and if it's a female, then there would be two tags used."</seg>
<seg id="25">As a result, some communities will no longer have tags to protect polar bears.</seg>
<seg id="26">"This new plan could reduce the number of polar bears coming into the community," Suzak told Nunatsiaq News.</seg>
<seg id="27">"However, he previously stated that polar bears are a threat to Inuit culture and lifestyle, because they destroy cabins, birds' habitats and seals."</seg>
<seg id="28">They attended the meeting in Cambridge Bay where they welcomed the changes to the polar bear management plan.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was also pleased that the dogs will now have five more tags for grizzly bears.</seg>
<seg id="30">There was a huge attack that happened and there was a mass shooting. The facility is too close to the houses here in Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="31">"On the other hand, with this new polar bear management plan it may have other ideas."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Polar bear futures are very uncertain because of climate change," according to a 2018 study by a committee of the COSEWIC, this committee, the kind of species at risk of disappearing in Canada (COSEWIC), re-evaluated polar bears as "very concerning."</seg>
<seg id="33">It means that polar bears are at risk or are at risk of disappearing into combinations of survival and specified threats.</seg>

<seg id="1">Inuktitut Roman orthography - Promotion and Development and Appeal</seg>
<seg id="2">Our contribution today to our children and our future generations</seg>
<seg id="3">The Roman orthography writing system can be used in all Inuit languages across Canada.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami has stated that they will not replace the syllabics and the Inuit regions the old Roman orthography and other syllabics will just be used.</seg>
<seg id="5">Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami has also stated that Inuit traditional writing systems will not be changing.</seg>
<seg id="6">By Majesty &lt;unk&gt;man</seg>
<seg id="7">"I was very proud to hear that the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami unanimously agreed to a new Inuktitut spelling system, named after the Inuktitut Roman orthography that was passed earlier this month."</seg>
<seg id="8">Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami means "the unity of Canada's people" and has few examples of strength that our people have long shared with each other to preserve our culture and language.</seg>
<seg id="9">That is good to me at this time.</seg>
<seg id="10">"In June 2011, as the President of ITK, we demonstrated our willingness to undertake reforms to our education system."</seg>
<seg id="11">"We launched a national campaign for Inuinnaqtut in grade 10 that demonstrated our commitment to shared vision for our children to be able to meet their educational needs, to safeguard Inuktitut and culture and language."</seg>
<seg id="12">Our recommendations included the establishment of a unified Human Rights Act.</seg>
<seg id="13">All the Inuit of Canada have been working for decades to reach this milestone and reach this new era.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Inuinnaqtuun Language Preservation Group in every community in the Inuit homeland took the Inuktitut terminology course.</seg>
<seg id="15">This means that we will have one writing system in all people's dialects that is workable.</seg>
<seg id="16">This new registration system will be a slow process.</seg>
<seg id="17">"My view is that the use of syllabics will not replace or diminish community traditional knowledge, as it is designed to involve my constituency's traditional knowledge."</seg>
<seg id="18">It is our contribution today to our children and to the future generations.</seg>
<seg id="19">I can now imagine that ordinary Canadians will be better able to communicate and share best practices and curriculum with high quality curriculum issues and that our children will be able to graduate from high school in both languages with the skills to write and write.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We face a global challenge as individuals.</seg>
<seg id="21">But we are here today.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the past we had to look at past experiences to find out today who we are and where we are today.</seg>
<seg id="23">I believe we're going to have to look back at the future.</seg>
<seg id="24">The use of Roman orthography in Canada as a public tool helps me to understand that we want to move forward as a united society.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Eight years ago when we began the process of developing a national program on Inuit education, we were able to carry out the term "Inuktitut" in the context of all Inuit dialects, regardless of their dialectal differences."</seg>
<seg id="26">To me that is a sign that we can overcome all the issues that are not true about barriers.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Our language and our identity are expressed, our language is well balanced."</seg>
<seg id="28">I am hopeful that we will be able to use all of the Inuktitut terminology and the spelling to move forward with our commitment to decentralization.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Michael Simon served as President of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami in 2011 on the launch of the Canadian "Traditional Inuit Education," which included a recommendation to create a standardized writing system for Inuit languages."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Many of the laws, policies, practices or institutional processes used are fundamentally different and inconsistent."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Quebec leader FranÃ§ois Lego issued an apology to the First Nations and Inuit of Northern Quebec on October 2, following a press release acknowledging the discriminatory nature of the ongoing work of the public service."</seg>
<seg id="4">(Advertisement)</seg>
<seg id="5">"As such, the Quebec Government has not taken the responsibility of the aboriginal peoples," Lego said.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Mr. Lego apologized - the first of 142 decisions reported - at the National Aboriginal Conference on Wednesday, October 2, just two days after the former Supreme Court Justice Jack B. Bens, the Commission's former Attorney General issued a statement."</seg>
<seg id="7">"No justification is acceptable," Lego said.</seg>
<seg id="8">He stated that he would review all of the decisions and find out exactly why there is discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Many of the laws, policies, practices or institutional practices used in diversity and inequality are currently inadequate in the provision of essential services to indigenous peoples and the Inuit," Ms. Wines said in her September 30 report.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The inquiry focused primarily on aboriginal issues dealing with the RCMP, legal systems, corrections, health and social services, and youth protection services."</seg>

<seg id="12">"Here, in November 2018, in his consultation."</seg>
<seg id="13">(Photographer Sara Rogers)</seg>
<seg id="14">"The Kativik Municipality issued a report stating the importance of the decisions including the recommendations, in improving relationships between aboriginal peoples and the Quebec Government."</seg>
<seg id="15">"In particular, the Kativik Municipality strongly urged the government to make this decision a videoconference in the context of criminal activity in small communities, as the Kativik Government has done in consultation with the Quebec Government."</seg>
<seg id="16">"The Kativik Society's entire municipal government is committed to working collaboratively with all levels of government and other regional organizations to implement the Commission's recommendations through its work," said Kativik Community Government Chairperson Jennifer Mearnick in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Nunavik Department of Health and Social Services' response to the report also indicated that Members remained concerned that the Commission discussed health and social services issues and youth protection services.</seg>
<seg id="18">The need for resources and management in the area of health and social services was also raised by Members during the review.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We will now expect the Quebec Government to make a report on its actions, as well as through partnership arrangements and usage," said Executive Director Minnie Green on October 2 of this report.</seg>
<seg id="20">Members also appreciated the Commission's assurance that Quebec's Abbott Scientist will be responsible for implementing the 142 decisions.</seg>
<seg id="21">Makivik President Charlie Ford made a statement during the course of the survey on Nunavik's progress and stated on October 1 that the public had a chance to speak to the survey.</seg>
<seg id="22">"In many cases, in tears, my fellow Inuit have spoken to the Commission about their actions through health, justice, social services, youth protection, Historical Problems and others in Quebec Government services," Ford said.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Although he stated that the report would be responded to, "in accordance with the first recommendation - that Quebec apologize to the Inuit and First Nations in a manner that treats Inuit differently in the delivery of services to our citizens - then we feel that we have been heard."</seg>

<seg id="1">Three law firms have promised Nunavut that the use of diesel fuel will be halted by 2030</seg>
<seg id="2">"This is a tremendous amount of work"</seg>
<seg id="3">Students walked four foxes from Iqaluit on September 27 to participate in a call for climate change.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three lawmaker candidates for federal elections announced plans to end Nunavut's Tesla fuel crisis by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="5">(Photographer Dustin Patter)</seg>
<seg id="6">By Dustin Pattaq</seg>
<seg id="7">"During this federal election, the three legislative branches announced that Nunavut's use of Tesch fuel for electricity would be halted by 2030."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Right now all 25 communities in Nunavut have diesel generators operated by the Qulliq Energy Corporation, only the power corporations in Canada that don't have a renewable energy source in their community."</seg>
<seg id="9">Reforming this program would be a huge and costly task.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This is a huge undertaking," said Martha Lineau, a northern renewable energy expert with the World Wildlife Fund.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It must be easy, just a little bit."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Green Party's campaign promise is to "Implement renewable energy sources."</seg>
<seg id="13">"By 2030, all Canadian energy will be recycled."</seg>
<seg id="14">This includes outpost camps in northern communities such as Telstra for heat loss."</seg>
<seg id="15">"The Liberal Party has stated that it will "make a significant step forward in financially reducing the number of people in the communities who depend on Tesch's fossil fuels, but also invest in renewable energy sources - such as hydro, wind and solar power - by 2030."</seg>
<seg id="16">The New Democratic Party (NDP) said that "to aim at achieving a national level of renewable energy without carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 ... this carbon dioxide emissions reduction in energy consumption reflects community and job creation.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We would support proposals such as community-owned and co-ordinated clean energy projects to provide jobs for residents and skilled people, as well as work with indigenous and northern communities on the disposal of Cell Oil."</seg>
<seg id="18">"According to the Environment and Climate Change Canada report released earlier this year, greenhouse gas emissions in Nunavut amount to less than 1 percent."</seg>
<seg id="19">"In 2017, Nunavut introduced a total of 0.6 megatons (megatones) of carbon dioxide, equivalent to 18,000 vehicles."</seg>
<seg id="20">"In that same year, Alberta, which is the country's largest emissions producer, unveiled an estimated 84 million vehicles per capita."</seg>
<seg id="21">"However, Nunavut has seen greenhouse gas emissions have more than doubled from 30% in 2005, with the largest increase in Canada and Alberta almost doubling, which is the second largest increase in this area."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Even if energy-related changes were made to the three major legislative initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the impact on Canada's greenhouse gas emissions would still be minimal."</seg>
<seg id="23">The communities will be able to get some equipment.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Nunavummiut pay the highest electricity rate in any other part of Canada, and funding for energy would go a long way toward reducing that."</seg>
<seg id="25">"However, taking steps toward renewable energy projects such as this may not be sufficient to cover current costs for energy."</seg>
<seg id="26">"Last month, the World Wildlife Board issued a report which discussed how renewable energy would be able to provide power to each of the 25 communities in Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="27">"They found that with a decrease of 8% - primarily due to the risk of doing business or other possible funding sources - Baker Lake, Coral Harbour, Iqaluit and Rankin Inlet would save money by moving 20% towards renewable energy, including a direct payment over the next 15 years."</seg>
<seg id="28">The survey also revealed that 16 other communities have a 4% subsidy - roughly what the Qulliq Energy Corporation can borrow - and roughly $2 million in subsidy costs and a 20% subsidy.</seg>
<seg id="29">"However the report only discusses how feasible these projects may be, by suggesting that moving away from renewable energy would be less costly than the present power rate."</seg>
<seg id="30">But moving from community to community that would qualify for renewable energy would be a huge undertaking.</seg>
<seg id="31">"There would have to be consultations, and they would have to start next year in order to reach their energy goals in each community," said Mr. Lineau.</seg>
<seg id="32">"They would have to go to the communities, work with them on what they want to do, and see what the communities envision in energy, to find out what their priorities are and to see the communities as important for hunting and harvesting."</seg>
<seg id="33">"This does not include any specific investments in solar panels or wind farms, which will take at least two years to put together, or projects by the Qulliq Energy Corporation to ensure that renewable energy sources are safe for business."</seg>
<seg id="34">"In every community 100 percent moving from recycling to renewable energy, the three candidates from the three regulators' position, would not only be a lengthy process but a significant amount of money."</seg>
<seg id="35">"The New Democratic Party (NDP) and the Liberal Democrats haven't announced yet how much money they would contribute to the move," the Green Party said last week.</seg>
<seg id="36">"In conjunction with the campaign expenditure report, the Green Party said it would provide $150 million over five years for the devolution of all outpost camps and northern communities - not just Nunavut - to eradicate diesel fuel."</seg>
<seg id="37">It's not right.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Mr. Leonard explained that if a community like Arctic Bay were to move or at least 60 percent of its power plant, it would have an operating expenditure of approximately $27.8 million."</seg>
<seg id="39">"Under the same report, for any other community that is 60% renewable energy, they would have to use a higher rate."</seg>
<seg id="40">"In Iqaluit, it is estimated that it will cost approximately $148 million."</seg>
<seg id="41">"Although it is clear that it is significantly less than the $250-500 million investment in energy than was originally proposed in the city, this investment will go to one community that the Green Party is proposing."</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Leonie's not expecting the federal government to cover all of these projects, but he also indicated the projects and how they would be dealt with and it would take time."</seg>
<seg id="43">"In looking at the 2030 deadline, there won't be much room."</seg>
<seg id="44">"In terms of solar power, I think it would take two to five years."</seg>
<seg id="45">"In terms of wind power, it looks like it's going to be a five to seven year wind project," says Mr. Leonard when asked how much energy it would take.</seg>
<seg id="46">"Looking at the deadlines and breaking them down into 25 communities and if they're going to be done in a very simultaneously isolated community and the land isn't always available, Leonard thinks about how it's going to be done.</seg>
<seg id="47">"I think with those expectations, that's going to change a lot."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Even if we don't achieve 100 percent, there is a lot of will."</seg>
<seg id="49">"Please note: this book talks about the federal nominations of the Green Party, the Liberal Party and the New Democrats."</seg>
<seg id="50">"While this book was prepared, the Conservative Party has not yet announced their candidacy, so it is not included in this report."</seg>

<seg id="2">It should be recognized that the value of early childhood education and childcare workers across Nunavut is invaluable to the employees.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Lakuluk Williamson Patrick, the Chairperson of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, is seeking additional support from the Government of Nunavut for quality early childhood education and early childhood education based on Inuit language and culture."</seg>
<seg id="4">By Nunatsiaq News</seg>
<seg id="5">Correspondence to the Hon. Premier of Nunavut, Joe Savikataaq, Minister of Education, David Joanasie, and Minister Joanasie</seg>
<seg id="6">I am one of those people who have children who are very sensitive to our language and culture.</seg>
<seg id="7">"As Chairman of the Board of Directors Footprints Sapaqivik, Inuktitut Language School is the only institution for early childhood education in Iqaluit and the only institution in Iqaluit in Nunavut that provides daycare services for children who are already speaking Inuktitut."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Footprints closed on August 21 to September 12, 2019 due to a staff shortage and, again, have been operating with a staff shortage for almost a year."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Very few people apply for jobs at the Trigram Building because they are underpaid (in Iqaluit the highest paid childcare), employees who do not have benefits, housing because they are seen as low-paying women working in the daycare as they see it."</seg>
<seg id="10">"The daycare is now open again, but the crisis operation has been challenging: we lost a very dedicated staff member who left tired."</seg>
<seg id="11">"We now have a part-time person in the office, an indeterminate day care coordinator, two day care workers and each parent who works out of the day cares (inclusive criminal records checks and balances), full-time employees, while we are looking for a position, a qualified person."</seg>
<seg id="12">"This process is rare, but for those of us with children, we believe that our children should be in a safe environment and speak Inuktitut so that the Arviarvik can be open."</seg>
<seg id="13">It is still dangerous that it may be closed down permanently.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Nunavut's daycare system currently does not generate any revenue. Daycare workers are expected to deliver one of the most important child-related services to provide quality early childhood education, which is based on Inuit culture and language, despite low cost and lack of support."</seg>
<seg id="15">The non-profit society relies on a wide range of sources of funding, from year to year, to provide support to parents, volunteers, and to operate and manage the early childhood education program.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Early childcare workers find it difficult to get enough compensation and benefits, poor training on the job and limited staff housing."</seg>
<seg id="17">Career and Early Childhood Services staff have now been asked to work following their needs to self-reliance or their families' economic development.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is a very difficult time for our daycares because of the special requirements for them to have the technical expertise to promote and preserve the Inuit language and culture of our young children; Footprints hire only the fluent Inuktitut speaking person.</seg>
<seg id="19">We have 100 percent Inuit employment.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, as a result of high turnover in staff, there is a shortage of staff and there is a lack of competition and benefits for staff leaving.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Therefore, it does have an impact on the early childhood education and the early childhood education."</seg>
<seg id="22">Inuit need to be provided with the support they need to ensure that our language and culture is taught to our children.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Government of Nunavut should consider how to better support the quality of early childhood education programs and ensure that the daycare is based on Inuit language and culture.</seg>
<seg id="24">"An effective early childhood education and child care workers are paid in competitive public sector benefits, which include housing through employment, vacation, training in the workplace and in the school."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Truth and Reconciliation Commission's vision is to increase the size of the day care so that it can reach the public and to increase programs to provide for more children.</seg>
<seg id="26">"Right now we've been looking for a larger, more dedicated daycare space to achieve that vision, so we have raised close to $80,000 for a new space."</seg>
<seg id="27">The proposed amendments provide that the Government of Nunavut:</seg>
<seg id="28">"Combine early childhood education and child care employees with GN employees to pay the same level of pay as GN employees, consistent with the Government of Nunavut's expenditures in each of the following eight categories, used by employees in the Nunavut School Operations;"</seg>
<seg id="29">Included in the operations and maintenance of daycare facilities across Nunavut that are integrated into the education system;</seg>
<seg id="30">"provide support for early childhood education and childcare workers but not limited to short-term measures which include long-term medical vacation, vacation, bilingual leave, parental leave and housing."</seg>
<seg id="31">â¢ Establish an institution to support all daycares in Nunavut;</seg>
<seg id="32">â¢ Work with daycares to immediately address emergencies and challenges. Together, we will work together to develop a long-term plan to change the operations of the daycare.</seg>
<seg id="33">It should be recognized that the value of early childhood education and childcare workers in Nunavut is invaluable to the employees.</seg>
<seg id="34">Our daycares need to be fully staffed with full staffing and full staff support.</seg>
<seg id="35">We have to keep our daycares open.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Changes to the operations of the daycare system. Nunavut early childhood education and childcare workers will value their work. They will be able to take this significant step forward so that early childhood education and child care systems can be adapted to the best practices in the life of children, including the ability to learn the Inuit language, build a strong foundation of Inuit culture, and thrive for Canadians."</seg>

<seg id="1">Inuit language rights groups even introduced the Montreal conference Inuktitut speaking conference</seg>
<seg id="2">"It is called the Inuit Cultural Immersion Day. It was meant to be the Inuit Language.</seg>
<seg id="3">"NTI President Aluki Kotierk, on his right, speaks during a speech entitled, "Inuktitut is a living right" on Thursday October 3, at the Inuit Cultural Immersion Day conference in Montreal.</seg>
<seg id="4">"With him is Louis Tapardjuk, a member of the Inuit Uqausinginnik Taiguusiliuqtiit, the Nunavut Language Authority."</seg>
<seg id="5">Although there are no interpreters, the interpreters kept speaking in Inuktitut.</seg>
<seg id="6">(Photographer Lisa Gregor)</seg>
<seg id="7">By Lisa Grigor, who is not always used by Nunatsiaq News</seg>
<seg id="8">"In Montreal the hotel boardroom had a lot of noise on Thursday, October 3, when people attended the 21st Inuit Cultural Immigration Symposium to hear the two Inuit leaders talk about why Inuktitut is a Nunavut human right and that right seemed to be rejected."</seg>
<seg id="9">"NTI President Aluki Kotierk and Louis Tapardjuk, a former Nunavut Government Minister and member of the Inuit Uqausinginnik Taiguusiliuqtiit, the Nunavut Language Authority, attended in a timely manner and sang the seats in front of the Inuit."</seg>
<seg id="10">"The choreographer designed this campaign through Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated's Facebook page, featured in a series of videos that could be linked to English-speaking people, and the attendees were mostly Inuit who learned the language."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Kiutiq welcomed the participants and started speaking in Inuktitut. Sometimes the Inuktitut-speaking people would say yes to their heads and they would clap."</seg>
<seg id="12">"For those people who don't speak Inuktitut, the writer was involved, they just sat there and looked."</seg>
<seg id="13">Some people just walked out.</seg>
<seg id="14">Some of them are just listening to the phones and working on the translations while they are waiting.</seg>
<seg id="15">There was no English.</seg>
<seg id="16">Welcome to an amazing community for many people in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="17">"It's called Inuit culture education so it was like, especially when we were talking about the Inuit language, we wanted to use the Inuit language," Kuutiq said at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Lulus we talked about this before and we know that there won't be interpreters but we felt it was very important in our language when we talk about support and the development of our language."</seg>
<seg id="19">"The Global Summit, which brings together northern experts from the north and south, recently began with a greater emphasis on Inuktitut speakers and co-hosts, a conference aimed at increasing Inuit needs and working more closely with Inuit and non-Inuit students."</seg>
<seg id="20">"The Inuktitut seminar, in regards to language of human rights, seems to have been the focus of this."</seg>
<seg id="21">Mr. Curley's presentation summary discussed a number of statutory requirements for the promotion and protection of the Inuktitut language in Nunavut and here there are more Inuit and speakers of Inuktitut.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Such legislation as the United Nations (United Nations) constitution guarantees the rights of indigenous peoples (or First Nations) to act on and legal actions taken by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Canadian Inquiry into murder and missing aboriginal women and girls, and the Nunavut Languages Act."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Kirtiq described many recent deaths of Inuit, partially, here in the language and culture breakwaters, such as Annie Kootoo, who passed away due to tuberculosis in 2017, and 15-year-old Eileen Kooneeloosie, who passed away due to tuberculosis in the same year."</seg>
<seg id="24">"People want to live a fair and human right.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Canadian Inuit should not die due to lack of access and services in equal measure with other Canadians," Kuutiq wrote in her statement.</seg>
<seg id="26">"In terms of the wording in the document, Mr. Tapardjuk talked about an incident that happened recently in Iqaluit where the RCMP went to an elder to say that his adopted son had been vaccinated against the deceased youth centre."</seg>
<seg id="27">This woman is by herself and does not speak English.</seg>
<seg id="28">Mr. Tapardjuk stated that the RCMP had to park the vehicle in order to get assistance in order to report the incident.</seg>
<seg id="29">"There are a number of things that could have been done through this report where an individual has an assistant to make a major change in his life, who did not have an interpreter," Kuutiq told Nunatsiaq News.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Many Inuit who speak English and Inuktitut are invited to work on the project.</seg>
<seg id="31">"We are considered to be interpreters at any time, even if we don't know the people."</seg>
<seg id="32">Sometimes there are privacy issues.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Therefore, I would say that there has been a violation of human rights."</seg>
<seg id="34">"Kiutiq stressed that even Inuktitut-speaking Nunavummiut should have access to professional services in their language such as health, justice and education."</seg>
<seg id="35">Even the information is not readily available.</seg>
<seg id="36">This and other leadership initiatives continue to call on the federal government to preserve language and livelihood in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="37">Mr. Speaker, Ottawa passed a new aboriginal language legislation in June that criticized NTI and ITK for saying that their decisions have not been taken lightly.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Kiutiq said to let people know, "We are the ones who have the authority."</seg>
<seg id="39">Let's speak in Inuktitut when we go to the stores.</seg>
<seg id="40">Let's speak in Inuktitut when we go to the bank.</seg>
<seg id="41">Let us speak in Inuktitut when we go to school.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Once we speak more in Inuktitut and ignore the needs of those who cannot understand, then they will be able to receive a larger share of the needs."</seg>

<seg id="1">QIA announces compensation package for tourism operators in Inuit communities</seg>
<seg id="2">Expenditures</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tourism operators who visit the Qikiqtani communities of Nunavut will now have to pay tourism bills if they wish to access the Inuit land, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association announced at their annual general meeting in Iqaluit October 8 to 10."</seg>
<seg id="4">"Investment in tourism operators now have to pay if people want to get into their own communities in the Qikiqtani region, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association announced at their annual general meeting in Iqaluit Wednesday, October 9."</seg>
<seg id="5">The Qikiqtani region has the highest number of cruise ships visiting Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Pond Inlet had 17 passengers onboard this summer, Iqaluit was approached by four."</seg>
<seg id="7">"The people in the Qikiqtani communities have been quite concerned about this because of the increasing number of tourism activities going on in our territory, especially for the people who carry the ships."</seg>
<seg id="8">"The Qikiqtani Inuit Association subsequently developed a tourism management fee to assist people in communities that are most impacted by cruise ships," P. J. Akeeagok, QIA President, said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="9">Information provided by the Qikiqtani Inuit Association to the Land and Recycling Division indicates that a new system will be installed.</seg>
<seg id="10">New expenditure areas include:</seg>
<seg id="11">â¢ Airplane landings: $150</seg>
<seg id="12">â¢ Helicopters landing in Inuit home: $100</seg>
<seg id="13">â¢ Commercial Tammaativvik Inuit Communities: $50 a day</seg>
<seg id="14">â¢ Enterprising visitors with less than six hours in the Inuit homelands: $25.00 a day</seg>
<seg id="15">"A total of half of the total spending would go to HTOs that are closest to the tourism industry that is available," the press release said.</seg>
<seg id="16">The other half would go to the Qikiqtani Inuit Association.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The number of ships carrying passengers to Nunavut consists of between 150 and 400 passengers," Roseanne D'Arcy, Qikiqtani Inuit Association Director of Lands and Recycling, said at the Qikiqtani Inuit Association Board meeting.</seg>
<seg id="18">The $25 per day fee would apply to all passengers who carry passengers if they were going to go to an Inuit owned community or IOL (Inuit owned community).</seg>
<seg id="19">"No matter how many people on board the ships would be on their own, they would be charged per capita," Mr. D'Arcy said to the board.</seg>
<seg id="20">Carrier said the ships that carry passengers to the islands will have to submit to the Qikiqtani Inuit Association the number of passengers per month or before going boating.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If a ship carrys 350 passengers, we would charge $25 per day."</seg>
<seg id="22">"The larger shipping companies would have to pay anywhere from $10,000 to $20,000 to land in the Inuit homeland," Mr. D'Arcy said.</seg>
<seg id="23">"The communities that have a lot of cruise ships come in during the summer, just like in Pond Inlet, the Hunters and Trappers Organization would get anywhere from $50,000 to $70,000 in fees," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">The new expenditure will also benefit the Qikiqtani Inuit Association from the Land Titles Office.</seg>
<seg id="25">"In this way, tourism operators will be consulted when applying for new fees to access their Inuit communities."</seg>
<seg id="26">Mr. D'Arcy said that QIA set up a fee based on other organizations' fees for tourism.</seg>
<seg id="27">"For example, Parks Canada charges $25 per person to go to a national park."</seg>
<seg id="28">"Hamlets also charge people loading ships and tourism operators to come to their communities," Mr. D'Arcy says.</seg>
<seg id="29">"The ships carrying Inuit passengers are penalized only if they actually come to our community," he says.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Joe Ataguttaaluk, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association secretary/general, asked if it would be possible to increase these expenditures in the future."</seg>
<seg id="31">"Grief said that it would be possible to make changes, but it would have to be discussed and established by the Qikiqtani Inuit Association Board of Directors."</seg>
<seg id="32">"This is an exciting event.</seg>
<seg id="33">"We are once again leading the way in which people can benefit from their communities," Mr. Akeeagok said to the council.</seg>
<seg id="34">"The payments will be made immediately," the Qikiqtani Inuit Association said.</seg>

<seg id="8">Community leaders in Pond Inlet are disappointed with the huge amount of cargo going into the Mary River mine this summer.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Concern expressed that, with Baffinland's proposed rail project expansion in phase 2 of the Blueprint, which has not yet been accepted by the permitting authorities, Baffinland brought in two large ten-plexes to be constructed in Premohavan, Germany, which is the company's docking facility for Mary River's North Baffin this summer."</seg>
<seg id="10">"It also brought in two small pieces of material that could potentially be used for construction and a large piece of heavy equipment that could be used for construction, such as roads and ground turbine."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Baffinland, in November 2018, had indicated to the permitting and enforcement officials at QIA that they would be bringing in, in such a format as public registries to the Nunavut Impact Review Board and the Nunavut Water Board."</seg>
<seg id="12">But the people of Pond Inlet are finally finding out about this.</seg>
<seg id="13">This ship was arriving at Big Brotherhood to the Baffinland port at Mary River this past August carrying a package of structurally sound building materials to be used for a rail expansion.</seg>
<seg id="14">When people in Pond Inlet saw the ship that was near their community they first heard about the barge that was going to be shipped, two more ships that were loaded with railway parts just after it arrived and they are expecting more cargo ships in the summer of 2020.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We only found out about three or four weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We see equipment carrying passengers near Pond Inlet," Joshua Arreak, director of the Pond Inlet Hunters and Trappers Organization told Nunatsiaq News.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We wondered why and who they were and how they were doing it.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We were not given any information from the Nunavut Impact Review Board, Qikiqtani Inuit Association or anyone else."</seg>
<seg id="19">"We didn't expect that," Mr. Arreak said.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We were not informed either by the Qikiqtani Inuit Association or the Nunavut Impact Review Board.</seg>
<seg id="21">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have a problem with the Inuit organizations.</seg>
<seg id="23">"They are not keeping us informed," Mr. Okalik.</seg>
<seg id="24">Nunavut Impact Review Board predicted shipping season</seg>
<seg id="25">"Neither the Nunavut permit holder nor any federal minister has approved the Baffinland expansion plan, which would result in a 110-kilometre rail link connecting Baffinland to Mary River, reintroducing an additional 12 million tonnes in the year, and driving up to 200 times a year carrying iron."</seg>
<seg id="26">This project is not subject to final approval by the federal government until the final public hearings that the Nunavut Impact Review Board has scheduled for November 2 in Iqaluit and concludes on November 8 and 9 in Pond Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="27">"The Nunavut Impact Review Board, in a statement that they did not look into this matter with the stakeholders, stated that they would be bringing in a sealift for the rail that was sent on July 25."</seg>
<seg id="28">"The Nunavut Impact Review Board told the companies that if Phase 2 is not approved, Baffinland would have to deal with the equipment shipment, which could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, from the mine site."</seg>
<seg id="29">It also indicated that the shipping season would not have an impact on NIRB's decision on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="30">"In an email dated October 17, the Nunavut Impact Review Board's executive director, Ryan Perry, confirmed that the Nunavut Impact Review Board has the authority to approve or reject cruise ship activity."</seg>
<seg id="31">"The Nunavut Impact Review Board could simply say that steps to be taken to investigate and that all property construction projects would have to be moved if the proposal was rejected after the board's review," Barry wrote.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is an aeroplane photograph of Big Brothers. This past summer the ship was carrying out a preliminary package of materials for the Mary River concrete that will be used for the Baffinland rail expansion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"One of the buildings, described as a "destructive unit," is 33 metres high, is 23.5 metres high and weighs 1,470 tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="34">"On the other hand, it's referred to as the "School House," which is 34 metres high."</seg>
<seg id="35">"So each unit, which is a part of an existing storage and contamination facility, is equivalent to ten floor buildings - perhaps even higher than the buildings in the Eastern Arctic."</seg>
<seg id="36">However, Mr. Speaker, Baffinland has not been accepted to use this new technology.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Baffinland will declare these assets only 'under Phase 2' - not "unless Phase 2 of the Request For Proposal is complete," the company wrote in its July 19 report to the Nunavut Impact Review Board.</seg>
<seg id="38">Equipment Acquisitions for Inuit Ownership</seg>
<seg id="39">"In joint submissions to the Land Titles Office, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association and Mr. Bavinla wrote that the assets would be located on Inuit owned land, in line with the Qikiqtani Inuit Association's commercial lease agreement with the company."</seg>
<seg id="40">"As for Mr. Arreak and so on, events such as this indicate that Baffinland has already been accepted for the project."</seg>
<seg id="41">"The people of Pond Inlet are not happy.</seg>
<seg id="42">I'm wondering if Baffinland is thinking that maybe Baffinland is thinking that when we don't find out whether the Nunavut Impact Review Board or the government has pre-approved that project.</seg>
<seg id="43">"I don't know," he said.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Rong Chester, a technical consultant from the Pond Inlet Hamlet, was granted permission by the Mayor of Pond Inlet, Joshua Chester, to speak to Nunatsiaq News on behalf of the Hamlet."</seg>
<seg id="45">"Baffinland has been working on the assumption that they will be accepted in Phase 2," Mr. Tester said in an email.</seg>
<seg id="46">"If the Nunavut Impact Review Board had the authority to do this, the final impact would be to challenge the Nunavut Impact Review Board through the appropriate authorization and approval of the application."</seg>
<seg id="47">"That's a concern," Mr. Tester said on behalf of the hamlet.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Other than that, the Hamlet feels that they shouldn't have done that."</seg>
<seg id="49">"This is an accounting exercise and it is in the interest of Baffinland to approve Phase 2," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="50">"Our main concern is the animals, marine wildlife and their presence."</seg>
<seg id="51">We would be the most affected in our community.</seg>
<seg id="52">That is our concern.</seg>
<seg id="53">"Funding will not recover," Joshua Arreak said on behalf of the Hunters and Trappers Organization, announcing something that has been talked about in Pond Inlet for a number of years regarding the Marine Transportation Strategy.</seg>
<seg id="54">"For non-governmental organizations such as the Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary's North, which has expressed an interest in hosting the Baffinland Improvement Plan, they have expressed support for a "responsible development" on the Mary River Project.</seg>
<seg id="55">"However it also indicated that Baffinland's exports of large quantities of facsimile did not take into account the environmental impacts, nor was it satisfied with Baffinland's decision to move large quantities of metal from Mary River to Southern Arctic Bay, which had been achieved in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="56">"It's no surprise that the residents are not satisfied with the huge amount of rail freight that is being flown in by Baffinland prior to the legalization of this expansion," said Chris Debiki, vice-president of policy and legal affairs at the Canadian Coast Guard for the North.</seg>
<seg id="57">Pre-constructed equipment acquired from Tysoncroft</seg>
<seg id="58">The following materials that are being brought in for the Mary River Project are included in the pre-developed railway materials which were acquired by Baffinland at Tysoncroft Various in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="59">"Two large buildings, the first of which came in, were designed in Primohavan, which is a third-built, railway loading facility, which was designed in Stein, Poland," the Isakora newspaper said.</seg>
<seg id="60">"Baffinland also brought in an underwater loader, a concrete trailer and a number of other equipment to be used for road transportation."</seg>
<seg id="61">"The material listing of Baffinland's submissions to the Nunavut Impact Review Board and the Nunavut Water Board included rail links and road links, as well as turbine metal and solid waste."</seg>
<seg id="62">"Tysoncroft's first shipment was sent to Baffinland, a ship called BigLift Barentsz, which weighed 5,500 tonnes of goods, and departed from Birmingham in early August."</seg>
<seg id="63">"Two additional cargo ships were loaded with additional supplies this summer, and many more will arrive in the summer of 2020," Mr. Tiscorab said.</seg>
<seg id="64">"Under a joint agreement with the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, Baffinland agreed to invest an additional 18 million dollars in a recovery fund for the cleanup of the Mary River mine at the end of the project, the Water Board's report said."</seg>

<seg id="1">The Montreal Women's Centre is announcing plans for an emergency overnight centre</seg>
<seg id="2">Inuit Women's 15% attends this women's centre</seg>
<seg id="3">"Marina Blue-Winton, Director of the Women's Shelter (Chez Doris), Women's Shelter and Kathy Wong, City Councillor representing Peter-Maggie on the ground and a spokesman for the Montreal City Council, presented a plan for a 22-bed women's homeless shelter in Montreal on October 16 during a press release on the women's shelter.</seg>
<seg id="4">(Photo from the City of Montreal)</seg>
<seg id="5">"The Montreal Downtown area here in Phil-Murray is able to begin the expansion project started by the women's centre, the day homeless shelter for women, which was a land-based switch that was built last year."</seg>
<seg id="6">"The residents' decision, which is announced on Wednesday, October 16, will allow for the establishment of a new facility in a remote location, which will lead to an emergency night for women."</seg>
<seg id="7">"The Women's Upgvik, Women's Day Facility at 1430 Smith Road in Montreal, is open every day for a week for women in need."</seg>
<seg id="8">Many of them are Inuit.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The women's centre right now is on Samiit Road, not too far from Ottawa and the Caribbean Square, a gathering place for people in town."</seg>
<seg id="10">"The women's centre is well known to many people, with its 15% attendance rate."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Determined to open in the winter of 2021, this facility is an emergency night program that was purchased with a grant of $1 million from Montreal by the businessman Andrew Harper through the Jewish Community Foundation in Montreal."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Thanks to the new facility, we will be able to accommodate 22 beds for women who are homeless," said Marina Blue-Winton, managing director of the Sargent Cross, said in a press release following the event at the women's shelter.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Currently, women account for 25 percent of the homeless population in Montreal, but the benefits for women are inadequate."</seg>
<seg id="14">This is a pilot project."</seg>
<seg id="15">"This is good news that the Utaqqivik expansion was announced less than a week after the person at the Utaqqivik Centre, Clara Okatsiakjuak, a former resident of Nunatsiaq, passed away on October 11 at the hospital."</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr. Bowler-Winton told Nunatsiaq News that when Mr. Okatsiak's daughter committed suicide while incarcerated she had a chronic illness.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Most of the people that go to the centres get into the city because of lack of housing and legal problems," Mr. Berlow-Winton said.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Many people go to the women's shelter during the day and there's a six-bed shelter here for a few hours and then sleep at night."</seg>
<seg id="19">This change will result in a new night's sleep.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Right now, the women's centre, which is about 100 women a day, provides services and programs to women that are in need of homelessness, food insecurity, mental health and substance abuse."</seg>
<seg id="21">Mr. Bowler-Winton said that the number of Inuit women coming here has not changed significantly since 2018.</seg>
<seg id="22">"However, we have relied on women who are in need of specialized services such as clothing and dermatology," he says.</seg>
<seg id="23">"This is the only women's day home in Montreal, the Serge Doris Women's Shelter is open seven days a week from 8:30 a.m. to 3:00 p.m."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Due to the fact that they were able to run the income support program, the women's shelter was on leave without a weekend service for six months in 2014 due to lack of funding."</seg>
<seg id="25">"We're hoping that we can get some funding from Makivik, but we don't know if we're going to get it at this time," said Blue-Winton.</seg>
<seg id="26">"The Women's Shelter also runs the Social Advocacy Office - however the Women's Shelter fundraises to do this work, which accounts for nearly 70 percent of its operations from $1.7 million a year."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Kathy Wong, a city councillor representing Peter-Maggie's community and speaker of the Montreal City Council, said during the announcement that a new night approach and more women should be offering "services offered to people who want to be healthy and safe."</seg>

<seg id="1">No use of Nunavut Liberals</seg>
<seg id="2">"In terms of serious questions, the Liberals weren't fully prepared."</seg>
<seg id="3">Mamilaaq Qaqqaq's win on October 21 marks a significant turning point in refusing to endorse the Liberal Policy for Nunavut and the North.</seg>
<seg id="4">Do you remember the Liberal report?</seg>
<seg id="5">They report on a series of things.</seg>
<seg id="6">There are more things that we can remember.</seg>
<seg id="7">"That doesn't matter, because the majority of Nunavut voters tabled the report on October 21, which they didn't."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Effective 2015, Justin Trudeau and other Liberal Democrats in Nunavut have published many reports."</seg>
<seg id="9">Some of the new information came up.</seg>
<seg id="10">"In the end, the people of Nunavut were just saying "nine."</seg>
<seg id="11">"In the end, it was much stronger for this political party, since 1961, that the Canadian people have turned to the party for change: New Democratic Party."</seg>
<seg id="12">"This unnamed Mamilaaq Qaqqaq's win is a sign of rejection of Trudeau's actions in the north and north of Canada, which includes the rejection of the ongoing Inuit-Federation partnership."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Since 2015, Trudeau has been working with co-management partners such as Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, Qikiqtani Inuit Association and others."</seg>
<seg id="14">However, this week's election campaign demonstrates to Nunavummiut that the Inuit-Federal relationship is not working well.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It's a little disturbing, because in the end, in Nunavut, the Liberal Democrats didn't have the answers."</seg>
<seg id="16">"It's no secret to the majority of people in Nunavut that some of the biggest concerns are economic and social issues: the lack of housing, food insecurity, the high cost of food in stores, the high cost of transportation, the high rate of tuberculosis and suicide, which is on a daily basis."</seg>
<seg id="17">"However, in the last trip to Nunavut on October 8, Trudeau did not have much interest in these issues."</seg>
<seg id="18">He spoke about South Baffin and discussed climate change and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="19">"These are national issues, but at this time of the election, Nunavummiut want to hear their concerns about housing and the high cost of living."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Instead it was Sylvia Grinnell River where the ground is for photographs, not for Nunavut voters, but for southern Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="21">"In doing so, he did not respond to the great interests of Nunavummiut and to the efforts of the Nunavut Liberal candidate Megan Pizzo-Lyall, who would have benefited from greater support from the Liberal Party."</seg>
<seg id="22">"In terms of food prices and poor nutrition, the Liberals took action, developed a higher subsidy for Nutrition North Canada Program, and provided additional funding of $12.5 million a year for aboriginal hunters in Nunavut and other parts of the north."</seg>
<seg id="23">But the hunter support program has to come out and no one can say why that is.</seg>
<seg id="24">"On August 1st as well, Toronto was very active in the area of Iqaluit and Arctic Bay, signing an agreement on the establishment of the Lancaster Sound Marine Conservation Area and committing to initiating a new conservation area called Toronto Bay."</seg>
<seg id="25">"This provides a significant amount of funding to communities in North Baffin, such as small craft harbours and conservation areas."</seg>
<seg id="26">He talked a lot about protecting the aboriginal rights of aboriginal people.</seg>
<seg id="27">"The inadequacy of such an approach is such that: constantly tearing up TB in an overcrowded house, this "union" doesn't make any sense."</seg>
<seg id="28">"Keeping that in mind, do you remember the Liberal Government's big message about TB?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"This was done in early 2018, when Jane Weber, the former Health Minister at the time, announced that the tuberculosis will be eliminated in the Inuit homeland by 2030."</seg>
<seg id="30">But Mr. Weber, the Federal Minister said that he would be dealing with this issue now that it is gone.</seg>
<seg id="31">"In response to Trudeau's actions by Jody Wyson Rebels and in conflict of interest with the SNC-Lavalin, Mr. Weber resigned from the conference."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Since then, the Liberals have not heard about TB prevention."</seg>
<seg id="33">"It is likely that the recent harvester support program, which is stuck in the traditional Inuit-Federal relationship, leads to significant discussions about tuberculosis prevention.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Public awareness of TB is linked to poverty, poor nutrition and housing."</seg>
<seg id="35">"But on the housing front, Trudeau advertised an existing temperature and an additional comment last summer."</seg>
<seg id="36">"And the Government of Canada's National Social Housing Program, "Structured" by ITK, has been an unpredictable undertaking."</seg>
<seg id="37">We would also like to congratulate Mamilaaq Qaqqaq for winning.</seg>
<seg id="38">"As a Member of the Fourth Legislative Assembly, a Member of the Legislative Assembly will need to be supported in order to be heard."</seg>
<seg id="39">Let the people of Nunavut just give him a little bit of time and support.</seg>
<seg id="40">"Qaqqaq won two championships, Leona Aglukkaq and Megan Pizzo-Lyall."</seg>
<seg id="41">I hope these two continue to ignore the losses they have caused to Nunavummiut and to the north.</seg>

<seg id="1">Members asked the Minister about the $80 million increase in the Weber Abbott Road Project</seg>
<seg id="2">"Looking at my colleagues here, we're more than willing to make a decision on the $80 million."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Joelie Kownirk, MLA for Amittuq, was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut asking the government for a $80 million dollar increase in the Iqaluit-Nuuk area for the Weber Abuse Program."</seg>
<seg id="4">Some Nunavut lawyers are now asking for unspecified assistance to expand the Nuuk-Iqaluit Weber Apartment Project.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Last August, the federal government committed $151 million towards this project, which is directed toward a 1,700-kilometre Viper Abbett Nuuk, Greenland-based all-weather route from Baffin Bay to Iqaluit."</seg>
<seg id="6">From there, it will be shipped to Kimmirut.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The Government of Nunavut will design and initiate the project, which should be completed by 2023."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Last year, the Legislative Assembly approved this project, which cost $126 million."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Over the course of the year, we were informed that the project's value was increased to reflect the increased costs and that it is now estimated at $209 million," John Main, MLA for Arviat North-Whale Cove, said in a member's statement Wednesday, October 23.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This $80 million difference," Maine said.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Looking at my colleagues we can make good decisions for the $80 million," Maine said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The federal contribution comes from small and northern communities for infrastructure in the Investing in Canada Plan.</seg>
<seg id="13">The project is now before the Standing Committee on Legislation for review of proposed capital estimates for 2020/21.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Later in question period, Joelie Kaynik, MLA for Amittuq asked Quassa Kusugak, Minister of Community and Government Services, if this $80 million increase is something that the government plans to do."</seg>
<seg id="15">"This process, as outlined in the GN's Budget Planning Process, "regards whether the program has a clear definition, and access to information on development, appropriate cost details and time frames, prior to beginning the budget process."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Was it a preplanning study, or not?"</seg>
<seg id="17">The question is directed to Mr. Kusugak.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Planning is completed and cost estimates are still underway.</seg>
<seg id="19">"When we were informed, we found out that it was going to cost a lot more," Ms. Kusugak says.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Mayne, sitting next to me is the Chairman of the House, rises to ask more questions in Kusugak."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Can the minister indicate how this significant project has resulted in cost increases over the past year?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"Ms. Kusugak reiterated that after this appropriation was approved last year, the department re-looked at the project and that the cost had increased substantially."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Ms. Kusugak reiterated that, in May 2019 the department felt that the funding request would have to grow to $201.6 million "with the largest amount of federal contribution to make available to the program if required."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Tomorrow, October 24, Maine rose again during Question Period to follow up with Finance Minister George Hickes on the same issue."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Under the Financial Management Board, what process was followed and what action was taken to inform the department of the $80 million cost escalation in this area?"</seg>
<seg id="26">Maine asked.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Mr. Hickes noted that with the federal contribution to the expansion project, as well as the very positive contribution from the Marine Mammal Research Institute, the Government of Nunavut has also increased its support."</seg>
<seg id="28">"The Department of Community and Government Services re-submitted it to the Financial Management Board as a result of the findings that the expenditure base was insufficient."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hickes also mentioned that half of the Government of Nunavut's 25 percent contribution to this program is the federal government's 75 percent contribution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"As the Government of Nunavut, we don't have to spend $80 million, and we have to pay 25 percent of that."</seg>
<seg id="31">"What we're going to do is look at, in the next few years, what additional support will be required to complete this project," he said.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Nunavik has to have its own federal lawyer," says Makivik.</seg>
<seg id="2">Charlie Ford during the federal election talks about the need for change</seg>
<seg id="3">"Charlie Ford, President of Makivik Corporation, issued a news release on October 22 following the federal election, indicating that Nunavik needed its own federal lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="4">By Elaine Andrews</seg>
<seg id="5">"The Makivik President Charlie Ford did not condemn his statement to the Nunavik Law Foundation when he announced his appointment to the new Assembly, Shervie Brobe."</seg>
<seg id="6">"We will seek the advice of the Electoral Boundaries Commission to reinforce this message, in other words, that Nunavik will have its own political party that reflects our territory, which is what it wants right now given the ability to do so," he says.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We need this provincial model."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Abbey-James Bay-Nunavik-Yeo is the largest federal political program in Quebec, ran from Nunavik South to La Valley-Ore to the mainland communities, of which four of the six 2019 federal candidates are residents, including Barbie to Black Cooper."</seg>
<seg id="9">Nunavik leaders have chosen to form their own government in their home community since 1972.</seg>
<seg id="10">"In 2002, the Kativik Board of Directors, including the Government of Nunavut, travelled to Makivik, the federal electoral district commission for this purpose and again in 2011."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Since division it increased in 2013, by adding two more communities to the south."</seg>
<seg id="12">"The districts were re-designed, under the commission, so as to achieve a representative level."</seg>
<seg id="13">"In the whole of Quebec, it's 100,000 people in the region. The snow-blower-James-Nunavik-Yeo is less than 85,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="14">"While Nunavik has a population of about 13,000, Nunavik has been primarily below that, but its leaders have a direct response to the situation here in Nunavik."</seg>
<seg id="15">"The smallest jurisdiction in Canada is Labrador, which has a population of about 26,000, while the province of Newfoundland has around 80,000."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Perubi won the Northern Quebec by over 11,000, or 40%, respectively, behind the Liberal and Conservative candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Ward celebrated with the Green Party candidate Keira Kabana-Widley, an Inuk from Kuujjuaq, who placed fifth overall with over 1,000 votes."</seg>
<seg id="18">"During her speech in Fort Worth, she invited Brube to visit Nunavik as soon as possible."</seg>
<seg id="19">"I look forward to meeting with him, and supporting him in our own endeavours, and issues such as the enforcement of the Jonathan Act on the Rights of Indigenous People," Ford said.</seg>
<seg id="20">"There was a significant announcement by Black Quebecois President Eves-Francois Blanchard, whose separation team won 32 seats for Quebec."</seg>
<seg id="21">"We look forward to supporting us in our efforts to develop our work in Nunavik - both legal and economic - and legal to establish a fair working relationship," said Ford.</seg>
<seg id="22">"However, with Quebec's desire for independence, Inuit have long supported a national unity."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Mr. Ward set up the election, although the Liberals do not have seats in the new government, to provide opportunities for the different parties to come together and meet nationally."</seg>

<seg id="1">"Reinstatement of the RSV in Nunavut," thousands of comments</seg>
<seg id="2">"For Inuit, you save money on respiratory illnesses"</seg>
<seg id="3">This air ambulance service in Nunavut is stopped at the Iqaluit airport during the summer air ambulance services.</seg>
<seg id="4">"In some years, when a child suffers from tuberculosis (RSV, respiratory virus), they have to be transported and that's the use of airplane and hospital spending."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Dr. Anna Panuji and her peers at the Toronto University School of Health collaborated in 1989 on the first time she introduced this program under Change.org at the end of September, and thousands of people signed it."</seg>
<seg id="6">"However, when this report was first drafted, it collected 23,322 signatures - and now wants to reach 25,000 signatures."</seg>
<seg id="7">The disclosure statement stated that the Government of Nunavut would provide protection for the highest number of deaths and reductions in infant mortality rates by implementing a palivizumab for all infants under six months old.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Palivizumab is an anti-viral, not anti-vaccine, and it is a marketing campaign called Synagogue."</seg>
<seg id="9">"It has been proven that infant mortality from RSV, a short summary of "respiratory synthesis," which leads to lower lung inflammation, and leads to diseases of alarm that are called bronchiolitis."</seg>
<seg id="10">"However, Dr. Michael Patterson, the Chief Medical Officer of Nunavut, told the Nunatsiaq News in an interview that the Government of Nunavut provides palivizumab from 11 percent to 12 percent for children under the age of 2."</seg>
<seg id="11">"We use them more for infants who may be at risk of developing RSV, and for those who support the world's donations of palivizumab," he says.</seg>
<seg id="12">"These include infants born with less than 35 weeks of pregnancy, or infants with chronic lung disease or heart disease."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Panner, a professor of child welfare at the Toronto University School of Medicine, has been writing curriculum for 15 years about the ongoing presence and cost of RSV in the north."</seg>
<seg id="14">"On the diagnostic side, this individual is very dissatisfied with the current Nunavut policy and says that all Nunavut children need this preventative medicine."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Dr. Anna Panuji, one of the senior educators in child care at the Toronto University School of Medicine, said research into Inuit infants by vaccinating a vaccine called palivizumab would greatly benefit your life and the economy."</seg>
<seg id="16">The cost of living in Nunavut is significant.</seg>
<seg id="17">He indicated that his analysis of the RSV disease would provide and multiply and lead to the development of a series of airlift and hospital services for Nunavut health professionals.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The preventative side of medicine is very expensive. It's approximately $5,600 per antibiotics."</seg>
<seg id="19">"However, even with this price tag, Panoji and many others believe this price tag has been reduced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"That's because in Nunavut we have a disease that is easily diseased and we have the best medivac, the best answer."</seg>
<seg id="21">"We have done a lot of feasibility studies that have demonstrated in the north that if we give more people in palivizumab, that there would be savings," he said in an interview.</seg>
<seg id="22">"The cost-benefit analysis, published in 2013, identified a significant number of lung cancers in Kitikmeot infants: set at 389 of 1,000."</seg>
<seg id="23">"The study, which was conducted from January 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010, found that the cost of medical travel for this illness ranged from $57,535."</seg>
<seg id="24">"In the Qikiqtani region, lung cancer infants were diagnosed in 2002 of 1,000 newborns and in the Kivalliq, 230 of them were 1,000 newborns."</seg>
<seg id="25">This means that the Government of Nunavut has spent $5.9 million dollars on palliative and palliative care in the Qikiqtani region and approximately $5.7 million dollars in the Kivalliq for palliative care and that was the result of that study.</seg>
<seg id="26">"However, as it stands now, Kivalliq was the top for lung cancer treatment: $63,686."</seg>
<seg id="27">"For people, it's a lot more economical, because of lung cancer," he says.</seg>
<seg id="28">The Chief Medical Officer of Ontario supports the petition</seg>
<seg id="29">"Inuit infants are ten times more likely to be treated at the hospital for tuberculosis than the "risky" infants and the disease is even more severe.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Although this is a major problem, Inuit infants do not get a Nunavut disease," Gandy wrote in her submission.</seg>
<seg id="31">"This is a situation where professionals are identified at the Northern Schools of Health, Health Canada Association and the Canadian Medical Research Institute for Indigenous Peoples."</seg>
<seg id="32">But it's okay that infants in Nunavut that graduate from the program do not receive this disease, even if they come from an infant in a community other than Iqaluit and they have a lot more chronic pain than lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="33">Mr. Barnabas is indicating that they are doing it incorrectly.</seg>
<seg id="34">"I've worked very hard.</seg>
<seg id="35">I have also shown my identifying them to the public.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Carolyn Bennett, Jane Webster, they have seen what I have written and they have said what I believe in," she says.</seg>
<seg id="37">Nunavik vaccinates all infants</seg>
<seg id="38">"She also revealed that, unlike in Nunavut, health care providers in Nunavik have provided palivizumab to all infants over the past three years."</seg>
<seg id="39">"At the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut on October 18, the Minister of Health George Hickes indicated in response to questions from the Iqaluit-Niaqunnguu MLA Pat Angnakak, that the Government of Nunavut take a closer look at the situation in Nunavik."</seg>
<seg id="40">"We are tracking that particular project," said Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="41">Ms. Angnakak stated that RSV is a very important part of the family.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Not too long ago, I know her infant had to be sent to a hospital for RSV and it affected the family, especially this young child."</seg>
<seg id="43">However, Mr. Hickes defended the Government of Nunavut's current practices and said that the government was not only investing in Inuit but providing this service.</seg>
<seg id="44">"This is not a legal or policy decision on the price.</seg>
<seg id="45">"It depends on the quality of health care," Mr. Hickes says.</seg>
<seg id="46">Mr. Patterson reiterated that Nunavik's program was a three-year program that started with infants under the age of six.</seg>
<seg id="47">"We're still waiting for the numbers on that, and if we find out properly that there are savings by providing palivizumab, then we will quickly implement that," Patterson said.</seg>
<seg id="48">"However, in his view, there is still not enough evidence to prove to be effective in Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="49">"There are two things that I don't agree with in the signing and the other one is that the signing ceremony is complete, or there is a scientific evidence to that effect."</seg>
<seg id="50">"There are a lot of people who still have questions," he said.</seg>
<seg id="51">The practice of palivizumab in Nunavut has come a long way.</seg>
<seg id="52">"In 2008, the Government of Nunavut refused to participate or participate in Panniqtuuq research on RSV, or professionals from Greenland, Nunavik and the Northwest Territories."</seg>

<seg id="2">Nunavik Construction Company (Nunavik) is offering small construction programs</seg>
<seg id="3">"The small building is on display, from Nunavik Construction Company, to Churchill this past summer."</seg>
<seg id="4">(Photograph of Nunavik Construction Corporation)</seg>
<seg id="5">The first group of small materials to be constructed in Nunavik arrived in Kuujjuaq this summer.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I wanted to show you how beautiful we have been building in the north," says Willie Gatborough, founder of Nunavik Construction, Homes Repair and Engineering Offices in Kuujjuaq and Naplesville, Quebec.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Ten years ago, Gatborough, Churchill, a plumber, oil burner mechanic and a construction engineer had a conflict with housing expert Claude Jennell."</seg>
<seg id="8">"We started talking about affordable housing in the north," Mr. Godford says.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Housing in the north is too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="10">It started from there."</seg>
<seg id="11">Out of that, they have developed designs for small units that reflect northern climates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Buildings with steel frames and roofs with strong winds can be avoided and can be used for longer periods.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Developed insulation is made of insulated panels, roofs and roofs and three-blade windows to keep the heat warm."</seg>
<seg id="14">"They have basic heating systems, it's not like wall-related furnaces, it's compared to the heating systems in the whole building."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I think that's the only way in the north," Mr. Gabbard said.</seg>
<seg id="16">"There's a lot of problems with furnaces and usually the heating system only goes partially.</seg>
<seg id="17">People are saying that their feet are starting to freeze.</seg>
<seg id="18">Their houses are insulated but they're still walking around."</seg>
<seg id="19">The design for the Nunavik building is a one-bedroom cabin.</seg>
<seg id="20">(Photograph from Nunavik Construction Corporation)</seg>
<seg id="21">"With the creation of boilers and pipes across Nunavut, Mr. Gabbard deals with making sure the buildings are built on a scale, ensuring everything is in order and maintained."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Nunavik Construction has a variety of conditions for small, four bedroom units, and a spacious location for this."</seg>
<seg id="23">"They can add more room and they can expand, for example, when they have a bigger child."</seg>
<seg id="24">"The building is on display in Kuujjuaq with a one-bedroom, size 5 metres to 10 metres to Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="25">It has a entrance at the end of the building to the kitchen and the living area.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is just behind the room and behind the washroom.</seg>
<seg id="27">The power plant is located in a different building over there.</seg>
<seg id="28">It took approximately two hours for the building to be completed and installed, along with electrical and plumbing.</seg>
<seg id="29">"This house can be purchased for $228,000, for the garbage and all the interiors," said Mr. Gabbor.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Nunavik house costs between $500,000 and $600,000," he says.</seg>
<seg id="31">"We're trying to build affordable housing with adequate space and inadequate water routes," says Mr. Gabbor.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I've been a plumber, an octane specialist for many years and a lot of the products are fixed, the pipes are not up to par, the furnace is not up to par."</seg>
<seg id="33">I have built this many years and now we have something that is more suitable for the north."</seg>
<seg id="34">"Buildings are built in Soperbrook, Quebec, and in the month of construction, Gatborough says, and trucked into the community are delivered on the sealift."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Once we get the orders and the site is on time for sealift, we'll be in a position to have the building in place by next summer."</seg>
<seg id="36">"In the future, if this goes well, we are looking at creating jobs in the north," he says.</seg>
<seg id="37">"However, this requires significant investment."</seg>
<seg id="38">He went on to say that the facilities across the north would be adequate and they would be more than happy to receive orders from Nunavut or from Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="39">"We're open and we're just waiting for payment consultants and they're planning to build houses," said Mr. Gabbard.</seg>
<seg id="40">"The plan is to help people in need."</seg>

<seg id="1">"In northern Canada, sea ice is at its lowest level right now."</seg>
<seg id="2">"We may be a month behind schedule for the rest of the year."</seg>
<seg id="3">"The freeze up is way behind this year," says Gjoa Haven resident Willie Aglukkaq, pictured on October 18.</seg>
<seg id="4">"It's still a boating trip to the mainland, which is not the case in Gjoa Haven."</seg>
<seg id="5">I have not seen the ice conditions in my lifetime."</seg>

<seg id="8">"Last October, this was Judah Sarpinak from Igloolik who started seal hunting and he had to go by snowmobile."</seg>
<seg id="9">"At the same time in the year, he had to go boating."</seg>
<seg id="10">"In Nunavut and other parts of the north, it's the same thing."</seg>
<seg id="11">"This is the first time I have seen this freeze in my entire life," says Willie Aglukkaq, who lives in Gjoa Haven for almost 40 years.</seg>
<seg id="12">That is correct.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Last October 15 sea ice caps were at 5.118 million kilometres, the lowest level since records began in 1968."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Depending on the location, we may be in a position for a month late than a year ago," said Jews Laggie, an inspector of land services in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="15">But this is not the first year that the ice is too low.</seg>
<seg id="16">In April, there was a lack of ice in the draft form.</seg>
<seg id="17">The report was drafted in July.</seg>
<seg id="18">In August, the ice shortage slowed down."</seg>
<seg id="19">"We were leveled with the lowest (from ice) rates in 2007 and 2016, but still higher than in 2012," said Border Mayer, senior researcher at the National Institute of Technology and Neuroscience.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Unfortunately we are lower than 2012 levels when that happens because of the slow freeze-up in 2012 and it quickly returned to normal, but the winter is very slow with ice."</seg>
<seg id="21">"As of October 15, ice thresholds were lower than in 2012, at that time."</seg>

<seg id="23">Europe's ice potential depends on the climate.</seg>
<seg id="24">"If there's a water that doesn't have ice and the warmer temperatures are colder in the water, then even if the temperature is out there it gets colder and the water gets colder or frozen early," says Lang.</seg>
<seg id="25">"However, the arctic temperatures in October are very unseasonably hot, warming over the past six months."</seg>
<seg id="26">"It was a very summer," said Mayer.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Effective April, monthly temperatures remained the third warmest month in recorded history - this was May and August."</seg>
<seg id="28">(Photo by UNEP)</seg>
<seg id="29">This year's event will bring even greater results.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Through global warming such as innovative vehicles, we have seen a reduction in ice thickness since 1979," said Paschal Patuji, Director of the GRID-Geneva, in a press release issued by the Jonathan Nissan's Department of Environment.</seg>
<seg id="31">"What is happening this year in the north is a reduction in ice has contributed to global warming over the years."</seg>
<seg id="32">"According to this news release, "The average temperature has risen to 0.5Â°C in the last ten years between 1982 and 2017, primarily due to the solar impact that surfaced in 1979."</seg>
<seg id="33">This is twice as fast as the world usage."</seg>
<seg id="34">This summer is not unique.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Even though the season is going on, the season is going backwards."</seg>
<seg id="36">"The ice is finally freezing," said Aglukkaq.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Over the past ten days, since October 20, sea ice has increased by approximately 1.5 million kilometres, including water near Gjoa Haven."</seg>

<seg id="2">"For me this is a joyous event."</seg>
<seg id="3">Gordon Howard of Iqaluit became the Iqaluit Fire Chief for the past two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Since then he has been reading and studying, but he is saying that his new position can do more."</seg>
<seg id="5">(Photographer Dustin Botha)</seg>
<seg id="6">"When Gordon Howard attended the City Council's first public meeting on October 22 as the fire chief, he did not expect to be questioned."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Do you support Montreal Canadiens?"</seg>
<seg id="8">Asked by the Member Joanasie Akumalik.</seg>
<seg id="9">"After a while of silence, Mr. Howard responded, "No."</seg>
<seg id="10">They are here with a great laugh.</seg>
<seg id="11">"A week later, in an interview with Nunatsiaq News, Mr. Harvard said, "That's when I thought my clients weren't heard."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mr. Howard, who grew up in Hamilton, went to Iqaluit via Metro, Ontario, a town near Collingwood in the Georgian Bay."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Although he is here for the first time, he is also from the north."</seg>
<seg id="14">"During the past ten years as the Emergency Measures Organization's Health Officer for the Canadian Rangers, near Arviat has camped in the middle of winter."</seg>

<seg id="18">That was the only thing Mr. Hawthorn did not go to Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition to their experience as a firefighter and emergency response - which rarely happens in other areas - this was due to the Iqaluit fire situation.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The actions of this department are awful," said Howard.</seg>
<seg id="21">"It's a lot of work here, and the techniques are always in place."</seg>
<seg id="22">"The activities of the department are carried out in such areas as, and now Hawaii, a new area, such as water disputes and inadequate assistance, to the point of encounter and because the fire hall is so small."</seg>
<seg id="23">"We can't change this overnight and it seems like nothing changes overnight.</seg>
<seg id="24">"If we keep moving forward and not going backwards I would be happy," said Mr. Harvard.</seg>
<seg id="25">"To me, it's an exciting project."</seg>
<seg id="26">"It's exciting, we're going to try and do what we know we can."</seg>
<seg id="27">"In response to the first question from the city that he's now the designate director for emergency services, "I'm the Toronto assistant,"" says Howard smiling.</seg>
<seg id="28">"It's nice to see some people supporting the fire hall in Toronto.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bedbugs have become a concern for Nunavik patients travelling to Montreal</seg>
<seg id="2">The operator of the boarding home says that there are investigations going on but they have never found one.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is just something you wouldn't want to see in the classrooms: bedbugs.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Recently, bedbugs have been seen at the Quaval Boarding Home when patients from Nunavik have arrived in the city."</seg>
<seg id="5">The issue of seeing bedbugs from the Nunavik Boarding Homes when they go down to Montreal is of great concern to the patients and their families.</seg>
<seg id="6">This photograph reveals the bedbugs of Cecilia Tutsaka who saw her last month at the bottom of her mother's bedroom at the Coraldi boarding home in Kurt D'Elise Drawall.</seg>
<seg id="7">(Photo by Cecilia Tutsaka)</seg>
<seg id="8">"In mid-October, Cecilia Kostaka was visiting her mother at the Coraldi boarding home here in Kirk Dee Lee's Dorval and she was very scared: she saw the bed below Ellie's throat, and she took that picture."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Kozaka's seeing bedbugs said to the patient from Nunavik who is monitoring the facility at Ulivvik, which has a number of rooms, 39 accommodations, on the first floor when it's full."</seg>
<seg id="10">Kutsaka phoned her mother and told her that she would never be there again.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The hotel's president, Sister Abdul Nair, told Nunatsiaq News last week that he was dealing with the bedbugs seeing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"This is something that was recently, when there was an investigation, and it was in the cardiac report, they couldn't find it."</seg>
<seg id="13">"One classification was found in this room as bedbugs, but they are no longer with us."</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr. Abdel Noir also posted an e-mail that showed people that had been boarded in bedbugs.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Due to the importance of the Ublivik Boarding Home operation, Abdul Nair said all classrooms were performed this year and are regularly inspected and dealt with if necessary."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Nunatsiaq News couldn't speak to the Nunavik Community Health Board or the Module du nord-quÃ©bÃ©cois who deals with the Nunavik Hospital going to Montreal such as bedbugs and what they are doing about it.</seg>
<seg id="17">The MNQ has a copy of the concerns emailed to Mr. Abdel Nirlunga.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It's almost like people are boarding with bedbugs because they see them and they don't want to stay in a hotel anymore," wrote George Tilatola, President of Ublivik on October 16.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Please inform me of what it is and how and when the problem will be solved.</seg>
<seg id="20">We need to inform the patients that bedbugs were treated."</seg>
<seg id="21">Ublivik will always look after the patients' uniforms or bags before they come in.</seg>
<seg id="22">There are bedbugs in Montreal: the government offices had to be closed in the Complexe Guy-Favreau last month.</seg>
<seg id="23">"And if there are bedbugs in patients from the north, that wouldn't be the first case, as it was in 2010 in Winnipeg."</seg>
<seg id="24">"The bedbugs are very unattractive: they're small, but they make you feel sorry for them, they make you feel good and they make you feel bad after having a skin."</seg>
<seg id="25">The bedbugs have a pipe where they have a cold blood pressure so that the blood is not thick enough and it can cause severe burns.</seg>
<seg id="26">"On another pipe, the bedbug drops in blood, sometimes five minutes after melting, exploring the red and it feels like it's spilt."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Bedbugs eat for five to ten days and can live for a whole year, such as bottom boxes, tiles and other hot, dark and appearance when they want to eat."</seg>
<seg id="28">"The good news is that the bedbugs don't stay cold, so they end up sleeping and passing away."</seg>
<seg id="29">Then you can shoot your bags outside for more than two days without any heat.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Try not to throw beds at you when you're out on the land, check the roof over the head, look at the bottom and keep your bags in the bed."</seg>
<seg id="31">"And when you go home, wash your clothes before they go into your room and check out your bags."</seg>
<seg id="32">"If you see a bed in Montreal, you can call 311 cities.</seg>

<seg id="2">"People need to be involved in the process.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It has an impact on all people's lives," said NTI President.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Representatives from Igloolik and Pond Inlet are listening to the proceedings from Aluki Kuuttiq, NTI President, on the resolution to suspend the Nunavut Impact Review Board's final hearings on Baffinland's phase 2 expansion on Wednesday, November 6 here in Iqaluit."</seg>
<seg id="5">(Photographer Emma Tander)</seg>
<seg id="6">By Emma Tander and Elaine Ansome</seg>
<seg id="7">"The NIRB hearing on Baffinland's proposal to increase the mine at Mary River was suddenly stopped in two days. The next meeting will be held in Pond Inlet."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Wednesday, November 6, Nunavut Tunngavik President Aluki Kuutsiq filed a resolution immediately calling for the resignation of this last public meeting and that the meeting shall continue for eight months to a year."</seg>
<seg id="9">The silent speech was a very interesting speech by one of the parties just looking at it; the members were looking to see what Mr. Baffinland was going to do about this incident.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Baffinland's crew had a good face stop, sometimes they would run the arms and turn the arms around when the river was saying what they wanted."</seg>
<seg id="11">"We are concerned that this public meeting will be concluded without consultation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The people need to be consulted and consulted.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Anyone here would like to understand all the issues and how it would affect NTI and the organizations," Kuutiq said when the chambers are full of speakers and people.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It affects all people's lives," he says.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The motion was introduced during the fifth day of the session in Iqaluit, just before the hour."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Nunavut Impact Review Board's first agenda was to proceed with a public meeting in Pond Inlet on November 8 and 9.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The Nunavut Impact Review Board was generally satisfied with Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated's motion, the meeting was cancelled and the Pond Inlet public meeting was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="18">"About a week, Baffinland representatives of interested parties were regularly presenting their plans for the construction of a railway connecting North Baffin from Mary River to the Mary River port."</seg>
<seg id="19">"This railway and other parts of the port, it would make it easier for the company to produce a larger current 6 million tonnes of coal a year to produce up to 12 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="20">"However it is apparent over the course of the week that Baffinland's request to amend its project permits by removing existing restrictions and by putting in place restricted export restrictions, a 20-gallon highway going back and forth on the 176 sealift year."</seg>
<seg id="21">"The motion to suspend the meeting was supported by all interested parties, many of whom are concerned with the uncertainty of the program."</seg>
<seg id="22">"P. J. Akeeagok, President of the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, stated in the Nunatsiaq News that he believes in the NIRB process that "the public has an opportunity to ask these important questions" and that "it gives residents an opportunity to voice their concerns on an ongoing basis."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Mr. Akeeagok also stated that the motion was not expected, but it was in order on the last day of the session."</seg>
<seg id="24">Baffinland officials are looking at Kutiq's motion to discontinue.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I think that there are too many questions that have not been resolved yet.</seg>
<seg id="26">"From my perspective, if you are going to decide your future, then you have to be informed in order to make proper decisions."</seg>
<seg id="27">There was not enough here."</seg>
<seg id="28">Representatives from the North Baffin communities unanimously voted in favour of the motion.</seg>
<seg id="29">"There needs to be more information and research," said Amanda Hanson-Main, researcher from Pond Inlet Hunters and Trappers Organization.</seg>
<seg id="30">He noted that the project may have "a significant impact on our values as a people and on the world stage."</seg>
<seg id="31">"Some participants at the table expressed dissatisfaction with the Mary River Project, and simply wanted to continue Baffin's work in Nunavut, but they had too many questions and concerns about the proposed expansion."</seg>
<seg id="32">"What we hear is that it is too much water and not enough," said Peter Ivalu, representing the Hamlet of Igloolik.</seg>
<seg id="33">"All information has to be translated.</seg>
<seg id="34">Everything has to be transparent."</seg>
<seg id="35">"The Government of Nunavut also agreed with the motion, on this issue, that there is too much disagreement between the parties involved and the proponent, and this is just a stop."</seg>
<seg id="36">"The Government of Canada also supported the motion, but stated that the Nunavut Impact Review Board could decide how long the moratorium would take."</seg>
<seg id="37">"Through the Department of Justice, Baffinland said they were not satisfied with the motion to stop the eight months and were not satisfied that they were not informed of the motion."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Everything that went into this consultation meeting was supposed to go ahead as of November 2," said Brad Armstrong, a lawyer for Baffinland.</seg>
<seg id="39">"No one suggested that they were not planning on starting this day.</seg>
<seg id="40">None of this was intended to deter them from coming forward."</seg>
<seg id="41">"Megan Lord-Hoyle, the Vice-President of the Recycling Program for Baffinland, said the delay would have an impact on the "urgent problems" program.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Instead we will do all we can to ensure the preservation and protection of 3,000 Canadians for employment, 476 of whom are Inuit."</seg>
<seg id="43">We need to know that people will work with us.</seg>
<seg id="44">"We need to have some room for what the deficiencies are in the program," Lord-Hoole said.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Although the Qikiqtani Inuit Association has stated that they can't help in Phase 2, Mr. Akeeagok stated that they will keep working on the Inuit Communications Program and the program will not be economical."</seg>
<seg id="46">"We are not satisfied with Mary River.</seg>
<seg id="47">We are working with them.</seg>
<seg id="48">We own the Inuit land.</seg>
<seg id="49">"We support Inuit employment," he says.</seg>
<seg id="50">"We have invested significant amounts of money and effort into this project to make money over time.</seg>
<seg id="51">"So with that in mind, we have to find a balance."</seg>
<seg id="52">But there is none at this time."</seg>
<seg id="53">Mr. Akeeagok also noted that the community's uncertainty about the railway impact on our caribou is critical to this project.</seg>
<seg id="54">"As an Inuk, these issues have a profound impact on our traditional rights."</seg>
<seg id="55">"This was very evident to the elders when they were here not only thinking about themselves, this is also part of our future."</seg>
<seg id="56">I am very sensitive to that.</seg>
<seg id="57">"My decisions are not just for now, but for the future."</seg>
<seg id="58">Do I leave them with a better foundation than I was?</seg>
<seg id="59">"That's more of a basis for deciding, no matter how cultured you are," he says.</seg>
<seg id="60">"In accordance with this recommendation, the Nunavut Impact Review Board allowed all interested parties to submit written submissions by November 15."</seg>
<seg id="61">"From there, the Nunavut Impact Review Board will give a written submission to the motion and the timeframe."</seg>

<seg id="1">Nunavut Legislative Assembly agrees to amend the Income Tax Act</seg>
<seg id="2">"Our government is taking a proactive approach to reinvestment in the Caribbean."</seg>
<seg id="3">"The Honourable Adam Mitchellan questioned the Minister of Finance George Hickes on Bill 26, An Act to Amend the Income Tax Act, during the Legislative Assembly on Wednesday, November 6."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Nunavut Legislative Assembly amended the Nunavut Income Tax Act to amend the Carbon Tax Act.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The changes, which were read for the third time on Wednesday, November 6, included increases to personal expenses of $13,325 to $16,000."</seg>
<seg id="6">"This means that taxpayers will earn close to $3,000 a year before they have to pay the Nunavut personal income tax."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Another change is the increase in the cost of living tax liability from $1,200 to $1,500."</seg>
<seg id="8">"This means that taxpayers who make more than $60,000 in their work will receive an additional $300 in income tax."</seg>
<seg id="9">As well, Nunavut's corporate income tax rates for small businesses have dropped from 4 percent to 3 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Our government is taking a proactive approach to reinvestment in the Caribbean," said the Minister of Finance, George Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The federal government's position on the Carbon Tax Rebate Program came into effect in Nunavut on July 1, in an effort to make the fuel price more appropriate - it would have increased by 5 cents per litre - the Government of Nunavut introduced a Carbon Tax Rebate Program that would reduce the price of fuel by 50 cents per litre."</seg>
<seg id="12">"In its deliberations on the issue of income tax reform, Nunavut MLAs agreed that the Caribbean tax revenues should be returned to Nunavummiut."</seg>
<seg id="13">They couldn't agree on how best to do that.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Mr. Adam Lysytheon, the Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, expressed concern that, in the event of an increase in personal income tax rates, the Government of Nunavut would have to correspond with the Government of Nunavut on tax rates."</seg>
<seg id="15">"It is my understanding that the current level of investment by the federal government is significant and that our own economy is only 10 to 15 percent of our total contribution.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We have to invest heavily in our own economy that we have to operate," said Mr. Lysytheon.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Why is the government taking advantage of the Carbon Tax Rebate Program to offset the cost of the government's operations?"</seg>
<seg id="18">"The co-payment process that we're undertaking right now would be a small portion of it would be the Government of Nunavut and the co-op would try to fit into their own coffers," replied Hicks, adding, "I think we wouldn't be too satisfied if we just put the co-payments into other revenue streams and not have the cash flow back to the consumer."</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr. Lysytheon also stated that the amendment to the Income Tax Act would be the most appropriate in returning Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="20">"It also indicated that the Carbon Tax Credit would provide the Government of Nunavut with the benefit of reducing Nunavut's coffee consumption."</seg>
<seg id="21">"I am very concerned about climate change and it needs to be worked on now and into the future.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Having said that, I have tabled some suggestions for this government on how to develop or come up with ways to reduce energy consumption in Nunavut," says Mr. Lysytheon.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Why is it that these ideas have not been considered and proposed for use in the Carbon Tax Rebate Program?"</seg>
<seg id="24">Mr. Hickes responded by saying that each department - responsible for specific tasks - is listening.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Some departments have undertaken a number of initiatives, including the Qulliq Energy Corporation, which has the mandate to develop energy efficient LED street lights for all of Nunavut and which was approved at the meeting earlier."</seg>
<seg id="26">"In 2019/20, the Government of Nunavut is projecting to raise $12 million in coffee tax expenditures."</seg>
<seg id="27">It would be broken down as follows:</seg>
<seg id="28">â¢ 2 million dollars for the government's higher heating costs for public housing and government housing such as schools and health centres.</seg>
<seg id="29">â¢ 3.6 million dollars for the new Nunavut Carbon Rebate Program.</seg>
<seg id="30">â¢ 6.2 million dollars back to Nunavummiut and Nunavut businesses this year through amendments to the Income Tax Act.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, with respect to Mr. Lyschnewstein's comments about the statistics, he stated that it was inadequate.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Given the 50% reimbursement from the tank farm and the 50% repayment from the Carbon Tax, why is there such a small room for energy conservation measures?"</seg>
<seg id="33">"Mr. Hickes responded that the federal government's position on the Caribbean tax increase each year over the next five years, and that while the 50 percent deduction on refined petroleum products will continue, this year's increase in the tax would generate additional revenue for other projects."</seg>
<seg id="34">The bill received second reading on November 6 and received third reading that evening.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Despite that, Mr. Lysytheon, the day before yesterday's birth of my new son, told the House that he had been sleeping for three hours and had left."</seg>
<seg id="36">"Shortly after the e-mail to Nunatsiaq News, Mr. Lightstone said he was not satisfied that he was going to vote on the Act."</seg>
<seg id="37">"I don't agree with the circumstances of Bill 26, I don't think it's a straightforward fiscal policy," wrote Lighthizer, who was going to say in the House.</seg>
<seg id="38">"The purpose of the Carbon Tax is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to address climate change.</seg>
<seg id="39">"If this Act includes utility tax credits for individuals or businesses that are willing to make a contribution, or if the Government of Nunavut put in place measures to assist people to purchase and set up energy efficiency measures then I would have been more than happy to approve the Act."</seg>
<seg id="40">Although Mr. Lysytheon is not satisfied with the passage of this bill.</seg>
<seg id="41">Mr. Hickes expressed his willingness to hear ideas on how to use the Caribbean tax revenues to offset Nunavut's reduction in the Caribbean.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I strongly recommend that a public letter be sent to all Members of the Legislative Assembly or to the government which considers appropriate actions in this area."</seg>

<seg id="5">"From April to September 2018, over 51,000 people visited Nunavut from outside of Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="6">"This is the premise of the Nunavut Tourism Annual Report for 2018/19 of the Department of Economic Development and Transportation, which was tabled in the Legislative Assembly earlier this month."</seg>
<seg id="7">"The same people who came here spent a total of $271,383,000 on travel and transportation expenses."</seg>
<seg id="8">The report does not indicate how much was spent other than travel.</seg>
<seg id="9">"On average, there were approximately 16,750 visitors who did not live in Nunavut from May to October 2015, with the following year's numbers visiting Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Baffin and Kivalliq regions have the highest number of visitors from July to September, 2018."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Baffin Island was visited by 95,600, of which just over a quarter (53.2 percent) came to Iqaluit with a budget of $75.1 million."</seg>
<seg id="12">Pond Inlet and Pangnirtung are accompanied and placed third in the communities visited here in the Baffin.</seg>
<seg id="13">"In the Kivalliq region, Rankin Inlet received 33,600 visitors and over $68 million, shortly after Baker Lake and Arviat."</seg>
<seg id="14">Cambridge Bay received the Kitikmeot Regional Visit.</seg>
<seg id="15">They are survived by Owen Owen through the Boat Study from Jordan to Kimmirut in August 2019.</seg>
<seg id="16">"In 2018, 3,404 cruise ships visited Nunavut within two and a half years."</seg>
<seg id="17">"The cruise ship operators spent $388,351 on community service," the report also states.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, weather and ice conditions affected more than half of all cruise ships travelling to Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The Department received a standing offer of eight passengers coordinating 23 journeys from Nunavut from July to September, 2018."</seg>
<seg id="20">"These ships brought 3,404 people together."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Just over half, or 59% of cargo or passengers landed in Pond Inlet from Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Iqaluit is the second group of cruise ships with 8.3%, followed by Qikiqtarjuaq, which is 6.1% visited and Grise Fiord with 5.9%."</seg>
<seg id="23">"The cruise ships visiting Pond Inlet did not just spend a total of $245,565, but the visitors most experienced 100 hours of the 189.5 hours of cruise ship visits in Nunavut, as reported."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Cambridge Bay, Gjoa Haven, Kimmirut and Kugluktuk were not visited by sealift in 2018."</seg>
<seg id="25">"In terms of reports, both Cambridge Bay and Gjoa Haven were expecting seven visits, but both were cancelled due to weather."</seg>
<seg id="26">"A report from Cambridge Bay and Gjoa Haven that influenced the cancellation of cruise ship visits resulted in a total loss of approximately $25,000."</seg>
<seg id="27">"The information contained in the report came from visitors who were on the exit survey in 2018, which involved cruise ship operators and other visitors to Nunavut last year."</seg>
<seg id="28">"In 2018, the GN responded to community concerns from Pond Inlet and Clyde River about cruise ship traffic."</seg>
<seg id="29">"In its report, the Government of Nunavut consulted with the Coalition of the Arctic Research Vessel Administrators and all shipping companies operating in a restricted area."</seg>
<seg id="30">"It also stated that as tourism is an independent industry, it requires government support for development."</seg>
<seg id="31">"In Nunavut, this means training and employment for Nunavummiut in the tourism sector."</seg>
<seg id="32">"There is always a lack of experience and training in various tourism sectors.</seg>
<seg id="33">"In the absence of trained workforce, tourism has not been fully realized."</seg>
<seg id="34">"Access has been known as a tourism industry in Nunavut," the report said.</seg>
<seg id="35">"The Certificate, Nunavut Government Shipping Skills Program, trains 12 people per year to work with people carrying ships to participate in the research," the report says.</seg>
<seg id="36">"In terms of reporting, all Government of Nunavut tourism inspectors are Inuit."</seg>
<seg id="37">"In the past, tourism data is rarely available, which confuses the economic size and potential of Nunavut's economy," the report said.</seg>
<seg id="38">"The department has supported 115 projects related to tourism in 2018, totalling $1,272,822."</seg>
<seg id="39">The projects include:</seg>

<seg id="1">"Baffin: If it's because of the economic potential, please raise it."</seg>
<seg id="2">Members are particularly interested in Baffinland's share of this revenue disclosure statement.</seg>
<seg id="3">Participants who are sitting in Iqaluit at Kat Hall for the fourth day of the Nunavut Impact Review Board public hearings on the proposed Baffinland iron ore project, Highway Expansion application from Baffinland.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Nunavut's process for enforcing regulatory processes for industry development, which began in 1993 with the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, has not been underway but has resulted in significant, diverse environmental and socio-economic impact assessments of the Mary River Iron Mine over the past decade."</seg>
<seg id="5">"This was demonstrated in Iqaluit earlier this month, when the Nunavut Impact Review Board held its final public meeting on the $900 million railway expansion proposal from the Baffinland Iron Mine Corporation during a recent recession due to confusion and misunderstanding."</seg>
<seg id="6">The last seven days of meetings scheduled for Pond Inlet were cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="7">"At the same time, Baffinland's billions of dollars, a multi-billion dollar mine is at risk."</seg>
<seg id="8">"In drafting this, the Nunavut Impact Review Board had yet to make a decision on the recommendation of Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated that, if approved, it would delay the eight to 12 months."</seg>
<seg id="9">"And the Baffinland Industry Corporation, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, said that they couldn't provide immediate assistance or permission to expand the railway."</seg>
<seg id="10">"However the Qikiqtani Inuit Association's Business Development Centre, Qikiqtaaluk Corporation has expressed their full support for it."</seg>
<seg id="11">Arctic Co-operatives Ltd.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is a very complex issue.</seg>
<seg id="13">"On behalf of Baffinland, the Vice-President of Recycling, Megan Lord-Hoyle, on this issue said that the company was only concerned about the project's viability, saying, "We will do our very best to stand up and protect Canadians with 3,000 jobs, 476 people."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Last week, Mr. Bavinlanco told the Nunatsiaq News that there were 490 southern contractors and 96 contractors hired by Inuit workers."</seg>
<seg id="15">That's why we're getting to the bottom of the unanswered question on the project: Mary River.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Baffinland has indicated that it is unclear what the mine's profitability would be unless the regulator would authorize the construction of a 110-kilometre rail line connecting Mary River to Cape Dorset and that its production would go up to 12 million tonnes per year, which could result in 176 trips through the Eclipse Sound."</seg>
<seg id="17">"The problem is, they didn't make a public statement to help with that."</seg>
<seg id="18">"As well, in the past, most professionals stopped asking questions about it."</seg>
<seg id="19">"A year ago, without a deal this did not stop the stakeholders from believing."</seg>
<seg id="20">"For example, in the summer and fall of 2018, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association stood by the Baffinland Inuit Association, protecting them from the Nunavut Impact Review Board."</seg>
<seg id="21">"On August 31 of that year, the Nunavut Impact Review Board decided that the federal government wouldn't approve ahead of time and that they would like to start producing 4.2 million tonnes of iron ore up to 6 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="22">"As a matter of fact, Mr. Speaker, Baffinland and his colleague, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, did a tremendous job."</seg>
<seg id="23">"In the last few weeks, they have been writing letters to senior decision-makers from across the country, Dominic Leblanc, at the time that he was the Federal-Territorial Minister, calling on the Board to reverse its decision..."</seg>
<seg id="24">Why?</seg>
<seg id="25">Money.</seg>
<seg id="26">"The Inuit organization expressed shock at the qualification of the Mary River Project, the need to provide substantial amounts of funding and benefits, worth more than $20 million to this project under the new IIBA."</seg>
<seg id="27">In Ottawa they said yes.</seg>
<seg id="28">"Focusing primarily on the Qikiqtani Inuit Association's concerns about the viability of the mine, the federal government formally approved Baffinland's proposal last year."</seg>
<seg id="29">"We are also concerned about the long-term viability of the Mary River mine and the knowledge that QIA's concerns about the economic development project will depend on the signing of the proposal," wrote Mr. Leblanc on September 30, 2018 by the Federal-Provincial-Territorial Minister Carolyn Bennett.</seg>
<seg id="30">"In other words, the most important Member of the public - the Federal Government - has agreed that economic prosperity is very important and important to this area."</seg>
<seg id="31">And they did that even though there was no financial transparency in there.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Of course if it's true that the program is not profitable, the Member of the Legislative Assembly should be interested in what he says to be true."</seg>
<seg id="34">"Throughout the Mary River project, Baffinland employees - as required - should present a significant number of benefits to this environmental impact statement."</seg>
<seg id="35">"However, given the nature of the project's financial survival, the Nunavut Impact Review Board is unlikely to publicly release a public statement."</seg>
<seg id="36">"For example, the Nunavut Impact Review Board has recommended a lengthy financial statement obtained by the Canadian Coast Guard in the Arctic "not binding" and that it be formally tabled in the Committee of the Whole.</seg>
<seg id="37">(A copy of the e-mail continues.)</seg>
<seg id="38">The Nunavut Impact Review Board made this recommendation after the publication - and then it was struck off the recommendation of Baffinland.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Under this scenario, Baffinland was willing to provide, at one point, a shorter financial statement indicating why Mary River could generate more revenue through a larger development."</seg>
<seg id="40">It could be a conflict of interest.</seg>
<seg id="41">At least Baffinland has corrected that.</seg>
<seg id="42">"In response, the Nunavut Impact Review Board made a different decision, which makes no sense."</seg>
<seg id="43">"If the federal government is going to invest in economic development, then this federal benefit board has to do the same thing."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Certainly, the Nunavut Impact Review Board and other regulators should be pursuing additional coverage."</seg>
<seg id="45">They need it.</seg>
<seg id="46">"As well as the Baffinland Implementation Commission, QIA."</seg>
<seg id="47">"And in light of such concerns as the possibility of further disaster, the federal government should amend the federal legislation governing the Nunavut Impact Review Board process, the Nunavut Planning Commission and the Vital Statistics Act, to clarify how financial information should be handled in the future."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Although there have been some requests for input, there are still many questions that have not been answered regarding Baffinland's final expansion proposal, related to the railway impact on caribou, the impact of ships on beluga whales, the lack of Inuit employment, and much more."</seg>
<seg id="49">"Many questions relate to the port facility in Arctic Bay, the rail project proposal, which Baffinland had approved in 2013, and the capacity to produce 18 million tonnes per year.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is not yet clear why Baffinland has not followed through with this plan.</seg>
<seg id="51">But the biggest question is how will this program be sustainable.</seg>

<seg id="2">Several positive developments have led to the Quebec promise.</seg>
<seg id="3">The children and teachers were here at the Aqavik Early Childhood Education Centre in Hudson Bay in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="4">"In that year the Quebec Government added additional support to the members of the Early Childhood Education Program, based on family income."</seg>
<seg id="5">"On November 7, 2019 these subsidies were discontinued, with the childcare subsidy set at $8.25 a day."</seg>
<seg id="6">(copy of nunavik childcare.ca)</seg>
<seg id="7">By Elaine Andrews</seg>
<seg id="8">"The economic restructuring of Quebec brings additional funding for family and child services in Quebec, including Nunavik."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Quebec's revenues were approximately 2.4 percent for 2018/19, which is 0.6 percent higher than originally thought."</seg>
<seg id="10">"In this case, Quebec's Finance Minister, Eric Jarrett, announced on November 7 that $857 million of the settlement would be achieved in less than a year's worth of commitment."</seg>
<seg id="11">Two of these programs have already been inspired by the Children's Advocate and the Children's Advocate.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The renewal of the Quebec Economic and Monetary Fund demonstrates the success of Northern Quebec in this area," Mr. Jarrett said in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The economic growth of Quebec gives us an opportunity to reduce our deficit and to fulfill our government's promise."</seg>
<seg id="14">"With this program, QuÃ©bec is repealing the additional support provided to families in child welfare that was adopted by the former Philip Queen Liberal government in 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Under this program, it makes an additional contribution to child care in addition to making the payment a day's income."</seg>
<seg id="16">This subsidy was increased to $15 a day for higher income earners.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Families who make less than $50,000 have not received an increase in the subsidy."</seg>
<seg id="18">"The November 7 news release indicates that a refund of Quebec childcare fee of $8.25, would be waived to cover all income."</seg>
<seg id="19">This new expenditure in Nunavik will be used through the Kativik Community Government program in Nunavik childcare.</seg>
<seg id="20">"In the Quebec press release, this new payment is for this year, and the press release from the Montreal Guard explained that it will start on January 1, 2019."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Last week, the Parent of Childcare Services Centre of the Municipality, Julie-Ann Pete, was not informed how or when these payments would begin in Nunavik."</seg>
<seg id="22">Premier FranÃ§ois League's government made the first realignment to slowly eliminate the use of additional resources and avoid it in 2022.</seg>
<seg id="23">Economic efficiency and a recent budget surplus of $4 billion for 2019/20 is a step in the right direction.</seg>
<seg id="24">"As well as removing payments for childcare, the Quebec Government is moving forward with a child benefit increase that will be implemented in 2021."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Effective January 2020, the Quebec Government announced that the family will receive an increase of $779 per year."</seg>
<seg id="26">"This subsidy is based on income, with a minimum amount of $1,000 for a maximum of $2,515 a year."</seg>
<seg id="27">"The new Act on Child Equality, less the Liberals can avoid paying a lower child benefit than the oldest child."</seg>
<seg id="28">"Today, we will complete the implementation of various measures to benefit the people of Northern Quebec," Mr. Jarrett said.</seg>
<seg id="29">"We are actually putting more money back into Northern Quebec in a lot faster time."</seg>

<seg id="12">"In the early 1990s, he was a member of the Sanikiluaq Impact Review Board, a group of community members who collected knowledge of the impacts of large-scale hydro-electric water systems that were built near Northern Quebec due to the impact of ice and sea ice on the islands around Sanikiluaq."</seg>
<seg id="13">This incident was described as "The Hudson Bay Voice: Traditional Knowledge by Inuit and First Nations of the Hudson Bay Area."</seg>
<seg id="14">"As the mayor of Sanikiluaq, Mr. Kattuk also expressed his frustration with the current status of the Churchill Hydroelectric Project Water Stabilization Application."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Following that, Mr. Kattuk was a member of the Nunavut Hudson Bay Neighbours Regional Roundtable, which is called the Nunavut Hudson Bay Neighbours Regional Roundtable."</seg>
<seg id="16">"These organizations, formed by the Government of Nunavut, Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated and the Hamlet of Sanikiluaq, are monitoring trends in the Sanikiluaq area with the second hydroelectric project proposal, which has been on hold ever since, including rivers in Eastmain and Rupert Rivers."</seg>
<seg id="17">"And in 1996, Mr. Kattuk was a member of the Nunavut Implementation Commission, an organization that was set up in 1993 under the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Peter Kattuk delivered a presentation to the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut on February 19, 2008, at the end of his second term in the constituency of Hudson Bay."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Koon Tattuinee, President of Arctic Co-operatives Ltd.," recalls Mr. Kattuk's "very good times," which made him the sea urchins of Sanikiluaq food.</seg>
<seg id="20">"This is Paul Okalik, when he was Nunavut's Premier, appointed Mr. Kattuk as Minister of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth in April 2000, to say that Mr. Kattuk incorporated Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit before this announcement."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Peter participated in a study on Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit quite some time before that was announced," Okalik said in a press release in April 2000.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Before he was the Minister of Human Resources in 2001, Mr. Kattuk had to deal with a "major case" from a laughing stock.</seg>
<seg id="23">This happened with NTCL bringing in gasoline by ship to Nunavut and causing damage to snowmobile engines in the Baffin and Kivalliq regions.</seg>
<seg id="24">"During his tenure, Mr. Kattuk took on another role: the Government of Nunavut's decision to withdraw NTCL and re-profile petroleum products supplier Woodward's working group from Labrador."</seg>
<seg id="25">"He ran for re-election in October 2017, but he came in third behind Allan Rumbolt."</seg>
<seg id="26">"Peter was widely considered for his efforts in career services and environmental initiatives," Mr. Mikkungwak said in a statement.</seg>

<seg id="4">(Photograph from Sylvie Brobie/Facebook)</seg>
<seg id="5">A new member of the legislative assembly of Nunavik has expressed an interest in learning about Inuit leaders' concerns.</seg>
<seg id="6">Legislative member Sylvie Barbie won the William-James Bay-Nunavik-Yeah nomination in the fall federal election with 37.7 percent of the vote.</seg>
<seg id="7">"When Black Quebecois is a member of the Legislative Assembly for the French language community, he stated that he was looking for an Inuktitut interpreter to work with him."</seg>
<seg id="8">"I want to be clear about the needs of aboriginal communities," he says.</seg>
<seg id="9">"To date, Mr. Barbie said he has identified two critical issues in Nunavik that he is aware of including health and housing."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Even though healthcare is a province, it is a federal benefit," says Mr. Brube.</seg>
<seg id="11">"In order to increase health benefits, the federal government must consider how it allocates funding."</seg>
<seg id="12">Perubi has been in the health field for over 30 years.</seg>
<seg id="13">"During the Black Co-op campaign, the province expressed a need for 10,000 public housing units over the next ten years."</seg>
<seg id="14">"In this case, Mr. Barbie talks about the design of different types of housing."</seg>
<seg id="15">"If we want this current Liberal Government to move forward, it's up to us to come up with a solution," Ms. Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="16">"This new member is not a stranger to Nunavik, but he plans to attend the next annual general meeting of Makivik, which will be held in March."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Following the election of Barbie, Makivik President Charlie Ford has issued a press release in which he welcomed Paroby to Nunavik as soon as possible."</seg>
<seg id="18">"I look forward to meeting with her, and we welcome her support in our efforts to promote self-reliance and in the implementation of the Jonathan Nason Right to Indigenous People," Ford says.</seg>
<seg id="19">Talking with Inuit leaders would be a benefit of the role of Makivik in pursuing a business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Bercow is a strong supporter of Bill C-262, which would allow the constitutional provision of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples."</seg>
<seg id="21">"In two different constitutional terms than the person who is replacing him, the Honourable Romeo Saganas."</seg>
<seg id="22">"When this was introduced in 2018, Act C-262 was suspended by the Conservative Party this spring but the Liberal government representative from the Senate, Senator Peter Harder, said that if re-elected this Liberal Government would have to enact legislation."</seg>
<seg id="23">"It is important for me to continue working on Bill C-262 in accordance with the Canadian Constitution on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the work of my predecessor Romeo Caganas," Barbie says.</seg>
<seg id="24">"I will continue to support this project and I intend to support Rome through future initiatives.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is unacceptable that Canada has not reached this goal by 2020."</seg>

<seg id="1">Trudeau Government 2.0: Don't expect too much</seg>
<seg id="2">"Don't expect too much"</seg>
<seg id="3">"Jane Webster, who was then the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs on March 23, 2018, along with Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami President Nathan Observed, promised that the federal government would eliminate the area by 2030."</seg>
<seg id="4">Not a year ago he resigned as a federal politician.</seg>
<seg id="5">Did you find out during the federal election campaign that one of the leaders didn't say too much about Nunavut issues and the other northerners.</seg>
<seg id="6">That is not amazing.</seg>
<seg id="7">"More importantly, it seems to me that the majority of Canadians, for the sake of southern Canadians, do not have enough voters to make their case to a northerner that the majority of Canadians have not heard."</seg>
<seg id="8">"The Liberal Government made it aware of this, by leaving it behind and establishing a northern and northern policy framework just days before the election."</seg>
<seg id="9">"During the campaign period, much of the focus was on aboriginal issues, many of which overlap with northern issues, but not much was done."</seg>
<seg id="10">"As a result of the new reduction in Justin Trudeau's government, and the swearing-in ceremony that took place on November 20, it is hoped that this will continue."</seg>
<seg id="11">Is this an indicator part of it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Its focus has been on promises made to the north since the Toronto government took over as president in 2015: eliminating at least 50% (half) cases of TB from the north by 2025 and eliminating it completely before 2030.</seg>
<seg id="13">"This included an initial contribution of $27.5 million over five years, which will be "developed" by four members of the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Effectively, this was TB reduction specialist with the Federal Government, Jane Weber, the former First Nations Minister who made that statement."</seg>
<seg id="15">He resigned from Trudeau's legal team on March 4 to criticize Trudeau's lack of business dealings with Jody Wyson-Rifford.</seg>
<seg id="16">He did this less than four days before Trudeau came to Iqaluit to apologise for Canada's inadequate treatment of people with TB in the 1950s and 1960s.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Since then, they have remained silent on the issue of tuberculosis in the north."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Despite the many campaigns, this issue was not addressed."</seg>
<seg id="19">"As of now, tuberculosis prevention has stalled."</seg>
<seg id="20">"For example, in the Northwest Territories, where tuberculosis rates were between 2006 and 2016 and recorded 248.5 people per 100,000, health care providers in only one community have been assessed."</seg>
<seg id="21">"That was done by Nine, in 2018, when there was tuberculosis and a 14-year-old boy died while he was in the hospital with Jane Johns."</seg>
<seg id="22">"In Nunavik, 313 people were diagnosed with tuberculosis between 2006 and 2016, compared to tuberculosis in the Inuit homeland, 234 were diagnosed with 100,000 cases."</seg>
<seg id="23">"However there has been no community-wide survey in Nunavik since 2018, when Mr. Weber made this news."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Indeed in Nunavut there was a recent public inquiry into tuberculosis, when Stephen Harper and Conservative were presidents, just before Trudeau's liberals were elected."</seg>
<seg id="25">"For Nunavut, there have been 670 cases of tuberculosis since 2006-2016, which is 171.8 out of 100.000 and there has been some work done."</seg>
<seg id="26">One untouched person is from the Inuvialuit Territory.</seg>
<seg id="27">"At that time, there were no cases of tuberculosis between 2007 and 2016."</seg>
<seg id="28">TB is a serious illness.</seg>
<seg id="29">That's why it's so common.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it is true.</seg>
<seg id="31">"If people do not have enough food and housing, TB can develop."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Also in consideration, the disease in Cape Dorset, in this case the 12-week TB test was completed in May."</seg>
<seg id="33">In 2016 the unemployment rate was 27.3 percent.</seg>
<seg id="34">"In 2015, a person over 15 years of age had an average income of just over $18,933."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Out of the 370 units, 120 units were in great need of repair."</seg>
<seg id="36">"Under Canada's overcrowding, the 140 units from 370 units were "unaccompanied" by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Act.</seg>
<seg id="37">That means they don't have enough rooms per capita.</seg>
<seg id="38">There are also a few other people in Canada that don't have housing.</seg>
<seg id="39">"It is no secret that over the last 20 years, tuberculosis has been a crisis in Nunavut and elsewhere in the north."</seg>
<seg id="40">It is not unreasonable that tuberculosis can be eradicated in these communities unless significant changes are made to increase the number of units and to improve the quality of care.</seg>
<seg id="41">"However, during the last campaign, Trudeau's lawyers did not have any public housing available, only to reiterate their 2016 and 2017 operating commitments."</seg>
<seg id="42">"In this case, they can't be excused for contravening their language.</seg>
<seg id="43">"This also illustrates what has happened in the Canadian pandemic, where tuberculosis in Inuit homeland is more than 300 times higher than in aboriginal Canadians born in Canada."</seg>
<seg id="44">"In Nunavut, it may be worse."</seg>
<seg id="45">Last year's report revealed that one in every 100 children born in Nunavut may have this disease.</seg>
<seg id="46">"In the absence of significant concern for such emergencies as the disease, what concerns does the Trudeau Liberal Government have regarding other issues such as mental illness, local housing needs, training and more?"</seg>
<seg id="47">"If you can think, don't expect too much."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Otherwise, be prepared to put you down."</seg>
<seg id="49">"Please note: A number of ongoing developments from ITK's 'Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami' tuberculosis prevention strategy, released in November 2018."</seg>
<seg id="50">Cape Dorset's report was compiled by Statistics Canada in its 2016 census.</seg>

<seg id="1">The new year will focus on new RCMP and resources in Nunavik.</seg>
<seg id="2">Police officers and the use of body cameras have been installed.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Kativik Community Constables will launch a new RCMP and surveillance camera system in early 2020.</seg>
<seg id="4">(Photographer Elaine Andersome)</seg>
<seg id="5">"After months of under-staffing, the Kativik Community Constables are able to see the efforts of additional RCMP officers,"</seg>
<seg id="6">The RCMP Commander Jean-Pierre Larose came to inform the council during the Kativik Municipality meeting on November 26th to date.</seg>
<seg id="7">This included the graduation of ten new Kativik Community Constables from the Ontario Police College this week.</seg>
<seg id="8">The hiring process also included former employees of the pension plan who were given the opportunity to speak to the issue of employment at Kativik.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Due to inadequate staffing, the Kativik Community has had RCMP detachments in Quebec from the RCMP, from S&lt;unk&gt;retÃ© du QuÃ©bec, acting detachments."</seg>
<seg id="10">"In September 20 in Quebec there were police officers from Nunavik."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Quebec's detachment has been slowly declining as the Kativik detachment approaches all communities to recruit police officers, and Larose said in early 2020 that they may no longer use Quebec's detachment."</seg>
<seg id="12">Cultural awareness campaigns begin</seg>
<seg id="13">The Inuit Cultural Immersion Day gathering for all communities was also posted on the website on November 18.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Pilimmaksarniq was developed by the Kativik Community Constable and Laval University and includes information on Nunavik, Inuit culture, and policing trends here in Nunavik."</seg>
<seg id="15">"This is a three-hour course and it takes place shortly after the completion of the course, which is described as a job competition."</seg>
<seg id="16">"This program is intended to help the Kativik Community Constables choose their own style of thinking," Larose says.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The other piece of equipment is a nine-hour stretch and requires full RCMP training," said Larose.</seg>
<seg id="18">We expect this to be completed by the beginning of the new fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="19">Photographs required by the RCMP</seg>
<seg id="20">Another thing that was added by the RCMP and it was appreciated by the members was the need to have cameras on the workings of the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="21">The equipment is being tested and they're using six cameras right now.</seg>
<seg id="22">"This work was initiated by the interest of Nunavik residents to make the Kativik detachment more visible through their work," Laros said.</seg>
<seg id="23">"The Kativik Community Constables Program aims to provide Inuit with regular access to and inter-agency support."</seg>
<seg id="24">The member from Kuujjuaq, Jobie Takkiapik, was hoping that these cameras would help people who have had problems with the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="25">"We hear about RCMP inappropriate actions and they don't want to say anything.</seg>
<seg id="26">"They are armed with the RCMP," Mr. Takiapik said.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Digital cameras are needed."</seg>
<seg id="28">"He goes on to say that even if one or two RCMP officers do something wrong, it's a huge impact, and it's a concern for the whole RCMP."</seg>
<seg id="29">"He thinks that the cameras, they take pictures of what the police are doing, can be used in the near future."</seg>
<seg id="30">Mr. Larus stated that they would be using these cameras in January.</seg>
<seg id="31">He added that inadequate and inadequate measures will not only be offered to the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I just recently gotten rid of a RCMP officer last week because of our program in Nunavik," he says.</seg>
<seg id="33">"We don't want too many RCMP officers in Nunavik."</seg>

<seg id="1">Nearby Nunavut talks about renewable energy in the Arctic</seg>
<seg id="2">"Representatives from Greenland, Canada and the United States speak for thought and experience."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Bruno Pereira, President of the Qulliq Energy Corporation presents the Northern Empowerment and Community Summit in Iqaluit, November 22, 2019."</seg>
<seg id="4">(Photo by the American Consulate General)</seg>
<seg id="5">Renewable energy experts from the Arctic met in Iqaluit on November 21 and 22 to consider and share their experiences in the north.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Attendees from Nunavut, the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, Greenland and Jonathan Steet spoke about the devastating effects of diversity in the communities."</seg>
<seg id="7">"The gathering, called Optimizing Operations, Intergrating New Technologies and Engaging Stakeholders (Improving operations, incorporating new technologies and engaging stakeholders), was organized by American Presidents in partnership with the Government of Nunavut and the Qulliq Energy Corporation."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Bruno Pereira, President of the Qulliq Energy Corporation, said the gathering was a sign of trouble."</seg>
<seg id="9">"What we want to do under the renewable energy program in our territory, we want to be very interested in what other people do, and find out what their accomplishments are or what their failures are," Pereira said.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Mr. Pereira also said that despite the importance of a representative gathering to discuss petroleum products conservation, there are a number of Nunavut activities here in Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Some communities have a way of doing things so they are not really in the Inuit communities of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="12">"But they have a hard time like us, where they have room, they can work with the community, so we can see that they have similar disabilities."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Chris Rose, Director of Renewable Energy Management in Alaska, said the Alaska Hydroelectric Project has contributed to renewable energy development."</seg>
<seg id="14">"As a result we were able to develop over 80 sites that have enabled us to use renewable energy on top of the gasoline supply in Tesco.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We think that we know how that helps," Rose says.</seg>
<seg id="16">"This subsidy, which is designed to promote renewable energy projects, and helps Alaskans reduce energy costs."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Rose said that in the south of Russia, the five communities are working together on the installation of wind turbines and they're taking advantage of that for energy purposes."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Now there is a combination of knowledge on how to operate and maintain the wind turbine and help each other in the design," Rose says.</seg>
<seg id="19">"In Alaska, like in Nunavut, the power bills are very expensive."</seg>
<seg id="20">Mr. Rose said that the communities that are using wind farms not only for electricity but also for heating.</seg>
<seg id="21">"What they have done is put small boilers into people's houses which are covered with diamond carpeting.</seg>
<seg id="22">"When the winds get stronger, they go into the heating system, and they put in a small signal that the boilers and the power plants are detected," Rose says.</seg>
<seg id="23">"The heat waves are preventable, which can keep warm."</seg>
<seg id="24">"They can be discharged or burned in a home that is suitable, and they can have alternative heating systems."</seg>
<seg id="25">"However, in Greenland, the issue of installing windmills has been a difficult one, in News Eric Hargreaves, a technical consultant for recycling at Nuuk."</seg>
<seg id="26">"Temperature and darkness make it difficult for wind turbines to get north," says Hagovist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Mr. Hagovist also indicated that there were two wind turbine systems that were properly installed on the other side of the Atlantic, but they failed."</seg>
<seg id="28">"We can say that in Greenland we have chosen more programs that can be delivered.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Even the two wind turbines that were installed in the 200 different locations will be tested and the other 150 on the ground," he says.</seg>
<seg id="30">"One of the wind gusts fell down. On the other hand, the tank was too thick for cold and caused engine damage," Mr. Hagovis said.</seg>
<seg id="31">"During the 2019 federal election campaign, three political leaders indicated that the selection of Nunavut Tesco fuel would be terminated by 2030."</seg>
<seg id="32">"While it may take some time to develop a recycling program that works in the Arctic, Mr. Hagovist said the issue of oil reduction was urgent."</seg>
<seg id="33">"We have to do something to get away from oil, from climate change, because there is something wrong with it now."</seg>
<seg id="34">This is for legal services because you have to have a conventional use of fuel but there is no funding available.</seg>
<seg id="35">"A sound investment," he says.</seg>
<seg id="36">Mr. Pereira said it was an eye-opening conversation with neighbouring Nunavut communities in the north.</seg>
<seg id="37">"I think that there has to be a way of thinking about this, in terms of how to start dealing with recycling."</seg>
<seg id="38">Some people have used the equipment and they have had problems with southern skills but they cannot do the north.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Once we have the financial capacity to be able to track those deficiencies," Pereira says.</seg>

<seg id="5">Issue: Minister Joanasie's Letter to Nunatsiaq News on Bill 25</seg>
<seg id="6">"Minister Joanasie wrote a letter published by Nunatsiaq News on November 25, 2019 indicating the extensive discussions between the Department of Education and Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated on Bill 25, indicating that these discussions were conducted in a spirit of cooperation and offering by NTI an opportunity to articulate their concerns."</seg>
<seg id="7">From the minister's perspective, he is urging NTI through public meetings and through NTI's public hearings that the Government of Nunavut sees as having a working relationship with previous meetings.</seg>
<seg id="8">That is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Inuit have a right under section 32 of the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement to participate in the development of social and cultural policies, and the development of social and cultural programs and services, including the administration of those policies."</seg>
<seg id="10">It's a different base.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bill 25 proposes amendments to the Education Act and the Inuit Language Protection Act to establish policies and governance with respect to Inuit language instruction.</seg>

<seg id="13">"In these cases, individuals have rights to participate in the development and restructuring process."</seg>
<seg id="14">NTI did not have the opportunity to participate in the development of the policy proposals outlined in the proposed Bill 25.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Not only does it violate the government's obligations set out in the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, it is an experience that demonstrates that partnerships are in place to deliver policies that better reflect Inuit goals and objectives."</seg>
<seg id="16">"NTI has been working with the Government of Nunavut, such as the Inuit Language Protection Act, the Official Languages Act and the Wildlife Act."</seg>
<seg id="17">"As we know it can go ahead, NTI contacted the Premier and shortly after the election of the government to co-ordinate working relationships and collaboration on Inuit priorities, including education, language and culture."</seg>
<seg id="18">"The Department of Education did not submit a legislative proposal to NTI on August 31, 2018, in which the department submitted a list of planned community consultations."</seg>
<seg id="19">NTI was given less than a week to review Bill 25 and prepare and prepare for a Nunavut consultation tour.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is not working together.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The department coordinated consultations in the short term, and did not seek to resolve or accommodate concerns raised by the public, NTI and other organizations such as District Education Authorities (DEA) and the Coalition of Nunavut District Education Authorities (CNDEA) were also there."</seg>
<seg id="22">"I urge the Minister of Education to ensure that the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement clearly defines the role to be carried out under Article 32, and that the department has the responsibility to ensure that it is done in a fair, objective and manner that respects the will of the people."</seg>
<seg id="23">"NTI's belief that the rewriting of the Education Act to permit Inuit to participate in the work of the proposed constitution must change the department's management, and the overall recognition of Inuit rights.</seg>
