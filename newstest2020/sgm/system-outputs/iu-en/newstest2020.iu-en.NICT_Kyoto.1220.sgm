<seg id="73">Good day to my fellow residents of Igloolik, my colleagues, and all Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="74">I would like to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Dr. Donna May-Kimmaliardjuk on receiving the 2018 Youth Achievement Award in Winnipeg.</seg>
<seg id="75">She is the first Inuk to be certified as a medical practitioner.</seg>
<seg id="76">Dr. Kimmaliardjuk was born in Chesterfield Inlet and he is the first Inuk cardiologist...</seg>
<seg id="77">For the fourth year in a row, it's going to be a six year program at the University of Ottawa.</seg>
<seg id="78">Mr. Speaker, Dr. Kimmaliardjuk was able to be admitted to the hospital in 2014 as the only registered cardiologist in Canada.</seg>

<seg id="83">These awards celebrate a culture that reflects the diversity of aboriginal people in Canada.</seg>

<seg id="88">Minister of Justice, Ms. Iqaqrialu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Minister's Statement 047 - 5 (1): Rankin Inlet Healing Facility Sewing (Iqaqrialu)</seg>
<seg id="90">Hon. Jeannie Iqaqrialu (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the Department of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth's sewing program at the Rankin Inlet Healing Facility.</seg>
<seg id="91">The inmates are involved in the production of sealskins, sealskins, and other items such as paraphernalia, scallops, sealskin pants, sealskin bags, and food boxes.</seg>
<seg id="92">Rosemary Angutialuk is run by Sandy, a respected elder, and her sewing skills are known all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="93">He recently went to Norway to teach the sealskins.</seg>
<seg id="94">She was a student at Nunavut Arctic College's fur program and she initiated a program with the Literacy Council of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="95">The Department of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth is working with the Department of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth to support the implementation of the Inuit Language and Cultural Healing Strategy.</seg>
<seg id="96">The sewing program will work with and support the Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, or Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, or Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, or Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, or Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, or Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit Qaujimajatujimajatuqangit.</seg>
<seg id="97">The fur and skins will be used for the sewing program.</seg>
<seg id="98">Programs like this help inmates to become more involved in the community at the end of their sentences by encouraging them to become more involved in the criminal justice system.</seg>
<seg id="99">I recently visited the Rankin Inlet Healing Facility and I was pleased to see the positive impact of the cultural programs, especially for the elders in the communities such as Rosemary Chandler.</seg>
<seg id="100">Minister of Family Services, Minister Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="101">Minister's Statement 048 - 5 (1): red Certificate Program (Savikataaq)</seg>
<seg id="102">Hon. Joe Savikataaq (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker. I say "good day" to the people of Arviat.</seg>
<seg id="103">Mr. Speaker, the Department of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth has been working with the Nunavut Association of Municipalities on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="104">In September 2016, the heavy equipment training program, which includes these three components, was announced in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="105">This allows Nunavummiut to take the Nunavut Apprenticeship Program, which is a certification program that is known as the Nunavut Apprenticeship Program.</seg>
<seg id="106">In November 2017, Nunavut was given the authority to certify heavy equipment operators and outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="107">As part of the Poverty Reduction Strategy, the Government of Nunavut has passed the regional certification process to ensure that Nunavummiut are able to work anywhere in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="108">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to announce that we have been able to provide Nunavummiut with a nationally recognized diploma and diploma in Nunavut.</seg>

<seg id="112">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to announce today that the Department of Education will be providing O and M funding to eligible daycares.</seg>
<seg id="113">Mr. Speaker, this increase is the result of a three-year program plan that my officials have put in place for early childhood and daycare facilities, which has been in place since the agreement was signed in September 2017 with the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="114">Mr. Speaker, this current fiscal year, we will see qualified daycares receive an increase in the minimum wage from $1,918.80 to $45,494.80 depending on the number, type, and location of the daycares.</seg>
<seg id="115">As long as daycares do not increase the cost of child care, they will not be eligible for similar funding in the next fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="116">Mr. Speaker, this funding will not only help with daycare management costs, it will also help families with child care costs without increasing costs.</seg>
<seg id="117">Mr. Speaker, we are proud to be able to provide this funding to support daycares and families.</seg>
<seg id="118">I also believe, and it is clear that we also believe that this funding will have a positive impact without changing the overall funding and daycare costs.</seg>

<seg id="124">Mr. Speaker, the National Mining Symposium will be held in Iqaluit for the 21st Annual Nunavut Mining Symposium from April 9 to 12, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="125">This conference is an excellent opportunity for Inuit to explore new opportunities in Nunavut's mineral exploration and mining sector to ensure that our communities are aware and involved in the mining and exploration activities in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="126">We anticipate that this year's Mining Symposium will continue with an excellent turnout across Nunavut and we expect more than 400 participants to participate.</seg>
<seg id="127">Mr. Speaker, I look forward to welcoming the mine, Inuit organizations, search and rescue organizations, community members, and other stakeholders to this important meeting.</seg>
<seg id="128">Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I would like to encourage all Members of the Legislative Assembly and the public to participate in this public forum on April 11.</seg>
<seg id="129">This is not just an opportunity to get good equipment, but to address the impact of search and rescue on the people involved.</seg>

<seg id="163">I rise today to address concerns that have been brought to my attention by my constituents regarding the decriminalization of marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="164">I just received a letter that said, "My family and the people of Iqaluit are in a public housing unit for the next year.</seg>
<seg id="165">A couple of years ago when we were smoking, we had to move because of the smell, the smoke coming into my house was very strong. "</seg>
<seg id="166">The letter further states, "I am deeply concerned about the effects of cannabis on my children, my children, and others in this situation."</seg>
<seg id="167">Mr. Speaker, as residents of Iqaluit and my family, we live in a shared house.</seg>
<seg id="168">Mr. Speaker, the smoke has an impact on other people who don't smoke.</seg>
<seg id="169">If you don't smoke for a long time, it's a health issue that has been known by the Government of Nunavut and it's one of the regulations that have been put in place to make sure that you don't smoke.</seg>
<seg id="170">As a father, we have children with these types of illnesses and I don't want them to be affected by anything that includes tobacco, tobacco, and marijuana smoke.</seg>
<seg id="171">As my colleague from Pangnirtung pointed out, the member asked the Minister of Health about the potential health effects of marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="172">In talking to my constituents, I know that many of them have the same concerns.</seg>
<seg id="173">Mr. Speaker, I recognize that in a situation like this, we have to be flexible.</seg>
<seg id="174">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to announce that the federal government will be introducing a ban on smoking in Nunavut in the next few months.</seg>

<seg id="180">Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Rankin Inlet North and Chesterfield Inlet also noted last week that the government's own consultations and results have indicated that it is concerned about the use of agricultural products and the exploitation of public housing units and condominiums.</seg>
<seg id="181">Mr. Speaker, I believe that when this legislation is introduced in the Legislative Assembly, it will be necessary to clearly address these concerns and I look forward to working with my colleagues to come up with the most appropriate solution.</seg>
<seg id="182">Before we proceed, as members are aware, Mr. Akoak is not here today due to illness.</seg>
<seg id="183">I wish Mr. Akoak a speedy recovery.</seg>

<seg id="190">Mr. Speaker, the Piqqusilirivvik Cultural School operates programs in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="191">This program can be expanded so that the public will have a better understanding and experience of Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit and Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit.</seg>
<seg id="192">Mr. Speaker, the idea of establishing a university in Nunavut has been discussed, and Agnico-Eagle Mines has indicated that they would be willing to support such a move.</seg>
<seg id="193">I think it would be best if we put it in the middle of Nunavut because it's the middle of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="194">Mr. Speaker, one of my colleagues stated that it is very important that we deal with these issues as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="195">The wheels of government move very slowly, but at the same time, we need to encourage and encourage when something comes up that is available in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="196">Mr. Speaker, we are at the beginning of our fifth term as Members of the Legislative Assembly. I, too, would like to see a step forward.</seg>

<seg id="204">There has been a lot of food problems and a lot of waste that has been going on for a number of months.</seg>
<seg id="205">Mr. Speaker, it is critical that the government ensures that the services that are paid for by Nunavummiut are actually delivered.</seg>
<seg id="206">I understand that hotels require a lot of accommodations on a daily basis but it is also very important that they are comfortable and well cared for.</seg>
<seg id="207">Mr. Speaker, it is unclear whether the boarding home will be included in the review.</seg>
<seg id="208">I look forward to seeing the results of the review and the recommendations that will be made to improve the services and conditions of the boarding homes.</seg>

<seg id="230">Mr. Speaker, I am very proud of the fact that we made a very strong statement on Friday that the Legislative Assembly is not going to just approve it and that the government has to respect its own procurement rules.</seg>
<seg id="231">Mr. Mayne (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker. my colleague from Iqaluit-Tasiluk tabled a very important motion on Friday and we will move on to the next sitting of the Legislative Assembly during the spring sitting.</seg>
<seg id="232">Mr. Speaker, we are a territorial government and although this government is not in full control, it has the power to do so.</seg>
<seg id="233">For example, as I noted in my opening comments last week, when we were dealing with the college's capital budget, the government listened to our concerns and made significant changes to its budget.</seg>
<seg id="234">I look forward to seeing more of that in the coming weeks and years, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="235">Mr. Speaker, over the past few weeks, Members of the Legislative Assembly have been asking a lot of questions on a daily basis.</seg>
<seg id="236">I think it's quite obvious that we need to do more research on the government's expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="237">It's not enough to just count the money that goes out.</seg>
<seg id="238">I seek unanimous consent to conclude my statement, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="239">The member is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statement today. are there any nays?</seg>
<seg id="240">Mr. Mayne, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="241">Mr. Mayne (interpretation): thank you.</seg>
<seg id="242">Mr. Speaker, I am talking about examples of things that are happening.</seg>
<seg id="243">Mr. Speaker, this information needs to be made public in the Legislative Assembly so that we, as elected officials, can make informed decisions.</seg>
<seg id="244">Mr. Speaker, I will use these as an example.</seg>
<seg id="245">I think it's fair to say that we can all agree that the government's administration of the Fuel Tax Rebate Program is not enough to support harvesters.</seg>
<seg id="246">The Department of Environment, which administers the government's Harvesters Assistance Program, needs to take a close look at its programs and how it can adjust its targets for harvesters to support the cost of fuel.</seg>
<seg id="247">Mr. Speaker, I would also like to take this opportunity to provide further examples of the government's grants and contributions programs.</seg>
<seg id="248">We know that the government has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on development and promotion.</seg>
<seg id="249">We are aware of the amount of money that has been borrowed from the private sector.</seg>
<seg id="250">We know who received the funding.</seg>
<seg id="251">We don't know what this money was used for.</seg>
<seg id="252">We don't know how many Inuit were hired from Nunavut and we don't even know what the money was used for.</seg>
<seg id="253">Mr. Speaker, as you probably know, I can tell you for a long time that it's not going to work, but I'll leave it at that.</seg>
<seg id="254">In addition, I look forward to reviewing the Main Estimates of the Legislative Assembly and I look forward to working with all Members of the Legislative Assembly to strengthen our budget with the support of all communities and constituents.</seg>
<seg id="255">Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="256">Member's Statement 104 - 5 (1): two More Inuit Travelling for Care (Towtongie)</seg>
<seg id="257">Mr. Towtongie (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="258">The residents of Rankin Inlet North and Chesterfield Inlet, I rise today to pay tribute to one of our most respected elders, Annie Tatty, who was sent to Ottawa by air.</seg>
<seg id="259">Also one of our elders, Amarok, as I rise today in the House, is sent to Gjoa Haven because there are no elders in Rankin Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="260">I would like to draw your attention to Rankin Inlet North and Chesterfield Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="261">As soon as I was elected in November, when I was looking at the budget for the Department of Health and Social Services, I asked, "Where are the plans for the elders" facility in Rankin Inlet or here in Nunavut? "</seg>
<seg id="262">I was told by the Minister of Health and Social Services that all of us, as Members of the Legislative Assembly, are very concerned about our elders.</seg>
<seg id="263">At our meeting in Pond Inlet, we were told that this issue would be brought up.</seg>
<seg id="264">I'm waiting.</seg>
<seg id="265">A few days ago, I stood up when we were dealing with the capital estimates and I didn't see the funding that was set aside for the elders "centre.</seg>
<seg id="266">I was told that I don't have to talk about this because I have to stop.</seg>
<seg id="267">However, I was grateful to our Chairman, Allan Rumbolt, for allowing me to go ahead and present my feelings to the elders "centre.</seg>
<seg id="268">Now I stand up for myself as an elected official because I am not satisfied.</seg>
<seg id="269">The issue of sending elders to places where they have not been raised in the south is not acceptable.</seg>
<seg id="270">As Members of the Legislative Assembly, we want to be a good government. we have told our elders that we would like to congratulate them and send them outside of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="271">Member for Amittuq, Mr. Quirke.</seg>
<seg id="272">Member's Statement 105 - 5 (1): recognition of Hall Beach and Igloolik Volunteers and Search and Rescue (Kilabuk)</seg>
<seg id="273">Mr. Iqaqrialu (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thought I was forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="274">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my pride in my fellow residents.</seg>
<seg id="275">The search and rescue teams work very hard to find people when there is a search and rescue going on.</seg>
<seg id="276">They use it for their own transportation.</seg>
<seg id="277">I rise today to pay tribute to our community of Hall Beach's Emergency Response Team, chaired by Kyle Issigaitok, second by George Innuksuk, guided by Martha Gibbons Tupik, and Daniel Qaunaq.</seg>
<seg id="278">One of our elders, Abraham Ullaaq, is an elder.</seg>
<seg id="279">As I stated before, this is the first time that a person goes out on the land for search and rescue.</seg>
<seg id="280">We need to provide more support to our young people because our elders are telling us the truth.</seg>
<seg id="281">We don't believe that there is a future for the people of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="282">Now that I am here, I would like to express my disappointment, but if I did, I would be more than happy to listen.</seg>
<seg id="283">I don't think that's going to be the case for the young people. when you go out on the land, make sure that you are safe.</seg>
<seg id="284">Mr. Iqaqrialu (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would also like to recognize the people of Igloolik. they had a meeting this week in Hall Beach.</seg>
<seg id="285">With that being the case, Mr. Speaker, if you are travelling anywhere, please have your SPOT devices and ask the elders where I go and I will catch up very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="286">Things like that.</seg>
<seg id="287">The reason why I rise today is to reiterate that the Department of Community and Government Services has one snowmobile and we have been lobbying the Department of Community and Government Services and they have not received a reply.</seg>
<seg id="288">I would like to urge the Department of Community and Government Services to provide more support to the search and rescue organizations.</seg>
<seg id="289">And that's it.</seg>
<seg id="290">The last name on the list, Member for South Baffin, Mr. Joanasie.</seg>

<seg id="293">In Cape Dorset, the Sam Pudlat School will be utilized and anyone will be invited to participate in the music program.</seg>
<seg id="294">I would also like to thank the people of Cape Dorset for being able to travel to Cape Dorset, as well as the support of the Hamlet of Cape Dorset.</seg>

<seg id="299">This is the first time that we have had a federal park manager in Nunavut, Jenna Byrne, and her staff. she has always looked after me and our children, my wife, Carol Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="300">I would also like to thank all of you. I would like to thank the member from Pangnirtung, who is from Pangnirtung, for being able to come here. I am very grateful to my sister, Naomi Kuksuk, who is from Kugluktuk.</seg>
<seg id="301">She is here with us and she is always taking our daughter to school. I am very proud of her and I would like to welcome Jayden Natanai.</seg>
<seg id="302">I would like to elaborate a little bit on that at that time.</seg>
<seg id="303">When I was a child, I was still a child...</seg>
<seg id="304">... I was expecting a seal pup for the first time in the lake.</seg>
<seg id="305">I don't think there were too many people in the lake at that time, but I think there were a lot of people out there on the sand.</seg>
<seg id="306">They were very supportive of the Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit and my mother was my father.</seg>
<seg id="307">I would like to thank them very much for coming to the witness table.</seg>

<seg id="317">I would like to recognize Naomi Kuktuk Kuktuk and Carol Akeeagok, they are my family.</seg>
<seg id="318">Naomi from Grise Fiord, from Pangnirtung, I don't have a family on a daily basis, as you can see.</seg>
<seg id="319">Welcome to your Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="320">Member for Pangnirtung, Ms. Nakasuk.</seg>
<seg id="321">Mr. Nakasuk (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would also like to recognize and congratulate my husband for being here, Andrew Nakasuk.</seg>
<seg id="322">Please welcome him.</seg>
<seg id="323">Mr. Nakasuk, welcome to our Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="324">Recognition of Visitors in the Gallery. I have no more names on my list.</seg>
<seg id="325">We will move on in our orders of the day.</seg>
<seg id="326">We will begin with the Hon. Member for Iqaluit-Tasiluk, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="327">Question 123 - 5 (1): private Securities Act (Hickes)</seg>
<seg id="328">Mr. Hickes: thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="329">My questions are for the Minister of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="330">I look forward to working with my colleagues over the next couple of weeks and over the next couple of weeks to ensure that there is a level playing field, a level playing field, a level playing field, a level playing field, and a level playing field.</seg>
<seg id="331">I would like to ask the minister if, as a government, he will be introducing legislation to deal with this issue.</seg>
<seg id="332">Minister of Justice, Minister Iqaqrialu.</seg>
<seg id="333">Hon. Jeannie Iqaqrialu (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) I thank Mr. Hickes for the question.</seg>
<seg id="334">To date, the Government of Nunavut does not have a Code of Values and Ethics.</seg>
<seg id="335">Our department is aware of companies that provide laundry services in our communities, such as health centres.</seg>
<seg id="336">We are currently in the process of reviewing the policies of the Nunavut Business Credit Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="337">Mr. Hickes: thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="338">As the minister is saying, one of the last jurisdictions in Canada that does not have a Nunavut Business Credit Corporation Act, we want to make sure that businesses in Nunavut have the capacity to respond to that. we want to make sure that they have the expertise to provide that service.</seg>
<seg id="339">All provinces and territories have introduced legislation on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="340">I guess my next question is: when they do a review of the policy, is there going to be a legislative proposal coming forward in the House?</seg>
<seg id="341">Minister Iqaqrialu.</seg>
<seg id="342">Hon. Jeannie Iqaqrialu (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Mr. Hickes, yes, we can work on developing a policy or legislation for the private sector in this bill.</seg>
<seg id="343">Your final supplementary, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="344">Mr. Hickes: thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="345">I thank the minister for his commitment.</seg>
<seg id="346">Mr. Speaker, in the meantime, I would just like to say that the Department of Justice is being monitored by the RCMP. does the Department of Justice work with the Department of Community and Government Services to coordinate contracts with the Government of Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="347">Hon. Jeannie Iqaqrialu (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="348">I don't have that information in front of me, but I will look into it and get back to you.</seg>
<seg id="349">Question 124 - 5 (1): status of Clean-up in Baker Lake (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="350">Mr. Mikkungwak (interpretation): thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="351">My questions are for the Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="352">So those are some of the questions that I asked the minister last week in regard to cleaning up the contaminated site in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="353">In one of his responses to me, the minister indicated that a "final report" would be prepared and submitted to the Qulliq Energy Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="354">Will the minister commit to providing a copy of the report to both the Hamlet Council of Baker Lake and me as the MLA for the community?</seg>
<seg id="355">Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation, Minister Iqaqrialu.</seg>
<seg id="356">Hon. Jeannie Iqaqrialu (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Yes, Mr. Mikkungwak, I will commit to doing that.</seg>
<seg id="357">Your first supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="358">I thank the minister for that commitment.</seg>
<seg id="359">One of the things that the minister has raised with the Qulliq Energy Corporation is to see if we can work with the Hamlet of Baker Lake to clean that up. Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to share that good news with the hamlet when I go back to the community next week. I will encourage the hamlet officials to meet with the Qulliq Energy Corporation officials.</seg>
<seg id="360">Mr. Speaker, this may not be possible because the Qulliq Energy Corporation's storage facility is located in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="361">The minister indicated that the Qulliq Energy Corporation has already spent $1.68 million to date on the clean-up.</seg>
<seg id="362">Can the minister clarify how much it would cost to clean up the painting?</seg>
<seg id="363">Minister Uqaqrialu.</seg>
<seg id="364">Hon. Jeannie Iqaqrialu (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) The overall cost of the clean-up would be about $10 million for the Power Corporation. as I mentioned earlier, the damage has been done since the creation of Nunavut and the federal government is responsible for the clean-up.</seg>
<seg id="365">We are committed to working with the Hamlet of Baker Lake to clean up the contaminated site.</seg>
<seg id="366">Your final supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="367">As I stated in my Member's Statement last week, this issue has not been resolved by the federal government or the Government of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="368">Mr. Speaker, I am in support of the Qulliq Energy Corporation's position that the damage was caused when it was under the jurisdiction of the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="369">Will the Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation be willing to work with the Minister of Justice to review and clarify the legal options that may be open to him on this issue?</seg>
<seg id="370">Hon. Jeannie Iqaqrialu (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Yes, as the Minister of Energy and the Minister of Justice, we will work together to resolve this issue. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="371">Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, Mr. Lyall.</seg>
<seg id="372">Question 125 - 5 (1): school Leave Policy (Lyall)</seg>
<seg id="373">My questions are for the Minister responsible for the Public Service Act.</seg>
<seg id="374">In previous years, the annual reports of the Government of Nunavut's Public Service and the number of individuals using the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act were tabled in the Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="375">Unfortunately, the 2016-17 annual report did not include this information.</seg>
<seg id="376">Can the minister provide the House with that information?</seg>
<seg id="377">Minister of Finance, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="378">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="379">It seems like he wants us to go through the annual report and I'm sure it will be tabled in the House all year round.</seg>
<seg id="380">I don't know if it's going to be there or not, but I can look into that.</seg>
<seg id="381">Your first supplementary, Mr. Lyall.</seg>
<seg id="382">I would just like to ask the minister if he could provide that information to the House as to how many pys were used for the 2016-17 school year.</seg>
<seg id="383">Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="384">Speaker (interpretation): thank you. (interpretation ends) The question has been taken as notice.</seg>
<seg id="385">Member for Pangnirtung, Ms. Nakasuk.</seg>
<seg id="386">Question 126 - 5 (1): status of Pangnirtung Old Health Centre (Nakasuk)</seg>
<seg id="387">Mr. Nakasuk (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="388">My questions today are for the Minister of Community and Government Services.</seg>
<seg id="389">I have asked the minister about the old health centre in Pangnirtung that is no longer in use after the new health centre was opened.</seg>
<seg id="390">The old health centre has not been used for a long time, but it remains closed.</seg>
<seg id="391">My question to the minister is: can the minister provide an update on the status of the old health centre?</seg>
<seg id="392">Minister of Community and Government Services, Minister Kusugak.</seg>
<seg id="393">Hon. Lorne Kusugak (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="394">I thank my colleague for that question.</seg>
<seg id="395">When a building that used to be owned by the Government of Nunavut is no longer used by the Nunavut Housing Corporation, it becomes a question of whether it would be used for other government projects.</seg>
<seg id="396">The old health centre was built in 1975 in Pangnirtung.</seg>
<seg id="397">The Department of Health doesn't want to use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="398">We have had various consultations with the Government of Nunavut and we have not heard of any interest in that.</seg>
<seg id="399">According to the government's procedures, we are now in the planning stages to see if they would like to be taken over by the hamlet. we are currently working on that.</seg>
<seg id="400">If they don't want it, then we would have to go back to the non-insured Health Benefits Program.</seg>
<seg id="401">They go through a process where they are disposed of by the government.</seg>
<seg id="402">That's where we're at right now.</seg>
<seg id="403">Your first supplementary, Ms. Nakasuk.</seg>
<seg id="404">If I understand correctly, the communities have been asked if they would like to be taken into custody or what is the status of that?</seg>
<seg id="405">Hon. Lorne Kusugak (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="406">We haven't heard anything from the government and we haven't heard anything from them.</seg>
<seg id="407">At this time, we are planning to do a feasibility study to see if the hamlet would be interested.</seg>
<seg id="408">That's where we are right now.</seg>
<seg id="409">Your final supplementary, Ms. Nakasuk.</seg>
<seg id="410">I also thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="411">I don't know whether or not the hamlet would be interested in it, but if it wasn't able to proceed from there, how do they do it when the government buildings are no longer going to be used?</seg>
<seg id="412">I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="413">There are four main areas that we use in the Sivumut Abluqta Mandate.</seg>
<seg id="414">For example, in Pangnirtung, the old health centre is no longer wanted by the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="415">It was not requested, so we will look into it to see if it is requested by the hamlet.</seg>
<seg id="416">Those are the procedures that we use when we go through these types of situations.</seg>
<seg id="417">Member for Aivilik, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="418">Question 127 - 5 (1): social Services Client Travel Policy (Netser)</seg>
<seg id="419">Mr. Netser (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="420">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="421">I would like to make a statement today and I would like to say "good afternoon" to the people of Nunavut. since I have been here, I didn't say "good afternoon" to them. I would like to say "good afternoon" to them.</seg>
<seg id="422">We will be going home very soon.</seg>
<seg id="423">Mr. Speaker, it is regrettable that some of Nunavut's most vulnerable residents have to travel south for assistance when they are away from their families.</seg>
<seg id="424">I agree with the member that when you go to visit a relative, it changes a lot.</seg>
<seg id="425">The Department of Family Services "travel policy, which is on the government's website, was tabled in the Legislative Assembly in June 2013 and came into force on March 31, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="426">I was led to understand that the former Minister of Family Services had agreed to change the family travel policy.</seg>
<seg id="427">Can the minister indicate if any changes to the Department of Family Services "Client Travel Policy have been made since 2013 and if no changes have been made since March 31 of this year?</seg>
<seg id="428">Minister of Family Services, Minister Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="429">Hon. Joe Savikataaq (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="430">Mr. Speaker, I can't speak for the former minister, but what I can say is that the policy will remain in place until the end of March 2018, and it will remain in place until the new policy is changed.</seg>
<seg id="431">At the same time, I haven't heard anything from the Department of Family Services officials about any changes to this policy.</seg>
<seg id="432">If there is a need to change it, we can look at it and we can't change it unless we look at it.</seg>
<seg id="433">If there seems to be a change that seems to be beneficial to the clients and to the government we can look into it.</seg>
<seg id="434">Your first supplementary, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="435">Mr. Netser (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Thank you, Minister.</seg>
<seg id="436">The Department of Family Services "family travel policy states that an elder who is under the care of the Department of Family Services can be visited by two family members or guardians on an annual basis.</seg>
<seg id="437">Can the minister indicate if this policy has been amended to allow two family members to visit twice a year?</seg>
<seg id="438">Two return tickets, two would be able to travel at the same time or one would be able to visit twice.</seg>
<seg id="439">Just to be clear, the two return tickets are one and two return tickets per year for one person.</seg>
<seg id="440">Your final supplementary, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="441">Mr. Netser: thank you, Mr. Speaker. will the minister commit to considering changes to the family travel program for adults in care?</seg>
<seg id="442">Once the policy is in place, we will have to review it, but at this time, I can't commit to reviewing the whole policy.</seg>
<seg id="443">I'm sure that there will be a review done on the medical travel that is paid for by the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="444">We will have to work with the Department of Health to make sure that the policies are followed properly, but at this time, I can't commit to anything else.</seg>
<seg id="445">Member for Netsilik, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="446">Question 128 - 5 (1): update on Auditor General's Office (Qirngnuq)</seg>
<seg id="447">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="448">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Health.</seg>
<seg id="449">Mr. Speaker, from time to time, my constituents come to my office in my community to seek help for their medical needs.</seg>
<seg id="450">The minister often told me this week that Nunavummiut can call the ombudsman if they have any concerns.</seg>
<seg id="451">Mr. Speaker, the language and where you live, it is a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="452">Can the minister tell us what other ways the patient relations office can be contacted?</seg>
<seg id="453">Minister of Health, Ms. Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="454">Hon. Pat Angnakak (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="455">I understand your concern, we try to encourage people to call the toll-free number so that you can get a response right away.</seg>
<seg id="456">At this time, I don't have that information in front of me. there is also an email address and a fax number.</seg>
<seg id="457">Your first supplementary, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="458">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) I don't know if he answered my question or not.</seg>
<seg id="459">Mr. Speaker, the Information and Privacy Commissioner has raised concerns about privacy issues, and I understand that there is an urgent need to address this issue.</seg>
<seg id="460">The complaints office has a form that outlines any complaints or concerns.</seg>
<seg id="461">However, if you don't have a fax machine, you can't send it on your own.</seg>
<seg id="462">Can the minister clearly explain why these complaints should not be sent by fax?</seg>
<seg id="463">An Hon. Member: good question.</seg>
<seg id="464">Minister Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="465">That's a very good question.</seg>
<seg id="466">I think it has to do with the fact that there is a decrease in the number of fax machines out there. as we move forward, as a government, we are using a lot more bandwidth than we have in the past.</seg>
<seg id="467">According to my substantiation sheet, the government has a website that can be accessed at www.patient relations @ gov.nu.ca.</seg>
<seg id="468">If you want to fill out the forms, you can send them by fax. the government liaison officers also have staff in every community.</seg>
<seg id="469">In their home communities, they can be sent by fax to our headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="470">If the patient relations office doesn't have a fax machine, then I can find out why.</seg>
<seg id="471">Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="472">Question 129 - 5 (1): income Support Policies (Towtongie)</seg>
<seg id="473">Mr. Towtongie (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="474">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="475">Mr. Speaker, I would like to follow up on some of the questions raised by the Member for Kugluktuk regarding income support.</seg>
<seg id="476">The minister stated that the Income Support Program, which will be signed off by the department, is part of the program selection process.</seg>
<seg id="477">Can the minister clarify how his department will approach the selection process when it does not have a mandate to do so?</seg>
<seg id="478">Minister of Family Services, Minister Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="479">I would like to know if there is a lot of work that needs to be done, but I don't know if there is a lot of work that needs to be done in the short term or if there is a lot of work that needs to be done in the short term.</seg>
<seg id="480">If it was appropriate for him to go to the Department of Health and Social Services, it would be appropriate for him to go to the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="481">Your first supplementary, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="482">The Income Support Program is a policy of the Government of Nunavut and it is not a policy of the Government of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="483">If it is a policy like carving we will not be able to change it as Members of the Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="484">I see that when you don't have a job on your own, when you have a young person in Taloyoak and they ask you to sign up for a job that you don't have a job on a monthly basis and you don't know how it's going to go in the right direction, it's embarrassing.</seg>
<seg id="485">My question for the minister: can the minister clearly explain what specific policies are in place for Nunavut to establish an outpost camp in Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="486">Right now it's a model that doesn't apply to Nunavut in the north.</seg>
<seg id="487">The policy is for Nunavut only.</seg>
<seg id="488">Outside of Nunavut, it's only used in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="489">With respect to the review of the Income Support Program, there was a change to the policy.</seg>
<seg id="490">At this time, there is very little funding available for people who are on income support and there are children who are being removed from the Nunavut Income Support Program.</seg>
<seg id="491">I would like to extend my condolences to the people of Pangnirtung and the people of Pangnirtung.</seg>
<seg id="492">Yes, if there is no work to be done, we will not be able to do that, but we have to make better choices. however, we will look into this further.</seg>
<seg id="493">Question 130 - 5 (1): mining Training (Kilabuk)</seg>
<seg id="494">Mr. Quirke (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="495">I rise today to direct my question to the Minister of Economic Development and Transportation.</seg>
<seg id="496">Mr. Speaker, I firmly believe that when the mining companies do their best to create jobs and take care of the environment, these benefits are realized.</seg>
<seg id="497">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth.</seg>
<seg id="498">Last year, you tabled your 2017-18 main estimates for the Department of Economic Development and Transportation, which included $200,000 in funding for the Nunavut Mine Training Program.</seg>
<seg id="499">Can the minister provide an update on how much of this funding has been spent to date in 2017-18?</seg>
<seg id="500">Mr. Speaker, I hope I was understandable.</seg>
<seg id="501">Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Ms. Shewchuk.</seg>
<seg id="502">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="503">I would also like to thank the member for his questions.</seg>
<seg id="504">What I can say about the mine training program is that it doesn't have all the details on how it was spent.</seg>
<seg id="505">The department is working with the Department of Family Services, Nunavut Arctic College, the federal government, the mining industry, and Inuit organizations to develop a number of programs to prepare Nunavummiut for opportunities in the mining sector. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="506">Your first supplementary, Mr. Quirke.</seg>
<seg id="507">Mr. Quirke (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="508">I thank the minister for that answer.</seg>
<seg id="509">Is there going to be an increase in the Department of Finance's budget or is there going to be a decrease in the budget for the 2018-19 fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="510">Minister Shewchuk.</seg>
<seg id="511">I can't respond to that question at this time, but I apologize if I can go back to the member's question as to how the $200,000 has been spent.</seg>
<seg id="512">The Kitikmeot Corporation's apprenticeship program is $61,000 for this program, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association's literacy program for the Baffin region is $60,000, and the Hamlet of Arviat's employment readiness program is $78,000 for heavy equipment training.</seg>
<seg id="513">I thank the member for clarifying his question.</seg>
<seg id="514">Mr. Speaker, as you will recall, last week, I tabled a copy of the Nunavut Mineral Exploration and Mining Strategy in the House.</seg>
<seg id="515">They are going to be working near Hall Beach this spring.</seg>
<seg id="516">I'm just wondering if the minister and the Department of Economic Development and Transportation, not just the Northern Air Transport Association, can work with the mining companies to see how they can improve the training opportunities that are available to the residents of my community or to the High Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="517">Mr. Speaker, I would like to add that Hall Beach is a small community and they get a lot of money from the mining industry. I would like to thank them for that.</seg>
<seg id="518">You also stated that you will be supporting the mining sector.</seg>
<seg id="519">The reason why I'm asking this question, Mr. Speaker, is that we will be able to deal with some of the issues that you mentioned, such as the Mary River project.</seg>
<seg id="520">In the Baffin region, there is a gold mine in the Kivalliq and in the Kitikmeot, there is a gold mine in the Kitikmeot.</seg>
<seg id="521">Will they be able to deal with these issues?</seg>
<seg id="522">For example, as an Inuk, if I wanted to pursue a higher education, how would I be able to receive the training and how would the Department of Economic Development and Transportation be able to assist me?</seg>
<seg id="523">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also thank the member for raising a good question, but the Department of Economic Development and Transportation is not responsible for that.</seg>
<seg id="524">There is an interdepartmental working group and the Department of Education has a mine training coordinator, but it's also important to recognize that the mining sector is different and we have to take that into consideration.</seg>
<seg id="525">Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="526">Oral Questions.</seg>
<seg id="527">Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Mayne.</seg>
<seg id="528">Question 131 - 5 (1): support for Hospital Staff (Mayne)</seg>
<seg id="529">Mr. Mayne (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="530">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="531">First of all, I would like to raise this question because it affects many communities, not just my community.</seg>
<seg id="532">In all of Nunavut, we have nurses working in the health centres.</seg>
<seg id="533">Mr. Speaker, as you know, one of the reasons why there is a lack of employment is because there is only one nurse in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="534">The reason why we don't have enough staff is because we don't have enough staff to meet the needs of Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="535">It seems obvious that we are trying to reduce poverty in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="536">I hope I'm understandable in Inuktitut.</seg>
<seg id="537">I'll say it in English. (interpretation ends) Mr. Speaker, the number of positions in Nunavut is increasing because of the shortage of staff and the increasing workload. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="538">My question for the minister: can he tell us what steps his department has taken to provide more support to health care workers in the communities who have a lot of work to do?</seg>
<seg id="539">Minister of Health, Ms. Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="540">I thank the member for that very important question.</seg>
<seg id="541">The issue of staffing at the health centre is very important and we have been working very hard as a department to make sure that we don't have a shortage of staff at the health centre.</seg>
<seg id="542">I hope that will be the case, but we don't have enough.</seg>
<seg id="543">I know that the nurses are very tired.</seg>
<seg id="544">Our department tries to do what they can.</seg>
<seg id="545">We just did that in the communities. when the nurse was tired, we sent out additional nurses to provide support.</seg>
<seg id="546">With that information, they send the nurse to the health centre in case they have too much work to do.</seg>
<seg id="547">When a nurse is in a situation where they have to go on holiday or get sick, we look at where we can get an assistant in the community.</seg>
<seg id="548">In terms of the Nursing Recruitment and Retention Strategy, we don't want to reduce the number of nurses that are providing health care in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="549">Your first supplementary, Mr. Mayne.</seg>
<seg id="550">Mr. Mayne: thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="551">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="552">I think we're all concerned about the department's staffing numbers. for example, in my community, it's obvious that there are still a lot of vacant positions in the health centres.</seg>
<seg id="553">We have a vacancy rate of 70 percent in Arviat and 44 percent in Arviat.</seg>
<seg id="554">I know that it's a challenge and it's a lot of work.</seg>
<seg id="555">I would like to ask the minister if he could explain the challenges that his department faces in addition to providing adequate staffing at the community health centres.</seg>
<seg id="556">Minister Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="557">At the end of the day, we can't keep them for 30 months when they're trained. I don't know if they're new or not, but it's very hard to get nurses in the communities.</seg>
<seg id="558">I think that's one of the things that you have to look at. it's one of the things that the Department of Community and Government Services has been working very hard to address.</seg>
<seg id="559">Your final supplementary, Mr. Mayne.</seg>
<seg id="560">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="561">In other words, Mr. Speaker, we all know that there are problems in the communities where there is always a lot of work to be done and there is always a shortage of health centre staff.</seg>
<seg id="562">I would like to get clarification on exactly what is being done to address these problems in the communities. what is being done to address these problems in the communities?</seg>
<seg id="563">What is being done and what is being considered to ensure that our nurses and other health care professionals are supported by the department?</seg>
<seg id="564">Hon. Pat Angnakak (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="565">I would like to ask for clarification, but I don't have that information in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="566">For example, if we're open for emergencies, they can't make an appointment because the workload is too high or there are too many nurses leaving for whatever reason.</seg>
<seg id="567">In my department, as I said, we're trying to fill all the positions. it's a challenge because we're competing with the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="568">That's what we're trying to do. I know that they work with people who have experience in the north, but not in the north, such as northern Manitoba.</seg>
<seg id="569">There are a number of different things that we try and do. I know that the Department of Health and Social Services is well aware of the practices of our nurses.</seg>
<seg id="570">It's not easy to come up with a solution, but I have to keep working on it. if you have any ideas, please let me know.</seg>
<seg id="571">Question 132 - 5 (1): insurance Policy for Government Facilities (Hickes)</seg>
<seg id="572">Mr. Hickes: thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="573">My questions are for the Minister of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="574">As we all know, Mr. Speaker, in all the Nunavut communities, there are different types of infrastructure, terminal buildings, health centres, schools, and offices.</seg>
<seg id="575">My question to the minister is: when it comes to insurance, is it on a case-by-case basis or is it on a case-by-case basis?</seg>
<seg id="576">Minister of Finance, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="577">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Our insurance coverage is broken down into different categories depending on the type of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="578">Each of our infrastructure has different policies and some of them do not even have a policy. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="579">I recently saw on the news that some of our communities were trying to burn down the school.</seg>
<seg id="580">The reason for the lack of insurance is that the Department of Finance is trying to improve the infrastructure to ensure that we have adequate insurance coverage. we also learned that the cost of maintaining our own home in Arctic Bay is $10 million.</seg>
<seg id="581">How is it going to affect the insurance company if there is another fire in the school? (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="582">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Today, the insurance premiums have increased from $10 million to $20 million.</seg>
<seg id="583">At the same time, we continue to lobby the Department of Education and all of us.</seg>
<seg id="584">I think we need to try and show that we can continue to work towards a better system. we need to show that the cost of living is increasing and that we have our own insurance. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="585">I understand exactly what I'm afraid of, but when you look at the insurance rates in the communities, it's about half of the cost.</seg>
<seg id="586">I asked a question.</seg>
<seg id="587">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) I hope that we will continue to have insurance.</seg>
<seg id="588">So this is going to be the new $20 million for school fires.</seg>
<seg id="589">Schools and other facilities have to pay $1 million on their own.</seg>
<seg id="590">They are different.</seg>
<seg id="591">I can't say how many schools will have to burn down, they are no longer insured.</seg>
<seg id="592">I hope that we don't have a fire in our government and I appreciate the fact that all Members of the Legislative Assembly have to continue to push for this because this is a school for our children and for the public...</seg>
<seg id="593">It's not just the schools, it's also the health centres that are very valuable to our service.</seg>
<seg id="594">Any damage is a challenge for our clients and I would like to continue to advocate for these facilities.</seg>
<seg id="595">So Mr. Speaker, a reminder.</seg>
<seg id="596">This is a public building where all students and the public, including schools, health centres, and garages, are served by the public.</seg>
<seg id="597">I applaud the minister for tabling this document. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="598">Question 133 - 5 (1): expansion of Curriculum in Baker Lake (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="599">I would like to direct my questions to the Minister responsible for Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="600">Mr. Speaker, as the member alluded to in his Member's Statement, as one of the five Members of the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut, we have an opportunity to build a new Nunavut for a brighter future.</seg>
<seg id="601">Can the minister tell the House if he would be willing to reopen the idea of establishing a university in your community in partnership with the private sector and others?</seg>
<seg id="602">Minister responsible for Nunavut Arctic College, Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="603">I thank the Member for Baker Lake for that question.</seg>
<seg id="604">With respect to Nunavut Arctic College, we made a request for proposals from different universities outside of Nunavut to see how we can work together.</seg>
<seg id="605">We have heard from various organizations, such as Agnico-Eagle, that they would like to establish a university in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="606">We have been working on this, but to date, we have been trying to come up with an agreement as to which ones we would like to work with outside of Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="607">I am very proud of the fact that we have to provide funding for education and growth from Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit to the Piqqusilirivvik Cultural School.</seg>
<seg id="608">I feel that Baker Lake would be a great place to expand.</seg>
<seg id="609">Can the minister clarify if he and his officials have been in contact with the Board of Governors of Nunavut Arctic College to look at ways to increase the opportunities for higher education in Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="610">Minister Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="611">Nunavut Arctic College would like to see more opportunities for Nunavummiut to pursue post-secondary education in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="612">In regard to the Piqqusilirivvik Cultural School, we are looking at how we can expand the program.</seg>
<seg id="613">Yes, they will be part of the Nunavut Arctic College Board of Governors, along with my staff, the President of Nunavut Arctic College, and the Vice-President of Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="614">Your final supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="615">Mr. Mikkungwak (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) I recognize that the previous government accepted the recommendation that Nunavut Arctic College should not be established at that time.</seg>
<seg id="616">Will the minister commit to getting back to me on this issue and report back to the House on what he is aware of?</seg>
<seg id="617">Minister Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="618">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thank Mr. Mikkungwak for the question.</seg>
<seg id="619">The option to build a university in Nunavut is considered by a wide range of people.</seg>
<seg id="620">Agnico Eagle has said that they have been able to come up with $5 million to build a new university if there is an interest in it.</seg>
<seg id="621">I think there are ongoing discussions.</seg>
<seg id="622">At this time, in the next four years, I don't know if we're going to be able to go through that process. once the feasibility study is done, that will be part of the review.</seg>
<seg id="623">Members will note that the time for question period has expired.</seg>
<seg id="624">Mr. Mayne.</seg>
<seg id="625">Motion 015 - 5 (1): extension of Question Period (Mayne)</seg>
<seg id="626">Mr. Mapsalak (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) pursuant to Rule 39 (7), I move, seconded by the Hon. Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, that question period be extended. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="627">The motion is in order and is not debatable.</seg>
<seg id="628">All those in favour of the motion, raise your hand.</seg>
<seg id="629">Opposed.</seg>
<seg id="630">As a result, we have increased the time for oral questions from 30 minutes to 30 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="631">Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Mayne.</seg>
<seg id="632">Question 134 - 5 (1): grants and Contributions (Mayne)</seg>
<seg id="633">Mr. Mayne (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="634">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Environment.</seg>
<seg id="635">I rise today to ask about the Department of Environment's Harvesters "Support Program.</seg>
<seg id="636">Looking at our government's main estimates for 2016-18, there are three main estimates.</seg>
<seg id="637">Just to be clear in English, there are three grants from the Department of Environment that are administered through the Disaster Compensation Program, the Wildlife Damage Compensation Program, and the Fur Pricing Program.</seg>
<seg id="638">The department has allocated $150,000 for this fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="639">Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the minister if he can clarify how the Department of Environment evaluates the effectiveness of these programs.</seg>
<seg id="640">Minister of Environment, Minister Shewchuk.</seg>
<seg id="641">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="642">The price goes up three times a year and they just recently put out a tender at the beginning of March. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="643">Your first supplementary, Mr. Mayne.</seg>
<seg id="644">I would also like to thank the minister for his response on the sealskin issue.</seg>
<seg id="645">Mr. Speaker, the information that has been brought to the House in the last few years is something that I really wanted to see and I think it should be seen by the hunters as well.</seg>
<seg id="646">In 2011, the Department of Environment reported that sealskins were auctioned for $800,000.</seg>
<seg id="647">In 2012, it was $1.1 million and in 2013 it was $1.04 million.</seg>
<seg id="648">Mr. Speaker, can the minister provide an update on the status of the sealskin industry in this year's most recent annual report?</seg>
<seg id="649">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) I have a copy of your statement.</seg>
<seg id="650">I can't say where they are at right now, but I don't have that information in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="651">I can tell you that after the Aqsarniit trade show, there will be an increase in sales. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="652">Your final supplementary, Mr. Mayne.</seg>
<seg id="653">Thank you, Mr. Minister.</seg>
<seg id="654">This will be my last question, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="655">I would like to ask the Department of Environment if they would consider providing more funding to our hunters and trappers organizations.</seg>
<seg id="656">We know that the fox pelts are very important to the people of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="657">I believe that the funding that is used for one year is not enough, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="658">It's too small for me.</seg>
<seg id="659">I would like to ask the minister if he agrees with me and if he can look into this further in the coming months.</seg>
<seg id="660">I agree with you and I look forward to tabling the supplementary appropriation in the House.</seg>
<seg id="661">Question 135 - 5 (1): compensation for Damage to Hunters and Trappers (Keyootak)</seg>
<seg id="662">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Environment.</seg>
<seg id="663">Mr. Speaker, as we all know in Nunavut, hunters are severely damaged by polar bears, their cabins are damaged, their equipment is obsolete, and their snowmobiles are damaged.</seg>
<seg id="664">Mr. Speaker, there is usually compensation for the damage that has been done, but it is very difficult to get compensation for the damage that has been done.</seg>
<seg id="665">I wonder if the funding for the Disaster Compensation Program has been depleted this year.</seg>
<seg id="666">Minister of Environment, Ms. Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="667">I'm sorry I didn't hear everything.</seg>
<seg id="668">Can he rephrase his question?</seg>
<seg id="669">Speaker (interpretation): please repeat your first question, Mr. Keyootak.</seg>
<seg id="670">Our equipment, our snowmobiles, and our cabins are damaged by polar bears, especially when we are left behind.</seg>
<seg id="671">We all know that we have to pay compensation for the damage that was done when we left them behind.</seg>
<seg id="672">My question was: has the capital estimates for this fiscal year already been used for damages?</seg>
<seg id="673">Speaker (interpretation): thank you for clarifying that.</seg>
<seg id="674">Minister of Environment, Ms. Shewchuk.</seg>
<seg id="675">Your first supplementary, Mr. Keyootak.</seg>
<seg id="676">The minister indicated that he would provide a response once he has that information.</seg>
<seg id="677">Can the minister indicate how much has been spent in the Baffin, Kivalliq, and Kitikmeot regions?</seg>
<seg id="678">Yes, I will give it to the regions.</seg>
<seg id="679">Question 136 - 5 (1): child and Early Childhood Services (Hickes)</seg>
<seg id="680">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Education.</seg>
<seg id="681">The Minister of Education stated this afternoon that all licensed child care facilities will be able to receive additional funding depending on where they are located.</seg>
<seg id="682">How much is being considered to be allocated to licensed daycares?</seg>
<seg id="683">Minister responsible for the Nunavut Housing Corporation, Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="684">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="685">I thank Mr. Hickes for the question.</seg>
<seg id="686">The Department of Education's Executive Committee approved a two-party agreement for a three-year term. over the past three years, it has been broken down into four categories.</seg>
<seg id="687">If you want to get a detailed breakdown of how much it is, the O and M total is $1.1 million per year, which is broken down by year.</seg>
<seg id="688">That's the numbers that I have.</seg>
<seg id="689">I thank the minister for that explanation.</seg>
<seg id="690">Mr. Speaker, when I look at the Child Day Care Regulations for Nunavut, section 17 of the Nunavut Early Childhood Education Act, it states that all staff who work on a daily basis should be properly trained. that is one of the expectations that I have.</seg>
<seg id="691">Mr. Speaker, I am aware of the Early Childhood Education Program at Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="692">I'm just wondering if the minister could give us an idea of how it's going to work, how it's going to work, how it's going to work, how it's going to work, how it's going to work, and how it's going to work.</seg>
<seg id="693">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also thank Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="694">Training is part of the agreement for the next three years.</seg>

<seg id="696">We want to get more certified teachers who can teach early childhood education.</seg>
<seg id="697">That's one of the things that we're trying to do to increase the number of apprentices in Nunavut over the next three years and we look forward to that.</seg>
<seg id="698">Mr. Hickes: thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also thank the minister.</seg>
<seg id="699">I look forward to getting that information in the House.</seg>
<seg id="700">When I look at the daycare staff and the training programs that are available, I have always heard that when staff are trained, they seem to be more effective.</seg>
<seg id="701">Mr. Speaker, I have also heard concerns about the minimum wage for day care workers in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="702">When you're trying to provide the same level of education to our children in early childhood, it's very important for them to stay in the workforce.</seg>
<seg id="703">Is this funding to support daycare workers so that they can get a better salary so that they can continue to work there on a casual basis?</seg>
<seg id="704">I totally agree with Mr. Hickes and I totally understand and agree that we want our children to be well prepared and successful in life before they enter the school system.</seg>
<seg id="705">That's what we're trying to do and we're trying to provide support to the daycare staff.</seg>
<seg id="706">One of the agreements that we have with the parents is that as long as they don't increase the cost of child care, I think we can do what we can to make sure that the staff at the daycare are adequately compensated for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="707">We're still working on that right now and we want to make sure that we have daycare workers in all of Nunavut.</seg>

<seg id="709">Question 137 - 5 (1): Inuit Employment Needs in Government Contracts (Minn)</seg>
<seg id="710">On Friday, March 16, I asked the Minister of Community and Government Services about this issue.</seg>
<seg id="711">Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, or Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, or Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, or Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, or Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, or Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit.</seg>
<seg id="712">Mr. Speaker, the minister indicated that he was in support of increasing Inuit employment.</seg>
<seg id="713">The 20 percent is related to the construction of the Baffin Correctional Centre and the docking facilities in Iqaluit and Pond Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="714">If I understand correctly, Mr. Speaker, the rates are 20 percent and 15 percent.</seg>
<seg id="715">Can the minister provide an update on how we are going to make changes to the RFP process and whether the department has the authority to change the RFP process?</seg>
<seg id="716">Minister responsible for Community and Government Services, Minister Kusugak.</seg>
<seg id="717">I think it's understandable that when work is done by the Department of Community and Government Services, the Department of Community and Government Services provides assistance to the departments that are going to be doing the work.</seg>
<seg id="718">If it's going to be a docking facility, it's going to be the Department of Economic Development and Transportation. if we're talking about a correctional facility, it's going to be the Department of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="719">Those are the types of things that we work with when it comes to contracts. we work with them to make sure that the contracts are being adhered to.</seg>
<seg id="720">We work with our client departments to determine how many Inuit can be employed.</seg>
<seg id="721">We try to make sure that it doesn't go over budget and we work with the departments to make sure that it doesn't go over budget.</seg>
<seg id="722">At this time, I cannot say that after the tendering process has been completed, I believe that it is impossible to change the tendering process, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="723">I would like to direct my question to the Minister responsible for Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="724">If there are no changes to the tendering process, I don't know if there are any other programs that can be offered to Inuit.</seg>
<seg id="725">Can the Department of Community and Government Services work with the Department of Community and Government Services?</seg>
<seg id="726">I hope I was understandable, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="727">Can the minister tell me, and perhaps tell the House, what happens when employees from other communities choose to work in the construction industry, can employees from Nunavut receive the same benefits as employees from outside of Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="728">Hon. Lorne Kusugak (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="729">I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="730">Mr. Speaker, the Nunavummi Nangminiqaqtunik Ikajuuti Inuit Employment Plan is designed to:</seg>
<seg id="731">What are they going to be doing;</seg>
<seg id="732">Inuit who are available for employment based on their level of education;</seg>
<seg id="733">There are other community programs that could affect the Inuit employment opportunities that are available.</seg>
<seg id="734">Mr. Speaker, we encourage contractors in the communities to hire from the regions of Nunavut before hiring outside of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="735">That's why we encourage people to come to Nunavut and recruit.</seg>
<seg id="736">We encourage that.</seg>
<seg id="737">In addition to the services that we provide to our clients, we work very closely with the departments to help them achieve their goals.</seg>
<seg id="738">Your first supplementary, Mr. Mayne.</seg>
<seg id="739">Mr. Mayne (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) I also thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="740">This will be my last question. I would like to ask the minister: will the minister commit to working with his department to address the need for larger infrastructure projects in Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="741">Will the minister commit to working with his department to ensure that jobs are created and that Inuit are able to apply for jobs in construction projects outside of the territory?</seg>
<seg id="742">Will the minister commit to ensuring that this opportunity is taken into account to ensure that Nunavummiut are included in the contracting process?</seg>
<seg id="743">I believe that the Government of Nunavut as a whole encourages the public to look for employment opportunities for Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="744">That is the way it has always been set up and we will continue to do that.</seg>

<seg id="792">Sergeant-at-arms, please escort the witnesses in.</seg>
<seg id="793">Mr. Akeeagok, for the record, please introduce your witnesses and proceed with your opening comments.</seg>
<seg id="794">To my left is my Assistant Deputy Minister, Dan Kaapik.</seg>
<seg id="795">Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to appear before the Committee of the Whole to present Bill 2, Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, 2017-2019.</seg>
<seg id="796">As a government, we are proposing to spend $491,804,000 between April 1, 2018 and June 30, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="797">Mr. Chairman, over the course of this year, the Minister of Finance has been here for the entire fiscal year, but as one of the five Members of the Legislative Assembly, we have just sat down and we are still planning what we are going to do.</seg>
<seg id="798">With that being the case, for the 2018-19 fiscal year, we will be going to Iqaluit in the spring session in May and June.</seg>
<seg id="799">What I see, Mr. Chairman, is that in the interim budget, the department will be able to fulfill its mandate to provide services to Nunavummiut in the coming months.</seg>
<seg id="800">The issue of attendance is a serious issue in the allocation of funds for this year's general election.</seg>
<seg id="801">Mr. Chairman, all departments and territorial corporations have had the opportunity to review these interim expenditures. our calculations are based on the department's expenditures and financial processes over the past four years.</seg>
<seg id="802">We are satisfied that this amount will be sufficient for the operations and maintenance of the Legislative Assembly as a result of the review and passage of the annual budget.</seg>
<seg id="803">These are the details of the two pieces of legislation that we will be requesting:</seg>
<seg id="804">$8.62 million for the Office of the Legislative Assembly;</seg>
<seg id="805">$11.66 million for the Department of Community and Government Services;</seg>
<seg id="806">$29.08 million to the Department of Finance;</seg>
<seg id="807">$49.1 million for the Department of Family Services;</seg>
<seg id="808">$32.44 million for the Department of Justice;</seg>
<seg id="809">$10.77 million to the Department of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth;</seg>
<seg id="810">$64.1 million for the Department of Education;</seg>
<seg id="811">$85.77 million for the Department of Health's old office buildings;</seg>
<seg id="812">$8.32 million for the Office of the Environment;</seg>
<seg id="813">$82.73 million for the Department of Community and Government Services "old office buildings;</seg>
<seg id="814">$23.29 million for the Department of Economic Development and Transportation's regional office;</seg>
<seg id="815">$73.39 million for the Nunavut Housing Corporation; and</seg>
<seg id="816">Total Operations and Maintenance, to be Voted. $12.54 million. Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="817">Mr. Chairman, that concludes my opening comments.</seg>
<seg id="818">At this time, I would be pleased to answer any questions or comments that members may have.</seg>
<seg id="819">Do members have any general comments?</seg>
<seg id="820">Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="821">Mr. Towtongie (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="822">I was reading the Inuktitut version. $32.44 million for the Department of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="823">Is there a difference between $8.62 million in Inuktitut and $8.62 million for the Office of the Legislative Assembly or the Department of Justice?</seg>
<seg id="824">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) To clarify, the Office of the Legislative Assembly is requesting $8.62 million and the Department of Justice is seeking $32.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="825">I apologize if it wasn't properly translated into Inuktitut. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="826">In this case, the English version is correct.</seg>
<seg id="827">Mr. Hickes: thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="828">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Community and Government Services and the Minister responsible for Community and Government Services, as well as the Minister responsible for Community and Government Services, and the Minister responsible for Community and Government Services, as well as the Minister responsible for Community and Government Services, as well as the Minister responsible for Community and Government Services.</seg>
<seg id="829">I know that we did a lot of negotiations with the Financial Management Board and the minister has indicated that there are some real changes that need to be made to ensure that the departments are able to provide the services that they need to meet the needs of Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="830">It doesn't have an impact, Mr. Chairman, but it does have an impact on the bill.</seg>
<seg id="831">I'm just wondering: has there been any change in the way the budget is allocated for the next fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="832">Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="833">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Thank you for your question.</seg>
<seg id="834">To date, there have been no changes to the operations and maintenance budget, but we will probably see that in the fall. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="835">Are there any more general comments?</seg>
<seg id="836">If members have any questions on the opening comments, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="837">If not, we will proceed with the clause-by-clause review.</seg>
<seg id="838">Go to Bill 2 in your white legislation binder.</seg>
<seg id="839">Bill 2, Interim Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="840">Chairman (interpretation): clause 2. do you agree?</seg>
<seg id="841">Chairman (interpretation): go to Schedule on page 2. page 3 of the Inuktitut Schedule. supplementary Amounts Appropriated for the Period April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="842">Vote 1: operations and Maintenance. total Operations and Maintenance, to be Voted. $491,804,000.</seg>
<seg id="843">Thank you, Mr. Mayne. do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="844">Mr. Mayne: thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="845">I should have brought this up earlier. I have a question on departmental grants and contributions.</seg>
<seg id="846">It is my understanding that the numbers are based on a percentage of the annual budget, but some of the grants and contributions are already expended as soon as April 1.</seg>
<seg id="847">I just want to get a little bit more clarification on the grants and contributions that are provided by the Department of Economic Development and Transportation or the Nunavut Housing Corporation. how is that handled?</seg>
<seg id="848">Chairman (interpretation): thank you.</seg>
<seg id="849">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) That's a very good question.</seg>
<seg id="850">As I indicated in my opening comments, if you look at the last four years, some of them have been in the first three months of grants and contributions.</seg>
<seg id="851">I can say that the Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation are one of the largest departments in Nunavut. as you can see, the grants and contributions are geared towards operations and maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="852">If they have to go through a request for proposals, then each department has a different process and in the last four years, every department's expenditures are reviewed on a quarterly basis by the Department of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="853">Chairman (interpretation): thank you, Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="854">I guess my next question for the minister is: can the minister tell us if that's the process that they're going to go through for these projects or are there any projects that have been put on hold or are they just going to go through the normal process?</seg>
<seg id="855">Chairman (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Mayne.</seg>
<seg id="856">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) We are running the same department.</seg>
<seg id="857">Hopefully tomorrow, we will be able to see some of the work that we have to do in terms of the future budget. that's what we were able to accomplish in the fifth Assembly with the guidance of the Department of Executive and Intergovernmental Affairs. it's going to be the same for the next three months.</seg>
<seg id="858">Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="859">I'm sorry, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="860">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to welcome the minister and his officials.</seg>
<seg id="861">In the main estimates, there is $491,804,000 on top of that.</seg>
<seg id="862">First of all, just to clarify, in this bill, it will be used for $8,623,000. in your opening comments, the minister stated that it will be $8.26 million.</seg>
<seg id="863">The $3,000 is not enough and the total amount is $54,000.</seg>
<seg id="864">If that's the case, why is it so short?</seg>
<seg id="865">I would like clarification on that.</seg>
<seg id="866">Chairman (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="867">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="868">The bill is on page 3 in Inuktitut and we are trying to get the actual numbers approved.</seg>
<seg id="869">Those are the exact figures.</seg>
<seg id="870">As I stated in my Member's Statement, I'm just trying to get the numbers closer to the main estimates. that's what I have stated. I don't want to say all of the numbers, but we have reduced the numbers.</seg>
<seg id="871">The numbers that we're looking at in the bill are correct, but they just don't mention them.</seg>
<seg id="872">Total Centrally Administered Funds. $491,804,000. do you agree?</seg>
<seg id="873">Clause 5. do you agree?</seg>
<seg id="874">Chairman (interpretation): do you agree to Bill 2 as a whole?</seg>
<seg id="875">Do members agree, pursuant to Rule 62 (2), that Bill 2 can immediately be placed on the orders of the day for third reading?</seg>
<seg id="876">Minister Akeeagok, do you have any closing comments?</seg>
<seg id="877">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="878">I would like to thank all Members of the Legislative Assembly for their support in approving this budget. I look forward to sitting in this House when we deal with our budget in May and June.</seg>
<seg id="879">I thank you all.</seg>
<seg id="880">Bill 2 is concluded.</seg>
<seg id="881">I will now ask the minister if we can proceed with his opening comments on Bill 3.</seg>
<seg id="882">Bill 03 - Supplementary Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, No. 3, 2017-2018 - Consideration in Committee</seg>
<seg id="883">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="884">I will keep my officials at the witness table and I would like to make sure that as soon as we get to the other positions, I will be able to invite them to the witness table, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="885">Mr. Chairman, can I begin with my opening comments?</seg>
<seg id="886">I am pleased to appear before you today to present Bill 3, Supplementary Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, 2017-2018, No. 3. under this bill, the government is proposing to increase its budget by $56,602,000 to:</seg>
<seg id="887">$49 million for the Department of Health and Social Services to address the significant costs associated with medical travel, mental health, rehabilitation, elder care, health care, physician services, and tuberculosis research;</seg>
<seg id="888">$6.2 million for the Department of Justice to cover costs incurred by the RCMP, Corrections, and the Department of Justice; and</seg>
<seg id="889">$1.402 million has been budgeted for the Department of Child and Family Services and the Department of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="890">Mr. Chairman, that concludes my opening comments. I would be pleased to answer any questions or comments that members may have.</seg>
<seg id="891">Are there any general comments?</seg>
<seg id="892">Supplementary Appropriation (O and M) 2017-18, No. 3. family Services. not Previously Authorized.</seg>
<seg id="893">Total Children and Family Services. $1,402,000.</seg>
<seg id="894">I don't have that number in front of me, but it doesn't really give me a clear picture of where it's at, where it's at, where it's at, where it's at, and where it's at.</seg>
<seg id="895">Mr. Savikataaq, can you respond to that question, Hon. Joe Savikataaq (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="896">Hon. David Savikataaq (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="897">I don't have the breakdown of the numbers in front of me, but there are two areas where we are sending more patients outside of Nunavut and we have increased the number of visitors outside of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="898">For example, there is an elder in Igloolik, in Gjoa Haven.</seg>
<seg id="899">There are some people who are not supported by the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="900">The majority of people who are sent outside of Nunavut do not have access to elders "services in Nunavut. as I said earlier, there are more people visiting the communities.</seg>
<seg id="901">I'm just wondering if the Department of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth has ever gone back to the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="902">Some of the things that the minister mentioned are not directly related to the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="903">Some of them are in the care of the Department of Health, the elders are in the care of the Department of Health, and when some of them want to visit, there is funding available through the Department of Family Services for medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="904">That's one of the examples I used. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="905">I understand that there is a need to visit some of the individuals that are in the care of the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="906">My question is: are there any elders still receiving social assistance that have not been transferred to the Department of Health?</seg>
<seg id="907">Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="908">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) According to the information that I have, it has been transferred to the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="909">Those that have not been transferred to the Department of Health and Social Services are still managed by the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="910">I'm just wondering if there are any other programs that have not been transferred to the Department of Family Services. when we look at the information and our plans, I think they are all transferred to the Department of Family Services. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="911">Maybe I'm confused, but if the Minister of Family Services can clarify that, I would appreciate it.</seg>
<seg id="912">It's up to Minister Akeeagok to respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="913">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Let me try to clarify that.</seg>
<seg id="914">I thought the question was: is there anyone in the Department of Health that still needs to be in the Department of Family Services?</seg>
<seg id="915">The answer I got was that the Department of Health is in there right now, the seniors "services are in there.</seg>
<seg id="916">We are still in the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="917">The supplementary appropriation is for the Department of Family Services. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="918">I thank the minister for clarifying that.</seg>
<seg id="919">Now I have a better understanding.</seg>
<seg id="920">Perhaps if I ask it in a different way, it will be easier to understand.</seg>
<seg id="921">Does the Department of Family Services still deal with elders?</seg>
<seg id="922">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Yes, there are still programs for elders, but I would like the Minister of Family Services to clarify that.</seg>
<seg id="923">I know that the government programs, such as the Senior Fuel Subsidy Program, the Senior Fuel Subsidy Program, the Senior Fuel Subsidy Program, the Senior Fuel Subsidy Program, the Senior Fuel Subsidy Program, the Senior Fuel Subsidy Program, and I believe that the Department of Family Services is responsible for people over the age of 60.</seg>
<seg id="924">If I missed something, Minister Savikataaq can help me answer the question. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="925">I thank both ministers for clarifying that.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my last question.</seg>
<seg id="927">When people are sent outside of Nunavut, are they still eligible for income support?</seg>
<seg id="928">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) I would like Minister Savikataaq to respond to that question. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="929">Chairman (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="930">It varies depending on the situation.</seg>
<seg id="931">In some cases, they are eligible for income support, but I can't say that all of them are the same.</seg>
<seg id="932">I have a lot of detailed questions for the department.</seg>
<seg id="933">It indicates that they will be providing funding for painting facilities from other departments.</seg>
<seg id="934">As it stands now, does the other division have the support of all Nunavummiut?</seg>
<seg id="935">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) It doesn't affect all the regions.</seg>
<seg id="936">In addition to the Department of Family Services, most of the money was transferred to the Department of Health and Social Services under the Income Support Program.</seg>
<seg id="937">They don't get that much subsidy. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="938">I thank the minister for that answer.</seg>
<seg id="939">When do you identify that they may be in a deficit situation and how do you deal with that?</seg>
<seg id="940">I don't know if that has an impact on our meeting, Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="941">The department reports on a monthly basis and at the end of the fiscal year, it's a little bit over budget for the department. if they can't do that, then we have to go through the supplementary appropriation process.</seg>
<seg id="942">We're on page 4.</seg>
<seg id="943">Mr. Mayne,</seg>
<seg id="944">The document in front of us indicates that the number of residential care placements in Nunavut has increased from 189 to 243.</seg>
<seg id="945">Do you think that the numbers are going to continue to increase?</seg>
<seg id="946">What is the increase in the number of children in care?</seg>
<seg id="947">Do you know what the reasons are for the increase in the number of people requiring care?</seg>
<seg id="948">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) The number of clients has been increasing since 2013.</seg>
<seg id="949">It's been changing for a number of years. I'm just wondering if that's going to be included in this budget as soon as possible. I'm not going to be approving a supplementary appropriation because you're going to have an accurate budget.</seg>
<seg id="950">Will that be included in the increase?</seg>
<seg id="951">As we go through the page-by-page review of the departmental estimates, it will be evident as we go through the page-by-page review of the departmental estimates. as we go through the page-by-page review of the departmental estimates, we look at the main estimates.</seg>
<seg id="952">We will have questions as we go through the main estimates. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="953">In your substantiation sheet that was provided by the department, there is a surplus.</seg>
<seg id="954">It also mentions the department's recent reorganization of the Income Support Program.</seg>
<seg id="955">My question for the minister: can the minister indicate how much of the surplus has been spent on the administration of the income support office or will the majority of the funds be allocated to the income support office?</seg>
<seg id="956">Which ones did you increase?</seg>
<seg id="957">I'm trying to understand where the surplus went, where was it spent?</seg>
<seg id="958">Is there an increase in the income support payments or is there an increase in the amount of money that was left over?</seg>
<seg id="959">Chairman: Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="960">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) There are a number of issues with the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="961">There has been an increase in the number of positions that have been hired to manage the transition from one department to another, and some of those positions have been filled in terms of who they are and how they work.</seg>
<seg id="962">When the Income Support Program was amended, it was funded by the Government of Nunavut and the government's response was that they send people to residential care in a number of different ways.</seg>
<seg id="963">There are a number of factors that determine how the Department of Family Services has arrived at its budget shortfall for the current fiscal year. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="964">I'll be there for him.</seg>
<seg id="965">The information indicates that the department is spending more money in the main estimates for income support and this document indicates that more money is being spent on income support.</seg>
<seg id="966">Is the money that is going to be used for the staff or is it going to be used for the income support office?</seg>
<seg id="967">My colleague, Mr. Savikataaq, can provide a better response to that question.</seg>
<seg id="968">Mr. Savikataaq, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="969">The amendments to the Income Support Program have a significant impact on these funds. I can use this as an example.</seg>
<seg id="970">It's called the Child Benefit Supplementary Benefit. it's called the Child Benefit Supplement. it's called the Child Benefit Supplement.</seg>
<seg id="971">The children who were taken out of the income support program will no longer be able to do so. at this time, the income support recipients will receive more money and the families will no longer be deducted from the income support program.</seg>
<seg id="972">We are on Total Children and Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="973">Not Previously Authorized. $1,402,000.</seg>
<seg id="974">Justice. operations and Maintenance. not Previously Authorized.</seg>
<seg id="975">Total Justice. $2,600,000.</seg>
<seg id="976">Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="977">Mr. Netser (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="978">Welcome, Minister.</seg>
<seg id="979">What it says here is that the purchase of new drugs will be subject to legislative changes by the federal government this summer. is that the plan?</seg>
<seg id="980">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) I would like to ask the Deputy Minister of Justice to go to the witness table.</seg>
<seg id="981">Does the committee agree to bring in the witness?</seg>
<seg id="982">Sergeant-at-arms, please escort the witnesses in.</seg>
<seg id="983">For the record, Mr. Akeeagok, please introduce your witness.</seg>
<seg id="984">To my left is the Deputy Minister of Justice, Bill MacKay.</seg>
<seg id="985">If it's okay with you, I would like to respond to the question.</seg>
<seg id="986">Mr. Chairman, that's a very good question in regard to the Department of Justice and the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="987">This does not apply to marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="988">We don't want prescription drugs in Canada and we don't want them to come to Nunavut because these are new drugs that we need to learn and implement.</seg>
<seg id="989">In December, at the Finance Ministers "Meeting, the money that will be allocated for marijuana, 25 percent of the money from the federal government will go to the RCMP, to do drug testing.</seg>
<seg id="990">This is a two-party system.</seg>
<seg id="991">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="992">My next question is in regard to the high cost of housing in the communities.</seg>
<seg id="993">I'm just wondering if the minister could explain why that's in there.</seg>
<seg id="994">Chairman (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="995">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) This is related to the fact that the RCMP received nine additional RCMP officers in different communities and that's why they provide staff housing.</seg>
<seg id="996">When there are additional RCMP officers, we have to go through government contracts to purchase those additional units, which was under $300,000. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="997">Mr. Mayne, did you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="998">Mr. Mayne: thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="999">The minister was talking about the $2.6 million allocation of $300,000 for housing.</seg>
<seg id="1000">I'm just wondering if he could break it down into a little bit more detail.</seg>
<seg id="1001">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) I may have missed a number.</seg>
<seg id="1002">I will ask my officials.</seg>
<seg id="1003">Those are the numbers.</seg>
<seg id="1004">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1005">I would also like to thank the minister. (interpretation ends) As I stated earlier, $1 million will be used for vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1006">Why did you not expect these vehicles to be purchased?</seg>
<seg id="1007">I believe it should have been included in the budget.</seg>
<seg id="1008">What was the reason for the purchase of new vehicles?</seg>
<seg id="1009">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman. that's a very good question.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The $1 million is for the replacement of vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1011">We do have a contract with the RCMP and there are different processes in place.</seg>
<seg id="1012">Last year, it was reported that the vehicles were not being replaced due to a lack of funding.</seg>
<seg id="1013">They tried to prevent that from happening, but earlier this year, they found that their vehicles were too damaged to meet their basic needs.</seg>
<seg id="1014">That's why it has gone up so much this year.</seg>
<seg id="1015">There has been a lot of hedging, but there has been a lot of damage to the property and that's the way it is.</seg>
<seg id="1016">Under the contract with the RCMP, we don't have to go through the procurement process.</seg>
<seg id="1017">However, in our discussions with the Nunavut Association of Municipalities and the Nunavut Association of Municipalities and the Nunavut Association of Municipalities, we have come to an agreement on this issue and it seems to have gone up.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Mr. Mayne (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1019">I would like to thank my colleague for asking that question.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I think these drugs are the new ones that are the most dangerous drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1021">Will this equipment be made available to all communities or will it be made available to all communities?</seg>
<seg id="1022">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Yes, the RCMP will be providing this service to all the communities.</seg>
<seg id="1023">Those are the new tools that the RCMP and the public may have to go through. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1024">Can the minister indicate if any new drugs have been found in our communities or if they have not been found in any of the communities to date?</seg>
<seg id="1025">Yes, the people who are coming into our communities are very sad and I hope that they will stop.</seg>
<seg id="1026">However, there have been a couple of communities that have been impacted. there are a lot of people who are coming up from the Northwest Territories.</seg>
<seg id="1027">It's very dangerous and I'm very afraid that these people will try to take drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1028">If you don't get those things, it's a lot more fun, but the way things are going, it's dangerous and I would like to congratulate the RCMP because they are in the planning stages.</seg>
<seg id="1029">Mr. Mayne: I thought we were done.</seg>
<seg id="1030">That's my last question.</seg>
<seg id="1031">In regard to the shortage of housing in the communities, perhaps you can clarify that for the Nunavut communities.</seg>
<seg id="1032">According to the documents that we have provided, there have been nine additional RCMP officers in nine of the six communities in Nunavut that have been decentralized to different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1033">That was just a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1034">Moving on, Mr. Hickes, do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the $2.6 million that you're asking for, it talks about the court interpreters who are going through the court system. did you need seven interpreters from the court system?</seg>
<seg id="1036">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) At this time, no, there are a number of additional interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1037">I'll just leave it at that. in his opening comments, he talked about the need for new phones and the need to continue with the old ones.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Now that we know that they're going to have to replace their existing telephones, are they going to be putting money aside for new ones or are they going to be asking for additional funding once they know the number from the RCMP?</seg>
<seg id="1039">Yes, this is being planned by the Department of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth.</seg>
<seg id="1040">One of the things that my colleague has mentioned in his business plan is that the finance ministers will be in the public service. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1041">With respect to other correctional facilities, as the member is referring to, there are a number of full-time staff at the Baffin Correctional Centre. what is the total number of inmates at the Baffin Correctional Centre?</seg>
<seg id="1042">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Item 8. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1043">Did he say that there were eight?</seg>
<seg id="1044">Mr. Hickes (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) I would like to direct my question to the minister.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Can the minister clarify that for me?</seg>
<seg id="1046">Through you, I would like my Deputy Minister, Mr. MacKay, to respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1047">Mr. McKay: thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1048">The Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Health and Social Services has a lot of other staff who work in the Department of Health and Social Services. if the weather is bad, they have to stay there.</seg>
<seg id="1049">When there is a blizzard, they can't go home. can the minister tell me if there are going to be more people coming to work?</seg>
<seg id="1050">Mr. MacKay, can you clarify that?</seg>
<seg id="1051">Yes, there are a couple of cases where if there is a blizzard, they are brought in right away, but there are only two cases where there is a blizzard.</seg>
<seg id="1052">Mr. Lyall.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Mr. Lyall: thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1054">My questions are for the Minister of Justice. first of all, the RCMP has indicated that they will need housing for nine new RCMP officers.</seg>
<seg id="1055">When you get a police officer, are they provided with housing on a case-by-case basis?</seg>
<seg id="1056">I am pleased to say that one of my staff members, a hockey player who suffered a stroke by a fellow employee, will probably be relieved that my deputy minister will not be able to write a letter.</seg>
<seg id="1057">It's going to have to be a whisper.</seg>
<seg id="1058">My question is in regard to the nine RCMP detachments that receive housing from the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="1059">As I stated earlier, there are different ways that we work with the RCMP through contracts.</seg>
<seg id="1060">I would like to clarify for the committee that 70 percent of the RCMP costs are paid by the Government of Nunavut and 30 percent is paid by the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="1061">The RCMP is provided through their contract with the federal government. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1062">Mr. Lyall: thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1063">I'm just wondering if the RCMP will be providing housing for all the RCMP detachments.</seg>
<seg id="1064">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) When the RCMP put their staff into a community, they automatically determine their age.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They operate in a unique way because they don't allow one of their officers to go out on the land.</seg>
<seg id="1066">They don't expect to get their own housing in the communities on a regular basis, depending on how many RCMP officers are needed in the communities.</seg>
<seg id="1067">The RCMP is unique in that they operate on a case-by-case basis.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When they identify a need for an RCMP detachment, they try to include all 25 communities. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1069">It is regrettable that the RCMP does not try to become an integral part of the community.</seg>
<seg id="1070">When the RCMP buys their own home, what kind of assistance do they provide?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Chairman (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Lyall.</seg>
<seg id="1072">I don't think there are a lot of questions that need to be asked here.</seg>
<seg id="1073">I don't think we should expect them to get their own homes and that's why they are provided with housing.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Mr. Akeeagok, if you would like to speak, it's up to you.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1076">That was a very good comment, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Mr. Speaker, although the RCMP members have only been in the community for three years, they have been raised in the community.</seg>
<seg id="1078">If an RCMP officer wants to get a house, they have to apply to the federal government for a home.</seg>
<seg id="1079">It's not a federal program. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1080">My last question in regard to the RCMP is: how many contracts did you have with the RCMP?</seg>
<seg id="1081">Branch Summary. total Operations and Maintenance, to be Voted. $40,071,000.</seg>
<seg id="1082">If this is approved, it will be $42,671,000 for this contract. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1083">Thank you for that clarification.</seg>
<seg id="1084">Moving on to the third item, the Corrections Division is responsible for overtime and casual staffing.</seg>
<seg id="1085">Chairman (interpretation): Mr. Lyall, we're just here for the Law Enforcement Division. we haven't gotten there yet. can you wait for your questions?</seg>
<seg id="1086">At this time, we are asking questions to the Law Enforcement Division. (interpretation ends) Are there any further questions?</seg>
<seg id="1087">Mr. Lyall (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Yes, this is the last one for the Law Enforcement Division.</seg>
<seg id="1088">According to the minister's letter, the total budget was $40 million, of which $30 million was for law enforcement, which is estimated to be $42 million.</seg>
<seg id="1089">How much of that $42 million is projected to be spent by the end of the fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="1090">Maybe if I could ask my colleague what specific numbers he is looking for.</seg>
<seg id="1091">If there is a number, I would like to get some assistance. at this time, the document that I tabled on Friday, I believe I found $30 million, but if you could elaborate a little bit more.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The letter, dated March 16, was addressed to the Chairperson of the Regular Members "Caucus, the Minister of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="1093">The letter I am referring to is on page 4 and there are five in total.</seg>
<seg id="1094">I would like to thank the member for his question.</seg>
<seg id="1095">This line item is $30 million for this year and to date it has been used for $30 million, and the plan is $42 million.</seg>
<seg id="1096">The $2.6 million that we have requested is based on the RCMP numbers. that's why I wrote that letter.</seg>
<seg id="1097">I'm looking at $2.6 million. on page 1 of the Legislative Assembly's substantiation sheet, it indicates that the RCMP administers the Auditor General's Report on the Auditor General of Canada's Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act. on top of that, it speaks to the history of this request.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The standing committee notes that the Government of Nunavut is committed to improving the management of the department. however, due to the unique nature of its operations, an additional $2.6 million will be required to cover the costs of staffing, training, and other departmental initiatives.</seg>
<seg id="1099">On the same page, it talks about $2.6 million for employee bonuses and casual salaries. on the same page, it talks about $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1100">Can you clarify that, Mr. Chairman?</seg>
<seg id="1101">Mr. Akeeagok, if you would like further clarification, it's up to you.</seg>
<seg id="1102">If you look at page 3 of the business plan, there's an additional $2.6 million for correctional facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1103">There are two separate projects in the amount of $2.6 million, but they're separate.</seg>
<seg id="1104">The need for the RCMP radios, the need for housing, the need for vehicles, as well as the number of incidents that have occurred in the past. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1105">I also thank Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="1106">If we're talking about $2.6 million, how much of that is, I don't understand that. can you clarify that for me?</seg>
<seg id="1107">Chairman (interpretation): thank you, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="1108">On page 5 of our document, Law Enforcement Branch, we're dealing with $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1109">Further, "Corrections $2.6 million," which is not the total amount that we're dealing with right now, we're at $2.6 million under Law Enforcement.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Do you have any questions?</seg>
<seg id="1111">Mr. Towtongie (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Thank you for clarifying that.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When I read the Inuktitut version, the English version of the main estimates is the same, but in the Inuktitut version, it looks like the main estimates, it looks like the main estimates in Inuktitut.</seg>
<seg id="1113">Can the minister clarify what this means in terms of the main estimates or the main estimates for 2017-18?</seg>
<seg id="1114">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) On the left of the main estimates, it talks about $40 million for law enforcement, $11 million for the Office of the Legislative Assembly, which has already been approved.</seg>
<seg id="1115">To my right, not Previously Authorized. (interpretation ends) We are still in the 2017-18 fiscal year. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation) That is why we are seeking approval from the Legislative Assembly for supplementary appropriations for the Department of Justice. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1116">A total of $6.2 million, of which $2.6 million would go to the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="1117">That's what we're requesting from you in the House. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1118">I was just confused because it looks like there's an estimate in Inuktitut.</seg>
<seg id="1119">I understand my question a little bit now, so I'll leave it at that.</seg>
<seg id="1120">We're on Law Enforcement. $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Next on the list is Total Registries and Court Services, $1 million.</seg>
<seg id="1122">Total Justice. corrections. $2,600,000.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Mr. Lyall: thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1124">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Corrections because every year they go over budget, if I recall correctly, they go over budget just for overtime.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Is that correct?</seg>
<seg id="1126">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1127">The member is correct that the maximum amount is for overtime, as well as casuals.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Mr. Lyall: thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1129">If my memory serves me correctly, the correctional facilities are staffed for 12 hours a day. is that correct?</seg>
<seg id="1130">At this point in time, the correctional facilities are full and the staff are working overtime, so has your department considered three to eight hours a week to make sure that there is no room for improvement?</seg>
<seg id="1131">I would like to ask the Deputy Minister, Mr. MacKay, to respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The member is correct that it takes 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1133">That's how it's set up. they have to work for two hours, 42 hours a week, and they're going to be working overtime for 42 hours a week.</seg>
<seg id="1134">Under the collective agreement, the overtime was reduced from $4 million to $2.49 million.</seg>
<seg id="1135">As a result, the corrections department's deficit jumped from $4.5 million to $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1136">We are moving forward with the overtime payments and we will continue to do that.</seg>
<seg id="1137">A reminder to put your cellphone in your mouth and keep it quiet.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Mr. Lyall (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1139">They operate only on overtime, and they work 42 hours a week.</seg>
<seg id="1140">Do employees work 50 or 60 hours a week?</seg>
<seg id="1141">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1142">It's very detailed. we have to provide it to the House and we will provide it in writing.</seg>
<seg id="1143">Our deputy minister can't answer that question.</seg>
<seg id="1144">We don't have that information in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="1145">I don't know how much information is required for the operation of the facility.</seg>
<seg id="1146">I would like to direct my question to the minister.</seg>
<seg id="1147">What kind of training do they receive?</seg>
<seg id="1148">Through you, I would like Deputy Minister MacKay to respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1149">I think the answer to that is that there is a training and training supplementary appropriation that is going to be used under the Corrections Division.</seg>
<seg id="1150">At this time, we don't have any training programs.</seg>
<seg id="1151">When we have a trainer on a contract, it costs them a lot of money, and when they're working overtime, they have to be replaced by someone else, so that increases the cost of training.</seg>
<seg id="1152">We are also looking at other ways of better planning and budgeting to make sure that the staff in the correctional facilities and the courts are better trained so that we don't have more contract teachers.</seg>
<seg id="1153">Ms. Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="1154">I was just wondering when the $2.6 million was announced for staff training.</seg>
<seg id="1155">What kind of training will be provided to employees and casuals?</seg>
<seg id="1156">Both the Baffin Correctional Centre and the Nunavut Court of Justice provide excellent training for casuals and staff.</seg>
<seg id="1157">I don't know if they're going to be hired on a casual basis, but they're going to be trained for a number of weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1158">Can the minister tell me what kind of programs are in place at the correctional facility? I didn't have to ask that question.</seg>
<seg id="1159">I don't know if they have that level of detail, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="1160">I'm just wondering if the Deputy Minister, Mr. MacKay, can elaborate a little bit on that, if you will allow him.</seg>
<seg id="1161">Ms. MacKay.</seg>
<seg id="1162">I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I will be able to get back to the member on what kind of training is provided to inmates.</seg>
<seg id="1163">Depending on which category of low-risk inmates are housed at the Iqaluit Baffin Correctional Centre, they are provided with trades training so that they can continue to work in the correctional facility.</seg>
<seg id="1164">At the Akausisarvik facility, we also have programs in place for each inmate based on their needs, addictions counselling, anger management counselling, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1165">Even though they can't leave the correctional facility, they are trained to be able to work in a correctional facility.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The Rankin Inlet Correctional Centre provides correctional services to inmates in Rankin Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="1167">There are different programs that we provide.</seg>
<seg id="1168">Mr. Nakasuk: I'm done.</seg>
<seg id="1169">We are on page 5.</seg>

<seg id="1172">Turn to page 6.</seg>
<seg id="1173">Department of Health. operations and Maintenance. not Previously Authorized.</seg>
<seg id="1174">Mr. Akeeagok, would you like to make a comment?</seg>
<seg id="1175">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) That's not a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1176">If it's okay with you, we will move on to another department. the witness is available to answer questions, so I would like to make a few changes before we go to the witness table. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1177">I was going to give you an opportunity, but if you want to take this opportunity, that's fine.</seg>
<seg id="1178">Sergeant-at-arms, please escort the officials out.</seg>
<seg id="1179">Does the committee agree to bring in the witnesses?</seg>
<seg id="1180">Chairman (interpretation): sergeant-at-arms, please escort the other witness in.</seg>
<seg id="1181">For the record, Mr. Akeeagok, please introduce your new witness.</seg>
<seg id="1182">He just walked in, to my left, Deputy Minister of Health and Social Services, Colleen Inuuujaq Stockley.</seg>
<seg id="1183">Health. operations and Maintenance. not Previously Authorized. total Directorate. $5.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Mr. Netser: I made a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1185">When it comes to travel, that's what I'm going to be asking about.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Chairman (interpretation): thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1187">Are there any questions on headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="1188">I don't have too many questions, but when we're talking about elders "homes in Nunavut, there are three facilities that are going to be funded from different sources.</seg>
<seg id="1189">A couple of days ago, when I was asking about the pre-feasibility study in Igloolik and Gjoa Haven, they were looking at expanding the elders "facility.</seg>
<seg id="1190">At that time, the minister did not know how many beds would be available for the study.</seg>
<seg id="1191">My question for the minister: can the minister update the House today on the status of his department's efforts to increase the number of elders "facilities in Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="1192">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you for the question.</seg>
<seg id="1193">It's under the preplanning stage. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1194">What is the status of the pre-planning phase and what is the current status of this project?</seg>
<seg id="1195">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) I would like my Deputy Minister of Health to respond to that because he is more familiar with the capital estimates.</seg>
<seg id="1196">The Department of Health is already planning for last year's capital budget for 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1197">I would like to ask the minister about the feasibility of expanding the facility in Igloolik.</seg>
<seg id="1198">Keeping that in mind, after the election, it was likely that the government would have a new mandate to look at options for the Igloolik expansion.</seg>
<seg id="1199">This has not gone far enough, but we expect that more action will be taken once we know what the government's mandate is.</seg>
<seg id="1200">Just to conclude, when we talk about the use of government resources to identify deficiencies in our infrastructure, I would like to emphasize to the department that it is the responsibility of the Government of Nunavut to address the issue of elder care.</seg>
<seg id="1201">I look forward to continuing to build on the existing infrastructure and identify opportunities for Nunavummiut to take advantage of the new infrastructure that is currently on the waiting list.</seg>
<seg id="1202">It's more of a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1203">I would like to follow up on my colleague's question in regard to the elders "home operations.</seg>
<seg id="1204">I would be interested to find out what the breakdown is of the $900,000.</seg>
<seg id="1205">I'm just wondering if the minister could give us an idea of what type of infrastructure is going to be allocated to these facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1206">The $900,000 is divided into three categories, totalling $300,000 each for each of the three elders.</seg>
<seg id="1207">Mr. Mapsalak (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1208">What is the process that the Department of Health and Social Services uses to inform people if they're going to be spending too much money?</seg>
<seg id="1209">The three communities that are operated by the Government of Nunavut have recently issued new contracts and this is one of them.</seg>
<seg id="1210">If there is a need to increase or decrease, the Department of Health and Social Services and the Nunavut Association of Municipalities meet to discuss these issues.</seg>
<seg id="1211">When they have to come up with a solution, they have to come up with a solution.</seg>
<seg id="1212">They have to abide by the laws of Canada and Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1213">In the business plan, it talks about the opening of three new residential care facilities in 2012-13. there are a number of factors that have contributed to the increase in the number of residential care and aging facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I'm just wondering if there's going to be an increase in the amount of money that's going to be spent in the next fiscal year. is there going to be an increase in the cost of operations or is there going to be a cap on the amount of money that we have now?</seg>
<seg id="1215">At the beginning of the contract, three of them were under the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="1216">The Department of Health finally took over the contract in April 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1217">One of the things that we brought to the attention of the Department of Health and Social Services was that there was a difference in the quality of care provided by the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="1218">There were a number of recommendations that were made on the Nutrition North Canada Program.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When we looked at the contract, the elders "facilities were not able to provide the necessary services.</seg>
<seg id="1220">There was a deficit of $855,000 last year and that's why we're asking for almost $900,000 right now.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Please correct me if I'm wrong when I look at the funding for mental health services across Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1222">We have to deal with trauma in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Is there any talk of putting money aside for mental health treatment?</seg>
<seg id="1224">We're here, we're just talking about additional funding for operations and maintenance. we're not talking about actual costs.</seg>
<seg id="1225">I don't think this is appropriate for the Legislative Assembly or anything else.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Do you have any further questions, Ms. Towtongie?</seg>
<seg id="1227">I thank the minister for clarifying that.</seg>
<seg id="1228">In terms of the mental health contract for 2017-18, I think it's $16 million, $16.7 million, $6.2 million. what is the status of that?</seg>
<seg id="1229">That's my last question. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1230">Mr. Chairman, we're on $5.9 million, which is part of the $43.1 million that the member is asking about.</seg>
<seg id="1231">The actual amount is $16 million and $10 million is there.</seg>
<seg id="1232">I would like Deputy Minister Stockley to explain why he is asking for an additional $10 million. if you can respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1233">It's very good to hear that Nunavummiut are asking for help.</seg>
<seg id="1234">There has been an increase in the number of people seeking help. that's why there has been an increase in the number of people going to the treatment centre.</seg>
<seg id="1235">I know people who have mental health problems and addictions.</seg>
<seg id="1236">There are also costs outside of the Department of Health and Social Services that are covered by the Department of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Before we proceed to the Directorate, we will take a five-minute break.</seg>
<seg id="1238">&gt; &gt; Committee recessed at 18: 03 and resumed at 18: 10</seg>
<seg id="1239">I would like to call the committee meeting back to order.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Total Health and Social Services. $43,100,000.</seg>
<seg id="1241">Outside of Nunavut, in terms of long-term elder care, you have identified a number of areas that are becoming increasingly forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1242">This number may increase due to the fact that we don't have a dementia research centre in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1243">That's what I'm interested in.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Are they looking at the possibility of having a dementia research centre in Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="1245">It's one of those things right away, but it's not at the top of the list.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Those are the types of things that are being worked on right now.</seg>
<seg id="1247">At the same time, outside of Nunavut, in the long term, the last document that we have in front of us is the regional budget for the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="1248">I was a little bit taken aback by the fact that the minister's letter, broken down by department, did not include anything within the budget to address the deficit.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Can the minister indicate if his department will be spending all of its funding in this area?</seg>
<seg id="1250">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman. on page 6, the first item is $5.9 million. not Previously Authorized.</seg>
<seg id="1251">We are requesting $5.9 million for elders "care. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1252">My question is more directed to the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Maybe through you, if I make a mistake, Deputy Minister Stockley can correct it.</seg>
<seg id="1254">I think it's a question that I can answer right now with respect to the over-expenditures, but there are other things that have not been removed from the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="1255">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you for clarifying that.</seg>
<seg id="1256">If there is money that has not been spent within the department, then we transfer the money that has not been spent.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The remaining budget for the Department of Health is $49 million.</seg>
<seg id="1258">The letter that I just sent out today will be translated into Inuktitut and it was sent in English on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1259">That's a very small amount compared to the deficit that we're proposing in this supplementary appropriation. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1260">I appreciate the appendix, but what I was trying to get at was in the letter that we received from the minister on page 4, there's a breakdown of programs and funding.</seg>
<seg id="1261">Under the Department of Family Services, they're showing the surplus that they're going to be able to reuse.</seg>
<seg id="1262">I'm just wondering why the Department of Health hasn't done that.</seg>
<seg id="1263">There was no indication from the Department of Health and Social Services that there would be a surplus.</seg>
<seg id="1264">On page 5, it indicates that the Department of Health and Social Services will require an additional $49 million. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1265">He's not talking about the Department of Health and Social Services, but he's talking about the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="1266">In the Department of Health and Social Services, I know that there is a regional surplus in the Nursing Recruitment and Retention Strategy. there has been a surplus of over $1 million over the last few years.</seg>
<seg id="1267">Can the minister provide us with a breakdown of all the programs that are provided by the Department of Health and Social Services when there is a surplus?</seg>
<seg id="1268">You're asking for a lot of information that may not be available at this time.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Minister Akoak...</seg>
<seg id="1270">... Mr. Akeeagok, go ahead.</seg>
<seg id="1271">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for recognizing me.</seg>
<seg id="1272">We don't have that level of detail.</seg>
<seg id="1273">We will be able to table it in the House at a later date. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1274">I'll move on to the elders "facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1275">In the second bullet, it indicates that the current elders "facilities are operated under a contract with a not-for-profit Nunavut organization.</seg>
<seg id="1276">I just want to say that this is a very good program that is available to all Nunavummiut and organizations.</seg>
<seg id="1277">I hope that they will be able to contract as many people as they can.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Moving on to the next bullet, it states that "24-hour care is provided 24 hours a day, seven days a week by the Department of Health and Social Services in accordance with the Department of Health's guidelines."</seg>
<seg id="1279">The Department of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth is responsible for administering the program.</seg>
<seg id="1280">I would like to ask a question to the Minister of Health and Social Services about the need for elders "facilities to meet the minimum requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1281">I responded to that earlier.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The department has entered into a new contract with Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, which has been increased as a result of the Department of Health's compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="1283">If there is no compliance, the interpreters and the Department of Health meet with each other to make sure that they are following the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1284">Mr. Mrazek (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1285">Can you clarify whether or not these elders "facilities are up to the minimum level of care that they need?</seg>
<seg id="1286">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1287">It's a new contract and we have increased it from $900,000 to $5.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="1288">We have been assured by the three departments that they are going to try and keep up with the current level of care, but they haven't really reached the level of care that the elders need.</seg>
<seg id="1289">The minister indicated that they are trying to keep up with that. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Mr. Netser (interpretation): thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1291">It's starting to get sore in my throat because I'm so quiet.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In regard to medical travel, they are asking for $50 million and I have raised this issue many times in the House. when patients go to the hospital, they don't have an appointment, especially in my constituency, especially when they go down to Winnipeg.</seg>
<seg id="1293">Does the Department of Health have a list of patients who went down to Winnipeg prior to their appointments being cancelled? (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1294">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="1295">The Minister of Health has committed to reviewing all patients and patients who were not seen or changed as a result of their appointments.</seg>
<seg id="1296">One of the things that the government is looking at is to make sure that we find out where the wrongdoing occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1297">I would like to thank the member for asking that question. he said that he has seen these types of things and we would like to include them in our review.</seg>
<seg id="1298">I would like to thank the member for raising that issue and we can look into it together.</seg>
<seg id="1299">That will be part of the review. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1300">Mr. Netser (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) I look forward to the review report.</seg>
<seg id="1301">At this time, there was $5.5 million for tuberculosis in Qikiqtarjuaq, and as recently as February 26, the federal government set aside a large amount of money for Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami. I believe it was $82 million and $80 million was set aside for TB research.</seg>
<seg id="1302">I wonder if the Government of Nunavut, or the Department of Health, or the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, can assist us in providing this funding. I wonder if the Government of Nunavut or the Government of Nunavut have been in contact with the federal government to see if they are willing to pay for the treatment of tuberculosis.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1304">That's a very good question.</seg>
<seg id="1305">At this time, the federal government has indicated that it will be included in the 2018 / 19 budget as a contribution to the fight against tuberculosis, but at the same time, it states that Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami will be allocated funding over the next five years for the Inuit Circumpolar Conference.</seg>
<seg id="1306">At this time, it states that the Standing Committee on Oversight of Government Operations and Public Accounts has a committee from the Inuit Land Claims Agreement. the Department of Health and Social Services is a member of the Standing Committee on Oversight of Government Operations and Public Accounts.</seg>
<seg id="1307">At this time, the additional funding will be provided by the federal government, and as the Minister of Finance, I haven't seen the details yet.</seg>
<seg id="1308">I look forward to seeing the details. if Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami is doing a good job and they understand us, we are working with the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="1309">That's the way it is.</seg>
<seg id="1310">We will be kept informed by the minister in regard to your question.</seg>
<seg id="1311">I would like to ask another question on the issue of medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="1312">Here in Iqaluit, there is an increase in the number of patients who go to the hospital and there is an increase in the number of people who go to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="1313">I'm just wondering if the Department of Health and Social Services understands why the costs are going up.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The 5.6 percent is expected to become more expensive each year, so what are the main reasons for the increase?</seg>
<seg id="1315">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Through you, I would like my Deputy Minister, Mr. Stockley, to respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1317">Medical travel and medivacs are increasing every year.</seg>
<seg id="1318">The number of patients who are on medical travel is also increasing, so that could be a good thing because they are being diagnosed very early.</seg>
<seg id="1319">At the same time, tuberculosis has been a major issue in Nunavut and it is one of the most preventable diseases in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1320">Let me give you an example.</seg>
<seg id="1321">I believe there were about 60 people that had to be medevaced to the hospital last Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="1322">There has been an increase in the number of patients being sent out on a weekly basis, but in the spring of this year, there has been an increase in the number of people who are suffering from respiratory problems.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Combined with medical travel and emergency medical travel, there has been an increase in the number of cases.</seg>
<seg id="1324">Mr. Chairman, I'm not going to get into the details, but I'm just trying to get a sense of what the reasons are for the increase.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Is it going to be good for the population of Nunavut? is it going to be good for the health of the people of Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="1326">My question is: are we starting to catch up or are we being left behind in terms of the number of people who are sick?</seg>
<seg id="1327">I would like Deputy Minister Stockley to respond to that.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Unfortunately, the Department of Health and Social Services has one of the highest rates of overcrowding in Nunavut. overcrowding is a major health issue in Nunavut and we have made some progress, but if there is no shortage of housing, I'm sure it will improve.</seg>
<seg id="1329">We also increased the marshalling capacity at the Baffin Regional Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="1330">One of the things that we try and do is reduce the cost of medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="1331">We are moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="1332">One of the regions, for example, is the telehealth system, which is going to be used in three regions.</seg>
<seg id="1333">You will hear more about the Main Estimates for the Department of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth.</seg>
<seg id="1334">I thank the minister for that answer.</seg>
<seg id="1335">I look forward to working on the Main Estimates for the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In terms of mental health, it's over $10.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="1337">When I look at the substantiation sheet, it doesn't say what the reason is for the increase of $10.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Are you being encouraged by your department to increase the number of people with mental health problems and what is the reason for that?</seg>
<seg id="1339">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) It's both a physical assessment and a mental health assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1340">During the Fourth Legislative Assembly, the issue of suicide was raised as a matter of urgency for the government to take action.</seg>
<seg id="1341">So we're going to continue to do that and we're going to continue to do that. we don't have any training programs in place to make sure that they're identified by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1342">It will transform the lives of our citizens and ensure that the Members of the Legislative Assembly continue to bring this issue to the public.</seg>
<seg id="1343">My final question is in regard to the Mental Health Training Program: how many services are we providing to people who are receiving care outside of Nunavut for mental health issues?</seg>
<seg id="1344">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) 64.</seg>
<seg id="1345">How is 64 more, is it less, and how does it change in the past?</seg>
<seg id="1346">We don't have that information from the past, but the numbers are increasing and if the member wants that information, we will be able to provide that information to him.</seg>
<seg id="1347">Moving on to another topic, the Qikiqtarjuaq TB study, I'm sure all of us agree that it's very encouraging to hear that.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Is it going to be in the hands of the Department of Health and Social Services or is it going to be in the other communities, or is it going to be in the smaller communities, or is it going to be in the communities?</seg>
<seg id="1349">Through you, I'll have Deputy Minister Stockley respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Is the property assessment going to be done through the capital planning process?</seg>
<seg id="1351">I'm lost.</seg>
<seg id="1352">It's under capital, so I'm just wondering if I could get some clarification on that.</seg>
<seg id="1353">I would like my deputy minister, Ms. Stockley, to respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1354">The bulk of these assets came from the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="1355">The programs that we received from the federal government, such as Uqaqtittijii, Inuit Uqausinginnik Taiguusiliuqtiit, Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, and Inuqangit.</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Mayne: thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1357">My last question, probably the last one.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Under the Department of Health and Social Services "Nursing Recruitment and Retention Strategy, the department has been successful in reducing the number of agency nurses.</seg>
<seg id="1359">I would like to ask, for this year's expenditures, what changes have been made to the funding formula?</seg>
<seg id="1360">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Instead of using agency nurses, we are using agency nurses to provide more services to Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="1362">From last year to today, we are using more agency nurses.</seg>
<seg id="1363">That's my last question.</seg>
<seg id="1364">If I get the breakdown of the $8.6 million, I would be very grateful.</seg>
<seg id="1365">Broken down by category, for the 2017-18 fiscal year, the casual staffing shortfall was $52.5 million, the casual staffing budget exceeded $45.3 million, the waiting list was $15.7 million, and the catalogue of nurses exceeded $0.1 million, a total of $8.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1366">I just have one question in regard to the breakdown of what you're talking about, but I would like to add to Mr. Mayne's question.</seg>
<seg id="1367">I don't have the details in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="1368">If there is a nurse in Sanikiluaq who is in an emergency situation in the middle of the night and needs to be sent out, then I know that the employee has to work overtime.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1370">I know the minister was answering questions today on what the department is doing to recruit nurses.</seg>
<seg id="1371">I'll leave it at that for now.</seg>
<seg id="1372">I would just like to say that when we look at the budget of the Department of Health, the staff, the doctors, the contractors, the mental health workers, and the travel costs are always reflected in the supplementary appropriation on an annual basis.</seg>
<seg id="1373">The number for mental health and addictions is a significant change from last year. I believe it was $6.8 million to $7.8 million in last year's supplementary appropriation.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Earlier in my Member's Statement on the budget process, the Minister of Finance indicated that they haven't made any changes at this time, but I believe that we have to make some changes.</seg>
<seg id="1375">I'm just wondering if the minister could give us an idea of how much it's going to cost and how much it's going to cost, but I'm just wondering if the minister could give us an idea of how much it's going to cost and how much it's going to cost.</seg>
<seg id="1376">That's just a comment, but I would like to hear from the minister on that.</seg>
<seg id="1377">I think that's exactly what we're looking at right now. members of the Fifth Legislative Assembly have been considering these issues and we have been having discussions with some departments, including the Department of Health and Social Services, and the Department of Justice, and they are continuing to ask for supplementary appropriations.</seg>
<seg id="1378">I'm very pleased that we're talking about this in the budget and I'm working very closely with my colleagues on this.</seg>
<seg id="1379">I'm responding to some of the health issues. since I have been the Minister of Health and Social Services, there has been a lot of attention paid to the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="1380">We have to work on the main estimates in order to correct some of the mistakes that have been made, but without making any changes to the budget process, we have to recognize that we have to go through the process.</seg>
<seg id="1381">It is only through this House that we will be able to make those changes.</seg>
<seg id="1382">One of our colleagues in the Regular Members "Caucus spoke very eloquently about this issue.</seg>
<seg id="1383">I also want to make sure that we have a good working relationship as Members of the Legislative Assembly, which is something that we really need.</seg>
<seg id="1384">In 2017-18, we are facing some of the challenges that we face. I look forward to working with the Premier and our elected officials to ensure that we don't have to be in a position where we know exactly how much money was spent by departments.</seg>
<seg id="1385">I just wanted to say that and thank you, Mr. Chairman, for giving me the opportunity to speak.</seg>
<seg id="1386">Chairman (interpretation): thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1387">I applaud the minister for recognizing the need for improvement.</seg>
<seg id="1388">I just wanted to reiterate, as the Minister of Justice has indicated, that the issue of overtime is something that we have been talking about for the last three and a half years.</seg>
<seg id="1389">My question to the Minister of Human Resources is: how can the Government of Nunavut fill these positions?</seg>
<seg id="1390">If we're going to make progress in filling some of the existing positions within our organization, if we're going to fill some of the weaknesses that we have, Mr. Mayne talked about the challenges that we have in the government in terms of burnout and health issues for some of our employees, then we need to take a step back and look at how we can move forward in filling those positions.</seg>
<seg id="1391">In terms of overtime, I would like to find out more as we move forward where the priorities are and what the initiatives are so that we can look forward to what we can do.</seg>
<seg id="1392">That was just a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Mr. Mikkungwak, did you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1394">Mr. Mikkungwak (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1395">I just have one question in regard to the mental health and addictions contract. in the fourth paragraph, it states that the Department of Justice pays for medical travel. is that included in the $10.5 million?</seg>
<seg id="1396">I'll make it brief, yes to the members.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Mr. Lyall, do you have any further questions?</seg>
<seg id="1398">My final question is for Mr. Mayne and Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="1399">My last question is in regard to the Nursing Recruitment and Retention Strategy. the $8.6 million deficit is just an indication of $143 million to $151 million to $8.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1400">Is that for all the salaries and benefits of the department?</seg>
<seg id="1401">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Yes, those are for compensation and benefits.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Mr. Lyall: thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1403">Is this $151 million 100 percent accurate?</seg>
<seg id="1404">It's a $25 million increase in salaries.</seg>
<seg id="1405">I don't think the funding has ever been at 100 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1406">I think that's what we're trying to do. we're asking for $8.6 million in the main estimates for compensation and benefits. I think that's the closest we can get.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. it's not 100 percent accurate in our financial statements. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1408">When it's just around the corner, it lists a lot of things.</seg>
<seg id="1409">Moving on to the minister's opening comments on page 4, the department's budget for medical travel is $63.8 million for the 2017-18 fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="1410">I'm just wondering why the money was set aside in the 2016-17 fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="1411">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman. I don't have that information in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1413">Mr. Lyall, we're trying to deal with 2016-17, not 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1414">I'll keep that in mind for 2016-17, but I'll leave it at that.</seg>
<seg id="1415">I was asking about the medical travel budget last year. I would like to know what the department will be allocating for the 2018-19 fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Mr. Akeeagok may not have the figures for 2017-18. (interpretation ends) Hon. Minister, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) In May, we will be discussing the budget for the 2018-19 fiscal year. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1418">We are voting on the interim appropriation for 2017-18. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Again, in the budget, there is a problem with the funding that the minister has provided. there are a lot of different things that have been done on an annual basis and it should be in place in the next fiscal year, so I will be making a formal request to the Department of Health and Social Services for the O and M budget.</seg>
<seg id="1420">So I don't want to see the House continue to see additional funding every year.</seg>
<seg id="1421">It will remain the same as it used to be, so I would like to get more details from the Department of Operations and Maintenance at that time.</seg>
<seg id="1422">That's just a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Chairman (interpretation): Mr. Qirngnuq, do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1424">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1425">I would like to ask a question in regard to travel. (interpretation ends) In English, (interpretation) for the third bullet, (interpretation ends) air ambulance, (interpretation) there has been an increase from last year. (interpretation ends) Hon. Minister, (interpretation) I would like to get clarification. (interpretation ends) Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1426">What the member is referring to is that the number of people who have to travel to the health centre has gone up. there has been an increase in the number of people who have to go to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="1427">However, there is an increase in the number of patients who have to travel for medical reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Mr. Mikkungwak, do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1429">I'm sorry, I thought you had your hand up.</seg>
<seg id="1430">We are on Health and Social Services. operations and Maintenance.</seg>

<seg id="1443">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) I would like to take this opportunity to thank the members for their questions on the budget allocation for the upcoming fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="1444">With that, we will be able to make some changes to the budget.</seg>
<seg id="1445">Before we go on to the next bill, I would like to ask that the bill be thrown out.</seg>
<seg id="1446">I would like to thank him for his good work and now he will be able to stand up.</seg>
<seg id="1447">Chairman (interpretation): thank you. did you want someone else to bring in?</seg>

<seg id="4">"when the federal government was going to be announcing the nomination, the Liberal government came up with a long awaited northern policy framework."</seg>
<seg id="5">(photo courtesy of the Department of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth)</seg>
<seg id="6">Besson Jim Bell</seg>
<seg id="7">"the day before the national election campaign began, the Liberal government, with little presence, launched a long awaited Northern and Northern Policy Statement on September 10."</seg>
<seg id="8">"this document, which lays out the first steps in the continuation of the event, will replace former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper's 2009 Northern Strategy and the Harper government's 2010 Statement on Canada's Northern foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is designed to guide federal policy in the north until 2030 - but there is no implementation plan or political direction for future action.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in terms of the work that will be done on the second phase, the action plan states."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in spite of these events, this initiative from Caroline Barnabas, Minister of Government - Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, indicated that this policy document represents a" significant change of direction for the federal government. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The introduction of this policy is far behind what was expected.</seg>
<seg id="13">"this winter, Mr. Barnabas stated that this policy will be introduced in June."</seg>
<seg id="14">CBC news reported earlier this month that a news conference in Yellowknife in August had been cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the Liberal policy there are eight" goals, "which include goals, and 10 (10)" principles. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"it addresses a wide range of policy issues, including community and regional economic development, housing development, aboriginal rights, environmental protection, national security and foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="17">"this is Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, on December 20, 2016, when he announced that his government wanted to put in place new policies, he strongly stated that it would be a" strategic partnership "between the northern governments and aboriginal groups."</seg>
<seg id="18">"as a result, more than 25 aboriginal organizations, including the Government of Nunavut, the Northwest Territories, the Yukon, Manitoba, Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador, participated in the reconciliation process."</seg>
<seg id="19">"through the Framework for Provincial and Territorial Policy Action, our partners helped us to understand and raise awareness of the untapped opportunities and opportunities of different regions, responsibilities and land rights in the north," Mr. Barnabas said in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="20">"and some of the partners also wrote their terms of reference, which were published in a separate policy document."</seg>
<seg id="21">Some of the comments do not mention federal policy.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the Government of Nunavut, the Government of the Northwest Territories and the three territorial governments have issued a joint statement of their own."</seg>
<seg id="23">However, there are a number of activities that are taking place.</seg>
<seg id="24">These documents that have been submitted to the tribunal may not be able to represent the federal government's policy.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is a sign that the federal government may be in a conflict of interest with more than 31 parties.</seg>
<seg id="26">"while this action document is part of the action plan, it does not necessarily reflect the views of the federal government or other partners," the action document said.</seg>
<seg id="27">The document also states that the approval process was challenging.</seg>
<seg id="28">"ideas, actions and goals and aspirations are a forum for a wide range of ideas and ideas."</seg>
<seg id="29">This means that there is an agreement between the federal government and aboriginal groups when we are seeking approval. "</seg>

<seg id="40">Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit is helping to maintain and build trust between aboriginal and non-aboriginal people.</seg>
<seg id="41">These goals begin with a variety of "projects" that have been re-defined.</seg>

<seg id="43">"in order to achieve these goals and objectives, the policy document sets out the principles under which it is designed to" continue to guide the implementation of the mandate ":</seg>

<seg id="45">"the rights and positions of the federal, provincial, aboriginal and local governments will be carefully considered."</seg>
<seg id="46">"adaptation must be a tool and a source of trust, social, cultural, economic and environmental thinking."</seg>
<seg id="47">"to be able to meet with aboriginal people on an ongoing basis, using the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission as a starting point, would be a great achievement."</seg>
<seg id="48">"while climate change is a serious issue in this land, action will be taken by a wide range of stakeholders, including the impact on aboriginal people, who continue to use the land and wildlife as a cultural, economic and food source."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the policy and program will be a symbol of diversity and equality, as well as for the use of resources such as the Women's / Men's Equipment Assessment (GRA), which will be used to measure the potential impact of various aspects of society."</seg>
<seg id="50">"this is a program that takes into account a wide range of principles such as rights, incentives and conditions for Inuit, northern First Nations and MÃ©tis to be respected, validated and implemented."</seg>

<seg id="2">"we are going to do what we can to make sure that this happens before the polar bear season."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Nunavut's new polar bear management plan sets out a balance between male and female polar bears in all of Nunavut's polar bear populations," said the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board.</seg>

<seg id="5">B-Jane George</seg>
<seg id="6">Cambridge Bay - Government of Nunavut agrees to a new polar bear management plan.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was brought to the attention of the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board members at the Kitikmeot Wildlife Management Board meeting in Cambridge Bay last week.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the beginning of this new polar bear management plan is a balanced harvest of male and female polar bears in Nunavut. this is what the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board Chairperson, Dan Shewchuk, said to the delegates."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the meeting in Cambridge Bay is the first of three regional meetings of the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board and Jason Akeeagok, who is the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board's executive director, would like to attend."</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Akeeagok said the polar bear management plan was a "great deal of work."</seg>
<seg id="11">"we are going to do what we can to make sure that this happens before the polar bear season," he says.</seg>
<seg id="12">"this plan has been under consideration for almost five years, and it was discussed in the planning stages last March at the Iqaluit Nunavut Wildlife Management Board's meeting."</seg>
<seg id="13">The plan will be in place until 2029.</seg>
<seg id="14">This Arnaqtuq polar bear is sitting in the water near Arctic Bay while the four caribou are watching.</seg>
<seg id="15">"under the new polar bear management plan, polar bear calving would be banned in all three communities."</seg>
<seg id="16">(photo photographer Nirie Iqalukjuaq)</seg>
<seg id="17">"in all the northern regions of the world there are 19 polar bears, 12 more in Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="18">Polar bear quotas have been established by region (e.g. only male polar bears) from these polar bears - and the killing of polar bears is included in the annual quota for the communities that are set up.</seg>
<seg id="19">"although this new plan will not increase the total allowable harvest at this time, a new total allowable harvest may be considered when new data is collected."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the original plan, Nunavut communities were allowed to harvest one female or two male polar bears through an annual polar bear tagging program."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this was done only in the Baffin Bay polar bear population, where there is a balance between females and males, but under the new plan, it will not matter whether the polar bear population in Nunavut is male or female but it has to be balanced."</seg>
<seg id="22">At the end of the day, they would be provided with a poster.</seg>
<seg id="23">This new standardized male / female polar bear quota allows for community polar bear protection to be carried out as required.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the presence of polar bears in the communities has been a concern in Nunavut since the death of two polar bears in the Kivalliq last year - however, under the current management plan, the protection of the polar bear and if it is a female, then two tags will be used."</seg>
<seg id="25">As a result, some communities no longer have tags to protect the polar bear population.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this new plan allows communities to reduce the importation of polar bears, as Mr. Shewchuk pointed out in the Nunatsiaq News."</seg>
<seg id="27">"but he had previously stated that polar bears are a threat to Inuit culture and way of life, because they damage cabins, birds and seals."</seg>
<seg id="28">Those who attended the meeting in Cambridge Bay welcomed the changes to the polar bear management plan.</seg>
<seg id="29">Members were also pleased to note that Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit will have five more tags for grizzly bears.</seg>
<seg id="30">There was a large Akullaq that was seen and shot and this one is too close to a lot of houses here in Manitoba.</seg>
<seg id="31">"on the other hand, with this new polar bear management plan they may have a different idea."</seg>
<seg id="32">"polar bears" future is uncertain because of climate change, according to a 2018 study by the Standing Committee on the type of species that may be lost in Canada (COWE).</seg>
<seg id="33">It means that polar bears are at risk or at risk of being lost due to a combination of factors that affect their survival and specific threats.</seg>

<seg id="2">The contribution we make today to our children and future generations</seg>
<seg id="3">The Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit syllabics will be used in all Inuit languages across Canada.</seg>
<seg id="4">Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami has stated that it will not replace syllabics and Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit.</seg>
<seg id="5">Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami has also stated that Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit will not be required to change their traditional writing practices.</seg>
<seg id="6">I would like to thank the Clerk of the Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I was very proud to hear that the working group of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami unanimously approved the new Inuktitut writing system, naming the Inuktitut syllabics that were completed when the film came out."</seg>
<seg id="8">The Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami means "unity of the Canadian people" and there are few good examples of the power that our people have shared with each other for the survival of our people and our language.</seg>
<seg id="9">That's what it's like for me at this point in time.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in June of 2011 when I was the President of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, we made a commitment to modernize our education system."</seg>
<seg id="11">"we launched a national initiative on Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit and Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit in collaboration with our partners to provide our children with the skills they need to be educated, reliable in Inuktitut and Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit and language."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit Katimajiit included Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, and Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit.</seg>

<seg id="14">The Inuit Uqausinginnik Taiguusiliuqtiit in all the communities of Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit was incorporated into the Inuktitut syllabics.</seg>
<seg id="15">This means that we will have one writing system for all Inuit to use in their own language.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is a new system for the use of a cheque.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit is not going to replace Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit with Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit or Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, or Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit."</seg>
<seg id="18">Our contribution today is to our children and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="19">I can now imagine that the Inuit of Canada will be able to communicate better with each other and they will be able to communicate with each other and they will be able to teach a good curriculum when it becomes a concern and our children will be graduating from high school and they will be able to speak both languages.</seg>
<seg id="20">"we have an international role to play in the development of Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, Inuit culture, and language."</seg>
<seg id="21">But we are here today.</seg>
<seg id="22">Over the past few years we have had to look at our history to find out who we are today and how we are today.</seg>
<seg id="23">I believe that we are in a situation where we are going to have to look back and see where we can go in the future.</seg>
<seg id="24">The use of Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit in the Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit and the use of Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit and Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit means that we all want to move forward together as one.</seg>
<seg id="25">"after eight years of developing a national approach to Inuit education, we were able to deliver a language that is" Inuktitut "that will mean all people in each language, regardless of where they come from."</seg>
<seg id="26">To me that gives me an opportunity to see that as an Inuit unity, that we are able to overcome all of these issues without being honest about the barriers that we face.</seg>
<seg id="27">"our language and identity are refreshed, and our language is healthy."</seg>
<seg id="28">I am hopeful that we will be able to use Inuktitut in all dialects and dialects and in the future we will be able to continue the work that we do in partnership with the public.</seg>

<seg id="2">"this is a very ambitious project."</seg>
<seg id="3">Students are walking four miles from Iqaluit on September 27 as part of a global climate change protest.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three legal candidates for the federal government announced plans to end Nunavut's dependence on fossil fuels by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="5">(photographer Dustin Balmer)</seg>
<seg id="6">Besson Dustin Ptak</seg>
<seg id="7">"in this federal election, three legal firms announced that Nunavut's use of fossil fuels would be phased out by 2030."</seg>
<seg id="8">"right now all 25 communities in Nunavut have diesel generators operated by the Qulliq Energy Corporation, the only utility in Canada that does not have electricity in their communities."</seg>
<seg id="9">Changing this would be a huge and costly project.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this is a very ambitious project," says Martha Lennox, a northern renewable energy specialist for the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).</seg>
<seg id="11">"it is possible, with a little bit of skill."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Green Party's campaign promises to "implement a renewable energy system.</seg>
<seg id="13">"by 2030, all of the country's electricity will come from renewable sources."</seg>
<seg id="14">This includes outpost camps in northern communities such as Gjoa Haven where diesel power is "decommissioned."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the Liberal Party stated that they would" move forward financially to make sure that the Inuit communities in Nunavut get rid of fossil fuels but use electricity for clean, renewable energy - like hydro, wind and solar power - by 2030. "</seg>
<seg id="16">The Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated (NDP) stated that it would be a "goal for Canada to be able to generate electricity from non-renewable sources of energy by 2030... this is a carbon neutral energy system that respects the communities and creates jobs."</seg>
<seg id="17">"we would support efforts such as community-owned and operated clean energy projects to create jobs for residents and professionals, as well as working with aboriginal and northern communities to reduce the use of petroleum products."</seg>
<seg id="18">"according to the Department of Environment and Climate Change Canada report that was released earlier this year, greenhouse gas emissions in Nunavut are less than 1 percent of the impact of this."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2017, Nunavut produced approximately 0.6 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions, equivalent to 18,000 vehicles."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this year, Alberta, which is one of Canada's biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions, produced 84 million vehicles."</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, Nunavut has seen that greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles have increased by 30 percent since 2005, with the largest increase in Canada and Alberta almost doubling, which is the second largest increase in the same period."</seg>
<seg id="22">"even if there is an energy transition between the three jurisdictions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the impact on Canada's greenhouse gas emissions would still be very small."</seg>
<seg id="23">That's what the communities are going to get.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Nunavummiut pay the highest rate of electricity in any other jurisdiction in Canada, and funding from the Department of Energy would reduce this."</seg>
<seg id="25">"however, action on renewable energy projects such as this may lead to a discrepancy in the amount of money that is currently being spent on renewable energy."</seg>
<seg id="26">"last month, the World Wildlife Fund released a report that talked about how renewable energy could provide electricity to all 25 communities in Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="27">"it found that a reduction of 8% - mainly due to the risk of the project or other sources of revenue - in Baker Lake, Coral Harbour, Iqaluit and Rankin Inlet would result in savings of up to 20% in renewable energy, including direct payments over the next 15 years."</seg>
<seg id="28">The study also identified 16 other communities with a 4 percent subsidy - roughly what the Qulliq Energy Corporation would be able to borrow - and approximately $2 million in benefits and a 20 percent subsidy.</seg>
<seg id="29">"but the report only talks about the feasibility of these projects, with a view to moving to a renewable energy system that would be cheaper than the current power rates."</seg>
<seg id="30">However, moving the community to a sustainable source of renewable energy would be a significant step in the right direction.</seg>
<seg id="31">"it would take a lot of consultation, and they would have to start next year in order to meet the energy needs of all the communities," he says.</seg>
<seg id="32">"they would have to go to the communities, work with them on what they want to do, and what the communities are looking at in the energy sector, to see what their priorities are and where the communities are most important for travel and wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="33">"this does not include the development of integrated solar power or wind, which will take place over the next two years to fully integrate, or the mandate of the Qulliq Energy Corporation to ensure that renewable energy is a reliable source of energy."</seg>
<seg id="34">"moving all communities to 100 percent renewable energy, the three Solicitor General's recommendations, would not only be a long process but would also be a significant investment."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the New Progressive Party (NDP) and the Liberal Party have not announced how much they would contribute to the relocation, but the Green Party said that last week."</seg>
<seg id="36">"as part of the campaign's spending report, the Green Party said it would provide $150 million over the next five years for decentralization to all rural and northern communities - not just in Nunavut - to get rid of fossil fuels."</seg>
<seg id="37">It's not enough but it's not enough.</seg>
<seg id="38">"the minister made it clear that if a community like Arctic Bay were to move 60 percent of its energy system, they would have to spend about $27.8 million."</seg>
<seg id="39">"under the same report, for other communities to use this 60 percent renewable energy, they would have to use it at a higher level."</seg>
<seg id="40">"in Iqaluit, the idea is that it would cost about $148 million."</seg>
<seg id="41">"even though it is obvious that it is smaller than the $250 million to $500 million that was originally proposed in the City, this would be used for one community that the Green Party wants to help."</seg>
<seg id="42">"I don't expect the federal government to pay for all of these projects, but they also said that it would be a project and how it would be done and it would be a challenge."</seg>
<seg id="43">"looking at this 2030 deadline, it's not going to take much time."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in terms of solar power, I wonder if it could be done in the next two to five years."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in terms of wind power, I think it would take five to seven years for it to be done," he says when asked about the amount of energy that would be involved. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"when you look at these deadlines and divide them into 25 communities and if they're going to be done at the same time in a very remote community and the land is not always available, then they're thinking about how to complete it.</seg>
<seg id="47">"I think that for those who want to achieve something, this is going to be a big change."</seg>
<seg id="48">"even if we don't reach 100%, then there is a lot of interest."</seg>
<seg id="49">"please note: this article refers to the federal election campaign of the Green Party, the Liberal Party and the New Progressive Party (NDP)."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in the design of this book, the Conservative Party has not yet announced what they are campaigning for, so they are not included in this report."</seg>

<seg id="8">"the Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit Centre was closed on August 21 to September 12, 2019 due to a lack of staff and in addition, they have been operating without staff for almost a year."</seg>
<seg id="9">"very few people apply for jobs at the Sanikiluaq daycare because they are underpaid (Iqaluit has the highest daycare costs), employees who don't have income support, they don't have housing because they are seen as inferior to the women working at the daycare."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the daycare is now open again, but the emergency operation has become a challenge: we lost a very good employee who was tired and resigned."</seg>
<seg id="11">"we now have a part-time office worker, a full-time daycare manager, two daycare workers and each child who works on a case-by-case basis (all of whom have criminal records and safety checks), who are working all day, while we are looking for a full-time worker, who is qualified to be certified."</seg>
<seg id="12">"this process is not uncommon, but for those of us who have children, we believe that our children should be safe and speak Inuktitut to keep the question open."</seg>
<seg id="13">There is still a danger that it could be closed permanently.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Nunavut's daycare system is currently unprofitable. daycare staff are expected to provide one of the most important child related services in order to provide quality early childhood education, which is based on Inuit culture and language, despite the low cost and lack of support."</seg>
<seg id="15">The non-profit organization relies on a wide range of resources to address the shortfall in annual funding and the number of children who volunteer to run and manage the early childhood education centre.</seg>
<seg id="16">"daycare workers suffer from low pay and lack of benefits, lack of training for their jobs and lack of housing for staff."</seg>
<seg id="17">Daycare staff have now been asked to work within the scope of their needs to sustain themselves or their families.</seg>
<seg id="18">We are going through a very difficult time with our daycares because of the need for specialized staff with the necessary skills to promote and preserve the Inuit language and culture of our young children; we only hire people who are fluent in Inuktitut.</seg>
<seg id="19">We are 100 percent Inuit employees.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, as a result of the high turnover of our employees, we continue to be understaffed due to the lack of competitive pay and benefits for our employees.</seg>
<seg id="21">"as a result, it has an impact on early childhood education and early childhood education."</seg>
<seg id="22">Inuit should be given the support they need to ensure that our language and culture is taught to our children.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Government of Nunavut should consider how they can provide more support to ensure that the quality of early childhood education and daycare is based on the Inuit language and culture.</seg>
<seg id="24">"effective early childhood education and child care workers should be paid competitive wages and benefits, which include housing on the job, vacation, training in the workplace and school."</seg>
<seg id="25">Mr. Iqaqrialu's vision is to increase the number of daycare spaces available to the public and increase the number of programs to accommodate more Inuit children.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we have now been looking for a larger, daycare facility to make this vision a success, so we have raised close to $80,000 for the new location."</seg>
<seg id="27">They are proposing the following solutions for the Government of Nunavut:</seg>
<seg id="28">"amalgamation of early childhood and early childhood education staff as part of the Government of Nunavut's collective bargaining process to ensure that they receive the same salary as the Government of Nunavut, consistent with the Government of Nunavut's pay structure in the eight categories, which are used by employees of the Nunavut school system;"</seg>
<seg id="29">â¢ Including the operations and maintenance of daycare facilities in Nunavut that are operating within the education system;</seg>
<seg id="30">"provide resources for early childhood education and daycare staff but not specifically for short-term purposes including long-term medical leave, vacation, bilingual bonus, maternity leave and housing."</seg>
<seg id="31">â¢ establish a body to support all daycares in Nunavut;</seg>
<seg id="32">â¢ Work with the daycares immediately to address urgent challenges. together, we will work together to develop a long-term plan to change the operations of the daycare.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is important to recognize the valuable role that early childhood education and daycare workers play in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="34">Our daycares will be fully staffed with fully staffed positions and all employees will receive benefits.</seg>
<seg id="35">We have to keep our daycare open all the time.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the system of early childhood education needs to change. Nunavut's early childhood education and daycare workers want to change their profession so that they can take a significant step forward in ensuring that early childhood education and daycare operations change in the best way possible so that children can start their lives, including learning the Inuktitut language, grow up with a solid foundation of Inuit culture, and be able to participate in the rest of Canada."</seg>

<seg id="9">"Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated President Aluki Kuksuk and Louis Tapardjuk, former Government of Nunavut Minister and Member of the Inuit Uqausinginnik Taiguusiliuqtiit, the Nunavut Language Authority, came in on time and sat in the chair in front of the people."</seg>

<seg id="17">"it's called the Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit workshop so it was like, especially when we were talking about the Inuit language, we wanted to use the Inuit language," Mr. Kuksuk said at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Louie and I talked about this and we knew that there would be no interpreters but we decided that it was very important that we use our language when we talk about the need to support and promote our language development."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the International Symposium, which brings together northern experts from the north and the south, has, in recent years, started to involve more Inuktitut speakers and facilitators, making the conference more responsive to Inuit needs and working together with Inuit and non-Inuit academics."</seg>

<seg id="21">Mr. Curley's speech outlined a number of pieces of legislation that are needed to promote and protect the Inuktitut language in Nunavut and there are more Inuit and more Inuit speaking in Inuktitut.</seg>

<seg id="1">Qikiqtani Inuit Association announces compensation for tourism operators in Inuit communities</seg>
<seg id="2">Fees to be applied as soon as possible</seg>
<seg id="3">"tourism operators who visit Qikiqtani residents of Nunavut will now be required to pay tourism fees if they wish to access Inuit land, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association announced at its annual general meeting in Iqaluit from October 8 to 10."</seg>
<seg id="4">"commercial tourism operators now have to pay for people to go to their own communities in the Qikiqtani region, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association announced at its annual general meeting in Iqaluit on Wednesday, October 9."</seg>
<seg id="5">The Qikiqtani region is home to the largest number of cruise ships in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Pond Inlet received 17 cruise ships this summer, while Iqaluit was visited by four."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the people in the Qikiqtani communities have been concerned about this because of the increase in tourism activities in this region, especially the people who go on cruise ships."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the Qikiqtani Inuit Association decided to set up a tourism management fee to help people in the communities affected by cruise ships," P. J. Akeeagok, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association president, said in a news release.</seg>
<seg id="9">Following a press release from the Qikiqtani Inuit Association on land and recycling, the Department of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth announced new expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="10">The new payments are for:</seg>
<seg id="11">â¢ Airplane landing on Inuit land: $150 at the airport</seg>
<seg id="12">â¢ helicopter landing on Inuit land: $100 at the airport</seg>
<seg id="13">â¢ Commercial Boarding Homes in Inuit communities: $50 per day</seg>
<seg id="14">â¢ Commercial Visitors with access to less than six hours of public land: $25.00 per day</seg>
<seg id="15">"half of the total fees would go to the Hunters and Trappers Organizations that are closest to the tourism industry that is available," the report said.</seg>
<seg id="16">The other half would go to the Qikiqtani Inuit Association.</seg>
<seg id="17">"the ships that bring people to Nunavut have a population of anywhere from 150 to 400 people," Rosemary Reed, Qikiqtani Inuit Association Director of Land Use and Recycling, said at the Qikiqtani Inuit Association board meeting.</seg>
<seg id="18">This $25 per day fee would apply to all passengers who fly on Inuit owned land - or IHL (Inuit owned land).</seg>
<seg id="19">"no matter how many people are on the ship if they are going to be in their own communities, they would be charged based on the number of people on the ship," Mr. O'Brien said to the board.</seg>
<seg id="20">Mr. O'Brien stated that the ships that bring Inuit to the Qikiqtani region will have to submit to the Qikiqtani Inuit Association the number of Inuit passengers each month or before they go boating.</seg>
<seg id="21">"so if the ship was carrying 350 people, we would charge $25 a day per person."</seg>
<seg id="22">"so the larger Inuit ships would have to pay anywhere from $10,000 to $20,000 to go to the land on their own," Mr. O'Brien says.</seg>
<seg id="23">"in the communities where there are a lot of cruise ships that come in during the summer, like in Pond Inlet, the Hunters and Trappers Organization would receive about $50,000 to $70,000 in compensation," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">The new fees will also benefit the Qikiqtani Inuit Association's Land Use Registry.</seg>
<seg id="25">"as such, tourism operators would be made aware of the new fees when applying for access to Inuit in their own communities."</seg>
<seg id="26">C'Uqaqti noted that the Qikiqtani Inuit Association established a fee based on what other organizations pay for tourism.</seg>
<seg id="27">"for example, Parks Canada pays $25 per person to go to the National Parks."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the hamlets also charge the people who bring the ships and the tourism operators to their communities," Mr. O'Brien said.</seg>
<seg id="29">"ships that allow Inuit to go on their own land are liable for this unless the Inuit actually go to their own land," he says.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Joe Ataguttaaluk, Qikiqtani Inuit Association Secretary / Chief Financial Officer, asked whether it would be possible to increase these costs in the future."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Utility Rate Review Council indicated that it would be possible to make changes, but it would have to be discussed and resolved by the Qikiqtani Inuit Association."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this is a very exciting event.</seg>
<seg id="33">"we are once again leading the way in providing Inuit benefits to their communities," Mr. Akeeagok said to the board.</seg>
<seg id="34">"compensation will come into effect immediately, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association said."</seg>

<seg id="8">Community leaders in Pond Inlet have expressed their displeasure with a large ship carrying heavy equipment to the Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation's Mary River iron ore mine this summer.</seg>
<seg id="9">"they are concerned that Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated's proposed expansion of the Pangnirtung Airport in Pangnirtung has not yet been approved by the Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated.</seg>
<seg id="10">"they also brought in a couple of small units that could be built and large parts of the rail that would be used in the construction, such as access roads and landfills."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Baffinland, in November 2018 had indicated to the authority and its partners here in the Qikiqtani Inuit Association that they would be bringing in, through the public registries for the Nunavut Impact Review Board and the Nunavut Water Board."</seg>
<seg id="12">But the people of Pond Inlet are finally finding out about this.</seg>
<seg id="13">This ship arrived at the Baffinland port at Mary River in Qikiqtarjuaq last August to deliver modular housing that will be used for the rail expansion.</seg>
<seg id="14">When the people of Pond Inlet saw the ship near their community, it was the first time they had heard that it was going to be delivered.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we only found out about three or four weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="16">"we see a lot of goods going through the Pond Inlet area," Joshua Arreak, the director of the Pond Inlet Hunters and Trappers Association said of the Northwest Territories "development.</seg>
<seg id="17">"we were wondering why and who they were and how they were doing that.</seg>
<seg id="18">"we did not receive any information from the Nunavut Impact Review Board, Qikiqtani Inuit Association or anyone else."</seg>
<seg id="19">"it was something that we didn't expect," Mr. Arreak says.</seg>
<seg id="20">"we have not heard from the Qikiqtani Inuit Association or the Nunavut Impact Review Board.</seg>
<seg id="21">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have a problem with the Inuit organizations.</seg>
<seg id="23">"they don't keep us informed," Okalik said.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Nunavut Impact Review Board knew about the sealift this winter.</seg>
<seg id="25">"if any Nunavut authority and any federal minister did not approve the Baffinland expansion plan, it would result in a 110 kilometre long rail road from Mary River to Baffinland, producing an additional 12 million tonnes of iron ore a year, and transporting up to 200 tonnes of iron ore a year."</seg>
<seg id="26">This project cannot be fully approved by the federal government until the final public hearings of the Nunavut Impact Review Board are scheduled for November 2 in Iqaluit and conclude on November 8 and 9 in Pond Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="27">"the Nunavut Impact Review Board, which did not seek comment on this matter from the stakeholders, indicated that they would be bringing in a sealift truck to be used in a letter that was sent to Baffinland on July 25."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the Nunavut Impact Review Board advised the companies that if Project 2 is not approved, Baffinland would be responsible for the disposal of the equipment, which is likely to cost several million dollars, from the mine."</seg>
<seg id="29">It also indicated that the sealift will not have an impact on the Nunavut Impact Review Board's decision on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="30">"in an email dated October 17, the Nunavut Impact Review Board Executive Director, Ryan Perry, indicated that it is legal for the Nunavut Impact Review Board to approve or deny cruise ship activities."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Nunavut Impact Review Board was only able to say that these actions would be included in the evaluation process and that all materials for construction would have to be moved if the proposal was not approved after the Board's review," Barry wrote.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is a plane photo taken in Pond Inlet. just this past summer, the ship was carrying some of the materials for the Mary River Qaujimajatuqangit project that will be used for the Baffinland rail expansion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"one of the units, referred to as" Damage Building, "is 33 metres high, 23.5 metres in length and weighs 1,470 tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="34">"on the other hand, it is referred to as a" containment building, "which is 34 metres high."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so each unit, which is part of the existing breakwater and containment facility, is roughly equivalent to a 10-storey building - or perhaps higher than the units in the North East."</seg>
<seg id="36">However, Baffinland has not yet approved the use of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Baffinland will identify these assets as" Project 2 "but not" Project 2 "when the proposal is considered to be complete," the company wrote in its July 19 report to the Nunavut Impact Review Board. "</seg>
<seg id="38">Materials provided by Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit</seg>
<seg id="39">"in their joint submission to the authority, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association and Baffinland wrote that the property would be located on Inuit owned land, in accordance with the Qikiqtani Inuit Association's commercial lease agreement with the company."</seg>
<seg id="40">"for Mr. Arreak and others, the action appears to be that Baffinland has already approved the project."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the people of Pond Inlet are not happy.</seg>
<seg id="42">Is Baffinland thinking that we don't know if the Nunavut Impact Review Board or the government is going to approve the project ahead of time?</seg>
<seg id="43">"I don't know," he says.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Rob Dexter, a project consultant from Pond Inlet with the Hamlet Council, was approved by the Mayor of Pond Inlet, Joshua Savikataaq, to speak on behalf of the Northwest Territories Development Corporation."</seg>
<seg id="45">"Baffinland has been working on the idea of getting approval for phase 2," Dexter said in an e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="46">"if the Nunavut Impact Review Board had the authority to do so, the final effect would be to put more pressure on the Nunavut Impact Review Board to be responsible and to approve the proposal."</seg>
<seg id="47">"this is worrisome," Dexter said on behalf of the Hamlet.</seg>
<seg id="48">"on the other hand, the Hamlet is thinking before they have to do this."</seg>
<seg id="49">"this is what has been done in the budget and in the minds of the Baffinland people to get approval for Project 2," he also wrote.</seg>
<seg id="50">"our main concern is the animals, the marine animals and their presence."</seg>
<seg id="51">We would be the most affected in our community.</seg>
<seg id="52">That is our concern.</seg>
<seg id="53">"the money is not going to bring back the wildlife," Joshua Arreak said on behalf of the Hunters and Trappers Organization. he said that there has been an ongoing discussion in Pond Inlet for a number of years in regards to marine transportation for the Baffinland plan. "</seg>
<seg id="54">"in regards to non-governmental organizations such as Orangutan Marine North (Orangutan North), who have requested the opportunity to hold a public meeting on the Baffinland expansion plans, they stated that they support the" responsible development "of the Baffinland mine."</seg>
<seg id="55">"however, it was also noted that Baffinland did not take into account the potential environmental impacts, and was not satisfied with Baffinland's decision to send large amounts of iron ore to Baffinland instead of from Arctic Bay, which was made possible in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="56">"it is not surprising that residents are not satisfied with the large shipments of rail parts to Baffinland prior to the legislative approval of this expansion," says Chris Tiki, vice president of policy and legal affairs for the Northwest Territories.</seg>
<seg id="57">Existing resources received from the Department of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth</seg>
<seg id="58">The equipment that is being shipped from Baffinland to Qikiqtarjuaq is part of the existing rail system.</seg>
<seg id="59">"the two large buildings, the first of which was a rival, were designed by Brigadier Abraham, which is the third building, which will be a rail station, designed by Stefano," Bowers said in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="60">"Baffinland also brought in a sealift, a sealift system and a number of other equipment that will be used for rail transportation."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the assets identified in the Baffinland submission to the Nunavut Impact Review Board and the Nunavut Water Board included rail and road infrastructure, as well as heavy metals and solid waste."</seg>
<seg id="62">"the Titanic's first shipment to Baffinland, a ship called the Baffin Bar, weighs 5,500 tonnes of cargo, and departed from Brixton in early August."</seg>
<seg id="63">"two other cargo ships also delivered additional supplies this summer, and many more are expected to arrive in the summer of 2020," Microsoft said.</seg>
<seg id="64">"through a joint agreement with the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, Baffinland agreed to invest an additional $18 million in a recovery fund that would be used to clean up the Mary River mine if the project failed," the water board's letter said.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Montreal Women's Centre announces plans for an emergency night centre</seg>
<seg id="2">Inuit women make up 15% of the attendance at the Women's Centre</seg>
<seg id="3">"Maria Pollin-Winton, Director of the Women's Centre (Chesterfield Inlet), the Women's Centre, and Kathy Wong, the City Councillor representing the Peterborough area and a spokesperson for the Montreal City Council, discussed the plans for a 22-bed shelter for women in Montreal's Town Hall on October 16 during a press conference at the Women's Centre."</seg>
<seg id="4">(photo from the City of Montreal)</seg>
<seg id="5">"the Montreal Town of Wilson-Murray is ready to begin the expansion of a program that was started at the women's centre, a day shelter for women who are homeless, as a result of the land that was converted into a facility that was acquired last year."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the residents" decision, announced on Wednesday, October 16, will give us the opportunity to design a new building for this centre not too far away, which will then become an emergency women's night centre. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"the women's centre, the women's day centre here at 1430 Sami Road in Montreal, is open every day of the week for women who need help."</seg>
<seg id="8">A lot of them are Inuit.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the women's centre that is here right now is Sanikiluaq Road, not too far from the Ashford Road and Koper Scores, a gathering place for the people of Cape Town."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the women's centre is well known to many Inuit women, which accounts for 15% of all visits to the centre."</seg>
<seg id="11">"set to open in the winter of 2021, this building is an emergency night centre that was purchased for a subsidy of $1 million by the Montreal businessman Andrew Harper through the Joyce Community Foundation in Montreal."</seg>
<seg id="12">"thanks to our new facility, we will be able to accommodate 22 beds for women who are homeless," said Maria Polla-Winton, the executive director of the Shelter in Paris, said in a press release after the event at the women's centre.</seg>
<seg id="13">"right now, women are 25% of the homeless in Montreal, but the benefits to women are not enough."</seg>
<seg id="14">This is a project that is the appropriate starting point. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"the good news is that the expansion of the centre was announced less than a week after this individual who lived in the centre, Clara Cloak, who was originally from the Northwest Territories, passed away on October 11 at the hospital."</seg>
<seg id="16">Bowler-Winton told the Nunatsiaq News that she was very close with her daughter after she was in jail because she was in a lot of pain.</seg>
<seg id="17">"most of the people who come to the centre come to the city because of housing and legal problems," Bowden says.</seg>
<seg id="18">"a lot of people go to the women's centre during the day because there are six beds here, they sleep for a few hours and then they go outside at night."</seg>
<seg id="19">What has changed is that there is going to be a new place to sleep at night.</seg>
<seg id="20">"now, the Women's Centre, which is around 100 women a day, provides services and activities for women in need of homelessness, food insecurity, mental health and substance abuse."</seg>
<seg id="21">Bowden said the number of Inuit women who come here has not changed much since 2018.</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, we have been inundated with women who need more help with basic necessities such as clothing and showers," she says.</seg>
<seg id="23">"this is the only women's day centre in Montreal, the Sharon Dorris Women's Centre is now open seven days a week from 8: 30 in the morning to 3: 00 in the afternoon."</seg>
<seg id="24">"because of their ability to run their programs, the women's centre was left without a weekend service for six months in 2014 due to a lack of funding."</seg>
<seg id="25">"we're hoping to get some financial assistance from Makivik, but we don't know if we're going to get it this time," says Bowden.</seg>
<seg id="26">"the women's centre also administers the Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit program - but the women's centre invests in this program, which accounts for about 70% of its operating budget of $1.7 million a year."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Cathy Wong, the City Councillor on behalf of the Pet-McGill community and spokesperson for the Montreal City Council, said during the announcement of the new night centre that it would provide more women with" the services that are available to the people who want them to feel safe and secure.

<seg id="1">Nunavut does not have a Liberal Party</seg>
<seg id="2">"on very important questions, the Liberals had very little to offer."</seg>
<seg id="3">Mr. Iqaqrialu's victory on October 21 is a testament to his unwillingness to accept the Liberal Party's policy for Nunavut and the north.</seg>
<seg id="4">Do you remember the Liberal press release?</seg>
<seg id="5">They make a lot of news about the latter.</seg>
<seg id="6">More than we can remember.</seg>
<seg id="7">"that doesn't matter, because the majority of Nunavut voters showed up on October 21st, nothing."</seg>
<seg id="8">"starting in 2015, Justin Trudeau and the other Liberal governments in Nunavut have made a lot of news."</seg>
<seg id="9">Some of the information that was provided was new information.</seg>
<seg id="10">"but in the end, the people of Nunavut just said," Okay. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"but in the end, they were more accountable to the Government of Nunavut, since 1961, Canada has been more receptive to these changes: the New Bombers."</seg>
<seg id="12">"this is not too old to say that the Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit victory is a testament to the rejection of Trudeau's actions in the north and north of Canada, which includes a lack of commitment to the previously stated Inuit / federal partnership."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since 2015, Trudeau has worked with leading organizations such as Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, Qikiqtani Inuit Association and others."</seg>
<seg id="14">However, this past week's election demonstrates to Nunavummiut that the Inuit-federal relationship is not as effective as it should be.</seg>
<seg id="15">"and that is not unusual, because at the end of the day Nunavummiut were not able to answer the main questions of the Liberal Party."</seg>
<seg id="16">"it is well known to the majority of the people of Nunavut that the biggest concerns are economic and social issues: the lack of housing, the lack of food, the high cost of food, the high cost of food and transportation, and the chronic tuberculosis and suicide that we face on a daily basis."</seg>
<seg id="17">"but during his final visit to Nunavut on October 8, Trudeau did not have much good news on these issues."</seg>
<seg id="18">He was talking about South Baffin when he was talking about climate change and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="19">"these are issues for all Canadians, but in this election, Nunavummiut want to hear their concerns about housing and the high cost of living."</seg>
<seg id="20">"what happened instead is that the Sylvia Grinnell River is the location for the film, not for Nunavut voters, but for southern Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in doing so, he did not respond to the hard work of Nunavummiut and the Nunavut Liberal candidate Megan Perel-Lyall, who did not even have the support of the President of the Liberal Party."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in terms of costs and food insecurity, the Liberals took action, setting up a higher subsidy program for the Nutrition North Canada Program, as well as providing additional funding, $12.5 million a year for aboriginal hunters in Nunavut and other parts of the North."</seg>
<seg id="23">However, they have to come up with a hunting assistance program and no one can say why that is the case.</seg>
<seg id="24">"on August 1 of this year, Toro played a major role in Iqaluit and Arctic Bay, signing an agreement to launch the Lancaster Sound Marine Conservation Area and making a major commitment to start a new protected area called Duittuq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"he is doing this by giving a lot of money to the communities in North Baffin, for small craft harbours and for the protection of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="26">He also talked a lot about security issues, such as trying to meet with aboriginal people.</seg>
<seg id="27">"the inadequacy of dealing with this type of issue is that, having been repeatedly diagnosed with tuberculosis in an overcrowded house, this" meeting "does not make sense."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with that in mind again, do you remember the Liberal government's big announcement on tuberculosis?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"they did this in early 2018, this is Jane Ferry, who was the Health Minister at the time, when she said that tuberculosis was going to be eliminated in the country before 2030."</seg>
<seg id="30">But Mr. Ferris, the Federal Minister committed to dealing with this issue because there are no more.</seg>
<seg id="31">"with respect to Mr. Trudeau's actions on behalf of Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated and the dispute over his handling of this matter with SNC-Lavalin, Mr. Wilcox resigned from the board of directors."</seg>
<seg id="32">"since then, the Liberals have not heard anything about the eradication of tuberculosis."</seg>
<seg id="33">"like the Hunters and Trappers Assistance Program, I think it's just stuck with the Inuit and the Federal Government working together, so it seems to me that there was a lot of talk about tuberculosis being eradicated in the community."</seg>
<seg id="34">"and everyone knows that tuberculosis is caused by poverty, poor nutrition and inadequate housing."</seg>
<seg id="35">"but on the housing issue, Mr. Trudeau came up with something that has already been heated up and talked about again this past summer."</seg>
<seg id="36">"and the Government of Canada's Inuit Housing Program, a" strategic partnership "with Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, has not yielded any results."</seg>
<seg id="37">We would also like to congratulate Mamiaq Qaqqaq for winning the award.</seg>
<seg id="38">"as a member of the 4th Division of the Law Clerk of the Legislative Assembly, she will have to be assisted in order to be heard."</seg>
<seg id="39">Let's just give Nunavummiut a chance and be supported.</seg>
<seg id="40">"Qaqqqaq won two prestigious awards, Leona Aglukkaq and Megan Pizzo-Lyall."</seg>
<seg id="41">I hope that they do not lose sight of the fact that they continue to serve Nunavummiut and the north.</seg>

<seg id="1">The member asked the ministers about the $80 million expansion of the Weber Road Project.</seg>
<seg id="2">"looking at my colleagues, we are in a good position to make a decision on the $80 million option."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Joelie Quirke, Member for Amittuq, was one of the members of the Nunavut Legislative Assembly who questioned the government on the $80 million expansion of the Iqaluit-Niaqunnguu Crossing Project."</seg>
<seg id="4">Some Nunavut lawyers are now asking for an undefined contribution for the expansion of the Nu-Iqaluit Fabric Ark Project.</seg>
<seg id="5">"last August, the federal government committed $151 million to the project, which is aimed at a 1,700-kilometre stretch of the Weber Apartments in Nuuk, Greenland, through the Qikiqtaaluk Fire in Iqaluit."</seg>
<seg id="6">From there, it will be shipped to Kimmirut.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Government of Nunavut will develop the design and start of the project, which is expected to be completed in 2023."</seg>
<seg id="8">"last year, the Legislative Assembly approved this project, which was supposed to cost $126 million."</seg>
<seg id="9">"at the end of this year, we were informed that the project cost was going up in line with the cost increase and it is now thought to be around $209 million," John Mayne, Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, said in his Member's Statement on Wednesday, October 23.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this is a $80 million difference," Mayne says.</seg>
<seg id="11">"when I look at my colleagues we are able to make decisions that could be worth $80 million," Mayne says.</seg>
<seg id="12">The federal subsidy comes from the Small Communities and Northern Communities Program under the Investment Canada Plan (Canada).</seg>
<seg id="13">The project is now in the Legal Services Board's review of expenditures for 2020 / 21.</seg>
<seg id="14">"on the second day of Question Period, Joelie Kilabuk, the Member for Amittuq asked Mr. Quassa Kusugak, the Minister of Community and Government Services, about the $80 million increase that the government is planning to do."</seg>
<seg id="15">"this process, as defined in the Government of Nunavut's Financial Planning Assistance," is intended to ensure that the project has a clear definition, and that interested parties have access to information on the development, the appropriate cost details and the timing of the project, prior to the start of the fiscal planning process. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"was it a pre-planned project, Iqaluit or Akavut?"</seg>
<seg id="17">The question is directed to Ms. Kusugak.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the planning has been completed and the cost is still being determined.</seg>
<seg id="19">"when we were informed, we found out that it was going to be much more expensive," Kusugak says.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Mr. Mayne, sitting next to the Chairperson of the Legislative Assembly, is standing to ask another question to Ms. Kusugak."</seg>
<seg id="21">"can the minister tell us how this huge project has gone up in price over the course of the year?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"Ms. Kusugak reiterates that after the funding request was approved last year, the department reviewed the project and increased the cost of the review."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Ms. Kusugak reiterated that, in May of 2019, her department considered a supplementary appropriation request that would require an increase of up to $9.6 million in" maximum federal assistance available to the program if necessary. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"the following day, on October 24, Mayne rose again during Question Period to consult with the Finance Minister George Hickes on the same issue."</seg>
<seg id="25">"through the Financial Management Board, what steps were taken and what steps were taken to inform the department of the $80 million increase in the cost of this project?"</seg>
<seg id="26">Mr. Mayne asked.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Mr. Hickes noted that the federal government did not increase its contribution to the project, and in addition to providing a positive contribution to the marine research project, the Government of Nunavut also increased its contribution."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the Department of Community and Government Services resubmitted it to the Financial Management Board for this reason when they found that the expenditure was not enough."</seg>
<seg id="29">"Mr. Hickes also stated that half of the Government of Nunavut (25 percent) benefits from the program, while the federal government contributes 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="30">"as the Government of Nunavut, we don't have to pay $80 million, and we would have to pay 25 percent of that."</seg>
<seg id="31">"we will be looking for... at some point in the next few years... to provide additional resources for the completion of this program," he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">Charlie Ward after the federal election talks about reforming the federal government.</seg>

<seg id="4">Bessie Elaine Anderson</seg>
<seg id="5">"Makivik President Charles Ward made the statement that there was no change in Nunavik's legal status when he made the announcement to the new Member of the Legislative Assembly, Sylvie Brewer."</seg>
<seg id="6">"we are going to be looking at the Electoral Boundaries Commission to make sure that it is understood, in fact, that Nunavik will have its own bureaucracy for our community, which is not what we want at this point in time in terms of the ability to apply for our own program," he says.</seg>
<seg id="7">"we have to do this at a provincial level."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Pangnirtung James Bay-Eavi-Eavik is one of the largest federal political projects in Quebec, from the south of Nunavik to the town of Pangnirtung to the southern town of Pangnirtung. here are four of the six 2019 federal candidates who live in the community, including Pangnirtung for the Black Bloc."</seg>
<seg id="9">Nunavik leaders have dedicated their own government to the community since 1972.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in 2002, the Nunavut Association of Municipalities, including Makivik, went to the Federal Electoral Boundaries Commission for this purpose and visited again in 2011."</seg>
<seg id="11">"since the division was expanded in 2013, it has expanded to include two more communities in the south."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the divisions were redrawn, through the Commission, in an effort to balance the population."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in Quebec, it is 100 thousand people by region, but in Pangnirtung it is less than 85 thousand people."</seg>
<seg id="14">"while Nunavik's population is around 13,000, Nunavik has been far below that, but its leaders have responded to this issue here in Nunavik as an independent society."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the smallest federal jurisdiction is Labrador, which has a population of 26,000, while Newfoundland has a population of about 80,000."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Ruby was the winner for Quebec North, with a vote of over 11,000, or 40 percent, followed by the Liberal and Conservative candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Ward expressed his congratulations to Green Party candidate Kiara Barnabas of Winnipeg, an Inuk from Churchill, who came in fifth place with more than 1,000 votes."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in his speech to Ford, he welcomed Brewer to Nunavik to visit him as soon as possible."</seg>
<seg id="19">"I look forward to meeting with him, and his support for self-interest in dealing with issues that I am very pleased with, as well as issues such as the implementation of the Judicature Act on the rights of aboriginal people," Ward says.</seg>
<seg id="20">"a big announcement was made by Black Bloc President FranÃ§ois Blanchet, after the regional wrestling team won 32 seats in Quebec."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it is our hope that we will support the development of our mandate in Nunavik - through legal and economic means - and that the legal system can establish a mutually beneficial relationship," says Ford.</seg>

<seg id="1">"further implementation of anti-cancer schemes in Nunavut, hundreds of thousands of states"</seg>
<seg id="2">"for individuals, you could save a lot of money by reducing the number of cases of lung cancer."</seg>
<seg id="3">This air ambulance service in Nunavut (Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated) is on hold at the Iqaluit International Airport for this summer's air show.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in some years, when children have lung cancer (RV), they have to be sent out of the hospital and they have to spend a lot of money in the hospital."</seg>
<seg id="5">"these are Dr. Anna Pangnirtung and her fellow teachers from Toronto's June School of Health Workshop in 1989 who first brought this issue to the attention of the RCMP at the end of September, and have over 1,000 signatures in favour of it."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but when this news was finally published, 23,322 names were put together - and now they want to reach 25,000 signatures."</seg>
<seg id="7">The notice states that the Government of Nunavut would reduce the number of deaths and hospitalizations of infants by implementing a cancer prevention program for all infants under the age of 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="8">"P2P is a preventative medicine, not a vaccine, and until it is on the market it is called Xanax."</seg>
<seg id="9">"it has been proven in infants that there is a higher risk of lung disease associated with the initiation of RSV, which is an acronym for" preeclampsia, "which is a type of secondary lung disease, and is associated with chronic pulmonary disease called bronchitis."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, Dr. Michael Patterson, the Minister of Health and Social Services for Nunavut, stated in the NWT News interview that the Government of Nunavut contributes 11% to 12% of children under the age of 2."</seg>
<seg id="11">"we use it more for babies who are at higher risk of cancer due to RSV, as well as for those who contribute to the global distribution of RSV," she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">"these include babies born at birth, under 35 weeks of pregnancy, or babies with chronic lung disease or heart disease."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Mr. Pangnirtung, who is also a professor in the Department of Child Health at the University of Toronto's School of Pharmacy, has been writing a curriculum for the past 15 years on topics such as the persistence and cost of the RV in the north."</seg>
<seg id="14">"as far as testing is concerned, this individual has not been satisfied with the current Nunavut policy and he stated that all Nunavut infants need this vaccine."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Dr. Anna Pangnirtung, who is a professor in the Department of Child Health here in Toronto at the University of Toronto's Department of Pharmacy, said after a lot of research that if Inuit infants were immunized with a preventative vaccine called the Predator it would be very beneficial both socially and financially."</seg>
<seg id="16">The cost of living in Nunavut has a significant impact on the cost of living in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="17">He stated in his assessment that the RV system is sustainable and able to deliver a wide range of air and medical services to Nunavut's health care system.</seg>
<seg id="18">"cancer prevention is very expensive: about $5,600 per patient."</seg>
<seg id="19">"but despite this cost, Pangnirtung and many others believe that this is like a subsidy."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this is the case in Nunavut when it comes to cancer and ambulance services are the best way to deal with it."</seg>
<seg id="21">"we've done a lot of cost-benefit analysis that shows that if we give the north a larger share of the pie, it would save money," he said in an interview.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in a cost analysis, published in 2013, it was found that there was a high rate of lung cancer in the Kitikmeot infants: it was set at 389 out of 1,000."</seg>
<seg id="23">"during the study, which was conducted from January 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010, it was determined that the cost of medical travel for this illness came to $57,535."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in the Qikiqtani region, lung cancer in infants occurred in 2002 from 1,000 newborns and in the Kivalliq region, from 230 to 1,000 newborns."</seg>
<seg id="25">This means that the Government of Nunavut has spent $5.9 million for minor injuries in the Qikiqtani region and approximately $5.7 million in the Kivalliq for infant injuries as a result of this study.</seg>
<seg id="26">"however, the fact of the matter is that Kivalliq had the highest rate of lung cancer hospitalization: $63,686."</seg>
<seg id="27">"for Inuit, it's not a lot of money, because of the high incidence of lung cancer," he says.</seg>
<seg id="28">The President of the Ontario Nursing Association supports the registration process.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Inuit babies are ten times more likely to be treated at the hospital for lung disease than the" at-risk "infant and the disease is much more severe due to its sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="30">"even though this is a major problem, Inuit babies in Nunavut do not get cancer," Mr. Gardy wrote in his submission.</seg>
<seg id="31">"another area of expertise identified here is the Winnipeg School of Health, the Canadian Medical Association and the Canadian Medical Research Institute for Indigenous Peoples."</seg>
<seg id="32">However, healthy babies in Nunavut at the end of their lives do not receive this cancer treatment - even if they come from a high-risk community other than Iqaluit and have a higher risk of lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="33">Pangnirtung is saying that they are doing the wrong thing.</seg>
<seg id="34">"I have done a lot of hard work.</seg>
<seg id="35">I have shown them some of the details that I am putting out to the public.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Carolyn Barnabas, Jane Ferry, they've seen what I've written and they've said it's credible," she says.</seg>
<seg id="37">Nunavik immunizes all infants</seg>
<seg id="38">"it was a warning, not just in Nunavut, that health professionals in Nunavik have given birth to all infants over the past three years."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut on October 18, the Minister of Health George Hickes indicated in response to questions from the Member for Iqaluit-Niaqunnguu, Pat Angnakak, that the Government of Nunavut will undertake a comprehensive review of the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement."</seg>
<seg id="40">"we are keeping an eye on that program," says Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="41">Ms. Angnakak said this RV (lung disease) has had a devastating impact on the family.</seg>
<seg id="42">"not too long ago, I know that the baby had to be sent to the hospital by the RV and it has a huge impact on the family, especially when this is a very young child."</seg>
<seg id="43">But Mr. Hickes defended the Government of Nunavut's current program and said that the government is not trying to save money for Inuit only by providing this program.</seg>
<seg id="44">"this has not been a legal or policy decision on the cost.</seg>
<seg id="45">"it depends on the best health care system," Mr. Hickes says.</seg>
<seg id="46">Mr. Patterson reiterates that Nunavik has had success over the past three years with the program starting with children under six months old.</seg>
<seg id="47">"we are still waiting for that number, and once we know that there is a savings to be made in using the Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, then we will be able to implement that very quickly," Patterson says.</seg>
<seg id="48">"however, in his view, there is still a lack of accreditation in Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="49">"there are two things that I don't agree with in the registration process and the other one is that this is something that has already been done, or is there a scientific explanation for that."</seg>
<seg id="50">"there are a lot of people who still have questions," he says.</seg>
<seg id="51">The use of Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit in Nunavut has come a long way.</seg>
<seg id="52">"in 2008, the Government of Nunavut did not approve or participate in the Pangnirtung study of the RV, nor did the experts from Greenland, Nunavik and the Northwest Territories participate."</seg>

<seg id="6">"I wanted to show how good we were building for the Northerners," says Willie Godfrey, co-founder of Nunavik Construction, a home design and construction firm with offices in Churchill and Nieuville, Quebec. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"ten years before that, Godfrey, a Churchill plumber, woodworker and construction worker had a collision with a housing expert in Clacton."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we started talking about affordable housing in the north," Godfrey says.</seg>
<seg id="9">"housing in the north is too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="10">It started from there. "</seg>
<seg id="11">From there, arrangements have been made for the design of small units with a view to the northern climate.</seg>
<seg id="12">The houses have steel walls and they are surrounded by strong winds and they can be used for longer periods of time.</seg>
<seg id="13">"they are made with insulation on the walls, roofs and roofs and there are three layers of windows to keep the heat out of the air."</seg>
<seg id="14">"they have a floor heating system, not a wall that has to be attached to the furnace, to make sure the temperature is the same as the rest of the house."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I think that's the only way to do it in the north," Godfrey says.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there are a lot of problems with the furnaces and the heating goes into a small part of it.</seg>
<seg id="17">Inuit say their feet are starting to freeze.</seg>
<seg id="18">Their house has a lot of insulation but they are "whispers."</seg>
<seg id="19">The design of the Nunavik Buildings is a one-bedroom cabin.</seg>
<seg id="20">(photo by Nunavik Construction)</seg>
<seg id="21">"because he has built boilers and pipes all over Nunavik, Godfrey is responsible for making sure that the buildings are built in the way they are designed, that everything is well designed and maintained."</seg>
<seg id="22">"the Nunavik Housing Corporation has a variety of conditions for small apartments, four bedrooms, and a different location for them."</seg>
<seg id="23">"they can add an extra room and it can be expanded, for example, if they are larger children."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the building that is being advertised in Churchill has one bedroom, which is about 5 metres to the side and 10 metres to the side."</seg>
<seg id="25">There is an entrance at the end of the building to the kitchen and the living room.</seg>
<seg id="26">It's just over your house and over the washroom.</seg>
<seg id="27">The plant is located in another building that is just behind it.</seg>
<seg id="28">It took about two hours for the building to be completed and put into place and the electrical and plumbing systems were put in place.</seg>
<seg id="29">"this house can be purchased for $228,000, for the foundation and everything inside," says Godfrey.</seg>
<seg id="30">"in Nunavik the house costs between $500,000 and $600,000," he says.</seg>
<seg id="31">"we're trying to build houses that are in good condition and have problems with water access," says Godfrey.</seg>
<seg id="32">"when I was a plumber, I was a woodworker for a number of years and a lot of the things that were built were not fixed properly, the plumbing was not adequate, the boiler was not adequate."</seg>
<seg id="33">This is what I have been building for many years and now we have something that would be more suitable for the north. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"the houses that are built in Sanikiluaq, Quebec, and they are built within a month," Godfrey says, "and then they are shipped by truck."</seg>
<seg id="35">"once we have received the order and the booking is on time for the sealift, this building could be in place by next summer."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in the future, if this is successful, we are thinking about creating jobs in the north," he says.</seg>
<seg id="37">"but this requires a lot of money."</seg>
<seg id="38">He goes on to say that these units in the north would be suitable and they would be very happy to order from Nunavut or from Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="39">"we are open and we are just waiting for the payments that they want to know and they are prepared for the construction," says Godfrey.</seg>
<seg id="40">"we are prepared to help people in need."</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the Canadian Arctic, the sea ice is at its lowest level right now"</seg>

<seg id="3">"the freeze is very late this year," says Gjoa Haven resident Willie Aglukkaq, who took this picture on October 18. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"he is still a joker on the land, which doesn't happen in Gjoa Haven."</seg>
<seg id="5">I've never seen it on the ice like that in my entire life. "</seg>

<seg id="7">Buddy Dustin Ptak</seg>
<seg id="8">"last October, Joda Savikataaq from Igloolik had to go seal hunting by snowmobile."</seg>
<seg id="9">"that's what he was trying to do when he was a year old, he had to go out on a boat."</seg>
<seg id="10">"in Nunavut and other parts of the north, it's the same thing."</seg>
<seg id="11">"this is the first explosion I've seen in my entire life," says Willy Aglukkaq, a resident of Gjoa Haven for nearly 40 years. "</seg>
<seg id="12">That is correct.</seg>
<seg id="13">"on October 15 the sea ice thickness was approximately 5.118 million square kilometres, which is the lowest level since records began in 1968."</seg>
<seg id="14">"depending on where we are, we may be a month behind where we were last year," says Jez Largie, a geophysicist with Geophysical Services Canada. "</seg>
<seg id="15">But this is not the first year that the river has been low.</seg>
<seg id="16">April also had the lowest amount of ice in the records.</seg>
<seg id="17">After that, it was published in the July edition of the Nunavut Gazette.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in August, the erosion of the ice began to slow down."</seg>
<seg id="19">"we were on par with the lowest (ice) in 2007 and 2016, but it was higher in 2012," says Walter Mir, a senior researcher at the Canadian Energy and Natural Resources Institute.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but we are lower than the 2012 levels when that happened because of the rapid melting of the ice - 2012 was a quick return to the Arctic, but the winter has slowed down the ice."</seg>
<seg id="21">"as of October 15, the ice volume was much lower than it was in 2012, at that time it was the lowest."</seg>
<seg id="22">(certificate from NSCID)</seg>
<seg id="23">The potential for sea ice is dependent on the temperature.</seg>
<seg id="24">"if there is water that doesn't have ice and the heat is colder in the water, then even though the temperature is in the atmosphere it will get warmer and the water will get warmer or freeze sooner," says Larkin.</seg>
<seg id="25">"but the Arctic temperatures in October have been very cold, with a lot of heat in the last six months."</seg>
<seg id="26">"it was a very warm summer," says Maye.</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the start of April, each month was the third warmest - as far as the Arctic is concerned - on record, whereas May and August were at the highest levels."</seg>
<seg id="28">(photo from UNESCO)</seg>
<seg id="29">This year's event will result in a larger event.</seg>
<seg id="30">"in the context of global warming such as the Inuit use of vehicles, we have seen a decrease in the amount of ice that was in 1979," says Pascal Pangnirtung, director of the GRA in the UK, in a press release published in the Journal of the United Nations Environment Program (UNESCO).</seg>
<seg id="31">"in light of what is happening this year in the Arctic, the decrease in sea ice has been a result of Arctic warming over the past several decades."</seg>
<seg id="32">"according to this press release," The average global temperature has risen by about 0.5 Â° C in the 10 years between 1982 and 2017, mainly due to the effects of the collapse of the glaciers in 1979. "</seg>
<seg id="33">This is two times faster than the world average. "</seg>
<seg id="34">This summer has not been the same.</seg>
<seg id="35">"although the year-to-year trend continues, the ice is now back on track."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the ice is just starting to freeze," she says.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in the last 10 days, since October 20, the sea ice has increased by approximately 1.5 million square kilometres, including the waters near Gjoa Haven."</seg>

<seg id="1">Iqaluit welcomes new fire chief</seg>
<seg id="2">"to me this is a bit of a fun way of doing things"</seg>
<seg id="3">Lord Howard of Iqaluit became the Fire Marshal two weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">"since then he has been reading and doing a lot of research, but he says that his new job is something he can do again."</seg>
<seg id="5">(photographer Dustin Peda)</seg>
<seg id="6">"this is Gordon Howard at the City Council meeting that he attended on October 22 when he was the Chief Fire Officer, he did not expect to be asked questions."</seg>
<seg id="7">"do you support the Montreal Canadiens?"</seg>
<seg id="8">Asked by Member Joanasie Akumalik.</seg>
<seg id="9">"for a moment of silence, Howard answered," No. "</seg>
<seg id="10">They are here with a sore throat.</seg>
<seg id="11">"a week later, in an interview with the Nunatsiaq News, Mr. Howard said," That's why I decided that my contributions should not be heard. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mr. Havioyak, from Sanikiluaq in Hamilton, went to Iqaluit and went to Winnipeg, Ontario, where the community of Pangnirtung is located near Georgina Bay."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although he has been here for the first time, he has also been from the north."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in his ten years as an emergency medical technician for the Canadian Armed Forces, Arviat has been a tent city in the middle of winter."</seg>
<seg id="15">"so I understand the snow, I understand the cold, but there are also things that have to be done."</seg>
<seg id="16">It seems like we're in a different world and that's why I came here.</seg>
<seg id="17">"and the department is very creative," says Mr. Howard, referring to the Iqaluit Fire Department's collectives - some of them are very professional firefighters and some of them just go out and help. "</seg>
<seg id="18">That's the only thing that Howard didn't bring to Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition to the work that has been done on fire and emergency services - where we don't have a lot of other things - there was also an issue here in Iqaluit where there was a fire.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the actions of this department are appalling," says Howard.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it's a lot of work here, and when you look at the programs that are in place all the time."</seg>
<seg id="22">"the activities of the department are related to, and now Howard, a new one in this area, such as water problems and lack of support, to the fires and the fire hall is too small."</seg>
<seg id="23">"we can't make this change overnight and it seems like we don't want to make any changes overnight.</seg>
<seg id="24">"if we continue to move forward and not go backwards I would be happy," says Howard.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to me, it's a very exciting project."</seg>
<seg id="26">"it is a pleasure, what we are trying to do and what we know we can do better."</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the first question of the City of Iqaluit's appointment as the Director of Emergency Management," I'm a Toronto Assistant, "says Howard with a smile."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it's good to hear that some people are in support of the fire hall in Toronto.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I brought a flag with me, so we will be able to show them through our cars if they win the Stanley Cup in the next 20 to 30 years."</seg>

<seg id="1">Bedbugs have become a concern for Nunavik patients in Manitoba</seg>
<seg id="2">The hotel manager says that they do inspections but they haven't found anything.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is something you just want to eat in your room and you wouldn't want to see it: bedbugs.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but more recently, bedbugs have been seen at the Quarry Hotel where patients from Nunavik are staying when they come to the city."</seg>
<seg id="5">The presence of bedbugs in Nunavik boarding homes during medical travel to Montreal is of particular concern to patients and their families.</seg>
<seg id="6">This photo shows the bedside table of Cecilia Dukka that she saw last month in the basement of her mother's house in the Coral Harbour Boarding Home here in Kira De LeÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="7">(photo from Cecilia Duka)</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the middle of October, Cecilia Kuksuk was visiting her mother at the Coral Harbour Boarding Home here in Kira De Leon in Labrador and she was very scared: she saw the dog on the bottom of the bed, and she took this picture."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in Kugaaruk the member from Iqaluit mentioned the medical travel from Nunavik to the monitoring centre here at the Ukivik Boarding Home, in this case they have a number of rooms, 39 in total, on the first floor when it's full."</seg>
<seg id="10">Kuka called her mother and told her that she would never be there again.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the hotel's general manager, Sadie Appel, told Nunatsiaq News last week that she is dealing with the bedbug sightings."</seg>
<seg id="12">"this is what happened a few days ago, when the tests were done, and the worms had the report, they couldn't find it."</seg>
<seg id="13">"one bedroom study found that there were bedbugs in there, but they are not here anymore."</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr. Aupaluktuq's e-mail also showed a number of patients who had seen the bedbugs.</seg>
<seg id="15">"given the importance of the Ukivik Boarding Home operation, Mr. Rafter stated that all rooms were dealt with this year and that they are regularly inspected and dealt with if necessary."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Nunatsiaq News was not able to speak to all the Nunavik Community Health Boards or the Manitoba Tunngavik Incorporated who work with the Nunavik Health Centre in Montreal on issues such as bedbugs and what they are doing about it.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated has written a letter to the Minister of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth on behalf of Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it seems to me that the people who are staying in Iqaluit are seeing bedbugs and they don't want to stay in the hotel," writes George Delilah, the president of the Uqsuqtuq Centre on October 16. "</seg>
<seg id="19">"let me know what it is and when the problem is going to be resolved.</seg>
<seg id="20">We have to let the patients know that the bedbugs were taken care of. "</seg>
<seg id="21">Ukvik patients always take care of their clothes / bags before they enter the facility.</seg>
<seg id="22">There are bedbugs in Montreal; there were bedbugs in the government offices that had to be closed.</seg>
<seg id="23">"and if there were bedbugs in patients from the north, this would not be the first time, as they did in 2010 in Winnipeg."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the bedbugs are very bad to start with: they are very small, but they can get very itchy, scaly and irritate the skin after they have been bitten."</seg>
<seg id="25">The bedbugs have a tube in their lungs so that the blood doesn't get too thick and they don't feel like a mouse.</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the other side of the pipe, the patient's throat is pumping blood, sometimes for five minutes, and then they melt, they start to look red and they seem to be floating."</seg>
<seg id="27">"the bedbugs eat five to ten days a week and they can live for a year, they live on the bottom of the bed, on the bed and on the other side of the bed, in the dark and they come out when they want to eat."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the good news is that the bedbugs don't get cold, so they end up sleeping and they die."</seg>
<seg id="29">So you can pack your bags when you're outside for more than two days if you don't have any heat.</seg>
<seg id="30">"try not to get wet while you're out on the land, keep an eye on the head of the house, and look at the bottom and keep your bags in bed."</seg>
<seg id="31">"and when you go home, wash your clothes before they go to your room and make sure that you don't have bedbugs."</seg>
<seg id="32">"if you see a bedbug in a Montreal hotel, you can call 311 cities for a problem."</seg>

<seg id="3">"it affects all aspects of people's lives," says Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated President</seg>
<seg id="4">"representatives from Igloolik and Pond Inlet are listening to Aluki Kuksuk, the President of Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, in a motion to suspend the Nunavut Impact Review Board's final meeting on Baffinland's proposed expansion on Wednesday, November 6 in Iqaluit."</seg>
<seg id="5">(photographer Emma Daniels)</seg>
<seg id="6">By Besma Daniel and Elaine Yun</seg>
<seg id="7">"the meeting of the Nunavut Impact Review Board on Baffinland's proposed expansion of the Mary River mine came to an abrupt end, with two more days of meetings being held in Pond Inlet."</seg>
<seg id="8">"on Wednesday, November 6, Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated President Aluki Kuksuk made a motion to immediately cancel this last public meeting and to continue this session for eight months to a year."</seg>
<seg id="9">There was a lot of noise and there were a lot of people who wanted to speak to their colleagues and they were just crying, and the members were looking at the Baffinland to see what they were going to do with this situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the Baffinland officials had good faces, sometimes they put their hands up and they just sat on the table when Mr. Kuksuk made his motion."</seg>
<seg id="11">"we are concerned that this public meeting would be completed without any action being taken.</seg>
<seg id="12">People need to be consulted and have a proper dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="13">"anyone here would like to understand all the things that are happening and how it would affect Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated and the organizations," Mr. Kuksuk says when the House is full of people who want to talk about it and the people. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"it has an impact on all aspects of people's lives," he says.</seg>
<seg id="15">"the motion was tabled on the fifth day of public hearings in Iqaluit, at the end of the hour."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Nunavut Impact Review Board's first agenda was to proceed with a public meeting for the community of Pond Inlet on November 8 and 9.</seg>
<seg id="17">"the Nunavut Impact Review Board was in favour of the Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated motion, this meeting was cancelled and the Pond Inlet meeting was also cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="18">"over the course of the week, Baffinland representatives from the interested parties spoke regularly about their plans to build a rail link from North Baffin to the Mary River port."</seg>
<seg id="19">"this is for the rail road and other parts of the port, which would make it more possible that the company is producing more than it currently produces 6 million tonnes of iron ore a year to the tune of 12 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="20">"but what is particularly notable this week is that Baffinland's proposal to amend the project permits to remove this restriction and to put in place a time limit for shipping, 20 times a rail back and forth and 176 sealift a year."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the motion to adjourn the meeting was supported by all those who wished to speak, many of whom expressed concern about the confusing nature of the project."</seg>
<seg id="22">"P. J. Akeeagok, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association President, stated that the Northwest Territories Development Corporation believes in the Nunavut Impact Review Board's work to ensure that" people have the opportunity to ask questions on these important issues "and that" it is an opportunity for residents to express their concerns on an ongoing basis. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"Mr. Akeeagok also stated that the motion was not expected, but it was well organized on the last day of the session."</seg>
<seg id="24">Mr. Speaker, the Baffinland officials are looking at Kugluktuk as a starting point for the transfer.</seg>
<seg id="25">"what I think is that there are too many questions that have not been resolved yet.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in my view, if you are going to make a decision about your future, then you have to be well informed to make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="27">There was not enough "here."</seg>
<seg id="28">Representatives from the Baffin North community also agreed to the motion.</seg>
<seg id="29">"it needs to be heard and there needs to be a study done," says Amanda Hanson Maine, a consultant for the Pond Inlet Hunters and Trappers Organization.</seg>
<seg id="30">He said the project "may have serious implications for our values and our way of life and our place in the world."</seg>
<seg id="31">"some of the participants at the table said they were not satisfied with the Mary River project, and they just wanted to continue the Baffinland project for Nunavut, but there were too many questions and concerns about the proposed expansion."</seg>
<seg id="32">"what we are hearing is that it is too small and inadequate," says Peter Evalu, the Hamlet of Igloolik representative.</seg>
<seg id="33">"all the information has to be translated.</seg>
<seg id="34">Everything has to be "transparent."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the Government of Nunavut also agreed with the motion, in this case referring to the fact that there is too much disagreement between those who want to have the opportunity to speak and those who have the right to do so."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the federal government also supported the motion, but stated that the Nunavut Impact Review Board could make a decision on the length of the moratorium."</seg>
<seg id="37">"through his legal team, Baffinland stated that they were not satisfied with the motion for termination for eight months and that they were not satisfied with the motion until they were informed."</seg>
<seg id="38">"everything that went into this press conference was supposed to go ahead on November 2 starting," says Brad Armstrong, the legal counsel for Baffinland. "</seg>
<seg id="39">"none of them indicated that they were not prepared to start on this date.</seg>
<seg id="40">No matter which language was used, it was not intended to deter people from going to these places. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"Megan Lawrence Hooker, the vice president of recycling for Baffinland, said the delay would have an impact on the" immediate problems "of the project.</seg>
<seg id="42">"but we will do whatever it takes to provide and protect 3,000 Canadians in employment, 476 of whom are Inuit."</seg>
<seg id="43">We need to know that people are going to be working with us.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we need time to figure out how much of a problem this project is going to be," Lorimer said.</seg>
<seg id="45">"although the Qikiqtani Inuit Association has stated that they cannot support Project 2, Mr. Akeeagok stated that they will continue to work on the Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit program and that the project will be economically viable."</seg>
<seg id="46">"we are not satisfied with the Mary River project.</seg>
<seg id="47">We are working with them.</seg>
<seg id="48">It is our own Inuit land.</seg>
<seg id="49">"we support Inuit employment," he says.</seg>
<seg id="50">"we have invested a lot of money and work to make this project economically viable for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="51">"so with that in mind, we have to find a balance."</seg>
<seg id="52">But right now there is "nothing."</seg>
<seg id="53">Mr. Akeeagok also stated that the community's uncertainty about the impact of the rail project on our caribou is very important.</seg>
<seg id="54">"as an Inuk, these issues have a direct impact on our cultural rights."</seg>
<seg id="55">"this was clearly demonstrated by the elders when they were here that they are not only thinking about themselves, this is also for the future."</seg>
<seg id="56">And that's what I really care about.</seg>
<seg id="57">"my decisions are not just for now, but for the next generation."</seg>
<seg id="58">Do I leave them with a better foundation than they did in the past?</seg>
<seg id="59">"this is basically the basis of the decision-making process, what the culture is," he says.</seg>
<seg id="60">"on the recommendation of the Nunavut Impact Review Board, the Nunavut Impact Review Board provided an opportunity for submissions to be made in writing until November 15."</seg>
<seg id="61">"from there, the Nunavut Impact Review Board will make a written submission to the motion and how long they have to wait."</seg>

<seg id="1">Nunavut Legislative Assembly agrees to amendments to the Income Tax Act</seg>
<seg id="2">"our government is working very hard to recoup some of the costs that have been incurred by the company."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the Member for Rankin Inlet North asked the Minister of Finance George Hickes about Bill 26, An Act to Amend the Income Tax Act, at the Department of Justice meeting on Wednesday, November 6."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Nunavut Legislative Assembly updated the Nunavut Income Tax Act to amend the Payroll Tax Act.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the amendments, which received third reading on Wednesday, November 6, included an increase in the personal allowance from $13,325 to $16,000."</seg>
<seg id="6">"this implies that tax payers will be earning close to $3,000 a year before they have to pay Nunavut income tax."</seg>
<seg id="7">"another change is the increase in the cost of living tax bills from $1,200 to $1,500."</seg>
<seg id="8">"this means that tax payers who make more than $60,000 will be able to claim an additional $300 in income tax."</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, Nunavut's corporate tax rate for small businesses has decreased from 4 percent to 3 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">"our government is trying to play a major role in the recovery of the Poverty Reduction Fund," says Finance Minister George Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the Federal Government's Fuel Tax Rebate Program came into force in Nunavut on July 1, to make the fuel price increase more reasonable - it would have been an increase of 5 cents per litre - the Government of Nunavut introduced the Fuel Tax Rebate Program, which subsidizes the fuel price increase by half."</seg>
<seg id="12">"during discussions on income tax reform, the Nunavut Legislative Assembly agreed that Khan's tax revenues should be repatriated to Nunavummiut."</seg>
<seg id="13">However, they have not been able to come to an agreement on how best to do that.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Adam Lyall, Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, expressed concern that, in light of the reduction in income tax rates, the government would have to use Khan's tax payments for government operations."</seg>
<seg id="15">"my understanding right now is that we need a lot of assistance from the Government of Nunavut and our own economy is only 10 percent to 15 percent of our contribution.</seg>
<seg id="16">"we really need to use our own economy for what we need to operate," says Lyall.</seg>
<seg id="17">"why is the government trying to use Khan's tax revenues to subsidize government operations?"</seg>
<seg id="18">"Mr. Khan's tax revenue development is only a small part of the Government of Nunavut and Mr. Khan has been trying to be fair to our own company," Mr. Hickes said, adding, "I don't think that we would be very satisfied if we just set up the Poverty Reduction Fund for other sources of revenue and not bring that money back to the private sector."</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr. Lyall also stated that this amendment to the Income Tax Act would be in the best interest of Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="20">"it also stated that the Canada-Nunavut Tax Assistance Program will be used by the Government of Nunavut for its intended purpose, to reduce Nunavut's hunger."</seg>
<seg id="21">"climate change is a big concern for me and a lot of work needs to be done now and for future generations.</seg>
<seg id="22">"having said that, I have tabled a number of ideas for our government on how to develop or motivate Nunavummiut to become more energy efficient," says Lyall.</seg>
<seg id="23">"why is it that these ideas have not been considered and proposed to be used for income tax purposes?"</seg>
<seg id="24">Mr. Hickes responded by saying that each department - which is responsible for specific projects - is listening.</seg>
<seg id="25">"some departments have been working with departments, including the Qulliq Energy Corporation, which has a mandate to develop energy efficient LEDs for all street lights in Nunavut and this was approved at the meeting in the near future."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in 2019 / 20, the Government of Nunavut expects to generate $12 million in corporate tax payments."</seg>
<seg id="27">It would be broken down as follows:</seg>
<seg id="28">â¢ 2 million dollars for the government's more expensive furnaces for public housing and government buildings such as schools and hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="29">â¢ 3.6 million dollars for the new Nunavut Candidate Rebate Program.</seg>
<seg id="30">â¢ 6.2 million dollars to be returned to Nunavummiut and Nunavut jobs this year as a result of amendments to the Income Tax Act.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, I would like to point out to Mr. Lyall that this math is not fully integrated.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in view of the 50 percent rebate from the Fuel Tax Rebate Program and the 50 percent rebate, why is there so little room for energy conservation activities?"</seg>
<seg id="33">"Mr. Hickes responded that the federal tax rate will increase every year over the next five years, and while this 50 percent deduction for petroleum products will continue, this year's increase in the tax rate will generate additional revenue for other projects."</seg>
<seg id="34">The Bill received second reading on November 6 and received third reading in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="35">"even though this is the case, Lyall, the day before she gave birth she said to the Law Centre that she had only been sleeping for three hours and she was out."</seg>
<seg id="36">"shortly after the email from the Nunatsiaq News, Mr. Lyall stated that he was not satisfied that he had voted for the legislation."</seg>
<seg id="37">"I do not agree with the circumstances of Bill 26, I feel that it is not a proper fiscal policy," Mr. Lyall said.</seg>
<seg id="38">"the purpose of Khan is to reduce taxes on oil and gas from industry and to address climate change.</seg>
<seg id="39">"if this legislation includes an energy tax rebate for individuals and businesses who wish to contribute, or if the Government of Nunavut has put in place measures to help people purchase and develop energy conservation measures then I would have been very pleased to be in agreement with the legislation."</seg>
<seg id="40">Although Mr. Lyall is not satisfied with this legislation, it was passed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Mr. Hickes indicated that he was willing to listen to ideas on how to use the Canada-Nunavut tax revenues to reduce poverty in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I strongly urge the public to write to the Members of the Legislative Assembly or the government with a view to what can be done in this area."</seg>

<seg id="6">"this is the result of the Nunavut Tourism Annual Report for 2018 / 19 from the Department of Economic Development and Transportation, which was tabled in the Legislative Assembly earlier this month."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the same people who came here used a total of $271,383,000 for participation and travel expenses."</seg>
<seg id="8">The report does not account for actual expenditures other than travel.</seg>
<seg id="9">"on balance, there were approximately 16,750 non-Nunavut visitors from May to October 2015, according to the following year's Nunavut exit survey."</seg>

<seg id="12">Pond Inlet and Pangnirtung are the second and third communities visited from the Baffin region.</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the Kivalliq region, Rankin Inlet received 33,600 visits and $68 million, followed by Baker Lake and Arviat."</seg>
<seg id="14">Cambridge Bay was the most visited region in the Kitikmeot.</seg>

<seg id="17">"cruise ship operators spent $388,351 on community services," the report also states.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the weather and ice conditions affected more than half of the cruise ships that wanted to visit Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="19">"the department received the results of eight Inuit cargo operators with 23 trips to Nunavut from July to September, 2018."</seg>
<seg id="20">"these ships brought 3,404 people together."</seg>
<seg id="21">"just over half, or 59% of the cargo that was shipped to Pond Inlet came from Nunavut."</seg>

<seg id="27">"the feedback from the report was from the Recruitment and Retention Strategy 2018, which conducted a survey of cruise ship operators and other visitors to Nunavut last year."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in 2018, the Government of Nunavut had to respond to community concerns from Pond Inlet and Clyde River about cruise ship traffic."</seg>
<seg id="29">"as far as the report is concerned, the Government of Nunavut consulted with the Association of Arctic Research Vessel Operators and both cruise ship operators to avoid going through this process."</seg>
<seg id="30">"it also stated that tourism is a private sector development, which requires government support for development."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in Nunavut, this means building capacity and employment for Nunavummiut in the tourism sector."</seg>
<seg id="32">"there is always a lack of dedicated and skilled tourism professionals.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in the absence of skilled workers, tourism has not fully realized its potential."</seg>

<seg id="36">"in our report, all Government of Nunavut tourism inspectors are Inuit."</seg>

<seg id="1">"Mary River: if the economic potential is an issue, let's make it a reality."</seg>
<seg id="2">The Members of the Legislative Assembly are very interested in the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement and the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement and the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="3">Participants sit in Iqaluit's Katowice Hall on the fourth day of the Nunavut Impact Review Board's public hearings on the Baffinland Iron Mines Highway expansion proposal for Mary River.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Nunavut's approach to regulatory compliance with industry development, beginning with the 1993 Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, has not been driven only by factors such as migration, changes in environmental and socio-economic conditions at the Mary River iron ore mine over the past decade."</seg>
<seg id="5">"this was demonstrated in Iqaluit earlier this month, when the Nunavut Impact Review Board held its last public hearing on the $900 million rail expansion proposal from the Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation in the wake of confusion and uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="6">The last seven days of meetings that were scheduled to take place in Pond Inlet were cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="7">"at the same time, Baffinland's multibillion dollar, diversified iron ore mine is in a state of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="8">"for this record, the Nunavut Impact Review Board has yet to make a decision on a motion from Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated that, if approved, would result in a delay of eight to 12 months."</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the Baffinland Nunavut Business Credit Corporation, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, said in the near future that they could not support or approve the expansion of the rail line."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but the Qikiqtani Inuit Association's task force, the Qikiqtaaluk Corporation has said that they fully support this."</seg>
<seg id="11">These are Arctic Co-ops as well.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is a very complex process.</seg>
<seg id="13">"on behalf of Pangnirtung, the Deputy Minister of Recycling, Meegan Loehr, on this issue stated that the company is only concerned about whether the project will be able to go ahead," he said. "we will do our very best to maintain and protect Canadians with 3,000 jobs, 476 of whom are Inuit."</seg>
<seg id="14">"last week, Baffinland announced that the Northwest Territories Development Corporation is terminating 490 southern contractors and 96 contractors for Inuit labour."</seg>
<seg id="15">This brings us to one of the biggest unanswered questions about the project: Baffinland's funding.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Baffinland has stated that the mine's economic potential is uncertain but if regulators allow it to build a 110 kilometre long rail link to Mary River and increase its production to 12 million tonnes a year, they would be able to do 176 trips through the causeway."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the problem is, they did not come up with a public report that would help them."</seg>
<seg id="18">"and at the same time, more and more professionals stopped asking questions about it."</seg>
<seg id="19">"it was a year ago, even though they didn't have anything to do with it that didn't stop the shareholders from believing what they were saying."</seg>
<seg id="20">"for example, in the summer and fall of 2018, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association quipped with Baffinland, to protect them from the Nunavut Impact Review Board."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on August 31 of that year, the Nunavut Impact Review Board decided that the federal government should not approve the prior and smaller year's production - from 4.2 million tonnes of iron ore to 6 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="22">"then Baffinland and his partner, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, started to do a lot of work."</seg>
<seg id="23">"over the last few weeks, they have been writing letters to the Chief Electoral Officer of Nunavut, Dominic Lampak, who at the time was the federal Northern Affairs Minister, calling for the board's decision to be reversed."</seg>
<seg id="24">Why is that?</seg>
<seg id="25">Funding.</seg>
<seg id="26">"the Inuit Association stated that they were shocked by the potential of the Mary River mine, due to the need to allocate significant amounts of money and resources, at a cost of over $20 million here in the new Inuit Impact and Benefit Agreement."</seg>
<seg id="27">Ottawa agreed.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in light of the Qikiqtani Inuit Association's concerns about the possibility of funding the mine, the federal government approved the Baffinland proposal last year."</seg>
<seg id="29">"we are also concerned about the potential long-term viability of the Mary River Mine and are aware of the Qikiqtani Inuit Association's concerns about the commercial viability of the project."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in other words, the most important Member of the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut - the Federal Government - has committed to the importance of economic development and investment in this area."</seg>
<seg id="31">And they did that even though there was no financial disclosure in there.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="33">"because if it is true that this project is not economically viable, the Member of the Legislative Assembly should look forward to seeing what he is saying."</seg>
<seg id="34">"in all aspects of the Mary River project, Baffinland staff - as required - must come up with a number of ways to contribute to this environmental impact statement."</seg>
<seg id="35">"but in terms of the program's financial ability, I don't think the Nunavut Impact Review Board really wants to create a public certification system."</seg>
<seg id="36">"for example, the Nunavut Impact Review Board has recommended that a lengthy financial document obtained by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans is not" valid "and should not be tabled in the Legislative Assembly's public registry."</seg>
<seg id="37">(the document is still on our website.)</seg>
<seg id="38">The Nunavut Impact Review Board recommended that this document be tabled - and that it be withdrawn as a result of Baffinland's request.</seg>
<seg id="39">"in this case, Baffinland wanted to provide, on a case-by-case basis, a shorter financial statement to explain why the Mary River project could generate more revenue as a result of a larger production."</seg>
<seg id="40">I don't know if it's a personal issue, but it may be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="41">Even though Baffinland has made some improvements in that area.</seg>
<seg id="42">"in this case in response, the Nunavut Impact Review Board made a different decision, which does not make sense."</seg>
<seg id="43">"if the federal government is going to make it economically viable, then this Federal Income Support Board has to do it as well."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in fact, the Nunavut Impact Review Board and other regulatory bodies should be required to obtain additional evidence."</seg>
<seg id="45">They should be very interested.</seg>
<seg id="46">"as well as Baffinland's lease on the land, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association."</seg>
<seg id="47">"in addition to any other concerns that may arise, the federal government should amend the federal legislation governing the Nunavut Impact Review Board's practices, the Nunavut Planning Commission and the Program Review Act, to clarify how financial information should be dealt with in the future."</seg>
<seg id="48">"although I would like to take this opportunity to comment on the weather, there are still many questions that remain unanswered about Baffinland's latest expansion proposal, related to the rail link's impact on caribou populations, the impact of ships on whales, the project's lack of Inuit employment, and much more."</seg>
<seg id="49">"there are a lot of questions as to why the Bathurst Inlet Port and Road Project, which was approved in 2013, was able to produce 18 million tonnes a year, and it is not clear yet why Baffinland was asked in 2013 to produce 18 million tonnes a year."</seg>
<seg id="50">It is still not clear why Baffinland has not moved forward with this plan.</seg>
<seg id="51">But the biggest question is how can this program be sustainable.</seg>

<seg id="5">"on November 7, 2019 these benefits were rescinded, with a daycare fee set at $8.25 per day."</seg>

<seg id="8">"the economic reform of Quebec has resulted in additional funding for family and child services in Quebec, including Nunavik."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Quebec's economy was estimated at 2.4 percent in 2018 / 19, which is 0.6 percent higher than previously thought."</seg>
<seg id="10">"in this case, Quebec's Minister of Finance, Eric Gerard, announced on November 7 that $857 million will be obligated at the end of the fiscal year."</seg>
<seg id="11">There are two areas that will be taken into consideration in the review of the Child and Family Services Act.</seg>
<seg id="12">"the modernization of Quebec's economy and financial system has resulted in Quebec's success in this area," Gerard says in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="13">"economic growth in Quebec gives us an opportunity to reduce the deficit and fulfill the government's promises."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with this program, Quebec is eliminating the additional support provided to families for child care that was implemented by Phillip Koke's previous Liberal government in 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">"through this program, there is an increase in the allowance for child care on top of the cost of a day's income."</seg>
<seg id="16">This subsidy was increased to $15 per day for higher income earners.</seg>
<seg id="17">"the families who make less than $50,000 did not receive an increase in the subsidy."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the November 7 news release will reinstate the Quebec daycare fee of $8.25, eliminating the additional fees for all income earners."</seg>
<seg id="19">This new fee in Nunavik will be used through the Kativik Community Government Program in Nunavik for child care.</seg>
<seg id="20">"according to the Quebec newspaper, this new fee will be for this year, and this newspaper in Montreal reported that this will be effective January 1, 2019."</seg>
<seg id="21">"as of last week, the parent of the Child Care Services Centre in all the communities of the Government of Nunavut, Jo-Anne Beatty, was not informed as to how or when these payments from Nunavik would begin."</seg>
<seg id="22">Premier FranÃ§ois Legault's government first made the decision to slow down the disbursement of additional resources and completely eliminate it by 2022.</seg>
<seg id="23">A healthy economy and a newly created budget surplus of $4 billion for the 2019 / 20 fiscal year is helping to speed up the process.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as well as eliminating the cost of child care, the Quebec government is moving forward with a child care increase that was promised in 2021."</seg>
<seg id="25">"starting in January 2020, the Quebec Government announced that families in Nunavut will receive an increase of $779 a year."</seg>
<seg id="26">"this subsidy is based on income, with a minimum of $1,000 deductible up to a maximum of $2,515 a year."</seg>
<seg id="27">"this new rule is about child equality, it's more about the fact that the Liberal Party does not pay any more for child care than it does for the parent of the child."</seg>
<seg id="28">"today, we will complete the implementation of various measures to help the people of Quebec," Gerard says.</seg>
<seg id="29">"we are getting more money back to Quebec at a faster rate."</seg>

<seg id="4">"the Sanikiluaq Community Operations Centre was erected on Wednesday, November 20 in front of the Nunavut Court of Justice in Iqaluit, in honour of Peter Kattuk from Sanikiluaq, who passed away this morning after a long illness."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Mr. Kattuk, 69, a respected member, and community leader from his home community, became a member of Nunavut at the beginning of February 15, 1999, when the voters of Hudson Bay voted for this first Nunavut Legislative Assembly and they held their first meeting on April 1 of that same year."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Peter Kattuk (left) along with former Commissioner of Nunavut Peter Irniq on April 12, 2000, when Mr. Kattuk was sworn in as Nunavut Minister."</seg>
<seg id="7">"at the beginning of the Legislative Assembly, Mr. Kattuk was the Minister of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth on April 12, 2000 to replace the Honourable Donald Havioyak, who resigned from his position."</seg>
<seg id="8">"on December 17, 2001, Mr. Kattuk was moved from his position as Minister of Community and Government Services to this position in 2004."</seg>
<seg id="9">"and in 2004, Sanikiluaq voters re-selected Mr. Kattuk from Hudson Bay, as a Member of the Legislative Assembly until 2008."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Peter represented Hudson Bay for the past eight years as a double election candidate and his family is in my thoughts," Nunavut Speaker Simeon Mikkungwak said in a news release.</seg>
<seg id="11">"born on June 2, 1950, Mr. Kattuk spent many years in Sanikiluaq as an environmental activist, mayor and community leader."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the early 1990s, he was a member of the Sanikiluaq Impact Review Board, which is a community gathering knowledge of the impacts of a large hydropower system built in the vicinity of Northern Quebec due to the impact of ice and marine mammals on the Sanikiluaq islands."</seg>
<seg id="13">The result was a report titled "Hudson Bay Sounds: cultural Knowledge of Inuit and First Nations in Hudson Bay."</seg>
<seg id="14">"as the Mayor of Sanikiluaq, Mr. Kattuk has also spoken out in favour of the current decommissioning of the Churchill Power Plant."</seg>
<seg id="15">"prior to that Mr. Kattuk was a member of the Nunavut Hudson Bay Working Group, which was called the Nunavut Hudson Bay Neighbours Association."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this group, formed by the Government of Nunavut, Nunavut Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated and the Hamlet of Sanikiluaq, is monitoring the progress of the Sanikiluaq adjacent to the second power hydro hydro project proposal, which has also been stalled since then, for the Eastside and Rupert Rivers."</seg>
<seg id="17">"and in 1996, Mr. Kattuk was a member of the Nunavut Impact Review Board, a body established in 1993 under the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Peter Kattuk spoke in the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut on February 19, 2008, at the end of his second term in Hudson Bay."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Mr. Kunuk Tattuinee, the Minister of Arctic Co-operatives, remembers Mr. Kattuk as a" very kind person, "and this is the first time that he has been able to get the seafood that the people of Sanikiluaq can eat."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this is Paul Okalik, at the time when he was the Premier of Nunavut, he appointed Mr. Kattuk as the Minister of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth in April 2000, saying that Mr. Kattuk had introduced Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit prior to this announcement."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Peter was involved in the study of Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit prior to this announcement," Mr. Okalik said in a press release in April 2000.</seg>
<seg id="22">"before we had a job as a minister in 2001, Mr. Kattuk had to deal with the" bad taste "that we used to have.</seg>
<seg id="23">This happened with the Northern Transportation Company bringing gasoline into Nunavut and causing damage to snowmobiles in the Baffin and Kivalliq regions.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in his role, Mr. Kattuk also took on another issue: the Government of Nunavut's decision not to use NTCL and reallocate the Petroleum Products Division to the Whitford Partners in Labrador."</seg>
<seg id="25">"he ran for re-election in October 2017, but he came in third place after Allan Rumbolt."</seg>

<seg id="6">The Members of the Legislative Assembly of Sivumut Abluqta won the Pangnirtung Tunngavik Incorporated election last fall in the federal election with 37.7 percent of the vote.</seg>
<seg id="7">"when the Black Bloc members were speaking French, he said he was looking for an Inuktitut interpreter to work with him."</seg>
<seg id="8">"I want to be able to make a clear statement on the needs of aboriginal communities," he says.</seg>
<seg id="9">"to date, Mr. Brewer has indicated that there are two very important urgent needs in Nunavik that he is aware of in the areas of health and housing."</seg>
<seg id="10">"health care is a province, but it's a federal subsidy," says Ruby.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in order to increase the health benefits, the federal government must consider how it allocates them."</seg>
<seg id="12">Ruby has worked in the health field for more than 30 years.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the "Black Bloc" campaign, the group said that the province needs 10,000 housing units over the next 10 years. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"in this case Ruby has been talking about, the potential for different designs."</seg>
<seg id="15">"if we want this new Liberal government to move forward, then it is up to us to come up with a solution," Ruby says.</seg>
<seg id="16">"this new member is not unusual in Nunavik, but he would like to attend the next annual general meeting of Makivik, which will be held in March."</seg>
<seg id="17">"after the election of Mr. Brewer, Makivik President Charles Ford issued a news release welcoming Mr. Brewer to Nunavik to visit him as soon as possible."</seg>

<seg id="19">Having a dialogue with Inuit leaders would help with the work that Makivik is trying to do in the private sector.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Ruby fully supports Bill C-262, which would bring Canada into compliance with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the two different pieces of legislation that he is replacing, he is a member of the Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, and he is a member of the Nunavut Association of Municipalities."</seg>
<seg id="22">"this was brought forward in 2018, Bill C-262 was suspended by the Conservative Party this spring but the representative of the Government of Nunavut, Senator Peter Hall, said that when he was re-elected this government would have to implement the legislation."</seg>
<seg id="23">"it is important for me to continue to work on Bill C-262 in accordance with the Constitution of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the work of my predecessor Romeo Cartier," Mr. Brewer says.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trudeau's government 2.0: don't expect too much.</seg>
<seg id="2">"if you have a good idea, don't expect too much."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Jane Bengts was the Minister of Aboriginal Services on March 23, 2018, along with Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, when she announced that the federal government would eradicate Inuit land before 2030."</seg>
<seg id="4">Less than a year ago he retired from federal politics.</seg>
<seg id="5">Maybe I found out during the federal election campaign or before any of the leaders talked about the issues that are important to Nunavummiut and the people of the north.</seg>
<seg id="6">That's not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the more important lawyers seem to be concerned about the majority of Canadians, because in the south, there are not enough people who will vote even if they are talking about the north that the majority of Canadians have never heard of."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the Government of Nunavut was made aware of this situation, which resulted in a delay in the northern and northern policy decisions made the day before the campaign began."</seg>
<seg id="9">"during the campaign, the issue of aboriginal issues, many of which overlap with northern issues, was also not addressed."</seg>
<seg id="10">"as a result of the new reduction in Justin Trudeau's government, and the new Board of Governors being sworn into office on November 20, it is likely that they will continue to act with little care."</seg>
<seg id="11">This is one of the symbols.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is in reference to one of the key commitments made by the north since the Trudeau government became president in 2015: to eliminate at least 50 percent (half) of tuberculosis in the Inuit territory by 2025 and to completely eliminate it by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="13">"this included an initial contribution of $27.5 million over five years, which will be used to" set up "four members of the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami."</seg>
<seg id="14">"but the announcement seemed to smell like a pair of promises. to begin with, this was a TB reduction specialist for the Federal Government, Jane Ferry, who was the Aboriginal Services Minister who made that statement."</seg>
<seg id="15">He resigned from Trudeau's legal team on March 4 in protest of Trudeau's failure to properly deal with Jody Wilson-Raybould.</seg>
<seg id="16">This happened less than four days before Trudeau was going to Iqaluit to apologize for Canada's unfair treatment of people who suffered from tuberculosis in the 1950s and 1960s.</seg>
<seg id="17">"since then, there has been a silence in the north about tuberculosis."</seg>
<seg id="18">"even though they were nominated, they didn't get that much attention."</seg>
<seg id="19">"and so far, the fight against tuberculosis has just stopped."</seg>
<seg id="20">"for example, in the Northwest Territories, where there was a tuberculosis epidemic between 2006 and 2016 and it was recorded at 248.5 per 100,000 people, the Department of Health has only done one community survey."</seg>
<seg id="21">"that's what happened in Repulse Bay, in 2018, when there was a tuberculosis outbreak and a boy who was 14 years old died of this disease while he was in the hospital with Jane Johns."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in Nunavik, 313 people became ill with tuberculosis between 2006 and 2016, which is in conjunction with tuberculosis in the Inuit homeland, 234 cases per 100,000."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, there does not appear to have been any community studies done in Nunavik since 2018, when this article was published."</seg>
<seg id="24">"indeed in Nunavut just a few years ago there was an outbreak of tuberculosis, this was when Stephen Harper was the last Conservative Prime Minister, long before Trudeau's Liberals were elected."</seg>
<seg id="25">"for Nunavut, there have been 670 people diagnosed with tuberculosis between 2006 and 2016, which is 171.8 out of 100,000 and there has been some work done on that."</seg>
<seg id="26">(one person who has not been affected is the Inuvialuit of the Northwest Territories.</seg>
<seg id="27">"at that time, we did not hear any cases of tuberculosis between 2007 and 2016."</seg>
<seg id="28">Tuberculosis is a disease with a lack of resources.</seg>
<seg id="29">This is an issue that has been brought up in the past.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it is true.</seg>
<seg id="31">"if people do not have adequate food and housing, tuberculosis can develop."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, poverty in Cape Dorset, in this case the 12-week TB study ended in May."</seg>
<seg id="33">In 2016 the unemployment rate was around 27.3 percent.</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 2015 the average income of 15-year-olds was just over $18,933."</seg>
<seg id="35">"out of the 370 units, 120 units were in desperate need of repair."</seg>
<seg id="36">"as a matter of national overcrowding, these 140 units from 370 units were deemed" uninhabitable "under the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Act."</seg>
<seg id="37">This means that there is a lack of classroom space based on the number of people in the household.</seg>
<seg id="38">There are also a few people in Canada who do not have adequate housing.</seg>
<seg id="39">"it is not surprising that over the last 20 years, tuberculosis has been declared an emergency in Nunavut and other parts of the north."</seg>
<seg id="40">And it is unlikely that tuberculosis can be eradicated in these communities unless major changes are made to increase the supply and quality of housing.</seg>
<seg id="41">"however, during the last campaign, Trudeau's lawyers did not make any public housing available, except to reiterate their 2016 and 2017 operational commitments."</seg>
<seg id="42">"in this case, they are not even allowed to say that they have broken their language, nor did they have any concerns about that."</seg>
<seg id="43">"this also reflects the history of Canada's medical emergency, where the rate of tuberculosis in the Inuit region is 300 times higher than the rate of tuberculosis among non-Inuit living in Canada."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in Nunavut, it could be worse."</seg>
<seg id="45">Last year's report revealed that one in 100 babies born in Nunavut may have this disease.</seg>
<seg id="46">"given that they are not particularly concerned about the crisis, what are the concerns of the Trudeau Liberal government on other issues such as mental health, community housing needs, education and more?"</seg>
<seg id="47">"if you have a good idea, don't expect too much."</seg>
<seg id="48">"if you don't, be prepared to be put down."</seg>
<seg id="49">"please note: the number of cases of tuberculosis continues to rise from Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami's" Inuit TB Reduction Framework, "published in November 2018."</seg>
<seg id="50">The Cape Dorset data comes from the Statistics Canada report that was compiled during the 2016 census.</seg>

<seg id="1">The New Year will focus on new RCMP officers and resources for the Nunavik RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="2">Police officers and the use of body cameras have been put in place.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Nunavut Association of Municipalities has a new RCMP detachment and surveillance system that will be launched in early 2020.</seg>
<seg id="4">(photographer Elaine Anderson)</seg>
<seg id="5">"after months of understaffing, the Nunavut Association of Municipalities is able to see that efforts have been made to recruit additional RCMP officers,"</seg>
<seg id="6">The RCMP Superintendent Jean-Pierre LaRose came to the council to provide an update at the meeting of the Nunavut Association of Municipalities on November 26 on the progress that has been made to date.</seg>
<seg id="7">This included the completion of 10 new community detachments from the Ontario Police College in the same week.</seg>
<seg id="8">The recruitment process also included people who had retired as adults being given the opportunity to talk about the work of the centre.</seg>
<seg id="9">"due to the lack of proper staffing, the Katimajiit of all the communities have had RCMP officers from the Quebec RCMP, from the Auditor General of Canada, from the Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit Katimajiit."</seg>
<seg id="10">"in September, there were 20 Quebec police officers from Nunavik."</seg>
<seg id="11">"there has been a decline in the number of Quebec RCMP officers as a result of the efforts of the Nunavut Association of Municipalities to recruit RCMP officers, and LaRose indicated that in early 2020 the Quebec RCMP may no longer be able to use the RCMP."</seg>
<seg id="12">Cultural Awareness Skills Starts</seg>
<seg id="13">The Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit Katimajiit was posted on the RCMP website on November 18.</seg>
<seg id="14">"skills development was developed by the Centre for Communities from the RCMP and Laval University and includes information on the Nunavik area, Inuit culture, and policing trends here in Nunavik."</seg>
<seg id="15">"this can take up to three hours and once it is completed it will be tested in the early stages of training, which has been identified in the job application process."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this skills program is intended to help the Katimajiit in every community police force to choose a culture of respect," LaRose says.</seg>
<seg id="17">"the second part of the training is nine hours long and it requires a wide range of police skills," says LaRose.</seg>
<seg id="18">This project is expected to be completed by the beginning of the new fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="19">The cameras will have to be used by the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="20">The other thing that was added by the RCMP and appreciated by the members is that they have to have the cameras that the RCMP are working on.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is a pilot project and they are using six cameras right now.</seg>
<seg id="22">"this work is driven by Nunavik's commitment to ensuring that all communities in the RCMP are able to be more transparent in their work," Ross says.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Kativik Community Policing Team aims to provide people with a place where they can go about their work and be more sociable."</seg>
<seg id="24">Churchill Councillor Jobie Tapik had hoped that these cameras would be able to help people who have had problems with the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="25">"we hear from the RCMP that they are being treated unfairly and those are the words that they don't want to say very much.</seg>
<seg id="26">"they have been intimidated by the police," Mr. Tapik says.</seg>
<seg id="27">"this is what the body cameras are supposed to be used for."</seg>
<seg id="28">"he went on to say that if only one or two RCMP officers are not doing the right thing, this has a huge impact, and it seems to be a concern for the whole RCMP."</seg>
<seg id="29">"the idea is that these cameras, which take pictures of what the officer is doing, can be used in the short term."</seg>
<seg id="30">LaRose said these cameras would come into effect in January.</seg>
<seg id="31">He went on to say that inadequate and inadequate action will not only be offered by the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I just recently retired from the RCMP a week ago because of the lack of compliance with our program in Nunavik," he says.</seg>
<seg id="33">"we don't want to have too many RCMP officers in Nunavik."</seg>

<seg id="1">Nunavut's neighbours are talking about renewable energy in the north.</seg>
<seg id="2">"representatives from Greenland, Canada and the United Kingdom are discussing ideas and experiences"</seg>
<seg id="3">"Bruno Pereira, President of the Qulliq Energy Corporation is presenting here at the Arctic Strengthening and Community Inuit Summit in Iqaluit, November 22, 2019."</seg>
<seg id="4">(photo from the United States Auditor General)</seg>
<seg id="5">Renewable energy experts from the north met in Iqaluit on November 21 and 22 to consider and share their experiences with the north.</seg>
<seg id="6">"delegations from Nunavut, the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, Greenland and the Jai Taiguusiliuqtiit discussed the challenges faced by different communities."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the forum, called Decentralization Operations, Global Innovation and Engagement (improving governance, incorporating new programs and engaging stakeholders), was set up by American officials in collaboration with the Government of Nunavut and the Qulliq Energy Corporation."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Bruno Pereira, President of the Qulliq Energy Corporation, said the meeting was a way of finding out about the problems."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in the interest of investing in renewable energy in our communities, we are very interested in finding out what others are doing, and finding out how their work has been accomplished or achieved," Pereira says.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Mr. Pereira also said that although it is very important for representatives to come together to talk about fuel conservation, Nunavut has a lot of activities going on here in Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="11">"some of the communities have access roads so they don't have a lot of people in the Nunavut communities.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but they have challenges like us, in terms of being able to fit in, being able to deal with communities, so we can see a similar level of disability."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Chris Rose, the Executive Director of the renewable energy program in Alaska, stated that the Alaska Energy Assistance Program has helped to promote renewable energy development."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so we have been able to build 80 communities that have been able to utilize renewable energy on top of the fuel in Gjoa Haven.</seg>
<seg id="15">"so we feel that we now know how to make a difference," Rose says.</seg>
<seg id="16">"this subsidy, which is designed to promote renewable energy development programs, also helps the people of Alaska by reducing the cost of electricity."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Rose said that in the southern part of Alaska, five communities are working together to develop wind turbines and they are using them for energy."</seg>
<seg id="18">"now there is an integrated knowledge of how to manage and manage wind power and they can help each other in setting it up," Rose says.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Alaska, like Nunavut, home power bills are very high."</seg>
<seg id="20">Mr. Rose said that the communities are using wind power not only for electricity but also for heating.</seg>
<seg id="21">"what they have done is put small furnaces into people's houses that are surrounded by diamonds that look like flooring.</seg>
<seg id="22">"when there is more wind, they go into the furnace, and they set up a small device that detects the furnace and the power goes out," Rose says.</seg>
<seg id="23">"these are the environmental factors that cause the boiler to break down, which can keep the boiler warm."</seg>
<seg id="24">"they can be turned off or burned in a home that is acceptable, and if they are unable to do so they can have another furnace."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but in Greenland, the installation of wind turbines has been very difficult, according to News Corp's Eric Hickey, a project consultant for recycling in Nuuk."</seg>
<seg id="26">"extreme cold and darkness make it difficult for wind farms in the south to adapt to the north," says Mr. Havioyak.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Mr. Havioyak also stated that there were two wind turbines that were successfully installed in another location in Greenland's North, but they failed."</seg>
<seg id="28">"we can also say that in Greenland we have more choices that can be made to take advantage of the resources that are available.</seg>
<seg id="29">"even the two wind turbines that were installed in 200 different locations and the other 150 sites are also being tested," he says.</seg>
<seg id="30">"one of the windmills went off, on the other hand, the heat was too thick for the cold and the engine broke down," Brooks says.</seg>
<seg id="31">"during the 2019 federal election campaign, the three political parties stated that if elected Nunavut will get rid of fossil fuel by 2030."</seg>
<seg id="32">"although it may take some time to develop a recycling program that can be used in the north, Mr. Havioyak stated that the elimination of fossil fuels is an urgent matter."</seg>
<seg id="33">"we have to do what we can to get rid of fossil fuels, climate change, because there is already a problem right now."</seg>
<seg id="34">This is for legal purposes because if you are not going to be using the fuel you have to have the resources but there is no money.</seg>
<seg id="35">"to be able to fund a good project," he says.</seg>
<seg id="36">Barra said it was a good experience to talk to the other side of Nunavut residents from the north.</seg>
<seg id="37">"I think this is something that needs to be considered in a different way, in terms of how to start working towards recycling."</seg>
<seg id="38">Some people have been using the technology and they have had problems in the south where they don't have the skills but they can't do it in the north.</seg>
<seg id="39">"once we have the financial capacity we will be able to track the problems that have arisen," Barra says.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Government of Nunavut should involve Inuit in the development of the Education Act: Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated</seg>
<seg id="2">"this is a very important policy change that will affect many Inuit parents and Inuit children in Nunavut."</seg>

<seg id="5">Issue: Minister Joanasie's Letter to Nunatsiaq News on Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Bill 25</seg>
<seg id="6">"Minister Joanasie wrote a letter to Nunatsiaq News on November 25, 2019 concerning discussions between the Department of Education and Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated regarding Bill 25, indicating that these discussions were conducted in good faith and that NTI had ample opportunity to voice its concerns."</seg>
<seg id="7">The minister is looking at encouraging Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated to hold public meetings and Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated to listen to the Government of Nunavut's view of working with the previous meetings.</seg>
<seg id="8">That is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Inuit have rights under Article 32 of the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement to participate in the development of social and cultural policies, as well as the development of social and cultural programs and services, including governance."</seg>

<seg id="11">Bill 25 proposes amendments to the Education Act and the Inuit Language Protection Act to streamline the policy and administration of Inuit language instruction.</seg>

<seg id="15">"not only does it violate the Government of Nunavut's obligations outlined in the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, it also demonstrates that efforts have been made to achieve a set of goals that better reflect Inuit goals and objectives."</seg>
<seg id="16">"NTI has been working to develop regulations with the Government of Nunavut, such as the Inuit Language Protection Act, the Official Languages Act and the Wildlife Act."</seg>
<seg id="17">"knowing that it could go ahead, NTI contacted the Premier and the newly elected government to coordinate cooperation and collaboration on Inuit priorities, including education, language and culture."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the Department of Education did not submit a proposed bill to NTI until August 31, 2018, at which time the department provided a list of planned community consultations."</seg>
<seg id="19">Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated was given less than a week to review Bill 25 and to plan and prepare for the Nunavut consultation tour.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is not a working relationship.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the department operated on a consultative basis, and did not seek to resolve or accommodate the concerns raised by the public. NTI and other organizations such as District Education Authorities (DEAs) and the Coalition of Nunavut District Education Authorities (DEAs) were also in attendance."</seg>
<seg id="22">"I urge the Minister of Education to ensure that the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement is a clear mandate for the delivery of Article 32, and that the department should operate in a manner that is fair, objective and responsible and reflects the values of the United Kingdom when it comes to dealing with Inuit."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated believes that the rewriting of the Education Act and the passage of the Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit Mandate should change the way the department operates, and the overall recognition of human rights."</seg>
