Paul Quassa, Mr. Alexander Sammurtok, Hon. Louis Tapardjuk, Mr. Simeon Mikkungwak, Mr. Simeon Mikkungwak,</seg>
<seg id="66">&amp;gt;&amp;gt;House commenced at 13:33</seg>
<seg id="67">Speaker (Hon. Joe Enook) (interpretation): Mr. Quassa, please say the opening prayer.</seg>
<seg id="68">Speaker (interpretation): Good afternoon, Premier, Members, Nunavummiut, and the people listening to the radio broadcast. Welcome to your committee.</seg>
<seg id="69">We will proceed immediately to the orders of the day.</seg>
<seg id="70">Premier of Nunavut, Mr. Quassa.</seg>
<seg id="71">Minister’s Statement 046 – 1(5): Nunavut’s 2018 Youth Award (Quassa)</seg>
<seg id="72">Hon. Paul Quassa (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="73">Good day to my fellow residents of Igloolik, my colleagues, and all Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="74">Mr. Speaker, I would also like to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Dr. Donna Main-Kimaliardjuk, who will be awarded the 2018 Council of the Federation Youth Award in Winnipeg.</seg>
<seg id="75">This is the very first time that a doctor has been certified as an Inuk.</seg>
<seg id="76">Dr. Kimmaliardjuk was born in Chesterfield Inlet and is the first Inuk veterinarian...</seg>
<seg id="77">This year is the fourth year of a six-year program offered at the University of Ottawa.</seg>
<seg id="78">Mr. Speaker, Dr. Kimaliardjuk was appointed in 2014 as the only Canadian veterinarian in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="79">In 2016, she was also a member of the Aboriginal Affairs Council, an advocacy group representing Inuit.</seg>
<seg id="80">During his tenure, he served as the Member of the Legislative Assembly for the protection of Inuit health and culture.</seg>
<seg id="81">Mr. Speaker, the award represents the highest honour and privilege of any aboriginal person in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="82">These awards celebrate Nunavut’s 25th anniversary in 2018 and pay tribute to 350 aboriginal people, Inuit and non-Inuit, who demonstrate outstanding achievement.</seg>
<seg id="83">The award celebrates a culture that promotes the diversity of indigenous peoples across Canada.</seg>
<seg id="84">This year, the awards ceremony will take place on March 23 in Winnipeg.</seg>
<seg id="85">I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Natsiq Kimmaliardjuk as one of the recipients of the Order of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="86">She has dedicated her time and energy to this cause and it is a cause for celebration for Inuit, as well as for the Department of Health, which we are very proud of, and this is a testament to our young people here in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="87">I know that when I talk about this issue, I am very proud of Dr. Kimmaliardjuk. I’m sure that he will work towards this goal and it will be very important to us.</seg>
<seg id="88">Minister of Justice, Minister Peterson.</seg>
<seg id="89">Minister’s Statement 047 – 5(1): Rankin Inlet Healing Facility Sewing Project (Cambridge Bay)</seg>
<seg id="90">Hon. Jeannie Ugyuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) I rise today to talk about the tradition of sewing for these men at the Rankin Inlet Healing Facility.</seg>
<seg id="91">The inmates in this program are involved in sealskin preparation, sealskin preparation, and other forms of clothing, such as sealskin floats, sealskin floats, sealskin pelt and caribou meat caches.</seg>
<seg id="92">Rosemary Anglesey is operated by Sandy, a respected elder, and her sewing skills are world-renowned.</seg>
<seg id="93">He just came to Norway to train with seal skins.</seg>
<seg id="94">She was a former student of Nunavut Arctic College’s Fur Production and Design Program and initiated the work of the Literacy Council of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="95">Mr. Speaker, Rosemary’s role is to assist inmates in providing culturally relevant, safe, Inuit language and cultural healing programs.</seg>
<seg id="96">The sewing program will collaborate with and support on-the-land training for inmates so that they can learn how to prepare skins and seal meat.</seg>
<seg id="97">These furs and skins will be used for the Fur Production and Design Program.</seg>
<seg id="98">Programs such as this provide an opportunity for inmates to reintegrate into their communities once their sentence has ended and they are encouraged to move into a more informal and non-violent society.</seg>
<seg id="99">I recently visited the Rankin Inlet Healing Facility and I was very pleased to see the positive impact it has on the cultural programs, especially for the elders in the communities like Rosemary Sandy.</seg>
<seg id="100">Minister of Family Services, Minister Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="101">Minister’s Statement 048 – 5(1): Red Sealift Workshops (Savikataaq)</seg>
<seg id="102">Hon. Joe Savikataaq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I say  ⁇ good day ⁇  to the people of Arviat.</seg>
<seg id="103">Mr. Speaker, this includes certified heavy equipment operators, such as loaders, graders, and outboard motors.</seg>
<seg id="104">In September of 2016 the Heavy Equipment Operator Training Program was delivered in three Nunavut communities.</seg>
<seg id="105">This gives Nunavummiut the opportunity to obtain on-the-job training and certification from the program known as certification.</seg>
<seg id="106">In November of 2017 the Government of Nunavut was granted the authority to issue red certification requirements for heavy equipment operators and heavy equipment operators.</seg>
<seg id="107">Mr. Speaker, as part of the Heavy Equipment Operator Program, the Certified General Accountants Program demonstrates their experience and commitment to employment anywhere in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="108">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that we have been able to showcase to Nunavummiut the National Award of Excellence for outstanding achievement and accomplishment for Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="109">Minister of Education, Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="110">Minister’s Statement 049 – 2(1): Funding for New Early Childhood Programs (Joanasie)</seg>
<seg id="111">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon, my colleagues, people of Cape Dorset, and Kimmirut.</seg>
<seg id="112">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to announce today that the Department of Education will be providing O ⁇ M funding to eligible daycares.</seg>
<seg id="113">Mr. Speaker, this increase is a result of the three-year program plan my department developed for early childhood and child care facilities following the agreement signed in September 2017 with the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="114">Mr. Speaker, in the current fiscal year, we will see eligible daycares receiving an increase in funding of $1,918.80, with the highest annual cost of $45,494.80, depending on the number, type, and location of each daycare.</seg>
<seg id="115">As long as the day cares do not increase their tuition and fees they will be eligible for similar funding in the next fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="116">Mr. Speaker, this money will not only help fund day-care costs, it will also help to keep family day care costs down.</seg>
<seg id="117">Mr. Speaker, we are proud to provide this funding to help day care centres and families.</seg>
<seg id="118">I also believe, and it is evident that we also believe that this funding will have a positive impact without changing the overall funding and daycare expenses.</seg>
<seg id="119">Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="120">Minister’s Statement 050 – 2(1): Nunavut Mining Symposium</seg>
<seg id="121">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik (interpretation): Good day, Nunavummiut and my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="122">Mr. Speaker, the mining sector plays a key role in Nunavut’s economic development.</seg>
<seg id="123">Mr. Speaker, my department is committed to supporting the mining industry in Nunavut so that it can benefit from these activities.</seg>
<seg id="124">Mr. Speaker, this year’s national event will be held in Iqaluit for the 21st annual Nunavut Mining Symposium, which will take place on April 9 to 12, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="125">This conference provides an excellent opportunity for people to explore the potential of new opportunities in Nunavut’s mining and mining sectors and to ensure that our communities are aware and active in the mining and exploration sectors of our territory.</seg>
<seg id="126">It is our hope that this year’s mining symposium will continue to attract investors from across Nunavut and we look forward to more than 400 participants.</seg>
<seg id="127">Mr. Speaker, I look forward to welcoming the mining industry, Inuit organizations, prospectors, community members, and other stakeholders to this important conference.</seg>
<seg id="128">Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would like to encourage all Members of the Legislative Assembly and the public to participate in this public forum on April 11.</seg>
<seg id="129">It’s not just an opportunity to get good equipment, but it’s an impact on search and rescue. I’ll make sure that all of the parties respond to your question.</seg>
<seg id="130">Members’ Statements. Member for Hudson Bay, Mr. Rumbolt.</seg>
<seg id="131">Member’s Statement 096 – 2(1): Happy Fifth Birthday to Granddaughter (Rumbolt)</seg>
<seg id="132">Mr. Speaker, five years ago to this day, the former Speaker stood up and said,  ⁇ I have been a grandson for the first time in five years. ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="133">Happy birthday, Jayden.</seg>
<seg id="134">Member for Netsilik, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>

<seg id="141">It includes:</seg>

<seg id="160">Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, Mr. Liechtenstein.</seg>
<seg id="161">Member’s Statement 098 – 5(1): Flowers Bill (Bloody Falls)</seg>
<seg id="162">Mr. Lichtstein: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="163">I rise today to express concerns that have been brought to my attention by constituents regarding the legalization of marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="164">I just received a letter that said,  ⁇ For my family as residents of Iqaluit we are in the social housing condominium program next year.</seg>
<seg id="165">Over the last couple of years we’ve been smoking, we’ve had to move smoke, and the smell, the smoke coming into my house and it’s very strong. ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="166">The letter further indicated that, and I quote,  ⁇ I am deeply concerned about the effects of tobacco on children, my children, and others in this situation. ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="167">Mr. Speaker, we live in Iqaluit and my family live in apartment buildings.</seg>
<seg id="168">Mr. Speaker, air pollution affects other people’s ability to smoke.</seg>
<seg id="169">Mr. Speaker, it has been a long time since non-smokers have been exposed to second-hand smoke by the government and there have been regulations in place to prohibit smoking.</seg>
<seg id="170">As a father, when you have children, I don’t want them to be negatively affected by diseases that include tobacco, marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="171">As my colleague from Pangnirtung noted, the question was directed to the Minister of Health regarding the potential health consequences of marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="172">At the same time, I have spoken to many of my constituents who have the same concerns.</seg>
<seg id="173">Mr. Speaker, I recognize that when dealing with issues of this nature, we have to be flexible.</seg>
<seg id="174">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to announce that the Government of Canada will be enacting the Tobacco Control Act within a few months.</seg>
<seg id="175">Mr. Speaker, I seek unanimous consent to conclude my statement.</seg>
<seg id="176">The member is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statement. Are there any nays?</seg>
<seg id="177">Mr Lafontaine, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="178">Thank you, colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="179">Under this legislation, elders are allowed to retain control of marijuana. However, the government will have to determine what regulations are in place to regulate the use of tobacco in our communities.</seg>
<seg id="180">Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet also noted last week that the government’s own consultations and results indicate that there is concern over the agriculture and distribution of public housing units and duplexes.</seg>
<seg id="181">Mr. Speaker, I believe that when this legislation is introduced in the Legislative Assembly, it will be important to clearly address these concerns and I look forward to the opportunity to work together with my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="182">Before we proceed, members will note that Mr. Akoak is not here today due to illness.</seg>
<seg id="183">Mr. Akoak, I wish you a speedy recovery.</seg>
<seg id="184">Member for Baker Lake, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="185">Member’s Statement 099 – 5 (1): Expansion of NTEP in Baker Lake (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="186">Mr. Mikkungwak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="187">I say  ⁇ hello ⁇  to the people of Baker Lake and all Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="188">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage our government to increase the number of training opportunities in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="189">Mr. Speaker, Baker Lake is one of the fastest growing communities in Nunavut. It will be very important for the government to step up its efforts to provide training and employment support to the residents of Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="190">Mr. Speaker, the Piqqusilirivvik Cultural School administers a number of programs in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="191">This could be expanded to make the public more aware and more knowledgeable about Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit.</seg>
<seg id="192">Mr. Speaker, the idea of establishing a university in Nunavut has been mentioned. In fact, Agnico Eagle Mines has stated that they would provide this type of support if it were to move forward.</seg>
<seg id="193">I think it would be best if we put Nunavut in the middle because it’s also the centre of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="194">Mr. Speaker, one of my colleagues stated that it’s very important that these things happen before they pass.</seg>
<seg id="195">Government wheels run at a slow pace, but at the same time we need to encourage and push forward whenever an opportunity is available on our tables.</seg>
<seg id="196">Mr. Speaker, this is the beginning of our term as the Fifth Legislative Assembly, and I too would like to see us take a big step forward.</seg>
<seg id="197">Expanding training programs in those communities and Baker Lake would be a great step forward.</seg>
<seg id="198">Member for Kugluktuk, Ms. Kamingoak.</seg>
<seg id="199">Member’s Statement 100 - 5(1): Concerns with Larga Boarding Home (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="200">Mr. Puqiqnak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="201">Good afternoon, colleagues, Kuglukturmiut, and Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="202">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage the government to be more vigilant with respect to the daily operations of medical boarding homes.</seg>
<seg id="203">Mr. Speaker, my constituents have raised a number of concerns and it appears that a number of them have been addressed in the past.</seg>
<seg id="204">Food problems and waste have persisted for months.</seg>
<seg id="205">Mr. Speaker, it is important that the government ensures that services that are provided to Nunavummiut are delivered in a timely manner.</seg>
<seg id="206">I understand that hotels have to accommodate a large number of patients on a daily basis but it is also important however important they may be that they are comfortable and well looked after.</seg>
<seg id="207">Mr. Speaker, it is unclear if boarding homes will be included in the review of the medical boarding homes.</seg>
<seg id="208">I look forward to the review and the recommendations that will be made to improve the services and conditions of our medical boarding homes.</seg>
<seg id="209">Member for Aivilik, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="210">Member’s Statement 101 - 5(1): Congratulations to Rosemary Ejangiaq (Netser)</seg>
<seg id="211">Mr. Netser (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="212">I would also like to recognize a young person who has graduated from high school, but has worked very hard and has been recognized as a recipient of the Bachelor of Education Degree from the University of Prince Edward Island.</seg>
<seg id="213">Mr. Speaker, Horowitz is the recipient of the Canadian High School Scholars Award. These scholarships are awarded to high school students despite the many difficulties faced by successful students.</seg>
<seg id="214">Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize Ms. Ejangiaq for her perseverance and commitment to continuing her education.</seg>
<seg id="215">Our young people face many difficulties and challenges in completing their Arctic College courses.</seg>
<seg id="216">I ask all members to join me in congratulating my achievements. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="217">Member for Pangnirtung, Ms. Nakasuk.</seg>
<seg id="218">Member’s Statement 102 - 1(5): Percy Mike’s Order of Canada Under 150 (Kattuk)</seg>
<seg id="219">Mr. Nakashuk: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="220">Good afternoon, colleagues, my relatives, and the people of Pangnirtung.</seg>
<seg id="221">I rise this afternoon to congratulate a constituent of mine from Pangnirtung who was recognized by Dennis Patterson.</seg>
<seg id="222">I would also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the 18 years of volunteer search and rescue service in Pangnirtung, Mr. Piusie Mike, who has been working for the search and rescue organization for 18 years. I am very proud of his accomplishment.</seg>
<seg id="223">The last name on my list is the Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Maine.</seg>
<seg id="224">Member’s Statement 103 – 5(1): Budget Address (McLean)</seg>
<seg id="225">Mr. Maine (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="226">I say  ⁇ good day ⁇  to the people watching the televised proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="227">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer some observations and recommendations on the government’s approach to fiscal management.</seg>
<seg id="228">Mr. Speaker, for those of us who are new to this House in the last couple of weeks, we have learned a lot from our experience.</seg>
<seg id="229">Mr. Speaker, as the Chair of the Regular Members’ Caucus of the Legislative Assembly, I would like to thank all of my colleagues for the opportunity to work together since the beginning of our new Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="230">Mr. Speaker, I’m very proud that we made a strong public statement on Friday that the Legislative Assembly will not simply rubber-stamp the government’s own procurement policies.</seg>
<seg id="231">Mr. Maine (interpretation): Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Iqaluit-Tasiluk made a very important motion on Friday, and this House will reconvene its spring sitting.</seg>
<seg id="232">Mr. Speaker, although we are a territorial government, this has not always been a functioning government.</seg>
<seg id="233">For example, as I indicated last week in my opening comments, when we were dealing with the college’s capital budget, the government listened to our concerns and even made some changes to the budget.</seg>
<seg id="234">I would love to see more of that happening in the weeks and years to come, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="235">Mr. Speaker, over the last few weeks, Members of the Legislative Assembly have asked a lot of questions on a daily basis.</seg>
<seg id="236">I think it’s pretty obvious that we need to do a lot more research on the government’s expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="237">It’s not enough if we just count out money.</seg>
<seg id="238">I seek unanimous consent to conclude my statement, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="239">The member is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statement. Are there any nays?</seg>
<seg id="240">Mrs Main, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="241">Mr. Maine: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="242">Mr. Speaker, I’m talking about measuring the results.</seg>
<seg id="243">Mr. Speaker, I believe that this information should be made public in this House so that we, as elected members, can make informed decisions, should any of our spending requirements be increased, should they be reduced, or should they be eliminated, and that we can do more with the limited resources that we have.</seg>
<seg id="244">Mr. Speaker, I will provide the following examples.</seg>
<seg id="245">I think we can all agree that one of the ways in which the government administers its Fuel Tax Rebate Program is to provide support to our hunters who are not getting enough support.</seg>
<seg id="246">The Department of Environment, which administers the government’s harvester support programs, needs to take a close look at its programs and how to improve the targeting of harvesters in order to support the price of fuel.</seg>
<seg id="247">Mr. Speaker, I will also provide another example of the government’s grants and contributions spending.</seg>
<seg id="248">As we know, the government has spent a significant amount of money on developing and promoting this program.</seg>
<seg id="249">We do know that the money that has been borrowed from the private sector is what it’s going to cost us.</seg>
<seg id="250">We know who has received the money.</seg>
<seg id="251">We don’t know what this money was really used for.</seg>
<seg id="252">We don’t know how many beneficiaries were hired from that fund and we don’t even know what the money was used for.</seg>
<seg id="253">Mr. Speaker, as you know, I could go on for a long time, but I will stop here.</seg>
<seg id="254">In addition, I would like to take a close look at the budget process of the Legislative Assembly and I would like to take this opportunity to work closely with all of my colleagues to strengthen our budget while supporting all of our communities and constituents.</seg>
<seg id="255">Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="256">Member’s Statement 104 – 5(1): Two More Elders Receiving Care (Tootoo)</seg>
<seg id="257">Mr. Towtongie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="258">I rise today to pay tribute to one of our most respected elders, Annie Tatty, who was flown to Ottawa.</seg>
<seg id="259">Also, one of our oldest residents, Amarok, as I stand here in the Legislative Assembly, was sent to Gjoa Haven because he was not an elder in Rankin Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="260">I want to be heard by the people of Rankin Inlet North and Chesterfield Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="261">When I was elected in November, I was looking at the budget for the Department of Health. My question was: where are the plans for implementing the elders facility in Rankin Inlet or here in Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="262">I was told by the Minister of Health and Social Services that every single one of us as Members of the Legislative Assembly is very concerned about our elders.</seg>
<seg id="263">At our meeting in Pond Inlet, this issue will be brought up properly.</seg>
<seg id="264">I am waiting for that.</seg>
<seg id="265">A few days ago I rose in the House and when we were dealing with capital estimates, I didn’t see it. It’s set aside for an elders’ facility.</seg>
<seg id="266">I was told that I shouldn’t talk about this because I have to stop.</seg>
<seg id="267">However, I was grateful to our chairman, Allan Rumbolt, for continuing to express my feelings towards the elders’ facility.</seg>
<seg id="268">Now I stand here as an elected representative and I do not agree.</seg>
<seg id="269">This practice of sending elderly people to southern Europe for whom they have not grown up is unacceptable.</seg>
<seg id="270">As Members of the Legislative Assembly, we want to be a good government and we have told our elders to respect them, and send them out of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="271">Member for Amittuq, Mr. Irniq.</seg>
<seg id="272">Member’s Statement 105 – 1(6): Recognition of Hall Beach and Igloolik Volunteers of Search and Rescue (Shewchuk)</seg>
<seg id="273">Mr. Ningark (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thought I was forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="274">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to once again express my pride in one of my fellow residents.</seg>
<seg id="275">The search and rescue teams work very hard to search and rescue whenever there is a search and rescue situation.</seg>
<seg id="276">It’s just for their own transportation.</seg>
<seg id="277">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the following individuals from my community of Hall Beach. The search and rescue committee is chaired by Kyle Issigaitok, Vice-President George Inukshuk, and they are: Martha Gibbons, Director of Search and Rescue in Hall Beach, and Daniel Qaunaq.</seg>
<seg id="278">As well, one of our elders, Abraham Ullalaaq, is an elder.</seg>
<seg id="279">I was the first one to say that he is the first one to go out for search and rescue. Here he is an elder and here I am younger.</seg>
<seg id="280">We have to provide more support to our youth, as our elders keep stating the truth.</seg>
<seg id="281">Instead of believing that the future is created, the future is created.</seg>
<seg id="282">Now I am on this side of the House, and I am always disappointed, but it is only if I have listened again.</seg>
<seg id="283">That’s not how you do it to the young people. When you go out, please be prepared.</seg>
<seg id="284">Mr. Speaker, I would also like to recognize the community of Igloolik’s search and rescue team who held a meeting this week in Hall Beach.</seg>
<seg id="285">With that, Mr. Speaker, if you’re going to go anywhere, please use your SPOT devices. (interpretation ends) Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation) I would like to ask you where I can go.</seg>
<seg id="286">Things like that.</seg>
<seg id="287">The reason why I rise today is to reiterate that the search and rescue organizations have one skidoo, but we have been requesting that they go to the Department of Community and Government Services and they have never received a response.</seg>
<seg id="288">I would like the search and rescue organizations to be assisted more.</seg>
<seg id="289">That’s it.</seg>
<seg id="290">The next name on the list, Member for South Baffin, Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="291">Member’s Statement 106 – 1(5): Cape Dorset Athletes (Joanasie)</seg>
<seg id="292">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="293">They are listening to some very good news from the Cape Dorset high school, Sam Pudlat School, which is going to be utilized, and there is going to be an individual who will be welcomed into the music industry or the arts and crafts program.</seg>
<seg id="294">I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Royal Canadian Museum of Civilization, as well as the contributions of the Hamlet of Cape Dorset.</seg>
<seg id="295">Nothing.</seg>
<seg id="296">Member for Quttiktuq, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="297">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="298">I would like to recognize four individuals who are here in the Gallery.</seg>
<seg id="299">First of all, I would like to recognize the Director of Parks Canada, Gina Byrne, and her employee, who always takes care of me and my children, my wife, Carol Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="300">I would also like to thank this individual from the High Arctic who was able to be brought to the Gallery. We are very grateful that my sister, Naomi Kuugaaruk, is here.</seg>
<seg id="301">I would also like to recognize our daughter who is here for school. She is our daughter and she is always there for our daughter. I am very proud of her. Please welcome Jonathan Natanine.</seg>
<seg id="302">I want to provide some background on this matter.</seg>
<seg id="303">When I was a child, I was still a baby...</seg>
<seg id="304">... the very first time I ever had a proper swimming pool in a lake.</seg>
<seg id="305">I don’t think too many Inuit harvested their first seal in the lake since we were in the sand on the Belcher Islands.</seg>
<seg id="306">She was very supportive and she was my mother’s father.</seg>
<seg id="307">I would like to thank them for being able to come here.</seg>
<seg id="308">Mr. Uttak and your wife, welcome to your Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="309">Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="310">Mr. Towtongie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="311">Although my parents are now called Ukkusiksalik Park, I would like to thank you all for providing us with pictures and we are very grateful to our eldest child.</seg>
<seg id="312">Also, I used to stay in Igloolik and when I was there, Theresa Uttak gave me a cup of tea, and Louis Uttak, I thank you for having a good food. I will be going back to your house again.</seg>
<seg id="313">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="314">Welcome to the Gallery.</seg>
<seg id="315">Member for Kugluktuk, Ms. Kamingoak.</seg>
<seg id="316">Mr. Puqiqnak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="317">I would like to recognize Naomie Kootoogook and Carol Akeeagok, they are my family.</seg>
<seg id="318">Naomi is from Grise Fiord. I don’t have relatives every day.</seg>
<seg id="319">Please feel welcome to your Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="320">Member for Pangnirtung, Ms. Nakasuk.</seg>
<seg id="321">Mr. Nakasuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would like to recognize and congratulate my husband, Andrew Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="322">Please welcome him.</seg>
<seg id="323">Mr. Nakashuk, welcome to our Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="324">Recognition of Visitors in the Gallery. I have no more names on my list.</seg>
<seg id="325">We will move on in our orders of the day.</seg>
<seg id="326">We will start with the Hon. Member for Iqaluit-Tasiluk, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="327">Question 123 – 2(1): Private Securities Bill (Hickes)</seg>
<seg id="328">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="329">My questions are for the Minister of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="330">I would like to take this opportunity to invite my colleagues in the House over the last couple of weeks to join me in wishing them all the best in their professional development and to provide them with the same level of training.</seg>
<seg id="331">I would like to ask the minister if he will be bringing forward legislation on this issue during the term of this government.</seg>
<seg id="332">Minister of Justice, Minister Peterson.</seg>
<seg id="333">Hon. Jeannie Ugyuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) I thank Mr. Hickes for the question.</seg>
<seg id="334">To date, the Government of Nunavut has no formal system of security.</seg>
<seg id="335">Mr. Speaker, as the minister is aware, the department is working with a number of companies to provide security services in our communities, such as health centres.</seg>
<seg id="336">We are in the process of reviewing the policy for the establishment of a Nunavut-based business monitoring centre.</seg>
<seg id="337">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="338">As the minister indicated, one of the last things that we’ve seen is that we don’t have a provincial-territorial-provincial-territorial Chamber of Commerce. We want to make sure that the private sector has the capacity to provide the services that they need.</seg>
<seg id="339">All the provinces and territories have passed legislation in regard to this issue.</seg>
<seg id="340">My next question is: once they’re doing their review, will there be a legislative proposal tabled in the House?</seg>
<seg id="341">Mr. Iqaqrialu.</seg>
<seg id="342">Hon. Jeannie Ugyuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Mr. Hickes, yes, we can work towards developing policies or regulations for the Private Sector Act.</seg>
<seg id="343">Your final supplementary, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="344">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="345">I thank the minister for his commitment.</seg>
<seg id="346">Mr. Speaker, at this point in time, I would just like to say that the Department of Justice is monitored by the RCMP and the law enforcement agency is working very closely with the Department of Community and Government Services in the direction of a contract. It should be a contract that the Government of Nunavut has contracted out.</seg>
<seg id="347">Hon. Jeannie Ugyuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Regulations or policies are prepared by the Department of Justice or other departments. When they draft the policies, our department tries to be involved from the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="348">I don’t have that information in front of me, but I will look into it and get back to the member.</seg>
<seg id="349">Question 124 – 5(1): Status of Site Remediation in Baker Lake (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="350">Mr. Mikkungwak: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="351">My questions are for the Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="352">So these are some of the questions that I asked the minister last week in regard to the clean-up of the contaminated site in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="353">In one of our responses to me, the minister indicated that the  ⁇ final report ⁇  would be prepared and presented to the Qulliq Energy Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="354">Will the minister commit to providing a copy of this report to both the Hamlet Council of Baker Lake and me as their MLA in the community?</seg>
<seg id="355">Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation, Minister Peterson.</seg>
<seg id="356">Hon. Jeannie Ugyuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Yes, Mr. Mikkungwak, I will commit to doing that.</seg>
<seg id="357">Your first supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="358">I thank the minister for that commitment.</seg>
<seg id="359">One of the things that the minister just stood up and said,  ⁇ Can we work with the Hamlet of Baker Lake to clean up this mess? ⁇  I would be happy to share that good news with the Hamlet of Baker Lake when I go back to the community next week. I look forward to more meetings with the Hamlet of Baker Lake and the Qulliq Energy Corporation officials.</seg>
<seg id="360">Mr. Speaker, it is possible that the Qulliq Energy Corporation’s warehouse is located in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="361">The minister indicated that the Qulliq Energy Corporation has already spent $1.68 million to date on the clean-up.</seg>
<seg id="362">I’m just wondering if he could clarify how much it would cost to clean up that site.</seg>
<seg id="363">Minister Peterson.</seg>
<seg id="364">Hon. Jeannie Ugyuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) The total cost of the clean-up would be approximately $10 million. That’s the kind of money that I mentioned in my Member’s Statement in terms of the damage that has occurred since the creation of Nunavut and the federal government is responsible for the clean-up.</seg>
<seg id="365">We’re more than willing to work with the Hamlet of Baker Lake in cleaning up the contaminated site.</seg>
<seg id="366">Your final supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="367">As I noted in my question last week, the federal and territorial governments haven’t finalized their rates yet.</seg>
<seg id="368">Mr. Speaker, I support the Qulliq Energy Corporation’s claim that damages occurred while the project was under federal jurisdiction.</seg>
<seg id="369">Will the Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation commit to working with the Minister of Justice to review and clarify the legal options that may be open to this issue?</seg>
<seg id="370">Hon. Jeannie Ugyuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Yes, as the Minister of Energy and the Minister of Justice, we will work together to resolve this issue.</seg>
<seg id="371">Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, Mr. Liechtenstein.</seg>
<seg id="372">Question 125 – 2(1): Student Suspension Policy (Thompson)</seg>
<seg id="373">My questions are for the Minister responsible for the Public Service Act.</seg>
<seg id="374">In previous years, the government’s most recent annual reports on the public service indicate how much of this funding was used to address the issue of school leave.</seg>
<seg id="375">Unfortunately, the 2016-17 annual report did not take into account these factors.</seg>
<seg id="376">Can the minister provide the House with that information?</seg>
<seg id="377">Minister of Finance, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="378">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="379">Every year, the annual report is tabled in the House and I’m sure that it will be tabled throughout the year.</seg>
<seg id="380">I’m sure that it will be there, but I can look into it.</seg>
<seg id="381">Your first supplementary, Mr Liberadzki.</seg>
<seg id="382">I would just like to ask the minister if he can also provide to the House how many employees took advantage of this program during the 2016-17 fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="383">Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="384">Speaker (interpretation): The question has been taken as notice.</seg>
<seg id="385">Member for Pangnirtung, Ms. Nakasuk.</seg>
<seg id="386">Question 126 – 2(1): Status of the old Pangnirtung Health Centre (Kattuk)</seg>
<seg id="387">Mr. Nakasuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="388">My questions today are for the Minister of Community and Government Services.</seg>
<seg id="389">I have asked the minister this question before. I think Pangnirtung is now the oldest health centre that has been in operation since the new health centre was opened.</seg>
<seg id="390">The old health centre is no longer being used for many years, but it has remained closed.</seg>
<seg id="391">My question is: what is the plan for the old health centre? Does the minister know what the status is of the old health centre?</seg>
<seg id="392">Minister of Community and Government Services, Minister Kusugak.</seg>
<seg id="393">Hon. Lorne Kusugak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="394">I thank my colleague for that question.</seg>
<seg id="395">When buildings that are no longer being used by the government are no longer being used by the department, the question arises as to whether they can be used by other government departments.</seg>
<seg id="396">The old health centre that was built in 1975 in Pangnirtung was used for that purpose as well.</seg>
<seg id="397">The Department of Health does not want to use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="398">We consulted with various organizations and we haven’t heard from any interested parties.</seg>
<seg id="399">Following the government routes, we are now making plans to see if they would like to be taken over by the hamlet. That’s where we’re at right now.</seg>
<seg id="400">If they don’t want it, then we would have to go back to the communities that don’t have income support.</seg>
<seg id="401">That’s where the process goes.</seg>
<seg id="402">That’s where we are at right now.</seg>
<seg id="403">Your first supplementary, Ms. Nakasuk.</seg>
<seg id="404">If I understood the question correctly, the community has now been asked if they would like to take on that responsibility. What is the status of that?</seg>
<seg id="405">Hon. Lorne Kusugak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="406">We have not heard from the government and we have not heard from them.</seg>
<seg id="407">At this time, we are in the process of doing a feasibility study to see if the hamlet would like to take on that responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="408">That’s where we are at right now.</seg>
<seg id="409">Your final supplementary, Ms. Nakasuk.</seg>
<seg id="410">I also thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="411">I don’t know if they want it or if the hamlet wants it, but if it doesn’t go ahead, what happens if the government buildings are no longer going to be used?</seg>
<seg id="412">I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="413">There are four main barriers that we face.</seg>
<seg id="414">As an example, when the former Pangnirtung Health Centre was no longer wanted by health professionals, we asked if it was in the interest of other government departments.</seg>
<seg id="415">They didn’t want it, so we will look to see if it’s a wish of the hamlet.</seg>
<seg id="416">That’s the process that we follow when we go through that process.</seg>
<seg id="417">Member for Aivilik, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="418">Question 127 – 1(5): Social Services Client Travel Policy (Netser)</seg>
<seg id="419">Mr. Netser (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I am the seal.</seg>
<seg id="420">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="421">I would like to start off today and I would like to say  ⁇ good afternoon ⁇  to them since I have been here since I have not gone through the afternoon, and I say  ⁇ good afternoon ⁇  to them.</seg>
<seg id="422">We are heading home very soon.</seg>
<seg id="423">Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that some of the most vulnerable people in Nunavut have to travel south to receive care and treatment while living away from their families.</seg>
<seg id="424">You agree with me that when you’re visiting a family, it changes a lot.</seg>
<seg id="425">The Department of Family Services’ Client Travel Policy is on the government’s website, which dates from June 2013 to March 31, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="426">It has come to my attention that the former Minister of Family Services has committed to making changes to the Family Abuse Intervention Act.</seg>
<seg id="427">Can the minister indicate if there have been any changes to the department’s client travel policy since 2013 and, if not, will there be any changes made after March 31 of this year?</seg>
<seg id="428">Minister of Family Services, Minister Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="429">Hon. Joe Savikataaq: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="430">Mr. Speaker, I don’t have time to discuss it with the minister in the first place but I can say that this policy will be in place until the end of March 2018 and it will remain in place until the new one is changed.</seg>
<seg id="431">I have not heard anything from the Department of Family Services officials to see if they are making any changes to the policy.</seg>
<seg id="432">We can look at it and see if there are any changes that need to be made, but we can’t make any changes.</seg>
<seg id="433">If there seems to be a change that is going to be beneficial to the clients and to the government then we can look into it.</seg>
<seg id="434">Your first supplementary, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="435">Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Speaker and thank you, Minister.</seg>
<seg id="436">The Department of Family Services’ new family travel policy states that an elder who is cared for by a social worker in a foster home can be visited by two family members or their chaperones on an annual basis.</seg>
<seg id="437">Can the minister indicate if this policy has been amended to allow two family members to visit twice a year?</seg>
<seg id="438">There are two return tickets available and two trips are available for one trip or two visits.</seg>
<seg id="439">Just to be clear, there are two return and two return tickets per year for each foster home.</seg>
<seg id="440">Your final supplementary, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="441">Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Will the minister commit to considering changes to the family travel program for adults in care.</seg>
<seg id="442">At the end of the day, we will have to review the policy, but at this time, I can’t commit to reviewing the policy as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="443">I’m sure that there will be a review done on the medical travel that is paid by the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="444">We will have to work with the Department of Health to make sure that the policies are followed, but at this time, I can’t commit to anything else because the Client Travel Policy will be expiring soon.</seg>
<seg id="445">Member for Netsilik, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="446">Question 128 – 1(5): Update on Correctional Facility (Qirngnuq)</seg>
<seg id="447">Mr. Qirngnuq: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="448">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Health.</seg>
<seg id="449">Mr. Speaker, from time to time, a number of my constituents have come to my constituency office to ask for help with medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="450">During the minister’s recent appearance before the standing committee, members were advised that Nunavummiut can contact the Office of Patient Relations if they have concerns.</seg>
<seg id="451">Mr. Speaker, the language and where you come from, is a conflict of interest.</seg>
<seg id="452">Can the minister provide an update on what steps are being taken to contact the Office of Patient Relations?</seg>
<seg id="453">Minister of Health, Ms. Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="454">Hon. Pat Angnakak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="455">I understand the concerns; we try to encourage people to call a toll-free number, so you can get an immediate response.</seg>
<seg id="456">I don’t have the information in front of me at this time. There’s also an email address, as well as a fax number.</seg>
<seg id="457">Your first supplementary, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="458">Mr. Qirngnuq: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation) I don’t know if he answered my question or not.</seg>
<seg id="459">Mr. Speaker, the Information and Privacy Commissioner has raised concerns with respect to privacy issues, and I understand that there is a need to ensure that such personal information is disclosed in a timely manner.</seg>
<seg id="460">The Ombudsman has a form in which he identifies complaints or concerns.</seg>
<seg id="461">But if you don’t have faxes you can’t send them out on your own, you don’t have all the computers to take pictures that are going to the computer, that are going to be sent electronically.</seg>
<seg id="462">Can the minister explain to me why the patient relations office should not be sent out very fast?</seg>
<seg id="463">An Hon. Member: Good question.</seg>
<seg id="464">Ms. Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="465">That’s a very good question.</seg>
<seg id="466">I think there’s a reason why there’s a decrease in the use of bandwidth across the territory. As a government, we’re seeing more and more usage of bandwidth across the territory.</seg>
<seg id="467">According to my substantiation sheet, the government has a website that can be found at www. Patient Relations.gov.nu.ca where all communities have health centres.</seg>
<seg id="468">If you want to send faxes, you can send them out and the government liaison officers have staff in every community.</seg>
<seg id="469">In their communities, faxes can be sent to our headquarters office.</seg>
<seg id="470">If the patient relations office didn’t have faxes, I would be more than happy to look into the matter.</seg>
<seg id="471">Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="472">Question 129 – 2(1): Income Support Policies (Tootoo)</seg>
<seg id="473">Mr. Towtongie: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="474">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="475">Mr. Speaker, I would like to follow up on some questions that were asked by the Member for Kugluktuk in regard to income support.</seg>
<seg id="476">The minister indicated that the Income Support Delivery System is part of a project selection process.</seg>
<seg id="477">Can the minister indicate how the search for a new position will be addressed in a clear and concise manner without a mandate?</seg>
<seg id="478">Minister of Family Services, Minister Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="479">With respect to his report on benefits and selection, I would think that if there is no need to hire a full-time indeterminate employee, it would be better to have a short-term or casual employee.</seg>
<seg id="480">If it was appropriate to look for an appropriate department to go in to do the work, then we would be able to do the work.</seg>
<seg id="481">Your first supplementary, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="482">This income support is a policy of the Nunavut Government and not a policy.</seg>
<seg id="483">If it’s a policy like the arts and crafts, we can’t make changes as Members of the Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="484">I have seen that when there is no job for the young person who is trying to work and wants someone to sign a job every month, and that’s what they’re doing on a monthly basis, how they’re going to work for the betterment of the young people and it’s very worrisome, even though the income support recipient admits that they don’t have anything to do with the job that they’re doing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Can the minister clearly describe what Nunavut’s actual policy is for outpost camps?</seg>
<seg id="486">Right now it only covers Nunavut and not the north.</seg>
<seg id="487">The NNI Policy applies to all of Nunavut, not just Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="488">It’s only used for outside of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="489">With respect to the review of the Income Support Program, there were changes made to the policy.</seg>
<seg id="490">At this time, there are still some funds available for income support and for children who are not considered eligible for income support and there was a review done on that.</seg>
<seg id="491">They signed the contract and I share their feelings on this matter.</seg>
<seg id="492">If you don’t have a job, then you can’t get a job. You have to make sure that there’s a proper selection process.</seg>
<seg id="493">Question 130 – 1 (1): Mine Training (McLean)</seg>
<seg id="494">Mr. Alakannuark (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="495">I rise today to direct my question to the Minister of Economic Development and Transportation.</seg>
<seg id="496">Mr. Speaker, I firmly believe that when mining companies are successful in creating jobs and caring for our environment, these benefits are realized.</seg>
<seg id="497">Perhaps my question today will be in regard to the construction of the schools.</seg>
<seg id="498">Last year, you tabled the 2017-18 main estimates for the Department of Economic Development and Transportation, which included $200,000 in funding for the Nunavut Mine Training Program.</seg>
<seg id="499">Can the minister provide an update on how much funding was spent to date during the 2017-18 fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="500">Mr. Speaker, I hope I was understandable.</seg>
<seg id="501">Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Ms. Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="502">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="503">I would also like to thank the member for his questions.</seg>
<seg id="504">What I can say on the Mine Training Program, it doesn’t have all the details on how it was spent.</seg>
<seg id="505">The department is working with Family Services, Nunavut Arctic College, the federal government, our mining industry, and Inuit organizations to develop a number of programs to prepare Nunavummiut for opportunities in the mining sector. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="506">Your first supplementary, Mr. Ningark.</seg>
<seg id="507">Mr. Nirlungayuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="508">I thank the minister for that answer.</seg>
<seg id="509">Will the Department of Finance be increasing the budget or reducing the budget for the upcoming 2018-19 fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="510">Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="511">I can’t respond to that question at this time, but I apologize if I can go back to the member’s question about the $200,000.</seg>
<seg id="512">The Kitikmeot Corporation’s Training and Development Program, $61,000 that was spent on this project, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association’s Literacy Fund, $60,000, and the Arviat Municipal Training Program, $78,000 for heavy equipment training.</seg>
<seg id="513">Thank you for clarifying that.</seg>
<seg id="514">As you will recall, last week, I tabled a copy of an article from the Geological Survey of Canada titled  ⁇ Ignico-Eagle Mines Ltd. ⁇  which I tabled in the House.</seg>
<seg id="515">They will be going out on the land near Hall Beach this spring.</seg>
<seg id="516">I wonder if the minister or his officials can work with the Department of Economic Development and Transportation to look at other opportunities for mining in the High Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="517">For that reason, Mr. Speaker, Hall Beach is a small community and they’re going to be getting a lot of money from the mining companies, so I would like to thank them for that.</seg>
<seg id="518">You also stated that you will be supporting the mining sector.</seg>
<seg id="519">What I’m trying to ask, Mr. Speaker, is I hope that these issues can be dealt with using the funds that you have identified, for example, the Mary River project.</seg>
<seg id="520">We’re talking about the Mary River project in the Baffin region. We’re talking about the Kivalliq gold project.</seg>
<seg id="521">Will these matters be dealt with effectively?</seg>
<seg id="522">For example, if I wanted to become an Inuk and I wanted to get a higher level position, how can I be taught? How can the Department of Economic Development and Transportation assist me?</seg>
<seg id="523">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also thank the member for raising a good question because ED ⁇ T isn’t responsible for that.</seg>
<seg id="524">The Department of Education has a mine training coordinator and I think it’s also important to recognize that mining activities are different and different, so these types of projects have to be taken into consideration.</seg>
<seg id="525">Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="526">Oral Questions.</seg>
<seg id="527">Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Maine.</seg>
<seg id="528">Question 131 – 5(1): Support for Medical Staff (McLean)</seg>
<seg id="529">Mr. Maine (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="530">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Health.</seg>
<seg id="531">First of all, I would like to say that my question is related to many communities, not just my community.</seg>
<seg id="532">I don’t know if that’s true or not throughout Nunavut, but our nurses and other health care professionals work within our health centres.</seg>
<seg id="533">Mr. Speaker, if they are aware of the lack of jobs in English, it is because they have too much work to do.</seg>
<seg id="534">Due to the lack of staff, there are not enough staff to fill the positions due to the lack of staff.</seg>
<seg id="535">I’m sure that it’s going to create a lot of hardship for the people of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="536">I hope I was understandable, as I am speaking in Inuktitut, if I was understood.</seg>
<seg id="537">Let me say it in English, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="538">My question for the minister: can the minister tell the House what actions his department is taking to provide additional support to health centre staff in communities where there is a high workload?</seg>
<seg id="539">Minister of Health, Ms. Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="540">I thank the member for that very important question.</seg>
<seg id="541">The issue of staffing the health centre is a very serious issue that we have been working very hard as a department to make sure that we don’t have a shortage of staff in the health centre.</seg>
<seg id="542">I hope that’s the case, but sometimes there’s a shortfall.</seg>
<seg id="543">I know for a fact that there is a tremendous amount of stress and strain on our nurses.</seg>
<seg id="544">Our department tries to do what it can.</seg>
<seg id="545">As we just recently did in the communities, when the nurses were exhausted, we sent out another nurse to support the nurses.</seg>
<seg id="546">The information that I have is that the nurse in charge would send the nurse out to the community in case there’s a need for a position.</seg>
<seg id="547">When a nurse does something, whether it’s vacation or sick, or a nurse that’s in that situation, we look at where that person can get help from in that particular community.</seg>
<seg id="548">What we’re trying to say is that we don’t want to see a dramatic decrease in the number of nurses working in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="549">Your first supplementary, Mr. Maine.</seg>
<seg id="550">Mr. Maine: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="551">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="552">I think we’re all concerned about the department’s staffing numbers. Using my two communities as an example, it’s evident that there are still too many vacancies in the health centres.</seg>
<seg id="553">There’s a vacancy rate of 70 percent, for Arviat it’s 44 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">I know that it’s a challenging issue and it’s a challenging one.</seg>
<seg id="555">I would now like to ask the minister if he can describe the challenges that his department faces in ensuring that there is an additional level of staffing at the community health centres when the workload is consistently high.</seg>
<seg id="556">Minister Aglukkaq.</seg>
<seg id="557">I don’t think we’re able to retain them within 30 months, but once they’re trained and they’re in their new positions, it’s very difficult for them to be a nurse in a community.</seg>
<seg id="558">One of the things that you have to look at as well, since it’s a community-based program, we have been working very hard to put that in place.</seg>
<seg id="559">Your final supplementary, Mr. Maine.</seg>
<seg id="560">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="561">Put another way, Mr. Speaker, we know that there are problems in the communities where they have a lot of work to do and there is always a shortage of health professionals.</seg>
<seg id="562">I would like to understand in detail what is actually happening with these problems in the communities, what is being done, what is being done, and what are the views of those problems in the communities?</seg>
<seg id="563">What steps are being taken to ensure that our nurses and other health care professionals are supported by the department?</seg>
<seg id="564">Hon. Pat Angnakak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="565">I just want to be clear. I don’t have anything in my briefing notes on the O ⁇ M side of things.</seg>
<seg id="566">For example, if we’re only on an emergency basis, they can’t make an appointment because of the volume of work that they have to do or if there are too many nurses that go out on the land, for whatever reason.</seg>
<seg id="567">Within the department, as I said earlier, we’re trying to fill all the positions, but it’s very difficult because we’re competing with other jurisdictions across Canada.</seg>
<seg id="568">That’s what we’re trying to do. I know that they work with people that have experience in the north, but not in the north, such as in northern Manitoba.</seg>
<seg id="569">I know that the Department of Health is very aware of the procedures that our nurses use.</seg>
<seg id="570">It’s not as easy as we can to help them out. It has to be done right away. If you have any ideas, please let me know.</seg>
<seg id="571">Question 132 – 5(1): Insurance Policy for Government Facilities (Hickes)</seg>
<seg id="572">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="573">My questions are for the Minister of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="574">As we all know, Mr. Speaker, in all Nunavut communities, there is a wide range of infrastructure, such as air terminal buildings, health centres, schools, and office buildings.</seg>
<seg id="575">My question to the minister is: when the insurance is in place, is the infrastructure separate or is it done on a case-by-case basis on a case-by-case basis?</seg>
<seg id="576">Minister of Finance, Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="577">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Our insurance covers a variety of different categories depending on the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="578">Each of our infrastructure has different policies and some of them don’t even have a policy. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="579">I saw on the news recently that some of our community’s schools were being burned down.</seg>
<seg id="580">Mr. Speaker, the Department of Finance is trying to come up with a solution that will ensure that the infrastructure is adequately insured. We have learned that the cost to operate the facility in Arctic Bay is $10 million.</seg>
<seg id="581">My question for the minister: can the minister tell the House what impact this will have on the Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission in the event of another school fire? (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="582">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Today, the insurance coverage has increased from $10 million to $20 million for schools that have been impacted by fires.</seg>
<seg id="583">We continue to urge the Department of Education and all of us to lobby the federal government to address these very costly and unfortunate incidents of arson.</seg>
<seg id="584">I think we need to continue to measure and show that we can continue to work on safety issues and that we’re doing a better job of promoting self-reliance by increasing our self-insured health benefits. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="585">I understand what the minister is saying, but I’m afraid that if you look at the municipal insurance program, it’s 50 percent of the cost.</seg>
<seg id="586">I asked a question.</seg>
<seg id="587">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Hopefully we will always have insurance.</seg>
<seg id="588">Mr. Speaker, the most recent tender for this project is $20 million for school fires.</seg>
<seg id="589">Our schools and other buildings have to pay $1 million on their own.</seg>
<seg id="590">There are different issues.</seg>
<seg id="591">I can’t say how many schools would have to be burned down because they’re no longer insured.</seg>
<seg id="592">Mr. Speaker, I hope that we don’t see a fire in our government. I thank all members for their support and encouragement as this is a school for our children, our children, and the public.</seg>
<seg id="593">Not just for the schools, but for the health centres because they are very important to our services.</seg>
<seg id="594">Any damage is a burden on our client and I would like to continue to encourage that type of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="595">So, Mr. Speaker, a reminder.</seg>
<seg id="596">This is a public building. It’s for all the students and the public. It’s for schools, health centres, and garages that are out there to serve the public.</seg>
<seg id="597">I applaud the member for raising that issue in the House. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="598">Question 133 – 1(5): Expansion of NTEP in Baker Lake (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="599">My questions are for the Minister responsible for Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="600">Mr. Speaker, as the member pointed out in his Member’s Statement, as the fifth Legislative Assembly of Nunavut, we have a new opportunity to bring Nunavut to a brighter future.</seg>
<seg id="601">My question for the minister: can the minister tell the House if he is open to reconsidering the idea of establishing a university in your community in partnership with the private sector and other stakeholders?</seg>
<seg id="602">Minister responsible for Nunavut Arctic College, Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="603">I thank the Member for Baker Lake for his question.</seg>
<seg id="604">At Nunavut Arctic College, we put out an advertisement to various universities outside of Nunavut to see how we can work together.</seg>
<seg id="605">We are aware that various organizations, such as Agnico-Eagle, have expressed interest in establishing a university dedicated to Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="606">We have wanted to move forward on this, but to date we have tried to come up with an agreement with some of the organizations outside of Nunavut that we would like to work with Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="607">I think it’s important that we continue to provide funding for the training and expansion of Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit into the Piqqusilirivvik program, such as the certification of students at the university.</seg>
<seg id="608">I feel that Baker Lake would be a great place to have that kind of expansion.</seg>
<seg id="609">Can the minister clarify whether or not she and her officials have consulted with the board of governors of the college to obtain a vision of how to increase opportunities for post-secondary education in Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="610">Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="611">We would like to see Nunavut Arctic College provide more opportunities for Nunavummiut to pursue post-secondary education in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="612">One of the things that you mentioned is the Piqqusilirivvik Cultural School. We’re looking at how we can expand the programs.</seg>
<seg id="613">Yes, the Arctic College Board of Governors will be involved along with my staff, the President of Nunavut Arctic College, and the Vice-President will be making plans to move this forward.</seg>
<seg id="614">Your final supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="615">Mr. Mikkungwak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="616">Will the minister commit to getting back to the House on this issue and report back to the House on his findings?</seg>
<seg id="617">Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="618">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thank Mr. Mikkungwak for the question.</seg>
<seg id="619">The option to build a university in Nunavut is in many respects a public interest.</seg>
<seg id="620">It says that Agnico Eagle has been able to raise $5 million for a new university if there is interest in building a new university in the region.</seg>
<seg id="621">I believe the discussions are ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="622">In the next four years, I don’t know if we’re going to be able to go through that process. We’re going to be doing a feasibility study to see if it’s going to work or not.</seg>
<seg id="623">Members will note that the time for question period has expired.</seg>
<seg id="624">Mr. Maine.</seg>
<seg id="625">Motion 015 – 2(1): Extension of Question Period (McLean)</seg>
<seg id="626">Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation) Pursuant to Rule 39(7), I move, seconded by the Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, that question period be extended. (interpretation ends) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="627">The motion is in order and is not debatable.</seg>
<seg id="628">All those in favour of the motion, raise your hand.</seg>
<seg id="629">Opposed?</seg>
<seg id="630">As a result, we have extended the allotted time for oral questions by 30 minutes, starting in half an hour.</seg>
<seg id="631">Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Maine.</seg>
<seg id="632">Question 134 - 1(5): Grants and Contributions (McLean)</seg>
<seg id="633">Mr. Maine (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="634">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Environment.</seg>
<seg id="635">I rise today to talk about the Department of Environment’s hunter support program.</seg>
<seg id="636">Looking at our government’s main estimates for 2017-18 these are three separate items.</seg>
<seg id="637">Let me speak in English so that I’m clear. (interpretation ends) There are three grants and contributions that the Department of Environment administers for disaster compensation, the Wildlife Damage Compensation Program, and the Fur Pricing Program.</seg>
<seg id="638">The department has allocated $150,000 for this year.</seg>
<seg id="639">Mr. Speaker, I would first like to ask if the minister can describe how the Department of Environment determines the effectiveness of its programs and services.</seg>
<seg id="640">Minister of Environment, Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="641">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="642">That’s three times a year and they have just had a competition at the beginning of March. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="643">Your first supplementary, Mr. Maine.</seg>
<seg id="644">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="645">Mr. Speaker, the information that has been provided to me in this House over the years is something that I would really like to see happen with the hunters as well.</seg>
<seg id="646">In 2011, the Department of Environment reported that sealskins sold under the Fur Pricing Program totalled $800,000.</seg>
<seg id="647">In 2012, it was $1.1 million and in 2013 it was $1.04 million.</seg>
<seg id="648">Mr. Speaker, can the minister provide me with an update on the Fur Pricing Program? I would like to know the latest results from this current fiscal year or the last fiscal year. I would like to know if there are any positive results from this program.</seg>
<seg id="649">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) I have a copy of what you read.</seg>
<seg id="650">I can’t say where they are at right now because I don’t have the current bids in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="651">I can tell you that after the Aqsarniit fashion show that same amount of sales are increased and I’m sure that’s going to be the case at that time when the auction for sealskins is going to be held again. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="652">Your final supplementary, Mr. Maine.</seg>
<seg id="653">I also thank the minister.</seg>
<seg id="654">That’s my final question, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="655">The Department of Environment should consider whether or not our hunters should be provided with more funding so that they can provide more assistance.</seg>
<seg id="656">We know exactly what’s happening in the fox trapping industry in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="657">I believe that the funding that is used for one year is insufficient, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="658">I think it’s too small.</seg>
<seg id="659">I would like to ask the minister if he agrees with me and if he can look into this further in the coming months.</seg>
<seg id="660">I agree with you and I look forward to coming to this House with your suggestions for increased funding.</seg>
<seg id="661">Question 135 – 2(1): Compensation for Damage to Hunters and Trappers (Keyootak)</seg>
<seg id="662">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Environment.</seg>
<seg id="663">Mr. Speaker, we all know that in Nunavut, hunters are severely damaged by polar bears, which cause damage to their cabins and equipment.</seg>
<seg id="664">Mr. Speaker, compensation is usually provided for damage, but it can be very difficult to replace equipment that has been damaged or destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="665">Has the funding for the Disaster Compensation Program been depleted this year?</seg>
<seg id="666">Minister of Environment, Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="667">I’m sorry I didn’t hear everything.</seg>
<seg id="668">Can he repeat his question?</seg>
<seg id="669">Speaker (interpretation): Your first supplementary, Mr. Keyootak.</seg>
<seg id="670">Our snowmobiles and cabins are damaged by polar bears, especially when we are out on the land.</seg>
<seg id="671">We know that there is compensation available for damages done while we are away from the communities.</seg>
<seg id="672">My question was: has the money for this year’s damaged equipment already been used?</seg>
<seg id="673">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you for clarifying that.</seg>
<seg id="674">Minister of Environment, Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="675">Your first supplementary, Mr. Keyootak.</seg>
<seg id="676">The minister said that he will get back to me once he gets that information.</seg>
<seg id="677">Can the minister indicate which communities in the Baffin, Kivalliq, and Kitikmeot regions have been using these funds?</seg>
<seg id="678">Yes, I will give it to the regions.</seg>
<seg id="679">Question 136 – 1(6): Child and Early Childhood Services (Hickes)</seg>
<seg id="680">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Education.</seg>
<seg id="681">The Minister of Education this afternoon announced that all licensed daycare facilities will be able to receive additional funding depending on where they are located.</seg>
<seg id="682">Is there a dollar figure as to how much money is going to be given to licensed child care facilities?</seg>
<seg id="683">Minister responsible for the Housing Corporation, Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="684">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="685">I thank Mr. Hickes for the question.</seg>
<seg id="686">The Department of Education, Executive and Intergovernmental Affairs, has ratified the ten-year collective agreement. The three-year agreement is divided into four phases.</seg>
<seg id="687">I’m just wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on what that is, the operations and maintenance, and the total is $1.1 million per year. That’s what it’s broken down by year.</seg>
<seg id="688">That's the numbers I have.</seg>
<seg id="689">I thank the minister for that explanation.</seg>
<seg id="690">Mr. Speaker, when I look at the Child Day Care Act for Nunavut, section 17 of the early childhood education program, it states that all staff who deal with children on a daily basis should receive appropriate training. This is expected to be one of my expectations.</seg>
<seg id="691">Mr. Speaker, I know that in the area of early childhood education that is offered through Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="692">What I’m trying to get at is: are they evaluated to see how well they’re doing in terms of training that’s identified as an incentive?</seg>
<seg id="693">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="694">Training is part of the agreement to be delivered over a three-year period.</seg>
<seg id="695">There’s $1.1 million that’s outside of that.</seg>
<seg id="696">We want to get more certified teachers that are able to teach early childhood education.</seg>
<seg id="697">That’s one of the things that we’re looking at trying to increase our capacity for on-the-job training and we expect that to happen in the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="698">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Minister.</seg>
<seg id="699">I look forward to receiving ongoing updates from the Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="700">When I look at the daycare workers and the training that they provide, I always hear that when the staff is being taught, it seems to be more effective.</seg>
<seg id="701">Mr. Speaker, I have heard concerns that there is not enough money for daycare workers.</seg>
<seg id="702">When it comes to providing the same level of education for our children as it applies to early childhood education, it’s very important that we maintain that level of education.</seg>
<seg id="703">This funding is to assist daycare workers to earn better wages so that they can continue to work in the facility without having to work there on a casual basis.</seg>
<seg id="704">Yes, I totally agree with Mr. Hickes and I completely understand and agree that we want children to be well prepared so that they can learn and succeed in life before they enter the school system.</seg>
<seg id="705">That’s what we’re trying to do and we’re trying to provide support to the daycare workers.</seg>
<seg id="706">As part of the contribution agreement, as long as the parents haven’t raised the cost of providing daycare services, I think we can do something to make sure that the staff at the daycare centre are getting the maximum amount that they need.</seg>
<seg id="707">At this time, what we’re doing is still trying to address the need for daycare spaces across the territory.</seg>
<seg id="708">Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Maine.</seg>
<seg id="709">Question 137 – 1(5): Inuit Employment Requirements for Government Contracts (McLean)</seg>
<seg id="710">Last Friday, March 16, I asked a question to the Minister of Community and Government Services concerning this issue.</seg>
<seg id="711">There are a lot of Inuit who are working within the government departments.</seg>
<seg id="712">On that issue, Mr. Speaker, the minister and I seem to agree that he supports increasing the number of Inuit working for the Government of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="713">This 20 percent is for capital projects such as the Baffin Correctional Centre and the breakwater in Iqaluit and Pond Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="714">If I understand correctly, Mr. Speaker, it’s between 20 percent and 15 percent.</seg>
<seg id="715">Can the minister explain how it would be possible to change the number of competitions to increase the number of applicants and whether the department has the authority to do that?</seg>
<seg id="716">Minister responsible for Community and Government Services, Minister Kusugak.</seg>
<seg id="717">I’m sure he understands that when they’re being worked on by the Department of Community and Government Services, they assist the department with the construction of these units.</seg>
<seg id="718">If it’s going to be a docking facility, it’s going to be the Department of Economic Development and Transportation. If we’re talking about a correctional facility, it’s going to be the Department of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="719">Those are the types of things that we work with our contractors to make sure that the contracts are being adhered to. We don’t administer that.</seg>
<seg id="720">We work with our client departments and we try to find out how many Inuit will be employed.</seg>
<seg id="721">We try to make sure that we don’t over-expend, but we work with the departments to make sure that we don’t over-expend.</seg>
<seg id="722">I can’t say at this time that after the tendering process has been completed, we can’t make any changes at this time, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="723">That’s my question.</seg>
<seg id="724">If that change is not possible, then there will be other programs that will be made available to the public.</seg>
<seg id="725">Can the Department of Community and Government Services take on that responsibility?</seg>
<seg id="726">I hope I was understandable, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="727">Can the minister tell me, perhaps if he could tell the House why employees from other communities, when they want to work at the major construction projects, can employees from other communities in Nunavut be given the same benefits as employees from outside of the territory that they are receiving?</seg>
<seg id="728">Hon. Lorne Kusugak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="729">I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="730">Mr. Speaker, the NNI Contracting Appeals Board evaluates the issues and sets out the Inuit employment criteria:</seg>
<seg id="731">The scope of work;</seg>
<seg id="732">Inuit are available to work according to their educational background;</seg>
<seg id="733">There are other local programs that can affect Inuit employment that are available.</seg>
<seg id="734">Mr. Speaker, we encourage contractors to be local hires from all regions of Nunavut before hiring from outside of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="735">We do encourage people to come to Nunavut to fill those positions.</seg>
<seg id="736">We encourage that.</seg>
<seg id="737">We work very closely with the client departments to make sure that they’re meeting their targets.</seg>
<seg id="738">Your first supplementary, Mr. Maine.</seg>
<seg id="739">Mr. Maine (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) I thank the minister for that response.</seg>
<seg id="740">I guess my final question to the minister is: will the minister commit to working with his department on these major projects?</seg>
<seg id="741">Will the minister commit to working with the service providers to ensure that jobs are created and that Inuit are able to apply for jobs in construction projects that are located outside of the territory?</seg>
<seg id="742">Will the minister commit to ensuring that this is also an option that will be taken into consideration to ensure that all Nunavut contractors have the opportunity to bid on contracts?</seg>
<seg id="743">Mr. Speaker, I am confident that the Government of Nunavut as a whole continues to encourage Nunavummiut to look for employment opportunities for our residents.</seg>
<seg id="744">That’s the way we have always been, and we will continue to do that.</seg>

<seg id="789">Moving on. Mr. Akeeagok, do you have witnesses that you would like to bring to the table?</seg>
<seg id="790">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Yes, Mr. Chairman, if I can, I would like to have my officials sit with me at the witness table.</seg>
<seg id="791">Chairman (interpretation): Does the committee agree to bring in the witnesses?</seg>
<seg id="792">Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the witnesses in.</seg>
<seg id="793">Mr. Akeeagok, for the record, please introduce your witnesses.</seg>
<seg id="794">To my left is my Assistant Deputy Minister, Dan Kaoson.</seg>
<seg id="795">I am pleased to appear before the Committee of the Whole to present Bill 2, Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, 2018-19.</seg>
<seg id="796">This bill makes supplementary appropriations for the Government of Nunavut to defray the operations and maintenance expenses of the Government of Nunavut for the fiscal year ending April 1, 2018 and June 30, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="797">Mr. Chairman, over the course of this year, the Minister of Finance has been here for the entire fiscal year, but we are currently sitting in the fifth Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="798">For that reason, for the 2018-19 fiscal year, we will be preparing the main estimates in May and June.</seg>
<seg id="799">To that end, Mr. Chairman, we are proposing an interim appropriation to allow the department to carry out its mandate of providing services to Nunavummiut in the coming months.</seg>
<seg id="800">The issue of attendance is the need to set aside funds for this year’s general election.</seg>
<seg id="801">Mr. Chairman, all of our departments and territorial corporations have had the opportunity to review these interim appropriations. Our calculations are based on departmental costs and cash flow over the past four years.</seg>
<seg id="802">We are satisfied that this amount will be sufficient to operate after the Legislative Assembly has completed its review and passed its annual budget.</seg>
<seg id="803">The major components of this legislation are:</seg>
<seg id="804">$8.62 million for the Office of the Legislative Assembly;</seg>
<seg id="805">$11.66 million to the Department of Community and Government Services;</seg>
<seg id="806">$29.08 million for the Department of Finance;</seg>
<seg id="807">$49.1 million for the Department of Family Services;</seg>
<seg id="808">$32.44 million for the Department of Justice;</seg>
<seg id="809">$10.77 million for the Department of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth;</seg>
<seg id="810">$64.1 million for the Department of Education;</seg>
<seg id="811">$85.77 million, Department of Health and Social Services for old office buildings;</seg>
<seg id="812">$8.32 million for the Department of Environment;</seg>
<seg id="813">$82.73 million for the Department of Community and Government Services for old office buildings;</seg>
<seg id="814">$23.29 million to the Department of Economic Development and Transportation for office space;</seg>
<seg id="815">$73.39 million to the Nunavut Housing Corporation; and</seg>
<seg id="816">$12.54 million, Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="817">Mr. Chairman, that concludes my opening comments.</seg>
<seg id="818">Mr. Chairman, I would be pleased to answer any questions or comments that members may have.</seg>
<seg id="819">Do members have any general comments?</seg>
<seg id="820">Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="821">Mr. Towtongie: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="822">I was reading the Inuktitut version. $32.44 million for the Department of Justice in Inuktitut, which is $32.44,000 for the Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="823">Is there a difference in the Inuktitut language of $8.62 million for the Office of the Legislative Assembly or is that for the Department of Justice?</seg>
<seg id="824">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Just for further clarification, the Office of the Legislative Assembly is requesting $8.62 million and the Department of Justice is seeking $32.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="825">I apologize if it’s not translated properly. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="826">In this case the English version is correct.</seg>
<seg id="827">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="828">It’s just a question in regard to the interim appropriations, not the percentages, but in terms of past expenditures and the allocation of resources to be voted on.</seg>
<seg id="829">I know there was a lot of debate over the budget, but the minister had indicated that if there is a need for real change, we want to ensure that the right departments are able to provide the services that they’re supposed to provide to Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="830">It doesn’t affect anything, Mr. Chairman. It’s a very important piece of legislation.</seg>
<seg id="831">So I’m just wondering: have there been any changes to the way that the money is allocated for additional funding in the upcoming fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="832">Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="833">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you for the question.</seg>
<seg id="834">So far, there have been no real changes to the operations and maintenance side of the project, but we expect to see the capital planning process in the fall. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="835">Are there any more general comments?</seg>
<seg id="836">I suggest to members that wherever possible you ask your detailed questions during the page-by-page review of the departmental estimates.</seg>
<seg id="837">If not, we will proceed with the clause-by-clause review.</seg>
<seg id="838">Go to Bill 2 in your white legislation binder.</seg>
<seg id="839">Bill 2, Interim Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="840">Chairman (interpretation): Clause 2. Do you agree?</seg>
<seg id="841">Chairman (interpretation): Go to Schedule on page 2, page 3, Inuktitut Schedule. Supplementary Amounts Appropriated for the Fiscal Year Ending April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="842">Vote 1: Operations and Maintenance. Total Operations and Maintenance. $491,804,000.</seg>
<seg id="843">Thank you, Mr Main, do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="844">Mr. Maine: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="845">I’m sure I should have brought this up earlier. I have a question for the department on grants and contributions.</seg>
<seg id="846">It is my understanding that the figures are based on a percentage of annual income, but there are some grants and contributions that are already expended and those that are for the whole fiscal year will be depleted as soon as April 1st.</seg>
<seg id="847">I just wanted to get a little bit more clarification on the grants and contributions. Is it the Nunavut Housing Corporation that provides the grants and contributions, or is it under the Nunavut Housing Corporation? How is that done when the funding isn’t for a full year?</seg>
<seg id="848">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="849">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): That’s a very good question.</seg>
<seg id="850">Under the appropriations, in the opening comments, it has been four years now, looking at some of the department’s first three months, grants and contributions, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="851">I can say that the Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation are one of the largest departments and you see in here that their grants and contributions are for operations and maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="852">If they have to go through an application, there are different ways of doing it, but in the last four years, all departments’ spending is done quarterly. The Department of Finance and the departments agree on how their grants and contributions are done.</seg>
<seg id="853">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="854">I guess my follow-up question to that is: can the minister indicate whether or not the normal operations of these types of projects have been put on hold or are they just going to go through the normal process?</seg>
<seg id="855">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Maine.</seg>
<seg id="856">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="857">Hopefully, tomorrow, we will be able to meet our obligations and look at the future budgets. We have been able to arrange for the Fifth Legislative Assembly and we have been instructed by the departments and the ministers, and that will be the same for the next three months. In May, we will be reviewing the programs again.</seg>
<seg id="858">Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="859">I’m sorry, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="860">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to welcome the minister and his officials.</seg>
<seg id="861">In the main estimates, $491,804,000 is on top of that.</seg>
<seg id="862">For example, in the bill, it states $8,623,000 and in the minister’s opening comments, it states $8.26 million.</seg>
<seg id="863">It’s not $3,000, but the total amount is $54,000.</seg>
<seg id="864">Why is that the case?</seg>
<seg id="865">That’s my question.</seg>
<seg id="866">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="867">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="868">The bill has three pages in Inuktitut. These are the main estimates that we’re going to be approving.</seg>
<seg id="869">That’s the actual number.</seg>
<seg id="870">As I stated earlier in my Member’s Statement, I was trying to lower the numbers and to keep them as close as possible to the main estimates. I have stated before that I don’t want to say all of the reductions; we have reduced the numbers by a number.</seg>
<seg id="871">The numbers that we’re looking at in the bill are accurate, and I don’t want to name them all.</seg>
<seg id="872">Total Centrally Administered Funds. $491,804,000. Do you agree?</seg>
<seg id="873">Clause 5. Do you agree?</seg>
<seg id="874">Chairman (interpretation): Do you agree to Bill 2 as a whole?</seg>
<seg id="875">Do members agree, pursuant to Rule 62(2), that Bill 2 can immediately be placed on the orders of the day for third reading?</seg>
<seg id="876">Minister Akeeagok, do you have any closing comments?</seg>
<seg id="877">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to thank my officials for preparing this for our government to be able to run this program until June.</seg>
<seg id="878">Thank you very much to all the Members of the Legislative Assembly for your support in approving this budget, and I will be looking forward to sitting in this House when we start dealing with the rest of the budget in May and June.</seg>
<seg id="879">Thank you all.</seg>
<seg id="880">That’s it for Bill 2.</seg>
<seg id="881">I would now like to ask the minister if he can proceed with his opening comments on Bill 3.</seg>
<seg id="882">Bill 03 – Supplementary Appropriation (Operations  ⁇  Maintenance) Act, No. 3, 2017-2018 – Consideration in Committee</seg>
<seg id="883">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="884">I will keep my officials at the witness table and I would like to inform the members that when we go to the other departments, I have additional staff that I would like to invite to the witness table, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="885">Mr. Chairman, can I begin with my opening comments?</seg>
<seg id="886">I am pleased to appear before you today to present Bill 3, Supplementary Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, No. 3, 2017-2018 – Legislative Assembly and Executive Council Act, which proposes to increase the government’s total budget by $56,602,000 for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="887">$49 million for the Department of Health to address over-expenditures in the areas of health, medical travel, mental health, treatment, elders’ long-term care, medical treatment, and TB testing;</seg>
<seg id="888">$6.2 million for the Department of Justice to cover the cost overrun of the RCMP, Corrections and Justice; and</seg>
<seg id="889">The $1.402 million deficit in the Department of Family Services comes from the Department of Family Services and the Department of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="890">Mr. Chairman, this concludes my opening comments. I would be pleased to answer any questions or comments that members may have.</seg>
<seg id="891">Do members have any general comments?</seg>
<seg id="892">Supplementary Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) 2017-18, No. 3, Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="893">Total Children and Family Services. $1,402,000.</seg>
<seg id="894">I just saw that number and I still don’t have that level of detail with me.</seg>
<seg id="895">Mr. Savikataaq, if you can respond to that question. (interpretation ends) Hon. Joe Savikataaq (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="896">Hon. David Savikataaq: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="897">I don’t have the breakdown of how many there are, but there are two main ones: we send more foster children out of the territory and the number of visits outside of the territory has increased.</seg>
<seg id="898">For example, there is an elder from Igloolik, which is from Gjoa Haven, who is in Ottawa, who has tickets to visit.</seg>
<seg id="899">Some of them don’t get any assistance from Family Services, but we do send some people out to visit them.</seg>
<seg id="900">The majority of our elders who are sent outside of Nunavut are not able to receive assistance in Nunavut. As I stated earlier, there are more and more elders visiting the communities.</seg>
<seg id="901">When you put together the Elders Program that the Department of Family Services had to take over from the Department of Health, I’m just wondering: in terms of the elders’ facility, is that still under the Department of Health and Social Services?</seg>
<seg id="902">Some of the minister’s comments are not really related to social services.</seg>
<seg id="903">Some of them are in the care of the Department of Health and Social Services, but if some of them want to visit, there is funding available through the Department of Family Services for medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="904">That’s one of the examples I used, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="905">I understand that there is a need to visit some of the children that are in care down south. The money is in the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="906">My question is, are there still elders in social services that are not transferred over to the Department of Health?</seg>
<seg id="907">Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="908">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) According to the information that I have, the information that I have is that the positions have been transferred to the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="909">They are not transferred to the Department of Health and Social Services and they are still administered by the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="910">I’m just wondering if there are any other programs under Family Services that haven’t been transferred over. Looking at the information and looking at our business plan, I think they’re all transferred over. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="911">I’m confused, but if the Minister of Family Services can clarify that for me, I would appreciate it.</seg>
<seg id="912">It’s up to Minister Akeeagok if he wants to redirect that question.</seg>
<seg id="913">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Let me try and explain it.</seg>
<seg id="914">I thought the question was: are there children still in the Department of Health and Social Services that need care?</seg>
<seg id="915">My response was that it’s in the Department of Health and Social Services right now, the Elders’ Programs that we have.</seg>
<seg id="916">They are still with the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="917">The supplementary appropriation is for the Department of Family Services to determine what they’re spending on. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="918">I thank the minister for that clarification.</seg>
<seg id="919">I understand it better now.</seg>
<seg id="920">Maybe I’ll rephrase my question to make it clearer.</seg>
<seg id="921">Does the Department of Family Services still care for elders? Does Family Services still have anything to do with elders?</seg>
<seg id="922">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) There are still programs available for seniors, but I would like the Minister of Family Services to clarify that.</seg>
<seg id="923">Mr. Speaker, I recognize that the government’s programs, such as the Senior Fuel Subsidy Program, the Senior Fuel Subsidy Program, and the Department of Family Services, I believe, are responsible for more than 60 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="924">If I’m missing something, Minister Savikataaq can help me answer the question. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="925">Thank you to both ministers for clarifying that.</seg>
<seg id="926">My last one.</seg>
<seg id="927">When they are sent outside of Nunavut, are they still eligible for income support?</seg>
<seg id="928">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Through you, I would like Minister Savikataaq to respond to that question. (interpretation ends) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="929">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="930">It varies depending on the situation.</seg>
<seg id="931">In some cases, people are eligible for income support, but I can’t say that all income support is the same.</seg>
<seg id="932">I have some detailed questions on this department.</seg>
<seg id="933">They have indicated that they’re going to be providing some funding from other departments.</seg>
<seg id="934">Given the current situation, are other branches of the department supporting all Nunavummiut?</seg>
<seg id="935">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="936">In addition, most of the money was transferred from the Department of Family Services to the Department of Health’s Income Support Program.</seg>
<seg id="937">So they don’t receive a whole lot of income support. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="938">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="939">When you’re giving contributions to different departments, how often do you identify when they’re going to be in a deficit situation and how do you deal with that deficit?</seg>
<seg id="940">I don’t know if this has an impact on our meeting, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="941">As a department, we do report on a monthly basis, and then we come to the end of the fiscal year, which is a little over budget, and then we try to re-profile the department’s budget. If we can’t do that, then we have to use a supplementary appropriation.</seg>
<seg id="942">We’re on page 4.</seg>
<seg id="943">Mr. Maine.</seg>
<seg id="944">The information that I have in front of me is that the number of children in care has continued to increase. As a result of the increase in the number of children in care since 189 years ago, we have 243 people.</seg>
<seg id="945">Do you foresee that the number of cases will be increasing at this time?</seg>
<seg id="946">What is the growing need for continuing care?</seg>
<seg id="947">Do you know what the reason for this increase is?</seg>
<seg id="948">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) The number of clients has increased since 2013. The number of clients has increased.</seg>
<seg id="949">I know that’s a trend that’s been going on for a number of years, so I’m just wondering if that’s something that’s going to be included in this year’s budget. I don’t want to get into this year’s supplementary appropriation because it’s going to be an accurate budget.</seg>
<seg id="950">I’m just wondering if that amount is going to be included in there.</seg>
<seg id="951">As we go through each page, it’s going to be obvious that we’re going to be talking about some of the changes that we’re going through. If we don’t keep up with the budget, then we go through the main estimates.</seg>
<seg id="952">There will be questions when we get to the main estimates. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="953">In the substantiation sheet that was provided to us, it says that the department has a surplus.</seg>
<seg id="954">At that time, the department announced some recent changes to the Income Support Program.</seg>
<seg id="955">I’m just wondering if the minister could indicate if any of the surplus that was left over from the administration, if the income support office was used up, or if the majority of the money was going to be given to the income support workers.</seg>
<seg id="956">Which increases are you referring to?</seg>
<seg id="957">I’m trying to understand where the surplus went, where was it spent?</seg>
<seg id="958">I’m just wondering if that’s something that they’re looking at: is that something that they’re looking at recouping, or is that just an increase to the income support amount that they’re looking at in terms of where those surpluses are going?</seg>
<seg id="959">Chairman: Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="960">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): There are a number of issues with the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="961">Some of these people were hired to work on the operational side of their responsibilities from a different department and some of these people started working on the job descriptions as well as how they work.</seg>
<seg id="962">Mr. Speaker, when the Income Support Program was revised, there was some funding for that as well, but the government’s response was that they would send people to residential care and different levels of care.</seg>
<seg id="963">There are a number of factors that play into how the Department of Family Services has met its budget shortfall for the current fiscal year. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="964">I'll be there.</seg>
<seg id="965">The news release states that  ⁇ This branch spends more than its budget on income support, ⁇  and I quote,  ⁇ making more money into the Income Support Program. ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="966">Will the money that is being proposed be for the staff or the income support office?</seg>
<seg id="967">I’ll have my colleague, Mr. Savikataaq, respond to that question in more detail.</seg>
<seg id="968">Mr. Savikataaq, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="969">The Income Support Program reform has a significant impact on the finances of the department.</seg>
<seg id="970">The National Child Benefit Supplement, for example, if a person is applying for a child tax benefit, their income is deducted from their income support.</seg>
<seg id="971">There was a claw back on income support. That will not be happening now. The income support clients will be receiving more money because the family income support is no longer clawed back from their income support.</seg>
<seg id="972">We are on Total Children and Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="973">Not previously authorized. $1,402,000.</seg>
<seg id="974">Justice. Operations and Maintenance. Not Previously Authorized.</seg>
<seg id="975">Total Justice. $2,600,000.</seg>
<seg id="976">Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="977">Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="978">Minister welcome.</seg>
<seg id="979">It says here,  ⁇ This is for the purchase of new drugs. ⁇  I’m wondering: in terms of the legislation that’s going to be changed by the Government of Canada this summer, is there a plan in place?</seg>
<seg id="980">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): For those of you, Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask the Deputy Minister of Justice to go to the witness table and if I may, I would like to defer that question to the Deputy Minister of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="981">Does the committee agree to bring in the witnesses?</seg>
<seg id="982">Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the witnesses out.</seg>
<seg id="983">For the record, Mr. Akeeagok, please introduce your witness.</seg>
<seg id="984">To my left is Deputy Minister of Justice Bill MacKay.</seg>
<seg id="985">If you don’t mind, can I respond to the question that was posed earlier?</seg>
<seg id="986">Mr. Chairman, that’s a very good question from the Minister of Justice in regard to the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="987">This does not apply to the substance.</seg>
<seg id="988">We don’t want to see any of the drug-related drugs coming into Nunavut because this is a new drug and we need to learn and implement the program.</seg>
<seg id="989">In December, at the Finance Ministers’ meeting, the funding that will be provided through the Non-Insured Health Benefits Program, 25 percent of the funding from the federal government will be directed to the RCMP to monitor drug use.</seg>
<seg id="990">There are two parts to that.</seg>
<seg id="991">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="992">Another question I have is in regard to the high cost of housing in the communities.</seg>
<seg id="993">I’m just wondering if the minister could explain why that’s in there.</seg>
<seg id="994">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="995">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) In relation to that, the RCMP received nine additional RCMP officers in different communities and as a result, they provided staff housing.</seg>
<seg id="996">When there’s an extra RCMP member, it’s on a government-wide contract basis. The extra cost was in the $300,000 budget. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="997">Mr Maine, did you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="998">Mr. Maine: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="999">In the minister’s opening comments, he talked about $2.6 million in the breakdown of the $300,000 for housing.</seg>
<seg id="1000">Would you be able to break it down a little bit more in detail?</seg>
<seg id="1001">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): I may be missing a number.</seg>
<seg id="1002">I’ll ask my officials.</seg>
<seg id="1003">Those are the numbers that the member is referring to.</seg>
<seg id="1004">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1005">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="1006">Why is it that these vehicles were not expected to be purchased?</seg>
<seg id="1007">I believe it was supposed to be in this budget, if I understood you correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Was that the reason why we needed to purchase new vehicles?</seg>
<seg id="1009">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. That is a good question.</seg>
<seg id="1010">That $1 million is for vehicle replacement.</seg>
<seg id="1011">Mr. Chairman, we have a contract with the RCMP to provide policing services in the community.</seg>
<seg id="1012">The minister indicated last year that they haven’t had any major changes to their vehicles due to lack of funding.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the past, they have tried to limit the number of vehicles that were damaged in the community, but this year, they purchased the vehicles that were most in need.</seg>
<seg id="1014">That’s why there’s a big jump in this year’s numbers.</seg>
<seg id="1015">It’s my understanding that they’re not buying as much as they should, but their assets are deteriorating and that’s how it is.</seg>
<seg id="1016">It’s in regard to the RCMP contract. We don’t want to buy each other because we don’t do that often.</seg>
<seg id="1017">However, when we talk with them about financial planning, they agree with each other and this seems to be the case where it has gone up.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Mr. Maine (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1019">I would like to thank the minister for responding to my colleague’s question.</seg>
<seg id="1020">These drugs, which are said to be new, are probably the most dangerous drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1021">Will the equipment for the study be made available to all the communities or will it be just some of the communities?</seg>
<seg id="1022">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Yes, all the RCMP officers will be receiving those vehicles in all the communities.</seg>
<seg id="1023">That’s the new system that we have for the enforcement officers and for the general public. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1024">In regard to the drugs and if they’re dangerous, if they’re starting to find loose tea in our communities, is that something that has been planned or if there are no found drugs in any of the communities? Has the RCMP been found to date?</seg>
<seg id="1025">The people who are coming into our communities are not very happy and I hope that they stop.</seg>
<seg id="1026">There have been a couple of communities that have been impacted and we’re going to be starting to see some of the things that are coming up from the Northwest Territories.</seg>
<seg id="1027">It’s a very dangerous situation and I’m very fearful of the people who will be applying for these substances.</seg>
<seg id="1028">If you ignore these events it's even more exciting but the outcome is risky and I'm glad the police are preparing for it.</seg>
<seg id="1029">Maine: I thought I was done.</seg>
<seg id="1030">That’s my last question.</seg>
<seg id="1031">In regard to the lack of housing in the communities, perhaps you can clarify that for the member.</seg>
<seg id="1032">In the document that we have provided, there are nine additional RCMP officers. There are nine in six communities in Nunavut that have been decentralized to different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1033">That was just a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1034">We will move on. Mr. Hickes, do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the $2.6 million that you are requesting, it talks about interpreter/translators going to court. Did you also require interpreters from the courts?</seg>
<seg id="1036">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) At this time, no, there are a number of additional interpreter/translator positions that we would like to hire. The importance of having trained interpreter/translators within the Department of Justice, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1037">I’ll just leave it at that. In the minister’s opening comments, he talks about the requirement to purchase new mobile phones and to keep the existing ones up to date.</seg>
<seg id="1038">I’m just wondering: in terms of knowing that we’re going to need new equipment to replace the existing telephones, are there going to be any money set aside for new equipment or are we going to be asking for additional funding once we know the numbers from the RCMP?</seg>
<seg id="1039">Yes, the planning is being done by the department with the funding that will be requested.</seg>
<seg id="1040">The Department of Finance’s business plan indicates that the Minister of Finance will be there as well for the Public Service, but the RCMP’s plan is that if the Tobacco Control Act is passed, as my colleague has mentioned, it’s for driver’s tests and so on, but there’s nothing in this budget to do with marijuana. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the minister’s opening comments, he talks about having full-time staff at the Baffin Correctional Centre. How many staff do you have at the Baffin Correctional Centre?</seg>
<seg id="1042">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1043">Did he say that there were eight?</seg>
<seg id="1044">Mr. Hickes (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to ask a question then. The information that I have on the overtime indicates that the Baffin Correctional Centre costs $180,000. Is that correct?</seg>
<seg id="1045">Can the minister clarify that for me?</seg>
<seg id="1046">Through you, Mr. Chairman, I would like to have my Deputy Minister, Mr. MacKay, respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1047">Mr. MacKay: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1048">The nurse in charge, we have a lot of other people working there. If there’s a weather problem, they have to stay there. If there’s a weather problem, then they’re added to the overtime.</seg>
<seg id="1049">When there’s a blizzard, they can’t go home, so I’m just wondering if the minister could give us an indication that there’s going to be more staff coming back to work. Does that mean there’s almost two staff working in a blizzard?</seg>
<seg id="1050">Mr Mar ⁇ n, could you clarify your question?</seg>
<seg id="1051">If it’s a blizzard, then they are sent right away and there’s only two crew members at that time because of the blizzard.</seg>
<seg id="1052">Mr President, Mrs Lepage.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Mr. Cloutier (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1054">My first question is for the Minister of Justice. The RCMP has identified that they will require housing for the next nine RCMP officers.</seg>
<seg id="1055">When you get a police officer, do they get housing separately?</seg>
<seg id="1056">I’m happy to say that one of my staff, just playing hockey with the broken arm of one of my staff, I’m sure it’s okay but I don’t know if my deputy minister can write to me.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You’re going to have to bring in a wheelchair.</seg>
<seg id="1058">My question is in regard to the nine RCMP officers that the federal government provides housing for.</seg>
<seg id="1059">As I indicated earlier, in different areas, we work very closely with the RCMP through our contracts.</seg>
<seg id="1060">I would like to clarify that 70 percent of the cost of the RCMP is paid by the Government of Nunavut and 30 percent is paid by the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="1061">The RCMP is provided with a contract through the federal government. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1062">Mr. Lichtstein: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1063">I’m just wondering if the RCMP is going to be providing housing to all the RCMP officers.</seg>
<seg id="1064">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1065">That’s why they operate in a unique environment and they don’t keep one RCMP officer out on the land.</seg>
<seg id="1066">They don’t expect to get their own housing in the communities on a regular basis, depending on how many RCMP officers they’re going to need.</seg>
<seg id="1067">Under that program, the RCMP has special operations.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When they identify that they need a new RCMP detachment, they try to include all 25 communities for housing. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1069">It’s unfortunate that the RCMP officers are not trying to become full members of the community.</seg>
<seg id="1070">When the RCMP gets their own home, what kind of assistance do they get?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Lausman.</seg>
<seg id="1072">I don’t think anyone here needs to ask a question like that.</seg>
<seg id="1073">I don’t think we should expect them to buy their own house and that’s why we provide them with housing.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Mr. Akeeagok, it’s up to you.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1076">Those are very good comments that you made, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Although the RCMP has been in the community for only three years, they have been involved in community-building activities.</seg>
<seg id="1078">If the RCMP wanted staff housing, they could apply to the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="1079">So it’s not ours. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1080">My last question in regard to the RCMP is: how many contracts do you have with the RCMP?</seg>
<seg id="1081">Detail of Expenditures. Page 5. Total Operations and Maintenance, to be Voted. $40,071,000.</seg>
<seg id="1082">If approved, it will be $42,671,000 for this contract. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1083">Thank you for that information.</seg>
<seg id="1084">I’ll go on to the third one. The Corrections Division provides overtime and casual staffing.</seg>
<seg id="1085">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Minister Peterson. (interpretation ends) Mr. Lichtstein, we’re finally in the Legislative Assembly. We’re not there yet. Can you wait a moment for your questions?</seg>
<seg id="1086">At this time we’re asking questions on law enforcement, are there any other questions on that page?</seg>
<seg id="1087"> ⁇ Ed. note: Yes, last minute to law enforcement.</seg>
<seg id="1088">In the minister’s letter, they also indicated that the total of the funding, I think it was $40 million, was going to be fully utilized by law enforcement, and it was estimated that it would have to be $42 million.</seg>
<seg id="1089">I’m just wondering how much of that $42 million is projected to be spent at the end of this fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="1090">I would like to ask the member if he could provide us with the numbers.</seg>
<seg id="1091">If he has the numbers, I would like to get some assistance. I sent the letter on Friday. I believe it was $30 million, but I would like to get some clarification.</seg>
<seg id="1092">A letter dated March 16, addressed to the Chairman of the Regular Members’ Caucus, the Minister of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="1093">My written question is on page 4 of 5 in total.</seg>
<seg id="1094">I would like to thank the member for his question. I see it in the document that we tabled.</seg>
<seg id="1095">That list of $30 million for this year so far has been $30 million, and the plan is $42 million.</seg>
<seg id="1096">They have given us information as to how they are going to be using that $2.6 million. That’s what we’re requesting.</seg>
<seg id="1097">I’m looking at $2.6 million for Program 1 for the Members of the Legislative Assembly in the substantiation sheet, it indicates that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police  ⁇ has been operating under low-grade GPS approaches and, on top of that, it says in the previous request.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Members note that the department is proposing to make some adjustments to the administration budget. However, given the unique nature of the operations, a $2.6 million increase is required to cover the costs of staff training, staff training, additional staffing, and facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1099">This $2.6 million is for compensation and benefits and casual wages. On the same page it talks about $2.6 million for compensation and benefits. It’s a little bit outdated now.</seg>
<seg id="1100">Can you clarify that, Mr. Chairman?</seg>
<seg id="1101">Mr. Akeeagok, if you would like to rephrase your question, it’s up to you.</seg>
<seg id="1102">If you look at the substantiation sheets, it states that there’s an increase of $2.6 million for correctional facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1103">There are two separate amounts, $2.6 million each.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It’s in regard to RCMP radios, housing requirements, vehicles, and other incidents related to emergency situations. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1105">Thank you, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="1106">If we’re talking about 2.6 million, how much is that, I don’t understand it, can we get that clarified, please?</seg>
<seg id="1107">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="1108">On page 5 of our document, we’re dealing with law enforcement, $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1109">Also, there’s $2.6 million in total. That’s not what we’re dealing with right now; it’s $2.6 million for law enforcement.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1111">Mr. Towtongie: Thank you for that clarification.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When I read the Inuktitut version, the English budget is the way it is, in the Inuktitut version, it looks like an estimate, an estimate in Inuktitut.</seg>
<seg id="1113">Can you explain exactly what you mean by the main estimates or the main estimates for 2017-18?</seg>
<seg id="1114">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1115">We’re still in the 2017-18 fiscal year and your main estimates are projected to go over that amount. That’s why we’re trying to get approval from the Legislative Assembly for supplementary appropriations for the Department of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1116">The total of $6.2 million, of which $2.6 million would be for the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="1117">That’s what we’re requesting from you and from the members. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1118">I was just confused because it sounds like in the Inuktitut translation there’s an estimate in there.</seg>
<seg id="1119">Although I understand my question a little bit now, I’m done.</seg>
<seg id="1120">We’re on Law Enforcement. $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Next we have the Total Registries and Court Services, $1 million.</seg>
<seg id="1122">Total Justice. Corrections. $2,600,000.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Mr. Clendenning: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1124">My question is in regard to the Corrections Division; there’s an annual over-expenditure in that line item, if memory serves me correct, over-expenditures in the Corrections Division.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Is that correct?</seg>
<seg id="1126">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1127">The member is correct. The majority of that is for overtime as well as casual employees.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Mr. Liechtenstein: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1129">If I remember correctly, the correctional facilities have a 12-hour shift. Is that correct?</seg>
<seg id="1130">With the current facilities that we have, I think they’re filled to capacity and they’re filled to capacity, I’m just wondering if the department has given any thought to having a three to eight-hour shift at this point in time, that it would not be possible to do that.</seg>
<seg id="1131">Perhaps I’ll go through you, Mr. Deputy Minister, Mr. MacKay, to respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The member is correct, they work 12 hours a day.</seg>
<seg id="1133">It’s based on the number of hours that they’re going to be working from two hours to four hours, 42 hours a day, 40 hours a week, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1134">Under the agreement, the cost of overtime was reduced by $4 million and now it’s $2.49 million.</seg>
<seg id="1135">As a result, the Corrections Division’s deficit was $4.5 million to $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1136">We are moving forward now on the overtime pay and we will continue to do that.</seg>
<seg id="1137">As a reminder, please turn your cellphones off and put them on silent mode.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Mr. Liechtenstein: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of my constituents who go out on the land for very long hours, 42 hours a week.</seg>
<seg id="1140">Do employees work 50 or 60 hours a week?</seg>
<seg id="1141">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This is far too detailed, so we have to provide it to the House and we will provide it in writing.</seg>
<seg id="1143">Our deputy minister cannot respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1144">We don't have that information.</seg>
<seg id="1145">I don’t know how much information he needs to provide on the operation of the facility.</seg>
<seg id="1146">I would like to ask the following questions.</seg>
<seg id="1147">What kind of training are they given?</seg>
<seg id="1148">With your permission, I would like Deputy Minister MacKay to respond to that.</seg>
<seg id="1149">With that answer, I think I answered the member’s question. We’re looking at the training and education component of the supplementary appropriation that’s going to be used for correctional facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1150">We don’t provide the training at this time.</seg>
<seg id="1151">We do have a trainer on the contract and that’s one of the major reasons why it costs a lot of money to have the extra O ⁇ M costs associated with providing the training and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1152">We’re also looking at other ways of better planning within the budget to make sure that the staff at the correctional facilities and the court staff are better trained so that we don’t have to rely on contractors to do that.</seg>
<seg id="1153">Ms. Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="1154">I was curious to find out about the $2.6 million that was talked about in terms of staff training.</seg>
<seg id="1155">What training programs will be offered to employees and casual employees?</seg>
<seg id="1156">I believe that both the correctional system and the court system provide excellent training for casual employees, as well as staff.</seg>
<seg id="1157">They are hired on a casual basis, on a contract basis, but it’s a matter of a few weeks before they’re hired to do some of the training that’s going on in the correctional facilities, for example, if there’s a dispute or a dispute between the staff and the department on what they need to do.</seg>
<seg id="1158">I’m just wondering if the minister could comment on what types of programs are offered in the correctional facilities and if there are any questions that I don’t need to ask.</seg>
<seg id="1159">I don’t know if they have that level of detail, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="1160">With your permission, Deputy Minister MacKay has set up a high-level group. I’m not sure if you will allow him to do that.</seg>
<seg id="1161">Ms. MacKay.</seg>
<seg id="1162">I don’t have the numbers in front of me, but I can get back to the member on what kind of training is provided for inmates.</seg>
<seg id="1163">Depending on which of those low-risk inmates or inmates that are housed in the Iqaluit Correctional Centre, there are some pre-employment courses that are offered to inmates so that they can work in corrections facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1164">The Akausisarvik Mental Health Treatment Program also provides programming for each inmate based on inmates’ needs, addictions counselling, and anger management.</seg>
<seg id="1165">Even though they can’t leave the correctional centre, they are given training so that they can work after they have completed their high school education. As well, there are some pre-trades courses being offered at the correctional centre.</seg>
<seg id="1166">In Rankin Inlet they provide probation services.</seg>
<seg id="1167">There are different programs that we provide.</seg>
<seg id="1168">Mr. Nakashuk: I’m done.</seg>

<seg id="1173">Department of Health. Operations and Maintenance. Not Previously Authorized.</seg>
<seg id="1174">Mr. Akeeagok, would you like to make a comment?</seg>
<seg id="1175">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): That was not a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1176">If you don’t mind, we will move on to the next department. I would like to have my officials at the witness table respond to the questions. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1177">I was going to give you an opportunity, but at this time, it’s okay if you wish to do so.</seg>
<seg id="1178">Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the witnesses out.</seg>
<seg id="1179">Does the committee agree to bring in the witnesses?</seg>
<seg id="1180">Chairman (interpretation): Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the other witness out.</seg>
<seg id="1181">For the record, Mr. Akeeagok, please introduce your new witness.</seg>
<seg id="1182">He just walked in, to my left, Deputy Minister of Health, Colleen Inuujaq Stockley.</seg>
<seg id="1183">Not Previously Authorized. Total Directorate. $5.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Mr. Netser: My mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1185">I’ll be asking questions in regard to the medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1187">Are there any questions under Directorate.</seg>
<seg id="1188">I don’t have too many questions, but when we were talking about elders’ facilities in Nunavut, there were three facilities that were going to be funded by different departments.</seg>
<seg id="1189">A couple of days ago when I was asking questions about the feasibility study that was done in Igloolik and Gjoa Haven, they were looking at increasing the elders’ facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1190">At that time, the minister wasn’t aware of how many beds would be used for the study.</seg>
<seg id="1191">I’m just wondering if we could get an update as to what’s happening with the increased elder care facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1192">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you for that question.</seg>
<seg id="1193">This year, according to the preplanning, it’s at the bottom of the page. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Can the minister update the House today on the status of this preplanning study and indicate what the current status of this project is?</seg>
<seg id="1195">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Through you, Mr. Chairman, I would like the Deputy Minister of Health to respond because he is more familiar with the capital estimates.</seg>
<seg id="1196">The Department of Health had already planned capital projects for 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1197">The minister alluded to the possibility of increasing the shelter in Igloolik.</seg>
<seg id="1198">With that in mind, after the election, I’m sure the government will have new responsibilities and I’m just wondering if there are any options of increasing the capacity in Igloolik.</seg>
<seg id="1199">It has not gone far enough, but we expect that we will take further action once we know what the government’s mandate is.</seg>
<seg id="1200">In closing, when we’re talking about the use of government programs to identify gaps in our infrastructure, I would like to emphasize the department’s role in addressing issues that arise in the area of elder care.</seg>
<seg id="1201">I look forward to this progress being made in order to better utilize the existing facility and identify opportunities within the territory for new infrastructure that are currently on the waiting list.</seg>
<seg id="1202">It’s more of a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1203">I would like to follow up on my colleague’s questions in regard to the operation of elders’ homes.</seg>
<seg id="1204">I would be interested to know what the breakdown is of the $900,000.</seg>
<seg id="1205">How is it going to be divided among the communities?</seg>
<seg id="1206">The $900,000 is for the three regions and the entire $300,000 is for each of the three elders.</seg>
<seg id="1207">Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1208">What is the process that the department uses to inform the public if they’re going to be over-expended?</seg>
<seg id="1209">They have just established a new contract and that’s one of the things that they have done.</seg>
<seg id="1210">If there has to be an increase or decrease, the Department of Health and Social Services and the various organizations meet together.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Those are the types of discussions that we’re working on.</seg>
<seg id="1212">They are required to comply with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</seg>
<seg id="1213">It’s indicated in here that there are three new continuing care centres. There are a number of factors that indicate that there are more group homes and more aging facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1214">Going back to the funding, do you anticipate that over the next couple of years, the costs will continue to increase or is there going to be a cap on the operating costs?</seg>
<seg id="1215">At the beginning of the contract, three of them were handled by the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="1216">The Department of Health’s contract was finally awarded in April 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1217">The information that we provided to the department was not quite the same as what we had seen from Health and Social Services. We looked at it from a clinical perspective as to how many people are in care and who they are.</seg>
<seg id="1218">There were a number of recommendations that came out of the food bank.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When we looked at the contract, it was felt that the elders’ facilities weren’t able to provide what was needed.</seg>
<seg id="1220">We had a deficit of $855,000 last year, so we’re asking for $900,000 right now.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Correct me if I’m wrong, looking at the funding that is available for mental health patients across the territory.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Now, when we’re dealing with trauma, we have to deal with that.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Is there any talk about putting money aside for mental health treatment?</seg>
<seg id="1224">We’re here, we’re just talking about additional operations and maintenance costs because we’re not talking about actual costs.</seg>
<seg id="1225">I don’t think that’s appropriate in this House or in any other way.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Do you have another question, Ms. Towtongie?</seg>
<seg id="1227">Thank you for that clarification.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The mental health contract for 2017-18 is $16.7 million. I believe it’s $6.2 million. What is the status of that contract?</seg>
<seg id="1229">That’s my last question, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1230">Mr. Chairman, we are dealing with the $5.9 million that the member is asking about, which is included in the $43.1 million.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Detail of Expenditures. Total Capital Expenditures. $16 million and $10 million.</seg>
<seg id="1232">I would like to ask the deputy minister, Ms. Stockley, to explain in detail why there is an additional $10 million for this line item. If you can respond, please.</seg>
<seg id="1233">It’s very good to hear that the people of Nunavut are asking for help, but I think it’s good to have this information by calling your health centre or email.</seg>
<seg id="1234">That’s why there’s an increase in the number of people coming into the treatment centre.</seg>
<seg id="1235">I know that they have mental problems and they have addictions.</seg>
<seg id="1236">There are also costs outside of the Department of Health and Social Services, which is covered through the Department of Justice. There are court orders for treatment and there are also costs associated with that.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Before we proceed to the Directorate, we will take a five-minute break.</seg>
<seg id="1238">&amp;gt;&amp;gt;Committee recessed at 18:03 and resumed at 18:10</seg>
<seg id="1239">I would like to call the committee meeting back to order.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Total Health. $43,100,000.</seg>
<seg id="1241">On the issue of long-term care for our elders, you have identified that there is a growing need for dementia care.</seg>
<seg id="1242">I would think that that number would increase because we don’t have a palliative care facility in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1243">That’s what I’m interested in.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Are they looking at doing something to have this cancer screening centre in Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="1245">It’s part of the curriculum right now, but it’s not at the high school level.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Those are the kinds of things that are being worked on right now.</seg>
<seg id="1247">On the same page, for the long-term care outside of Nunavut, the last sentence there states,  ⁇ Expand the out-of-territory hospital costs to the Department of Health and Social Services. ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="1248">I was a little bit disappointed in the minister’s letter with the breakdown that his department didn’t include in that amount.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Does the department plan to spend all of their money in this area?</seg>
<seg id="1250">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On page 6, the first item is $5.9 million. Not Previously Authorized.</seg>
<seg id="1251">That’s why this year, we’re requesting $5.9 million for long-term care for elders. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1252">My question was more directed to the Department of Health and Social Services to cover off their deficit from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Perhaps through you if I make a mistake Deputy Minister Stockley can correct that.</seg>
<seg id="1254">I don’t think there was a question there, but I can respond by saying that the over-expenditures have not been removed from the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="1255">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you for clarifying that.</seg>
<seg id="1256">That’s what the money is not spent on within the department, so we’re carrying over the unspent money.</seg>
<seg id="1257">With the current deficit, we’re trying to balance that out. The remainder of the budget for the Department of Health is $49 million.</seg>
<seg id="1258">The document that I just sent today will be translated into English, it was sent on Friday, and it’s an appendix, there’s no numbers on the over-expenditure, if you look at what’s being planned.</seg>
<seg id="1259">That’s a very small amount when you look at the actual over-expenditures in this line item. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1260">I appreciate the fact that you refer to the Schedule on page 4, but what I was trying to get at was the fact that in the letter that we received from the minister on page 4 there is a breakdown of the various programs and funding.</seg>
<seg id="1261">Under Family Services, are they showing the surplus that they’re going to be able to use again?</seg>
<seg id="1262">I’m just wondering why the department hasn’t done that.</seg>
<seg id="1263">The Department of Health and Social Services, there was no indication that there was going to be a surplus.</seg>
<seg id="1264">On page 5, it indicates that the department requires $49 million in additional funding. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1265">The Department of Health doesn’t have regional responsibilities.</seg>
<seg id="1266">I’m aware that in the department’s main estimates, the department’s Nursing Recruitment and Retention Strategy, there has been a little over $1 million in surpluses in the past year.</seg>
<seg id="1267">My question for the minister: can the minister provide the House with a breakdown of all the programs that the Department of Health and Social Services has to cover any surpluses under its programs?</seg>
<seg id="1268">You’re asking for a lot of detailed information that may not be available at this time.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Minister Akoak...</seg>
<seg id="1270">...Mr. Akeeagok, please.</seg>
<seg id="1271">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for recognizing me.</seg>
<seg id="1272">We don’t have that level of detail.</seg>
<seg id="1273">We will be able to table it in the House at a later date. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1274">I’ll move on to the Elders’ Facility, Elders’ Facility Operations.</seg>
<seg id="1275">In the second bullet, it indicates that  ⁇ The current elders facilities are managed through a contract with non-profit, non-profit, Nunavut-based organizations.</seg>
<seg id="1276">I would just like to say that this is a very good program that is available to the public and to all Nunavut organizations.</seg>
<seg id="1277">I’m hoping that we can get as many contracts as we can.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Moving on to a different topic, on the next page, on a 24-hour elders’ care facility, it says,  ⁇ It’s a 24-hour, seven-day week for the Department of Health and Social Services to provide public housing in compliance with the Department of Health’s Public Health Act. ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="1279">We have to make sure that our elders are looked after according to the minimum standards.</seg>
<seg id="1280">My question for the minister: can the minister tell the House what criteria Health and Social Services has in ensuring that elders’ facilities meet the minimum criteria?</seg>
<seg id="1281">I responded to that question a little while ago.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Mr. Speaker, the department has entered into a new contract with a number of stakeholders, including an expansion of the Department of Health’s organizational structure to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="1283">I don’t know if the interpreter/translators and the Department of Health meet with each other to try and find out what’s going on.</seg>
<seg id="1284">Mr. Monteith.</seg>
<seg id="1285">Can you clarify if these elders’ facilities meet the minimum level of care required?</seg>
<seg id="1286">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1287">As it is a new contract, we have increased the amount of $900,000 to $5.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="1288">As indicated by the three institutions, they’re going to try and meet that need, but they’re not really up to par with the level of care that the elders require.</seg>
<seg id="1289">The minister indicated that they’re trying to keep up with that. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Mr. Netser: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1291">He’s got a sore throat so I’m quiet.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In regard to medical travel, they’re asking for $50 million and I’ve brought this up many times in the House about medical patients that don’t have a place to go, especially in my constituency, there’s somebody that goes down to Winnipeg and then they find out that they don’t have an appointment.</seg>
<seg id="1293">My question for the minister is: does the Department of Health have a list of all the medical travel patients that were sent down to Winnipeg that haven’t been made aware of their appointments, and if so, does the Department of Health have that list of all the costs that were incurred by those patients that had missed appointments, including travel, accommodation, as well as travel costs?</seg>
<seg id="1294">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1295">The Health Minister has committed to reviewing all of the patients and the patients that were missed or changed as a result of their appointments.</seg>
<seg id="1296">That’s one of the things that this government is looking at very seriously. It’s identified that we’re going to be trying to find out where people did wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1297">One of the things that our member has been asking about, and I’m sure he has seen it in the past, is that these are the types of things that we want to incorporate into the review.</seg>
<seg id="1298">I would like to thank the member for raising that issue and it’s something that we can look at collectively.</seg>
<seg id="1299">That will be part of the review process for patients that have gone to see a doctor without an appointment. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1300">Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation) Yes, I will look forward to the review report.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Just recently, on February 26, the federal government allocated a large sum of money to Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, I think it was $82 million, and $80 million was set aside for the TB testing program.</seg>
<seg id="1302">I wonder if the government or the Department of Health and Social Services has requested or if Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami can provide some funding to combat tuberculosis. Has the government discussed this matter with the federal government?</seg>
<seg id="1303">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1304">That’s a very good question.</seg>
<seg id="1305">At this time, the federal government’s announcement for the 2018-19 fiscal year will be included as part of the government’s Inuit Tuberculosis Program and it further states that Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami will be allocated a five-year contribution towards this program.</seg>
<seg id="1306">At this time, it states that the committee has an Inuit-owned committee, which includes the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="1307">At this time, the additional funding will be provided by the federal government and I, as the Minister of Finance, have yet to see the details.</seg>
<seg id="1308">I’m looking forward to seeing the details. If Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami is working closely with us, we will be working with the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="1309">That is the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1310">As the minister, we will be kept informed on the details of your question.</seg>
<seg id="1311">I would like to ask another question in regard to the concerns of medical patients.</seg>
<seg id="1312">It says here that it’s not under control; it’s an increase in interest and contract services.</seg>
<seg id="1313">I know it’s a $15 million deficit and I’m just wondering if the department has an understanding of why the costs have gone up.</seg>
<seg id="1314">5.6% is expected to increase year-on-year, but what are the main reasons for inflation?</seg>
<seg id="1315">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Through you, I would like my Deputy Minister, Mr. Stockley, to respond to that.</seg>
<seg id="1317">The medical travel and medivac travel are increasing every year.</seg>
<seg id="1318">The number of people going on medical travel is increasing too, so it’s a good thing that they’re diagnosed with early detection.</seg>
<seg id="1319">In regard to tuberculosis, this has been a very difficult issue. As well, in all of Canada, we have one of the highest rates of vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="1320">I’ll use an example.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Approximately 60 people had to be medevaced to the hospital in December.</seg>
<seg id="1322">Even though the number of medevacs is increasing every week, we’re constantly reviewing it, but at this time of year, in the springtime, there are a lot of people who have respiratory problems and they’re in a state of emergency.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Combined medical travel and medivacs have all resulted in a significant increase.</seg>
<seg id="1324">Mr. Chairman, I’m not going to go into detail on what the reasons are for the increase.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Can the minister update this House on what steps are being taken to address this issue?</seg>
<seg id="1326">My question is: are we on track or are we being left behind in terms of the number of people who are sick?</seg>
<seg id="1327">I’ll have Deputy Minister Stockley respond.</seg>
<seg id="1328">It’s unfortunate that in all of Canada, the Department of Health and Social Services, we have one of the highest overcrowded houses in Nunavut. Overcrowding is a contributing factor to the health and well-being of our residents, so we’re making progress on that.</seg>
<seg id="1329">We have added to the carry-overs of the Baffin Regional Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="1330">One of the things that we try to do is reduce the number of people that are on medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="1331">We are moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="1332">In other regions, for example, the telemedicine system is to be applied in three regions.</seg>
<seg id="1333">You will hear more and more as we seek to get operations  ⁇  maintenance funding.</seg>
<seg id="1334">I thank the minister for that answer.</seg>
<seg id="1335">I look forward to that when we’re dealing with the main estimates.</seg>
<seg id="1336">When we look at the over-expenditure in mental health, we’re talking about $10.5 million, but the other thing that I’m hearing is that it’s ongoing, but it’s very important.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Looking at the substantiation sheet, it doesn’t say what the cause of the $10.5 million increase is.</seg>
<seg id="1338">I’m just wondering: in your department, are you putting pressure on the department to increase the number of people with mental illnesses or what’s the reason for that?</seg>
<seg id="1339">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Both the assessment and the psychological assessments are done.</seg>
<seg id="1340">Fourthly, during the life of this Assembly, the Members of the Legislative Assembly who put their own lives on the line was declared a state of emergency for the government to take action.</seg>
<seg id="1341">So it’s something that we will continue to try and promote. We don’t have any training programs in place to be able to diagnose individuals at the local level.</seg>
<seg id="1342">It will continue to make changes to the way our constituents and Members of the Legislative Assembly continue to raise issues of concern to the public.</seg>
<seg id="1343">My final question is in regard to mental health and addictions workers, how many services do we provide for people who are in care outside of the territory for mental health and addictions?</seg>
<seg id="1344">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 64.</seg>
<seg id="1345">How does it feel to have 64 more people, or less? How does it change from the past?</seg>
<seg id="1346">I don’t have that information in front of me, but if the member would like that information, I would be more than happy to share it with him in the main estimates.</seg>
<seg id="1347">Moving on, with the Qikiqtarjuaq TB study, I’m sure all of us will agree that it’s very encouraging to hear.</seg>
<seg id="1348">As it says, the equipment and supplies, will that equipment be retained by the Department of Health or will it be used in other communities for testing, or will it be small, or will it remain in the community for this equipment?</seg>
<seg id="1349">Through you, I’ll have Deputy Minister Stockley respond to that.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Will the assets of the survey be acquired through a capital appropriation?</seg>
<seg id="1351">I’m lost.</seg>
<seg id="1352">I believe it’s under capital. I would like clarification on that.</seg>
<seg id="1353">I will, through you, have Deputy Minister Stockley respond to that.</seg>
<seg id="1354">The bulk of the assets were from the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="1355">The funding that we received from the federal government was for building ramps, for example, for office supplies, for beds, and so on. The Department of Health and Social Services is using the funding that we receive from the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Maine: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1357">My last question, probably the last one.</seg>
<seg id="1358">In regard to the Department of Health and Social Services staffing, it’s my understanding that you’re hiring agency nurses and contracted staff. My department has been very successful in reducing the number of agency nurses.</seg>
<seg id="1359">I would like to ask, this year the payments from previous years, how much has changed in terms of the money that has been paid out to them?</seg>
<seg id="1360">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1361">We’re instead using agency nurses and we’re trying to get more nurses in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1362">We’re using more agency nurses than we did last year.</seg>
<seg id="1363">That’s my last question.</seg>
<seg id="1364">If I get the $8.6 million, I would be very grateful.</seg>
<seg id="1365">Broken down by fiscal year, the 2017-18 full-time employee experienced a shortfall of $52.5 million, casual employees made an over-expenditure of $45.3 million, resulting in overtime expenditures of $15.7 million, and casual nurses in excess of $0.1 million, for a total increase of over $8.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1366">I have one question, though, to say a few words about the breakdown of what you have said, and I add to Mr Megahy’s question.</seg>
<seg id="1367">No, I don’t have all three details.</seg>
<seg id="1368">If there is a nurse in the community of Sanikiluaq who is on medical travel during the middle of the night, who is supposed to be on duty travel, I know that the employee has to be on overtime.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): All the nursing positions are over-expended.</seg>
<seg id="1370">I know the minister was answering questions today on what the department is doing to recruit nurses.</seg>
<seg id="1371">I’ll leave that alone for now.</seg>
<seg id="1372">I would just like to comment that when we’re looking at the budget for the Department of Health, there are physicians, doctors, contract nurses, mental health workers, medical travel, and those types of requests that are made every year.</seg>
<seg id="1373">The number for mental health and addictions has changed drastically from the previous year. I think it was $6.8 million last year.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Earlier in my Member’s Statement, I talked about the budgeting process and I don’t know what changes were made. I think the Minister of Finance indicated that they haven’t made any changes to it at this time, but I believe that we need to make some changes.</seg>
<seg id="1375">When you’re aware of budget overruns and so on, when we’re actually finalizing the budget for O ⁇ M, let’s come up with the amount that’s required and not add anything to it.</seg>
<seg id="1376">That’s just a comment, but I would like to hear from the minister in regard to his comment.</seg>
<seg id="1377">I think that’s exactly what we’re looking at as a result of the fact that the Members of the 5th Legislative Assembly are now considering these issues and we’ve had discussions with some of the departments, health, and justice, and they’ve been coming back and asking for supplementary appropriations.</seg>
<seg id="1378">We need to take action. I’m very happy that we’re talking about this in the main estimates and I’m working closely with my colleagues on this.</seg>
<seg id="1379">Some of it is related to health, but since I’ve been the Minister of Health, the Department of Health has been, and continues to be, very sensitive to health issues.</seg>
<seg id="1380">This is an area where we need to make sure that the budget process is correct, correct, and correct, and that’s what we’re trying to do, but without any changes to the budget process, we need to recognize that process.</seg>
<seg id="1381">That’s the only way we’re going to be able to change some of these things.</seg>
<seg id="1382">When one of our colleagues spoke during the Regular Members’ Caucus, they made a lot of observations.</seg>
<seg id="1383">I am also doing this because we have to be able to work closely together as Members of the Legislative Assembly, because we really need that.</seg>
<seg id="1384">For 2017-18, we’re facing some of the challenges that we’re facing. I look forward to working with the Premier and the Members of the Legislative Assembly to make sure that we’re not spending the resources that we’re supposed to have in our budget.</seg>
<seg id="1385">I just wanted to make that comment and thank you, Mr. Chairman, for giving me the opportunity to speak.</seg>
<seg id="1386">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1387">I appreciate the minister for recognizing that there needs to be improvement.</seg>
<seg id="1388">I just wanted to reiterate, as the minister indicated, that this legislation is regularly updated by the Members of this House with respect to overtime costs for nurses and other health care providers. There is a continual back and forth with supplementary appropriations for overtime and I have raised this issue in the House for the next three and a half years.</seg>
<seg id="1389">My question for the minister: can the minister tell the House how her department is working to ensure that the government’s positions are filled?</seg>
<seg id="1390">Mr. Speaker, if we were to fill the existing positions in the public service, I would suggest that we take a step back to evaluate the strengths of our public service, the strengths of our public service, and not just the challenges of keeping up with the demands of the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1391">When I talk about overtime, I’m going to want to know a little bit more about moving forward on where the priorities are and what the initiatives are so that we can look forward to what we can do.</seg>
<seg id="1392">That was just a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Mr. Mikkungwak, did you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1394">Mr. Mikkungwak: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1395">I just have one question in regard to mental health and addictions. The contract, on the fourth bullet, it says,  ⁇ To provide funding to the Department of Justice for the costs associated with medical travel, ⁇  does that include the $10.5 million?</seg>
<seg id="1396">I’ll make it brief. Yes, they are members.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Mr L ⁇ ttge, do you have another question?</seg>
<seg id="1398">This is going to be my final question to Mr. Main and Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="1399">For the last one, we’re dealing with a deficit of $8.6 million. Just to clarify, you’re budgeting $143 million to $151 million to $8.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1400">Total Operations and Maintenance. Not Previously Authorized.</seg>
<seg id="1401">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Yes, those are for compensation and benefits.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Mr. Clendenning: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1403">Is that $151 million 100 percent correct?</seg>
<seg id="1404">There’s a $25 million increase in compensation and benefits.</seg>
<seg id="1405">I don’t think any of the funds have ever been 100 percent spent.</seg>
<seg id="1406">As I stated earlier, we’re looking at casual employees and overtime. I think what we’re trying to do here is that the $8.6 million that we’re proposing in our main estimates is for compensation and benefits.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It’s not 100 percent accurate in our financial statements. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1408">When it’s finally there, there are a lot of things that have to be written down.</seg>
<seg id="1409">Moving on to the minister’s opening comments on page 4, the department’s proposed budget for medical travel is $63.8 million for the 2017-18 fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="1410">I’m just wondering why the money was set aside in the 2016-17 fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="1411">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’m just waiting for the 2016-17 fiscal year because I don’t have that information in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1413">Mr President, Mr Lafontaine, we are attempting to cover the period from 2016 to 2017, not later than 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1414">I’ll just keep that in mind. I’ll just leave it at 2016-17 for now.</seg>
<seg id="1415">I was asking about the funding for medical travel for last year. I would like to know what the department’s budget is for the 2018-19 fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="1416">For 2017-18 the minister does not anticipate that next year, Mr. Akeeagok may not have his figures, but Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) I think it will be early in May, they will be talking about the funds for 2018-19.</seg>
<seg id="1418">We are voting on the interim appropriation for fiscal year 2017-18. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Now, to go back to that, there are problems within the funding formula that the minister has provided, there are significant differences in the amount of money that they have budgeted each year before they’re revised, I would hope to be in a position in the next year to be able to make that request when the department’s O ⁇ M budget is tabled.</seg>
<seg id="1420">So I don’t want to see in this House an increase every year.</seg>
<seg id="1421">I would like to find out the details of that.</seg>
<seg id="1422">That’s just a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Chairman (interpretation): Mr. Qirngnuq, are you asking a question?</seg>
<seg id="1424">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1425">I would like to ask a question in regard to medical travel in English so that I’ll be clear on the third bullet. For medical evacuations, there has been an increase from last year.</seg>
<seg id="1426">With regard to medical travel, it has increased the number of people who have to go out of the community to receive medical services. The number of people who have to go to the health centre has increased and the number of expectant mothers has increased.</seg>
<seg id="1427">The number of people on medical travel is going up.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Mr. Mikkungwak, do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1429">I apologize, I thought you had your hand up.</seg>
<seg id="1430">We are on Health. Operations and Maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="1431">If you go down to the bottom of the page, the total department is $49 million.</seg>

<seg id="1442">Minister Akeeagok, do you have any closing comments?</seg>
<seg id="1443">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1444">With that, we will be able to make some changes to the budget.</seg>
<seg id="1445">Before we move on to the next bill, we would like to ask the members to waive the two-day notice requirement.</seg>
<seg id="1446">I thank him for the good work that he has done and will now rise to report progress.</seg>
<seg id="1447">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you. Did you want someone else to come in?</seg>
<seg id="1448">Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the minister and his officials out.</seg>
<seg id="1449">Moving on, Bill 4.</seg>

<seg id="1457">Are there any general comments to the minister’s opening comments?</seg>
<seg id="1458">This is the first time I have been involved in this process and I would like to know why we have to do this.</seg>
<seg id="1459">Can the Department of Community and Government Services not find its own capital funding for this project?</seg>
<seg id="1460">This is for accounting purposes. The interest earned has to be recorded so that we can make it more transparent.</seg>
<seg id="1461">At this point in time, there wouldn’t be any claims, but at the end of the day, there would be no claims. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>

<seg id="1520">As Speaker of this House and Chairman of the Order of Nunavut Advisory Council, I am very proud to take this opportunity to announce the recipients of this year’s Order of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1521">On January 1, 2010, the Order of Nunavut Act came into force.</seg>
<seg id="1522">The intent of this program is to recognize individuals who have provided much needed service to Nunavummiut and to our communities.</seg>
<seg id="1523">This award is the highest honour of the Government of Nunavut for all recipients of prizes, medals, and medals.</seg>
<seg id="1524">To date, 15 individuals have received the Order of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1525">These individuals have been recognized for their hard work and dedication in a variety of fields, including public service broadcasting, education, language advocacy, and various leadership roles, as well as for economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="1526">I am particularly honoured to have the opportunity to announce two recipients of the Order of Nunavut this year, Ms. Betty Brewster and Mr. Ludy Pudluk.</seg>
<seg id="1527">I am very pleased that we are able to be with Mr. Pudluk in this House.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Welcome, Mr. Palluq.</seg>
<seg id="1529">As you know, colleagues, Betty Brewster is a well-known interpreter for many years.</seg>
<seg id="1530">In 2016 she was also recognized for her work and dedication with the Inuit Uqausinginnik Taiguusiliuqtiit for language awards.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Mr. Palluq, who was a Member of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories from 1975 to 1995.</seg>
<seg id="1532">During his many years of service, Mr. Palluq represented the High Arctic communities and played a leading role in the creation of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1533">I am pleased to inform you that we will be working on the Accreditation Report, which we hope to have in place for Ms. Brewster and Mr. Pudluk in the spring of 2018 sitting of the House.</seg>
<seg id="1534">The investiture ceremony will be held here in the Legislative Assembly and will be broadcast across Nunavut on television.</seg>

<seg id="7">Rodney Hofstra-Brown, a native of Saudi Africa who moved to the United States, said in an audience here in Tampa Bay a few years ago that the country's foreign ministry gagged her in Lufthansa and watered down the human blood donor.</seg>
<seg id="8">She devoted over an hour at the Iqaluit cathedral to more than 100 people.</seg>
<seg id="9">But their information is not for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The whole squad right now is linked with what's happening tonight.</seg>
<seg id="11">If you're interested in the light (sleepy), please stand here (on the cathedral's desk), or you can get out.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's up to you," Horford-Brown said after a two-and-a-half hour performance.</seg>
<seg id="13">About 50 people attended.</seg>
<seg id="14">"I didn't fly thousands of miles to play.</seg>
<seg id="15">I didn't come here because I was going to be liked, and I didn't come here to be accepted by you ... Remember: Jesus died alive, he wanted us to leave the room with people."</seg>
<seg id="16">The turnout was higher among Inuit and children, youth and elders.</seg>

<seg id="27">The Guardian is asking attendees to submit their e-mail addresses through a registry and to comply with the Hollywood-born Instagram post.</seg>
<seg id="28">He was given some permits for the purchase of the Hollywood-Brown religious items.</seg>
<seg id="29">And then he unveiled Howard-Brown's next book, The King of the Planet, saying that he is talking about past practices of unfair commercial practices over the last 200 years.</seg>
<seg id="30">"This is a comment that's not popular in Crusius, that's exactly what it is," Mr. Gagnon said.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Giannulli then tweeted a video of the 18-minute long Howard Brown statue (Picture: Netflix)</seg>
<seg id="32">At the end of the video, Howard-Brown prayed that donations to the Church of God would be given to the spiritual services that his church has protected.</seg>
<seg id="33">"He loves a small gift," Howard-Brown said in the video.</seg>

<seg id="43">Mr. Speaker, the issue of providing assistance to a number of our communities is one that is desperately poor. More than half of Nunavut’s population is on income support, including food security and the lack of adequate housing.</seg>

<seg id="62">With the hour that has gone by, Mr. Howard-Brown is going to make a response.</seg>
<seg id="63">"It's going to be light on the ice," the priest says of more than 100 people, most of whom are Inuit, in different age groups.</seg>
<seg id="64">"If you don't want to, just go straight to the door with your talent."</seg>
<seg id="65">During the hour, Howard-Brown's voice gets louder and louder.</seg>
<seg id="66">He stopped for a few minutes on what was going to happen and he called me back and told me to do something, and he was laughing.</seg>
<seg id="67">"I know that I don't feel like I'm from Africa, so I do it because my parents would normally put me in the shoes, never take me out," she says with a laugh.</seg>
<seg id="68">"Moscow was the first author of the label (Stillard).</seg>

<seg id="70">And Adamie and Evi were the first A-list artists. ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="71">Howard-Brown became well known, largely because of it, making him laugh at meetings in which attendees would laugh.</seg>
<seg id="72">The grandson of brother-in-law came into the house at the age of two, who had laughed for 12 minutes after escaping, Hewlett-Packard says.</seg>
<seg id="73">Horvath-Brown has publicly criticised other Avonians who also hold the Pride of the world.</seg>
<seg id="74">He was referred to as a 'scientific guy' whose religious beliefs are becoming a laughing stock in the Qammaqs and things like that, but Mr. Howard-Brown has responded to those people who are not satisfied that he was just going out and terrified.</seg>
<seg id="75">Mr. Arreak, from Iqaluit, Mr. Evygotailak and as a singer who assisted him during the time, he laughed at members of his band.</seg>
<seg id="76">"This is not a funeral, why are people sad?" he said.</seg>
<seg id="77">Howard-Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="78">Arreak is laughing now.</seg>
<seg id="79">"We're fighters in Jesus and he's alive."</seg>
<seg id="80">Arreak is laughing loudly.</seg>
<seg id="81">"I like this guy," said Ms. Aariak, who has made her laugh a little bit more loudly.</seg>
<seg id="82">Howard-Brown is having a laugh with the rest of the band, which is a little bit of a laugh.</seg>
<seg id="83">"We are very happy.</seg>
<seg id="84">Happily you can get it in the water, from things like watermelons to the toothbrush. ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="85">Mr. Arreak’s laugh goes off all of a sudden and it costs a lot of money to build the roof.</seg>
<seg id="86"> ⁇ This is the real thing.</seg>
<seg id="87">No one will be arrested this evening."</seg>
<seg id="88">Mr. Arreak, in Nunatsiaq News, has stated that he doesn’t want to speak to the media, so he’s laughing again.</seg>
<seg id="89">Howard-Brown also spoke in plain language, saying that the word was understood in the native language of Obama's New  ⁇ ealand accent.</seg>

<seg id="95">Shocking moment a group of ex-girlfriends jumped out of her car after she failed to show up</seg>
<seg id="96">Before he touched the nerve in the audience, Howard-Brown had a couple of people complaining about the fact that they didn't leave.</seg>
<seg id="97">"So you're coming to Brathwaite?</seg>
<seg id="98">H.</seg>
<seg id="99">Hey ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="100">Are you out?" she said.</seg>
<seg id="101">Howard-Brown says to one man quietly as he leaves the church.</seg>
<seg id="102"> ⁇ Would they take a picture and then walk out on the phone? ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="103">You're the editor of a daily newspaper here?" he said.</seg>
<seg id="104">Attendees are laughing.</seg>
<seg id="105">"Why would I say hello if I adopted him and he came back ... find out who he is and why he's filming and why he's leaving," said one of his staff.</seg>
<seg id="106">After hitting the gym floor with a towel, Howard-Brown decided to take the two female chairs for the second time because they don't like their eye.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Have you been alive again?</seg>
<seg id="108">What are you, Jehovah Fitzsimmons? ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="109">Attendees are laughing.</seg>
<seg id="110">"I've never seen people sit across the border who can't change.</seg>

<seg id="116">Don't be kidding me.</seg>
<seg id="117">It is not a laughing matter.</seg>
<seg id="118">The whole north right now is connected to what's happening tonight."</seg>
<seg id="119">Action personnel in attendance are telling people not to take photos or record them.</seg>
<seg id="120">However, these guys filmed the whole event.</seg>
<seg id="121">Even people running around crying when Howard Brown touches them and they take pictures of them and they are very close.</seg>
<seg id="122">A photograph from the Ribeiro Church of Illinois on my website shows a number of people who appeared to have fallen out of the frying pan. The physical injuries that appear, the ice flares, the mouth shut, or are only on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="123">Lady Hewlett-Packard touched her hand on the floor as she was crying in the bottom of the table.</seg>
<seg id="124">In front of them, Howard-Brown and her team go out and it's going to have an impact on the lives of the couple.</seg>
<seg id="125">This event was originally meant for St. Jude's</seg>
<seg id="126">This event was originally slated to be here at St. Jude’s Anglican Church in Iqaluit, but it was changed.</seg>
<seg id="127">That change was prompted by the subpoena from Howard-Brown, Secretary of State for St. Joe's state.</seg>
<seg id="128">David Parsons, the Anglican bishop to the north, said he wasn't sure whether Howard-Brown would make his mission to St. Jude.</seg>
<seg id="129">If he had known about it, he said he would have stopped it because Howard-Brown is a very popular person.</seg>
<seg id="130">As a result, the local Anglican community did not meet the criteria for approval of the bishop's event, Parsons said.</seg>
<seg id="131">The Angolan Church's role is in the know-how of devotion, and in dealing with other parishioners, Parsons says.</seg>
<seg id="132">"But there is a good faith in each other, and it doesn't deal with things that wouldn't be right for religion and church people to go there."</seg>

<seg id="134">"I'm not here to do what the religious people want to do.</seg>

<seg id="1">With low turnout, Canada quietly launches new northern policy documents</seg>
<seg id="2">Lib Dems say this new policy brings "a huge change of direction"</seg>
<seg id="3">Many of the green berries grow from Cape Dorset to Rankin Inlet, Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="4">In announcing the federal election tomorrow, the Liberal government unveiled a long-awaited northern policy strategy.</seg>
<seg id="5">(Representational)</seg>
<seg id="6">By Jim Bell</seg>
<seg id="7">On the day before the National Campaign for Democracy began, the Liberal Government, in an unprecedented fashion, launched a long-awaited Northern and Northern Policy Strategy on September 10.</seg>
<seg id="8">This document, which establishes the first framework for this approach, replaces the former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s 2009 Northern Strategy and the Harper Government’s 2010 Speech from the Canadian Foreign Policy.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is set to guide federal policy in the north up to 2030 but there is no implementation plan or political direction for future action.</seg>
<seg id="10">In terms of the scope of work for the second phase, the terms of reference.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, this initiative stems from Carolyn Bennett, the Minister of Public-Private Affairs and Northern Development, who stated that this policy document showed a "significant change in direction for the federal government."</seg>
<seg id="12">The introduction of this policy is far from what was expected.</seg>
<seg id="13">This winter, Barnett said that the policy would be brought into effect in June.</seg>
<seg id="14">The CBC News reported earlier this month that a news release from Yellowknife in August was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Liberal Party's list of eight "Truth Hurts," along with the Tories, and ten (10) are "extraordinary."</seg>
<seg id="16">It covers a wide range of policy issues, including local and regional economic development, building infrastructure, aboriginal rights, environmental protection, national defence and foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="17">Myanmar's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, on December 20, 2016, when he announced his government's desire to set new policies, promised a "constructive engagement" with North African governments and indigenous groups.</seg>
<seg id="18">As a result, more than 25 aboriginal organizations, including the Government of Nunavut, the Northwest Territories, the Yukon, Manitoba, Quebec and Newfoundland, took part in the co-management process.</seg>
<seg id="19">"In developing a series of northern and northern policy measures, our partners helped us to understand and raise awareness of minority rights and approaches across a wide range of categories, responsibilities and citizenship rights across the Arctic," Mr Panetta said in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="20">As well, some partners have documented their practices, which have been reflected in separate policy documents.</seg>
<seg id="21">Some of the comments don't mention federal policy</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada, the Government of Nunavut, the Government of the Northwest Territories and the three territorial governments jointly made personal statements.</seg>
<seg id="23">There is a process.</seg>
<seg id="24">Any of these articles submitted by co-sponsors may not represent a federal policy.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is an indication that the federal government may run into problems that may require the approval of more than 31 partners.</seg>
<seg id="26">"When strategic documents are part of this process, they are very complex from the point of view of either the federal government or other partners," the transaction document stated.</seg>
<seg id="27">The filing also says the approval process was stressful.</seg>
<seg id="28"> ⁇ Our values, actions and objectives and interests come from a meeting of many minds and ideas.</seg>
<seg id="29">It means that they have to come to an agreement with the federal government and the aboriginal partners to get approval. ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="30">You can find a foundation for northern policies as I’m bringing it up here.</seg>
<seg id="31">8 goals</seg>
<seg id="32">Here are eight goals in the action plan, to demonstrate the federal government’s commitment.</seg>
<seg id="33"> ⁇  A strong, sustainable, diversified and sustainable local and regional economy.</seg>
<seg id="34"> ⁇ The northern and northern Indigenous peoples can continue to apply and are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="35"> ⁇ The North and the Arctic people are safe and secure.</seg>
<seg id="36"> ⁇  A stronger institutions where the differences from one country can be re-emerged.</seg>
<seg id="37"> ⁇  Acts based in the North play a meaningful role in creating new opportunities and opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="38"> ⁇  A knowledge and understanding direction of decision-making.</seg>
<seg id="39"> ⁇ The Canadian Arctic and the North’s energy is healthy and persistent.</seg>
<seg id="40"> ⁇  Establishment is a collaboration that helps to sustain and restore the faith of indigenous and non-Indigenous people.</seg>
<seg id="41">These goals begin with a series of "prioritities" that have been redefined.</seg>
<seg id="42">Ten fundamental principles</seg>
<seg id="43">To address these goals and objectives, the policy document outlines key principles under which it has been established to  ⁇ continue to guide the implementation of the program ⁇ :</seg>
<seg id="44"> ⁇  Decisions on the Northern Territory will be made through cooperation and northern participation, rights transparency, access and northern interests.</seg>
<seg id="45"> ⁇  The rights and positions of the federal, provincial, aboriginal and local governments will be respected.</seg>
<seg id="46"> ⁇  Development should be a process that can be used and respected, from a social, cultural, economic and environmental point of view.</seg>
<seg id="47"> ⁇  Meeting with Aboriginal people on an ongoing basis, using the results of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission as a starting point, would be a step in the right direction.</seg>
<seg id="48"> ⁇  Climate change is a real issue in this land. Activities will be undertaken by a broad range of stakeholders, including the impact on indigenous peoples, the sustainable use of land and wildlife for cultural, economic and food security.</seg>
<seg id="49"> ⁇  The Policy and Practice will identify inequalities and inequality, and implement measures such as gender-specific assessments (Gender-Body Essex) that will address the potential effects of different ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="50"> ⁇  This work is intended to reflect a range of principles such as rights, interests and circumstances of such people as Inuit, Northern Indians, and Métis.</seg>
<seg id="51"> ⁇  The Government of Canada recognizes that Inuit, First Nations and Métis are indigenous peoples of Canada, in a variety of ways, in exercising their right to self-determination at the community level, on a case-by-case basis, with the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="52"> ⁇  Work on building relationships based on rights, respect, relationships such as the needs, priorities and circumstances of each individual.</seg>
<seg id="53"> ⁇  All groups, from independent entities to universities and colleges, such as the non-profit sector, community groups and individual nationals, have a crucial role to play in building a stronger country's north.</seg>

<seg id="5">By Emma Dunker</seg>
<seg id="6">The Nunavut Conservative candidate stated that if the Conservative Government were to become the Government of Nunavut, it would eliminate the carbon tax because it  ⁇ subsidizes the cost of everything. ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="7">Leona Aglukkaq began her campaign in Nunavut by going around to the communities.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Nunavut MP began her campaign in Iqaluit by holding a special event on September 12 at the Frobisher Inn.</seg>
<seg id="9">After that he flew to Rankin Inlet the next day to Iqaluit, before returning for next week.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Speaker, the Nunatsiaq News did have an opportunity to talk to Ms. Aglukark while she was in Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="11">This carbon tax (cashon tax) "promotes the price of air transportation, goods, transport, hunting and private accommodation," says Aglukark's campaign poster.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ms. Aglukkaq also mentioned in the Nunatsiaq News that this tax has a negative impact on the daycare and the elders’ home upgrading program.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Every penny of production is affected by this pollution tax."</seg>
<seg id="14">Ms. Aglukkaq.</seg>
<seg id="15"> ⁇ The reason why we can’t pay the carbon tax is because we can’t afford it. ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="16">However, Mr. George Hickes, the Nunavut Minister of Finance, announced in May that through an agreement in Ottawa, electricity and aviation fuel products from Nunavut had been exempt from this tax.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Government of Nunavut also contributes half of the carbon tax to Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mr. Speaker, Ms. Aglukkaq’s campaign for Nunavut has four priorities: simplicity, housing, mental health, and job creation.</seg>
<seg id="19"> ⁇ How can we as a government and the private sector and the Nunavut Government work together to address the huge need for housing across the north? ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="20">The Housing Corporation’s priority for Ms. Aglukkaq is to develop options including housing support, elder’s housing and group housing.</seg>
<seg id="21">The federal and territorial governments should also consider promoting homeownership, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ms. Aglukkaq spoke of northern infrastructure and mental health training for Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="23">"We are a vast land with a rich coastline in the country and we are still left with the necessary marine resources in our land, so we have to think of big things like this from the North," he says.</seg>
<seg id="24"> ⁇ We need to address the housing, capacity building of Nunavummiut to deliver mental health services in order to support our communities. ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="25">When asked if she was going to continue lobbying the federal government for the Northern Food Mail Program, Ms. Aglukkaq said that the carbon tax has increased the cost of food by way of an increase in airfares.</seg>
<seg id="26">When asked if he would consider using this program, and if they didn't, what he would do other than the carbon tax, he said he would talk to the ANC's Arctic Council.</seg>
<seg id="27">He said that if Croatia became a government, the council would remain in existence.</seg>
<seg id="28"> ⁇ It is important to have people in the north who can tell the government how to improve the program.</seg>
<seg id="29">This isn't a bad project.</seg>
<seg id="30">Not everything is perfect in this world.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, there needs to be a subsidy for northern food. ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="32">Ms. Aglukark did not want to be specific in how to tell the north about the Nutrition North program, but said that there should be a subsidy program for food and that "no subsidy" would help.</seg>
<seg id="33">More recently, research published in the Canadian Health Association’s journal found that food insecurity in Nunavut through the Nutrition North Canada Program had been identified in the Canada Community Health Survey.</seg>
<seg id="34">Ms. Aglukkaq said that I had been working as the Minister of Environment on the issue of climate change and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, but she had not really stated how she would be working on it.</seg>
<seg id="35">He stated that he would be supporting the Kivalliq Transmission Line and the Grays Bay Road and the Kitikmeot Port Project.</seg>
<seg id="36"> ⁇ Would we be able to get rid of fuel in the very near future?</seg>
<seg id="37">No," he said.</seg>
<seg id="38">When Conservative leader Andrew Schneider came to Iqaluit last June, he suggested that Nunavut should develop a recycling program, saying,  ⁇ It is very popular ⁇  with the current Liberal Government.</seg>
<seg id="39">Mr. Speaker, Ms. Aglukark stated that she believes the policy has been developed to consult with the public on recycling development and that it is hard to tell at this time.</seg>
<seg id="40"> ⁇ The Nunavut Land Claims Agreement gives us information on how the private sector should be dealt with in the north. The Land Claims Agreement, in my opinion, is the most important part of the environmental strategy.</seg>
<seg id="41">It protects our land, protects our waters, protects our wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="42"> ⁇ There is already some work that needs to be done on how projects should be done.</seg>
<seg id="43">It has become a very important legal entity and we should be very proud of it.</seg>
<seg id="44">Also, any decision regarding the Arctic should come from the people of the North, not from Ottawa. ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="45">Ms. Aglukark left the capital on her way to Pond Inlet and Arctic Bay on September 19, her office said.</seg>
<seg id="46">He also plans to travel to Pangnirtung, Qikiqtarjuaq and Clyde River before travelling to the Keewatin and Kitikmeot.</seg>

<seg id="5">By Nunatsiaq News</seg>
<seg id="6">Nunavut’s Legislative Assembly will be looking very closely at the new Languages Commissioner, following the resignation of Helen Klengenberg.</seg>
<seg id="7">Klengenberg, who served as Nunavut’s Languages Commissioner at the beginning of June 2017, retired not long ago from the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="8">This Languages Commissioner is a senior official with the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut and reports to the Legislative Assembly, with the appointment of Mr. Klengenberg.</seg>
<seg id="9">This would be done through the Management and Services Board, which is the Standing Committee of the Legislative Assembly that is responsible for the Legislative Assembly’s administration activities. Speaker Simeon Mikkungwak made the announcement on September 17.</seg>
<seg id="10">"I believe that the Management and Services Board will begin the process of staffing this position in the short term and we will report back if necessary to the temporary vacancy," Mokgweet said.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Languages Commissioner’s role, under the terms of reference for the important Official Languages Act, is to monitor language rights in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="12">Klengenberg was appointed in 2017 after a lengthy search for almost a year, following the sudden resignation of Sandra Inutiq in June 2016.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Inutiq left his position a month after he presented his report on the Qikiqtani General Hospital that the hospital does not have a language policy and services for Inuktitut and French speakers.</seg>
<seg id="14">He also indicated that the Deputy Minister of Health had applied for a year’s worth of documents related to the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="15">Soon after, lawmakers began to issue subpoenas for the job three times before appointing Mr. Klengenberg.</seg>
<seg id="16">In 2017, the Languages Commissioner’s position for the fiscal year was $119,000 to $170,000 a year, with a northern allowance of $15,016 per year, 25 days of leave during the year and a variety of other benefits.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nunavut has a new polar bear management plan: Nunavut Wildlife Management Board (NWMB)</seg>
<seg id="2">"We're going to do what we can to make sure this happens before the polar bear season."</seg>
<seg id="3">Nunavut’s new polar bear management plan establishes a balance between the harvesting of male and female polar bears in all of Nunavut’s polar bear populations, said the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board.</seg>
<seg id="4">(Reporting by Jane George)</seg>
<seg id="5">By Jane George</seg>
<seg id="6">Cambridge Bay and the Government of Nunavut are in agreement with the new polar bear management plan.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was announced by the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board members at the Kitikmeot Wildlife Management Board’s public meeting in Cambridge Bay last week.</seg>
<seg id="8">The starting point for this new polar bear management plan is the balanced quota and the polar bear hunting of Nunavut polar bears. This is the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board’s chairperson, Mr. Don Shewchuk, made a statement to the delegates.</seg>
<seg id="9">The meeting in Cambridge Bay is the first of three regional wildlife boards to be held by Mr. Jason Akeeagok, the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board director.</seg>
<seg id="10">Akeagok said the polar bear management plan was a "massive project."</seg>
<seg id="11">"We're going to do everything we can to make this happen before it's bearable," he says.</seg>
<seg id="12">This plan has been under consideration for almost five years and it was announced that it would be coming up with a plan this past March at the Iqaluit Nunavut Wildlife Management Board meeting.</seg>
<seg id="13">The plan will cover the period up to 2029.</seg>
<seg id="14">This Arnakallak Nanook is a lake close to Arctic Bay when the four floors are watching.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the new polar bear management plan, the risk of harvesting a polar bear in three communities would be eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="16">(photo courtesy of Niore Iqalukjuak)</seg>
<seg id="17">In the circumpolar world there are 19 zones for polar bears, 12 of which are mostly in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="18">The polar bear quotas have been established by way of zone (e.g. male only) of the polar bears and the defence of polar bears is included in the year quotas that are set by the communities.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the new plan will not increase the total allowable harvest at this time, a new total allowable harvest may be considered once new data is received.</seg>
<seg id="20">According to the original plan, Nunavut communities were allowed to harvest only one female polar bear that was harvested through two male polar bear tags each year in the communities.</seg>
<seg id="21">Under the new management plan, it doesn’t matter whether the polar bear in Nunavut is male or female.</seg>
<seg id="22">Their names would be tagged in half.</seg>
<seg id="23">This new ratio of the total allowable harvest for polar bears to the community harvest also ensures that defence measures can be carried out if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="24">The increase in the polar bear population has been a major concern in Nunavut as a result of the deaths of two polar bears in the Kivalliq region last year. However, under the current management plan, a defence kill polar bear, and if it was a female, then two tags would be used.</seg>
<seg id="25">As a result there are some communities that have no more tags for defence of polar bears.</seg>
<seg id="26">This new plan will allow communities to better prevent polar bears from being harvested, Suzuki said in a Nunatsiaq News.</seg>
<seg id="27">But he previously stated that polar bears pose a danger to Inuit culture and way of life, because they damage cabins, birds’ spaces and seals.</seg>
<seg id="28">They attended the meeting in Cambridge Bay where they welcomed changes to the polar bear management plan.</seg>
<seg id="29">Members were pleased to note that the dog team was scheduled to have five more tags for grizzly bears.</seg>
<seg id="30">There was a large grizzly bear spotted and it was shot because it was too close to the small apartment here in Mount Pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="31">On the contrary, with regard to the new polar bear management plans they may have a different view.</seg>
<seg id="32">The future of polar bears is uncertain because of climate change. According to a 2018 study by the Standing Committee on the species at risk of extinction in Canada (COSEWIC), this committee, the species at risk of extinction in Canada (COSEWIC), conducted a further study on polar bears "with great concern."</seg>
<seg id="33">It means that polar bears are at risk of disappearing or being lost due to a combination of invasive species and specified risk factors.</seg>

<seg id="1">In Inuktitut the Qaliujaqatigiit - Development and Appeal</seg>
<seg id="2">The gift we give today to our children and future generations</seg>
<seg id="3">In Inuktitut, the Roman orthography writing system is used in all of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="4">Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami has stated that it is not going to replace the Roman orthography and the Inuit-owned regional syllabics and so on.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami has also stated that Inuit will not need to change their traditional writing system.</seg>
<seg id="6">Beyond Secrets by Meiji  ⁇ aman</seg>
<seg id="7">I was very pleased to hear that the Joint Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami has unanimously approved the new Inuktut spelling, the name in Inuktitut of Qaliujaq that was released as a result of the Taqqiq initiative.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Inuit Tapirisat of Canada means a  ⁇ greater partnership between Canada's peoples ⁇  and there are few practical examples of the power that our people have shared over time in connection with the preservation and survival of our language.</seg>
<seg id="9">To me that is a priority at this time.</seg>
<seg id="10">In June of 2011 when I was the President of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, we committed to undertaking a thoughtful renovation of our education program.</seg>
<seg id="11">We brought together a national effort to ensure that our children have the right to education, which is at risk in Inuktitut and English.</seg>
<seg id="12">Our recommendations include the possibility of creating a centralized system where all citizens can register.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Inuit of Canada have spent many years trying to reach our goal of a new era.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Inuinnaqtun Language Specialist in all the communities in the Inuit communities worked very hard to produce Inuktitut syllabics.</seg>
<seg id="15">This means that we will have one system whereby all people learn their own language can be used properly.</seg>
<seg id="16">The use of this new system for cheque-cashing fees will begin.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dragons will not replace the traditional Inuktitut spelling and will not change the community’s spelling system, as it is a tool that will allow participation in both documents to improve ordinary people's communication.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is our gift today to our children and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="19">I can now imagine that the ordinary people of Canada will be in a better position to communicate and work together on a set of benchmarks and teaching materials to get the best out of the crisis and to give our children a high school education that they can use in both languages to be able to speak and express themselves.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the world we face the challenge of our social system, the western way of life is corrosive to our social values, our family structures, and our language.</seg>
<seg id="21">But today we are here.</seg>
<seg id="22">Over the years we have had to look at our history in order to understand who we are today and what we are living with today.</seg>
<seg id="23">I believe now that we are getting into a two year old system are we going to have to keep looking back or are we going to be able to go in the future.</seg>
<seg id="24">The use of Inuktut in all areas of Canada’s public life makes me understand that we want to move forward as a single territory.</seg>
<seg id="25"> ⁇  Eight years ago when we began developing a national effort for Inuit education, we were able to pass on the word  ⁇ Inuktitut ⁇  to all Inuit in each language, regardless of where they came from in the different dialects.</seg>
<seg id="26">To me this gives me the opportunity to see these individuals in unity.</seg>
<seg id="27">Our language and our identity are preserved, and our language is healthy.</seg>
<seg id="28">I am hopeful that we will be able to use Inuktitut in all languages and orthography and continue to work together on the land claims as we strive to work together with our fellow Inuit.</seg>

<seg id="2"> ⁇ This is a lot of work ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="3">Students marched down the four corners of Iqaluit on September 27 to take part in a global climate change protest.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three of the lawmakers who are running for federal elections said they plan to end the territory's Tis Hazel fuel consumption by electric vehicles by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="5">(Photo by Dustin Paddack)</seg>
<seg id="6">By Dustin Paddack</seg>
<seg id="7">During this federal election, three major law firms announced that Nunavut’s use of diesel fuel will be stopped by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="8">Currently all 25 communities in Nunavut have electricity supplied by diesel generators operated by the Qulliq Energy Corporation, the only power plant in Canada that does not have a fixed power supply in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="9">Replacing this would be a huge and costly project.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This is a huge commitment," said Martha Leroy, the Arctic Recycling Energy Specialist for the Global Wildlife Fund (WWWF).</seg>
<seg id="11">"It's probably not easy, just a little bit of luck."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Green Party campaign promised to "implement the use of renewable energy sources' .</seg>
<seg id="13">By 2030, every country will have a renewable energy system.</seg>
<seg id="14">This bill also includes camps in northern communities such as Teheran Fuel to be decommissioned. ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="15">The Liberal Party said it would "future forward financially to ensure that the people's communities of Tis Hazel oil are decommissioned but have enough electricity to use clean, renewable energy sources like water, wind and solar power after 2030."</seg>
<seg id="16">What New Delhi's Patrikuri (NDP) said was "to target the country's ability to generate energy from non-renewable sources of energy after 2030 ... This is carbon-free power with a view to generating a community and job creation potential.</seg>
<seg id="17">We will support initiatives such as locally owned and operated clean energy projects to provide employment for residents and authorities, and work with Aboriginal and Northern communities in efforts to eliminate the use of diesel fuel. ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="18">According to the Department of Environment and Climate Change Canada’s report released earlier this year, greenhouse gas emissions in Nunavut are less than 1 percent of this increase.</seg>
<seg id="19">In 2017, Nunavut produced an average of 0.6 gigatonnes of greenhouse gas emissions (or carbon dioxide), of about 18,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time this year, Alberta, which is the country’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases, produced approximately 84 million vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although this is the case, Nunavut has seen an increase in greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent since 2005, the largest improvement in Canada and Alberta almost double, which is the second largest increase since the Great Recession.</seg>
<seg id="22">Even with the changes in the energy sector these three areas are proposing to the Legislative Assembly to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the impact of this project on Canada’s carbon footprint is still very small.</seg>
<seg id="23">What does the community have in this case.</seg>
<seg id="24">Nunavummiut pay for the largest share of electricity in any other part of the country, and funding for the power corporation would decrease this amount.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, actions in the area of renewable energy projects such as this might be a contradiction in terms to the expenditure that is currently being incurred in the field of energy.</seg>
<seg id="26">Last month, the World Wildlife Organization released a report which addressed the issue of how renewable energy sources could provide electricity in all 25 Nunavut communities.</seg>
<seg id="27">They found that a reduction of 8 percent was mainly due to the potential risks of the program or other sources of revenue ⁇ Baker Lake, Coral Harbour, Iqaluit and Rankin Inlet would save money by moving 20 percent from renewable energy, with a direct payment of about 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="28">The study also indicated that 16 other communities have a 4 percent subsidy which is close to the Qulliq Energy Corporation’s potential to borrow as much as $2 million in subsidies and a 20 percent incentive to move it.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the report only talks about how feasible these projects are, simply deciding to relocate renewable energy sources at a lower cost than current energy prices.</seg>
<seg id="30">But the transfer of community capacity building and the use of renewable energy sources would be a major undertaking.</seg>
<seg id="31">"There would be a lot of consultation, and they would have to start the year in order to achieve what the energy sector wants to achieve in every community," says Liener.</seg>
<seg id="32">"They have to go to the communities, work with them on what they want to do, and how the communities look at energy, see what their priorities are and the communities have the most important areas of travel and harvesting."</seg>
<seg id="33">This does not include the development of an integrated system for solar power or wind power, which will work over the next two years to compile, or programs for the Qulliq Energy Corporation to ensure that renewable energy sources are reliable.</seg>
<seg id="34">Mr. Speaker, moving 100 percent from one community to another in the area of renewable energy, that’s three areas that the cabinet has identified as essential, not only for long-term work but also for a significant amount of money.</seg>
<seg id="35">Meanwhile New Delhi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Liberal Party (BJP) have not announced how much money it would give to the MoD, the Green Party (BJP) said last week.</seg>
<seg id="36">As part of the campaign's spending report, the Green Party said it would invest $150 million over five years in mobile infrastructure for all rural and northern communities  ⁇ and ⁇  not just in the communities of Brazil to reduce fossil fuel use.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is not enough however.</seg>
<seg id="38">Mr. Levy pointed out that if a community like Arctic Bay were to move at least 60 percent of their power plant, they would have to operate at about $27.8 million.</seg>
<seg id="39">Under the same report, for the other communities where they’re trying to use 60 percent of their renewable energy, they would have to use a higher amount.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Iqaluit, the projected total cost is approximately $148 million.</seg>
<seg id="41">Although it is evident that it is a smaller amount than the 250 and 500 million dollars that was originally thought for power in the city, this would apply to one of the communities that the Green Party is proposing to help.</seg>
<seg id="42">We don’t expect the federal government as a whole to pay for these projects, but they also said that there are projects and how they are going to be done and it’s going to be difficult in the long run.</seg>
<seg id="43">Looking at the 2030 deadline, it’s not going to take too much time.</seg>
<seg id="44"> ⁇ In terms of hydro, I think it’s a two to five year project.</seg>
<seg id="45">For wind energy, we would think that in five to seven years it would be a project," said Leighton when asked about the amount of energy they would be working on.</seg>
<seg id="46">When you look at the deadlines, you divide them up to 25 communities, and if you’re going to do it at the same time in different communities, and the land is not always available.</seg>
<seg id="47">"I think in the case of the areas that have been reached, this is going to be a big change.</seg>
<seg id="48">Even if we don't reach 100 percent, then there is enough demand."</seg>
<seg id="49">Note: This book refers to federal election campaigns like Green Party, Liberal Party and New Dealer Democrats (NDP).</seg>

<seg id="1">Subject: A system of early childhood education and childcare issues</seg>
<seg id="2">We must recognize the important role that early childhood education and daycare workers play in Nunavut’s economy.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Laakkuluk Williamson-Bathory, the chair of the Footprints High School Board, is seeking additional support from the Government of Nunavut for quality early childhood education and child care based on Inuit language and culture.</seg>
<seg id="4">By Nunatsiavut News</seg>
<seg id="5">Correspondence to the Premier of Nunavut, Joe Savikataaq, and the Minister of Education, David Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="6">I am a member of the Inuit people who are very sensitive to our language and culture.</seg>
<seg id="7">As the chair of the board of directors for Uqausirmut Quviasuutiqarniq, the only Inuktut language school for children in early childhood education in Iqaluit, and that’s the only one in the capital of Nunavut where we send children to daycares that are already speaking in Inuktitut.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Foot Locker Station was closed from August 21 to September 12, 2019 because of staffing shortages it had to close and, once again, it has been operating under staffing for almost a year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Very few of them applied for jobs at the Footprints Centre due to low pay (Iqaluit is one of the most expensive day cares), employees don’t have any benefits, they don’t have housing because they’re seen as low as the women’s day care centre. That’s how it’s seen.</seg>
<seg id="10">The daycare is now open again, but the urgent operation is proving difficult: we lost one of our finest staff when she was stressed out.</seg>
<seg id="11">We now have a part-time position in the office, we have a full-time daycare manager, two full-time daycare workers and one full-time child care worker who works in the daycares (including a criminal records check and safety), who works full-time, while we look for a qualified, qualified employee.</seg>
<seg id="12">It’s not very common for us, but for those of us who have children, we believe that our children should be safe and that they speak Inuktitut so that the facility is open.</seg>
<seg id="13">There is still the risk that the door may be closed permanently.</seg>
<seg id="14">Nunavut’s daycare system currently does not generate revenue. The daycare workers are expected to provide one of the most important child-related services to provide quality early childhood education, based on Inuit culture and language, despite the fact that it is cost-effective and not adequately supported.</seg>
<seg id="15">The non-profit organizations continue to rely on a large number of sources of funding each year, including parents who volunteer to run and manage early childhood education.</seg>
<seg id="16">The daycare workers are having a hard time getting paid and they don’t have any income support, they don’t have adequate training for their jobs and they don’t have housing for the staff.</seg>
<seg id="17">The daycare workers are now being asked to work below their specific needs in order to be self-sufficient or to provide for their families.</seg>
<seg id="18">We are going through a very difficult time with our daycares due to the special needs of staff with the skills needed to promote and preserve the Inuit language and culture at the very early age of our children; the tyrants hire only Inuktitut speaking people.</seg>
<seg id="19">We have 100 percent Inuit employment.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unfortunately, due to the high turnover of staff, the lack of competition and the lack of benefits to staff leave the public service.</seg>
<seg id="21">So, it does have an impact on early childhood education and early childhood education.</seg>
<seg id="22">Inuit need to be supported in this effort and be valued for our language and culture to be taught to our children.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Government of Nunavut should consider how best to help ensure that a good early childhood education and daycare is based on Inuit language and culture.</seg>
<seg id="24">Effective delivery of essential early childhood and child care workers will be paid by competitors on a public scale and social assistance program, which will include housing provided on the job, vacation, training in the workplace and at school.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Footprints model to expand childcare has reached the public and the resources are greater than ever so that more people with children will have a place.</seg>
<seg id="26">We have now been looking for a larger, dedicated day care facility to achieve this vision, so we have raised close to $80,000 for the new space.</seg>
<seg id="27">It proposes to make the following adjustments for the Government of Nunavut:</seg>
<seg id="28"> ⁇  Collecting early childhood and early childhood education staff as members of the Government of Nunavut’s workforce in a manner that is comparable to the salaries of all Government of Nunavut employees, consistent with the Government of Nunavut’s payroll system, broken down by eight grade levels, applied to all employees in the Nunavut school system;</seg>
<seg id="29"> ⁇  Included in the operations and maintenance costs of daycare facilities across Nunavut as part of the education system;</seg>
<seg id="30"> ⁇  Providing benefits for early childhood education and childcare workers but not limited to focusing on short-term measures that include long-term sick leave, vacation, bilingual pensions, maternity leave and housing</seg>
<seg id="31"> ⁇  establish a society to support all child care facilities in Nunavut;</seg>
<seg id="32"> ⁇ Work with daycares to respond immediately to some urgent challenges. Together, we will work together to develop a long-term plan to address structural changes to child care.</seg>
<seg id="33">We must recognize the important role that early childhood education and daycare workers play in Nunavut’s economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">This will ensure that our daycares have fully staffed positions and that all staff receive benefits.</seg>
<seg id="35">We have to keep our daycares open.</seg>
<seg id="36">Changes to the operations of the Early Childhood Education and Child Care Division will allow Nunavut’s early childhood education and daycare staff to step up their careers in a manner that is very critical to the success of our early childhood education and daycare system, and make the system the most effective way of life for children to begin, including learning the Inuit language, building a strong foundation of Inuit culture and identity for Canada.</seg>

<seg id="8">The atmosphere in the Montreal Tuktu Room was chaotic on Thursday, October 3rd, when Inuit attended the 21st Inuit Education Conference to hear the two Inuit leaders speak about why the ability to speak in Inuktitut is a fundamental human right and one that has simply not been accepted.</seg>
<seg id="9">NTI President Aluki Kotiq and Louis Tapardjuk, former Government of Nunavut minister and member of the Inuit Uqausinginnik Taiguusiliuqtiit, the Nunavut Language Authority, appeared on time and sat in front of the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The camera crew organized a live broadcast on Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated’s Facebook page, which features video conferencing technology that can be connected to English-speaking speakers, and the attendees were mostly Inuinnaqtun-bound speakers.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kuutiq welcomed the delegates and started speaking in Inuktitut, and some of these Inuktitut-speaking people sometimes say yes to their heads and sometimes they don’t.</seg>
<seg id="12">For those people that don’t speak Inuktitut, including this writer, they were just sitting there and looking around.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some people just walked out.</seg>
<seg id="14">Some of them are just trying to listen to their phones while they are working on the English version of their waitlist.</seg>
<seg id="15">There were no English speakers.</seg>
<seg id="16">They feel welcome in a very dark place for a lot of people in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="17">"It relates to the Inuit culture of education that in this case, especially when we were talking about the Inuit language, we decided to use the Inuit language," Kuuttiq said at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="18"> ⁇ We spoke about this issue and we know there will be no interpreters but we felt it was important to use our language when we talk about the need to help and sustain our language development. ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="19">The International Conference, which brings together northern experts from the North and the South, has, in recent years, begun to involve more Inuit speakers and delegates, making the conference more responsive to Inuit needs and working more closely with non-Inuit students.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Inuktitut session, in regards to the language as being a human rights issue, it seemed like they were starting to work on it.</seg>
<seg id="21">The contents of Mr. Quirke’s opening remarks spoke of many important pieces of legislation to promote and protect the Inuit language in Nunavut as well as the majority of the Inuit and speak Inuktitut.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Act of the United Nations (United Nations) Act on the Rights of the Aboriginal People (Ambria) calls for action and legal action from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the National Commission on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, and the Nunavut Official Languages Act.</seg>
<seg id="23">Kutiqtuq described many dramatic moments in people’s lives, in part, to the language and culture ports, such as Annie Kootoo, who passed away due to the liver loss in 2017, and also to the 15-year-old Eileen Kuniliusie, who also passed away from TB for the same year.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Most people want to live an appropriate life and have a right to live.</seg>
<seg id="25">Nationally people shouldn't die because they don't have access and services comparable to other Canadians," Kirby wrote in her acceptance speech.</seg>
<seg id="26">In his statement, Mr. Tapardjuk made a reference to a recent incident in Iqaluit where members of the RCMP alerted the elder to the fact that their adopted son had died in the youth centre.</seg>
<seg id="27">This woman is a single person and she can’t speak English.</seg>
<seg id="28">Mr. Tapardjuk said the RCMP had to stop the vehicle in order to get assistance in informing the complainant.</seg>
<seg id="29"> ⁇ There are so many ways that this story could have been done, if this individual had a helping hand to change his life, they didn’t even have an interpreter," Kuuttiq told Nunatsiaq News.</seg>
<seg id="30"> ⁇ A lot of us Inuit who speak English and Inuktitut are invited to deal with issues.</seg>
<seg id="31">We are thought to be interpreters at any time, even if we do not know the people.</seg>
<seg id="32">Sometimes it's for privacy issues.</seg>
<seg id="33">So, in that way, I would say that is a violation of human rights. ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="34">Kuutiq suggested that at least those who speak Inuktitut in Nunavut should have access to professional services in their language such as health, justice and education.</seg>
<seg id="35">They don't even have those resources available.</seg>
<seg id="36">This and other leadership continues to call on the federal government to protect the language and the people of their homes.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ottawa passed its new Aboriginal Language Act in June which has been criticized by Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated and Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami for stating that their decisions have not been respected.</seg>

<seg id="1">Qikiqtani Inuit Association announces fees to tourism operators for Inuit owned lands</seg>
<seg id="2">Fees to be delivered automatically</seg>
<seg id="3">Tourism operators who visit island communities in Nunavut will now have to pay tourism fees if they want to access the land, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association announced at its annual general meeting in Iqaluit from October 8 to 10.</seg>
<seg id="4">Commercial tourism operators are now required to pay if they want to go on their own land in the Qikiqtani region. The Qikiqtani Inuit Association announced their annual general meeting in Iqaluit on Wednesday, October 9.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Qikiqtani region has the largest passenger ship in the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">Pond Inlet had 17 cruise ships that were in attendance this summer, while Iqaluit was the destination for four.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The people of the island communities have been concerned about this as a result of the increasing number of tourism activities taking place in this region, particularly from people carrying passengers on board ships.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Qikiqtani Inuit Association decided to set up tourism management fees to help people in communities whose vessels are mostly affected," P. J. Akeeagok, QIA's president, said in a news release.</seg>
<seg id="9">Subsequent information provided by the Qikiqtani Inuit Association’s Department of Community and Government Services indicated that the department was developing a new rent scale.</seg>
<seg id="10">New payment appropriations consist of:</seg>
<seg id="11"> ⁇  A plane landing in County Landing: $150 when it lands</seg>
<seg id="12"> ⁇  Helicopter landing in Tenerife: $100 when it lands</seg>
<seg id="13"> ⁇  Commercial Diarmuaries in the Country: $50 a day</seg>
<seg id="14"> ⁇  Commercial visitor offerings in less than six hours of public land: $25 a day</seg>
<seg id="15">A lump sum payment would be half of that going to the Hunters and Trappers Organizations that are closest to tourism programs that are available, the report stated.</seg>
<seg id="16">The other half would go to the Qikiqtani Inuit Association.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ships that transport people to Nunavut have a population of between 150 to 400, Roseanne Dyer, Qikiqtani Inuit Association Director of Land and Recycling, said at a Qikiqtani Inuit Association board meeting.</seg>
<seg id="18">The $25 a day fee would be for all passengers on each person’s journey if people were to go to their own community or the IOL site.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Regardless of the number of people on board a ship to land in their own country, they would be liable for the amount of people on board the vessel," DeFazio said in a statement to the board.</seg>
<seg id="20">Derbyshire said the ships that carry people to the islands will have to submit to the Qikiqtani Inuit Association the number of people that will be on board each month or before they go boating.</seg>
<seg id="21">"When the ship carrying 350 people, we would charge 25 dollars a day for one person.</seg>
<seg id="22">So the larger passenger ships would have to pay between $10,000 and $20,000 to get to the land on the people's own land," DeRozan says.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the communities where there are a lot of cruise ships that go to people in the summertime, like in Pond Inlet, the Hunters and Trappers Organization would get anywhere from $50,000 to $70,000 to cover that, he’s repeating.</seg>
<seg id="24">The new fees will also assist the Qikiqtani Inuit Association in land use planning and electronic registration.</seg>
<seg id="25">In this way, tourism operators will be notified of new fees when applying for access to people’s own communities.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Bureau noted that the Qikiqtani Inuit Association resolved to pay fees in line with other organization fees for tourism.</seg>
<seg id="27">For example, Parks Canada charges twenty five dollars per person if they are going to a national park.</seg>
<seg id="28">The hamlets also charge people for the shipping and tourism operators who are going to the communities, Mr. Deroy also says.</seg>
<seg id="29">"The ships that carry people who are able to come to their own territory are charged this fee only if the people are actually coming to our community," he says.</seg>
<seg id="30">Joe Attagutaluk, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association’s secretary/ treasurer, asked if it would be possible to increase these payments in the future.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Bureau had indicated that it would be possible to make changes, but there would have to be discussions and decisions made by the Qikiqtani Inuit Association.</seg>
<seg id="32"> ⁇ This is a exciting action.</seg>
<seg id="33">We are now giving more leadership that Inuit can get benefits for their communities," Akeagok said to the council.</seg>
<seg id="34">The payments will take effect immediately, the QIA said.</seg>

<seg id="2"> ⁇ Can the minister give us an idea of when we don’t know whether the Nunavut Impact Review Board or the government will approve the project? ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="3">A cargo ship from Pellegrini's (Bloomsbury Parramatta) has sailed to Bermuda in Heaven, Germany, in the summer of last year.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the loading dock, you can see two stick-built units, 33 to 34 metres high, of which Baffinland took the iron ore from Tyson and shipped it to Baffinland’s Mary River mine this summer.</seg>
<seg id="5">Two of the smaller units are being transported from the front lines.</seg>
<seg id="6">The purpose of these measures is to pave the road to expansion, which has not yet been approved by the Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="7">(Picture: Getty Images)</seg>
<seg id="8">Community leaders in Pond Inlet are frustrated with the large volume of unloading materials from Baffinland’s iron ore project at Baffinland’s Mary River iron mine this summer.</seg>
<seg id="9">One of the concerns is that Baffinland is proposing to expand the scope of work in phase 2 of the plan. Before the permitting process had been approved, Baffinland had two major ten-storey buildings scheduled to be shipped to Polaris, Jeremie, the company’s docking facility in Mary River in North Baffin last summer.</seg>
<seg id="10">They also brought in two smaller construction materials and a large trailer that would be used for construction, such as pilings and ground transportation.</seg>
<seg id="11">Baffinland in November 2018 announced to the permit holders and partners of the Qikiqtani Inuit Association that they would be bringing in, such as through a public registry to the Nunavut Impact Review Board and the Nunavut Water Board.</seg>
<seg id="12">But the people of Pond Inlet are finding that out now.</seg>
<seg id="13">This ship from Plymouth Brunswick arrived at Baffinland’s Port in Mary River this past August and loaded all ready-to-ship units to be used for railway expansion.</seg>
<seg id="14">When the people of Pond Inlet saw the ship close to their community they first heard of the re-supply, two more ships were delivering the railway material just prior to that and more ships are expected to be coming in the summer of 2020.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We only found out about three or four weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="16">We see equipment hauling near Pond Inlet," Joshua Arreak, the director of the Pond Inlet Hunters and Trappers Association told Nunatsiaq News.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We were thinking about why and who they were and how to do it.</seg>
<seg id="18">We didn’t get any information from the Nunavut Impact Review Board, Qikiqtani Inuit Association, or anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="19">We didn't expect that at all," Arreak said.</seg>
<seg id="20"> ⁇ We have not been contacted by the Qikiqtani Inuit Association or the Nunavut Impact Review Board.</seg>
<seg id="21">I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="22">As Inuit organizations we have a problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">They're not keeping us up to date," she said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Nunavut’s Department of Environment knew about the sealift season</seg>
<seg id="25">Neither the Nunavut permit nor any federal minister approved Baffinland’s expansion plans, which would result in a 110-kilometre railway road connecting Baffinland to Mary River, producing another 12 million tonnes a year, and continuing to generate up to 200 tons of iron ore.</seg>
<seg id="26">This project cannot be completely approved by the federal government until the last public announcement of the Nunavut Impact Review Board’s decision was made on November 2 in Iqaluit and concluded on November 8 and 9 in Pond Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Nunavut Impact Review Board, which did not seek comment on the matter with the stakeholders, announced that it would be sending a ship for the rail system to be used in a letter to Baffinland that was sent to them on July 25.</seg>
<seg id="28">The Nunavut Impact Review Board told the companies that if Phase 2 is rejected, Baffinland would be responsible for the transfer of assets, which could be worth tens of millions of dollars, from the mine itself.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was also noted that the sealift supply will not have an impact on the Nunavut Impact Review Board’s decision in this matter.</seg>
<seg id="30">In an e-mail dated October 17, the Nunavut Impact Review Board’s director, Ryan Parry, explained that the regulatory body of the Nunavut Impact Review Board may approve or deny marine activities.</seg>
<seg id="31">"The Nunavut Impact Review Board was prepared to only say that these actions would be part of the ongoing investigation and that all materials for construction would have to be moved if the request is not approved after the board's initial review," Perry wrote.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is an aerial photo of Phillibbons. Last summer the ship was carrying ready-to-ship materials for the Mary River Project to accompany the Bland Highway expansion.</seg>
<seg id="33">One of the building blocks, described as a "transition house," has a 33-metre high ceiling, 23.5 meters deep and a height of 1,470 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="34">Among other things, the so-called "Royce House," which is 34 meters high.</seg>
<seg id="35">So each unit, which includes the prefabricated building and the dam, sits on a ten-storey building or higher than the buildings built in the North East.</seg>
<seg id="36">But Baffinland has not been approved to use them yet.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Betland will identify these assets as  ⁇ Division 2 only. Don't miss this deal until Phase 2 of the proposal consideration is completed," the company wrote in its July 19 report to the NRF board.</seg>
<seg id="38">Equipment occupied by Inuit from their own land</seg>
<seg id="39">In a joint submission to the Rights Tribunal, QIA and Baffinland wrote that the properties would be located on Inuit owned lands, in line with the Qikiqtani Inuit Association’s investment lease agreement with the company.</seg>
<seg id="40">In regards to Arreak and so on, it seems like the Baffinland has already been approved for the project.</seg>
<seg id="41"> ⁇ The residents of Pond Inlet are not happy.</seg>
<seg id="42">Baffinland is thinking that if we don’t find out from the Nunavut Impact Review Board or the government ahead of time whether they’re going to approve the project?</seg>
<seg id="43">I don't know," he said.</seg>
<seg id="44">Frank Tester, the technical advisor for the Hamlet of Pond Inlet, was approved by the Mayor of Pond Inlet, Joshua Saksak, to speak on behalf of the Nunatsiaq News hamlet.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Police have been working with a view to approving the deal on Dec. 2," Deschamps said in an email.</seg>
<seg id="46"> ⁇ If the Nunavut Impact Review Board had the authority to do this, the final effect of this decision would be to put more pressure on the Nunavut Impact Review Board to act as a guardian and to approve the application.</seg>
<seg id="47">That's an issue," Deschamps said on behalf of the municipality.</seg>
<seg id="48">" Aside from the decisions that were made, the Hamlet now feels that they didn't have to do that.</seg>
<seg id="49">This is what has happened to the financial sector and the assumption that Portland will be accepted as a deal at 2am," he also wrote.</seg>
<seg id="50">"Our main concern is the animals, the marine animals and their presence.</seg>
<seg id="51">We would be most affected in our community.</seg>
<seg id="52">That is our concern.</seg>
<seg id="53">The money is not going to bring back the animals," Joshua Arreak said on behalf of the Hunter Support Program, saying something that has been talked about in Pond Inlet over the years in regards to the Marine Transportation Strategy.</seg>
<seg id="54">For the non-governmental organisation Urgewanda Ocean North (Oceanco North), who had hoped to have a say in the upcoming meeting on Baffinland's expansion plans, said they supported "incompetent progress" here at the Mary River mine.</seg>
<seg id="55">But it also stressed that Baffinland’s decision to move large amounts of iron ore out of the Mary River mine from Arctic Bay to Southern Canada, and this proved to be the case in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="56">"It is unacceptable that citizens are protesting against large-scale imports of railway parts into the Netherlands before the legal system is approved this expansion," said Chris Tabichi, deputy director of policy and legal affairs for the Ocean region.</seg>
<seg id="57">The already built resources inherited from the Dysonsburg estate</seg>
<seg id="58">The items being brought to Mary River are some of the items that have already been built on the access roads that will be part of Baffinland's acquisition of Dyson's multi-purpose facility in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="59">Two large buildings, first of these to arrive, were set up in Brumadinho, which is the third building in the state, to be used for railway transport, organised by Sardineen, in Berlin, the Taoiseach said in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="60">Baffinland also brought in a barge re-supply truck, a trailer for the transportation system and a number of other goods to be used for rail transportation.</seg>
<seg id="61">The material details of Baffinland’s submission to the Nunavut Impact Review Board and the Nunavut Water Board included a road linkage and a road link, as well as pocketing of steel and garbage bins.</seg>
<seg id="62">It was the Tyson group's first shipment of the Poundland, a ship called the Bigfoot Bonds, which weighed 5,500 tons of supplies, and left the Bermuda region in early August.</seg>
<seg id="63">The two other cargo ships also loaded with additional supplies this summer, and expect many more to come by the summer of 2020, the Daisuke said.</seg>
<seg id="64">Under a partnership agreement with the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, Baffinland agreed to invest an additional 18 million dollars for the reclamation project at the Mary River mine if the project ended, Water Board documents stated.</seg>

<seg id="4">(New York from Monterey City)</seg>
<seg id="5">The Montreal Town Centre on the Bell-Murray allows for the expansion of a project started by the Women's Centre, a day care centre for women who are homeless, on a land that was converted into a building that was inherited last year.</seg>
<seg id="6">The citizens' decision, announced on Wednesday, 16 October, will provide an opportunity to organise a new building into this centre in a not too far away place, thus turning this emergency evening into a women's centre.</seg>
<seg id="7">The women's centre, the women's day clinic here at 1430 Sammie Road in Montreal, is open every day of the week for women with special needs.</seg>
<seg id="8">Many of them survive.</seg>
<seg id="9">The women's centre is currently located in Sammadi Road, not too far from Ataturveda Road and Kaapo Sculpture, Kativik in the People's Republic of Cape Town.</seg>

<seg id="11">Established to open in the 2021 winter, this building's emergency night shelter was purchased with a contribution of $1 million from Montreal-based businessman Andrew Harper through the Joyce Community Foundation in Montreal.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Thanks to the new building, we will now be able to accommodate 22 more beds for women who are homeless," said Marina Pozl-Winnett, the executive director of Sargeant County, said in a press release after an event at a women's shelter.</seg>

<seg id="14">This project is a step in the right direction. ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="15">The good news is that the expansion of the centre was announced less than a week after this person who lives in the centre, Clara Okatsiak, a former resident of the Northwest Territories, passed away on October 11 at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr. Bowler-Winton told Nunatsiaq News that after his daughter was in prison, she became ill.</seg>
<seg id="17">Most of the entry-level people come to the city due to housing and legal disputes, Bloomberg-Kennedy says.</seg>
<seg id="18">There are a lot of women who go to the shelter to sleep during the day. There are six beds in the facility and they spend a few hours sleeping and they end up staying outside at night.</seg>
<seg id="19">That’s going to change with the new overnight beds that will be available.</seg>
<seg id="20">Meanwhile, the Women's Centre, which attracts around 100 women every day, has services and interventions tailored to women's needs in the areas of homelessness, food insecurity, mental illness and substance abuse.</seg>
<seg id="21">Blue-Winton said the number of people coming to this event hasn't changed much since 2018.</seg>
<seg id="22">"However, we are now surrounded by women who need more support than they really need in areas like fashion and fitness," she says.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is the only women's day room in Montreal. Sister Threshold is now open seven days a week from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. during the day.</seg>
<seg id="24">As a result of being able to run its income support programs, the Women's Centre stalled over the weekend without providing basic services six months in 2014 due to a lack of funding.</seg>
<seg id="25">"We think we're going to get financial assistance from Makivik, but we don't know if we're going to get that this time," said Boole-Winton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Women's Centre also administers the Social Assistance Program, but the Women's Centre raises funds to be able to carry out this program, as it does about 70% of its operating budget out of $1.7 million per year.</seg>
<seg id="27">Kathy Wong, a City Council Member on behalf of Peter-Megler's community and a spokesman for the Montreal City Council, said in a news release that a new evening destination and more women would be available to "facilitate services that are available to people to keep them healthy and safe."</seg>

<seg id="1">N.R.A. does not have Liberals</seg>
<seg id="2">On the big questions of fundamentals, the Liberals had little to offer</seg>
<seg id="3">Mamma Mia's win on October 21 demonstrates her reluctance to accept the Liberal Party's policy for the territory and the north.</seg>
<seg id="4">Do you remember it in the Liberal Group's report?</seg>
<seg id="5">They report back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="6">More than anything we can remember.</seg>
<seg id="7">That doesn’t matter, because the majority of the Nunavut voters came out on October 21, and they didn’t come up with anything.</seg>
<seg id="8">Since 2015, Justin Trudeau and a number of other Liberal governments in Nunavut have published numerous press releases.</seg>
<seg id="9">There were even some new announcements made.</seg>
<seg id="10">But in the end, the people of Nunavut just said  ⁇ I’m over here. ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="11">But in the end, it turned out to be the turn of the politicians. Since the 1961 uprising, the country has been turning to these forces for change: New  ⁇ ealand's colonial rulers.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is not so old that the Maple Leafs' win is a testament to their disapproval of Mr. Trudeau's approach to northern and northern Canada, which is in part due to a lack of consensus on the federal-provincial-territorial relationship.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since 2015, Trudeau has worked with governing organizations such as Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, Qikiqtani Inuit Association and others.</seg>
<seg id="14">But this week’s election demonstrates to the people of Nunavut that the P3 process is not working.</seg>
<seg id="15">And that is hardly surprising, because in the end Nuremberg's specific questions the Liberals were unable to answer directly.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is well known that the majority of the people in Nunavut are the ones that are most concerned about economic and social issues: the ongoing housing shortage, the lack of food, the high cost of food in the stores, the high cost of transportation, the high rate of tuberculosis, and suicide, which is almost daily.</seg>
<seg id="17">But on the last trip to Nunavut on October 8, Mr. Trudeau didn’t have much good news on those issues.</seg>
<seg id="18">He made a Member’s Statement about South Baffin talking about climate change and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="19">These are national issues, but they want an election on this, so Nunavummiut want to hear their concerns about housing and the cost of living.</seg>
<seg id="20">What he did was that the Sylvia Grinnell River was a heritage site, not for Nunavut voters, but for southern Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="21">When he did that, he did not respond to the people of Nunavut who are working very hard. Also, the Nunavut Liberal candidate, Megan Pizzo-Lyall, didn’t even help out, although she should have been given more support by the head of the Liberal Party.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the case of food price and poor nutrition, the Liberals took action, establishing a higher level of support for the Nutrition North Canada Program, and providing additional funding, $12.5 million a year for aboriginal harvesters in Nunavut and other parts of Western Canada.</seg>
<seg id="23">But there has to be a hunter support program in place and no one can say why this is happening.</seg>
<seg id="24">On August 1 as well, Mr. Duterte undertook a major effort with Iqaluit and Arctic Bay, when he signed an agreement to establish a Lancaster Sound Marine Conservation Area and promised to start a new protected area called Duval Point.</seg>
<seg id="25">Mr. Speaker, as a result of this initiative, the federal government committed millions of dollars to the communities of North Baffin to support small craft harbours and protect jobs.</seg>
<seg id="26">He also drew attention to safeguarding issues such as reconnecting with indigenous people.</seg>
<seg id="27">The only negative thing about doing that is that when you have a lot of coughing and sneezing in the overcrowding house, this  ⁇ say together ⁇  doesn’t really mean anything.</seg>
<seg id="28">In view of this fact, do you remember the Liberal Government's very clear stance on tuberculosis?</seg>
<seg id="29">That's what they did in early 2018. This is what Jane Webb, the former national health minister, said when she announced that tuberculosis would be eradicated in people's lands by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="30">But Mr. Weber, the federal minister, said that he was going to look into the matter because there are no more.</seg>
<seg id="31">With Trudeau's treatment of Judith Fusion's Rabbit and the controversial handling of the SNC-Lavalin affair, Mr. Bachelet stepped down from the podium.</seg>
<seg id="32">Since then, the Liberals have not heard anything about tuberculosis being eradicated.</seg>
<seg id="33">Like the Harvesters’ Support Program, I think it’s becoming very difficult for the Inuit-Government of Canada to work together and I think it’s time that they had a serious discussion about the tuberculosis program and now it’s in jeopardy.</seg>
<seg id="34">And people know that tuberculosis is a symptom of poverty, poor diet and inadequate housing.</seg>
<seg id="35">But on the issue of housing, Mr. Twerdin brought up an issue that had already warmed up and picked up another rumour last summer.</seg>
<seg id="36">As well as the Government of Canada’s Public Housing Program, which has been  ⁇ developed ⁇  by the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada, very little has happened since then.</seg>
<seg id="37">We would also like to congratulate Mamiak Qaqqaq for his winning goal.</seg>
<seg id="38">To be a member of the 4th Division of the Legislative Assembly, she will need all the support she can get.</seg>
<seg id="39">Let the people of Nunavut have the opportunity and the support.</seg>
<seg id="40">The mountain won two world championships, Leona Aglukkaq and Megan Pizzo-Lyall.</seg>
<seg id="41">I hope that these two individuals do not feel that they have been defeated, that they continue to serve Nunavut and the north.</seg>

<seg id="1">Members asked the Ministers about the $80 million increase to the Weber Street Project</seg>
<seg id="2">"Looking at my colleagues I think we are in the right position to decide what $80 million can be spent on"</seg>
<seg id="3">Joelie Kownirk, the MLA for Amittuq, was one of the Members of the Legislative Assembly from the Nunavut Legislative Assembly that questioned the government on the $80 million dollar expansion in Iqaluit-Nuuk between the Webber Acquisition Program.</seg>
<seg id="4">Some Nunavut lawyers are now asking for unspecified resources for the expansion of the Nuuk and Iqaluit’s Weber Project.</seg>
<seg id="5">Last August, the federal government announced that it would be contributing $151 million to the project, which is aimed at 1,700 kilometres of Weber Avenue in Nuuk, Greenland through the Davis Strait area of Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="6">That’s where the product would be delivered to Kimmirut.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Government of Nunavut will design and initiate the project, which should be completed by 2023.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last year, the Legislative Assembly approved this project, which would cost $126 million.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Over the past year, we were informed that the cost of the project has increased as a result of the cost of complying with the increases and it is now estimated to be around $209 million," John Main, the MLA for Arviat North-Whale Cove, said in a member’s statement on Wednesday, October 23.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is an $80 million difference," Maynard said.</seg>
<seg id="11">"From a team point of view we are in a position to make a conscious decision about the potential of $80 million," Maynard says.</seg>
<seg id="12">The federal government’s contribution to the Outpost Camps and the Northern Community Initiatives Program is the Investment Canada Plan.</seg>
<seg id="13">The project is now in the Legal Services Board's review of proposed expenditure for 2020/21.</seg>
<seg id="14">Later on in question day, Joelie Qaunaq, MLA for Amittuq asked a question to Mr. Quassa, Minister of Community and Government Services, about the $80 million increase that the government is planning to put into the program.</seg>
<seg id="15">This process, as defined in the Government of Nunavut’s fiscal planning contribution, is to, and I quote,  ⁇ make sure that this project has a clear definition, and that information is available for development, an accurate cost analysis and a time frame, prior to beginning the planning process. ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="16"> ⁇ Is this a pre-planning study, yes or no? ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Kovic is asking the question to Ms. Kusugak.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The planning has been done and they are still trying to figure out how much it would cost.</seg>
<seg id="19">When we were informed, we realised it was going to be much more expensive," Ms Kusugak says.</seg>
<seg id="20">Mr. Main, who is sitting beside me who is the Chairperson of the Legislative Assembly, stands up to ask another question from Ms. Kusugak.</seg>
<seg id="21"> ⁇ Can the minister indicate how this huge project has gone up in the past year? ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="22">Ms. Kusugak points out that after the funding request was approved last year, the department re-evaluated the project and the costs increased as a result of the review.</seg>
<seg id="23">Ms. Kusugak reiterated that, in May of 2019 her department anticipated that the funding assistance proposal would need to be increased to $201.6 million to  ⁇ Provide maximum federal contribution to be made available to the program if needed. ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="24">The next day, on October 24, Mr. Maine stood up again during question period seeking advice from the Finance Minister George Hickes on the same issue.</seg>
<seg id="25"> ⁇ So, from the perspective of the Financial Management Board, what steps were taken and what were taken to inform the department of the $80 million cost increase in this project? ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="26">Maine asked.</seg>
<seg id="27">Mr. Hickes noted the federal government’s contribution to the expansion of this project, and that in addition to supporting a marine research project, the Government of Nunavut has also increased its contribution.</seg>
<seg id="28"> ⁇ The Department of Community and Government Services gave it back to the Financial Management Board for this reason when they found that the payments were not enough. ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hickes also noted that the Government of Nunavut (25 percent) contributes to this program, which the federal government contributes 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="30"> ⁇ If you are a Nunavut Government, we don’t have to pay the whole $80 million, we will have to pay for that 25 percent.</seg>
<seg id="31">What we’re going to be doing is trying to find... . In the next few years, we’re going to be looking at additional resources to support the completion of this project," he said again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nunavik needs its own federal lawyer, says Makivik chief</seg>
<seg id="2">Charlie Ford's election comes after federal government calls for change</seg>
<seg id="3">Charlie Watt, President of the Makivik Corporation, issued a news release on October 22 following the federal election, saying that Nunavik needs its own federal lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="4">By Elaine Andreescu</seg>
<seg id="5">Makivik president Charles Ward defended his comments on Nunavik's legal status at a ceremony announcing his arrival here to the new Legislative Assembly, Sir Bobby Papandreou.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The Electoral Boundaries Commission will be looking to ensure that this message, in other words, that Nunavik has its own government in our area, which is what it would like right now in respect of the right to self-determination that we are working on," he says.</seg>
<seg id="7">"We need this from the province."</seg>
<seg id="8">Abbas-James Bay-Navy is one of the largest federal political projects in Quebec, originating from the Nunavik South to the Loma Valley-Oaiwa community. About four of the six 2019 federal candidates are residents, including a candidate from Papua for the Bloody Falls.</seg>
<seg id="9">Nunavut’s leaders have committed to self-government for the territory, which began in 1972.</seg>
<seg id="10">In 2002, the Kativik Regional Government along with the Makivik Federal Election Commission came to the Regional Commission on this issue and again in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="11">Since then the division has expanded in 2013, adding two more locations to the south-east.</seg>
<seg id="12">The regions were drawn up again, by way of the Commission, in order to try to make the population equal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Across the Quebec region, there are about 100,000 people in the region, which is the Abigail-James-November and there are about 85,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="14">When Nunavik’s population was around 13,000, the population was far below Nunavik, but their leaders have responded to this question about the Nunavik Inuit relationship.</seg>
<seg id="15">The smallest federal jurisdiction, Labrador, with a population of approximately 26,000 people, is situated in Newfoundland.</seg>
<seg id="16">Prabowo won the seat for Kuala Lumpur, which has a vote of more than 11,000 votes, or 40%, behind both Liberal and Conservative candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Ford said he was annoyed by the Green Party candidate Kiara Cabana-Whiteley, a person from Churchill, who was the fifth candidate to win more than 1,000 seats.</seg>
<seg id="18">In a speech from Mr Ford, he welcomed a visit from Birobo to Nairobi in order to visit him as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="19">"I look forward to meeting with him, and his support for self-determination in the process that I am very excited about, as well as for issues such as the example of the implementation of the Jonathon Nation Act on the rights of indigenous peoples," Ford said.</seg>
<seg id="20">He had big news for Black Cube President Evas-Francois Blanchard, while the pro-independence wrestling team won 32 seats to the UK.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We expect us to support the development of our business in Nunavik through law and economics ⁇  as well as the legal system to establish appropriate relationships," said Ford.</seg>
<seg id="22">"However, with Quebec's desire for independence, people have long been contributing to the country's unity."</seg>
<seg id="23">Mr Bercow defended the outcome of the election, even though the Lib Dems don't have enough seats in the new government, which he wants to allow the various Brexit parties to meet and unite across the country.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Judy Trudeau has a strong government that doesn't have many seats, and he can work with other candidates (Publicans, Black Quebec, Green, Conservative and Independent candidates) to create law and order in the country, and work to bring it together," he said.</seg>
<seg id="25">When Nunavut was elected as the new MP for Ontario, Momama Qaqqaq of Baker Lake, he made some interesting statements.</seg>
<seg id="26">"I remember the NTI meeting in Baker Lake in 1871 with Tagak Curley," Ford said.</seg>
<seg id="27"> ⁇ We were young at that time.</seg>

<seg id="1">Reinforcement of RSV in Nunavut, thousands of states</seg>
<seg id="2"> ⁇ In the case of humans, you save a lot of money on lung cancer ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="3">This aircraft emergency service from Nunavut Ltd. is on hold at the Iqaluit International Airport this summer during a scheduled air show.</seg>
<seg id="4">In some years, when children are suffering from respiratory disease (RSV), acute respiratory syndrome, they have to be sent out and this leads to the use of aircraft and medical services for a significant amount of money.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr. Speaker, Dr. Anna Panzeri and her fellow teachers at the Toronto Jewish School of Medicine in 1989 first brought this issue to the attention of the University of Toronto in late September, and about 1,000 people signed the agreement.</seg>
<seg id="6">But when this report was first drafted, 23,322 names were collected and now they want to reach 25,000 signatures.</seg>
<seg id="7">The announcement indicated that the Government of Nunavut would provide a number of palliative and end-of-life services for infants under six months of age.</seg>
<seg id="8">Palihapitiya is an anti-vaccine movement, though it isn't exactly a vaccination program, and its marketing campaign is called Synagogue.</seg>
<seg id="9">It has been proven that infants with lung diseases start from RSV, which is the acronym for  ⁇ Jeremy syndrome, ⁇  which is a viral infection of the lungs, and leads to cancer of the immune system called benzodiazepines.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, Dr. Michael Patterson, Chief Medical Officer of Health in Nunavut, told Nunatsiaq News in an interview that the Government of Nunavut contributes 11 percent to 12 percent of children under the age of 2.</seg>
<seg id="11">"We use it more for those babies who are at greater risk of serious illnesses to RSK, and for those who support the country's donation from Pemex," he says.</seg>
<seg id="12">These include infants who are Inuit, at less than 35 weeks of pregnancy, or children with lung diseases or heart disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Panzeri, who is a teacher in the Children’s Clinic in Toronto’s June Clinic, has been writing curriculum for the past 15 years on topics such as persistent post-traumatic stress disorder and the cost of RSV in the north.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to the results of this survey, the minister has not been entirely satisfied with the current Nunavut policy and stated that all Nunavut children should have access to the H1N1 virus.</seg>
<seg id="15">Dr. Anna Panzeri, who is an associate professor of pediatrics in the Toronto Journal of Medicine, said that conducting research on the Inuit infant immunization program known as Palliative Care would help improve the quality of life and finances.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr. Speaker, I believe that this is a very valuable program for Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="17">He stated through his study that RSV is a chronic disease that has the potential to multiply and produce a wide range of air transportation and medical services for Nunavut’s health care system.</seg>
<seg id="18">In order to keep people healthy, it’s very expensive; about $5,600 per patient.</seg>
<seg id="19">But even at that cost, Panzeri and many others believe that this is like a subsidy.</seg>
<seg id="20">That’s why in Nunavut people tend to get sick and medivacs are often the best way to respond, they have a lot of problems.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We have also tested against the producers in the north if we give the vast majority of them in Punjab, where it would save money," he said in an interview.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Price Survey, published in 2013, found a large number of lung cancer cases in the Kitikmeot region involving infants: up to 389 out of 1,000.</seg>
<seg id="23">During the course of this study, which was conducted from January 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010, it was determined that the costs for medical travel in this region amounted to $57,535.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the Qikiqtani region, the rate of lung cancer in infants was 2002 from 1,000 newborns and in the Kivalliq region, 230 out of 1,000 infants.</seg>
<seg id="25">This means that the Government of Nunavut has spent 5.9 million dollars on medivacs for the Baffin Region and approximately 5.7 million dollars for the Kivalliq region for infants and that was how they did the evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="26">However, the result was that Kivalliq had the highest rate of lung cancer patients: $63,686.</seg>
<seg id="27">"In the case of humans, it's easier to save money, because lung cancer stays high," he says.</seg>
<seg id="28">Head of Ontario Nurse Supports Registry</seg>
<seg id="29">"Children with babies at least 10 times more need hospital care than their lungs due to illness from  ⁇ vulnerable ⁇  infants and the disease is even more severe when it comes to the side effects.</seg>
<seg id="30">Even though this is a problem, Inuit infants don't get the Nunavut health card," Mr. Gandy wrote in his submission.</seg>
<seg id="31">We also have the situation for professionals identified in the Northwestern School of Health, the Canadian Health Association and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research for Aboriginal People.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, babies born in Nunavut who graduate from this program do not receive any type of cancer care regardless of whether they are at risk in communities other than Iqaluit and have a higher risk of respiratory illness.</seg>
<seg id="33">What Mr. Panzeri is saying is that they’re doing the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="34">"I've done a lot of hard work.</seg>
<seg id="35">I have made it public and I’m making it clear to the public.</seg>
<seg id="36">Carolyn Bennett, Jane Webb, has seen what I've written and described as credible," she says.</seg>
<seg id="37">Nunavik kicks off measles vaccination for all infants</seg>
<seg id="38">It was noted that, unlike Nunavut, the Department of Health and Social Services in Nunavik has delivered a Prenatal Nutrition Program to all infants over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="39">At the Nunavut Legislative Assembly on October 18, the Minister of Health George Hickes stated in response to questions from the Iqaluit-Niaqunnguu MLA Pat Angnakak, that the Government of Nunavut should carefully review Nunavik’s practices.</seg>
<seg id="40">"We are monitoring that project closely," said Hicks.</seg>
<seg id="41">Arnaktak said this RSV (Bubba's illness) had a huge impact on the family.</seg>
<seg id="42">"For a while, I knew her baby had to be medivaced to the RSK and it had a major impact on the family, especially when this was a young child.</seg>
<seg id="43">But Mr. Hickes defended the Government of Nunavut’s current programs and he’s not saying that the government is not saving people but they are providing this program.</seg>
<seg id="44">"This is not a legal or policy decision about costs.</seg>
<seg id="45">It has been consistent with the best medical practice," Hicks said.</seg>
<seg id="46">Patterson recounts that Nunavik passed a three-year program that started with infants under six months of age.</seg>
<seg id="47">"We're still waiting for this number, and if we find out that it's a good investment to lend at the Palihapitiya, then we'll implement this quickly," Patterson said.</seg>
<seg id="48">But in his view, there is still a lack of concrete indicators for the implementation of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="49"> ⁇ I disagree with you on the registration process and the other issue is that it is almost completed, or that there is a scientific basis for that.</seg>
<seg id="50">We still have a lot of people who have questions," he says.</seg>
<seg id="51">The event that is held in the Kivalliq region is a long time coming.</seg>
<seg id="52">In 2008, the Government of Nunavut denied or participated in the Polar Bear Survey on RSV, even though officials from Greenland, Nunavik and the Northwest Territories wanted to be involved.</seg>

<seg id="13">On October 15th the sea ice penguins were around 5.118 million square kilometres, the lowest level since record-keeping began in 1968.</seg>

<seg id="16">April was also the worst ice sheet in the history books.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was followed by the July documentation process.</seg>
<seg id="18">In August, the melting of the ice caps caused a slowdown.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We went down in history as a partner with the lowest (loss) ratio between 2007 and 2016, but it's higher than in 2012," said Walter Meyer, a research professor in the National Technology and Nineties Department.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We are on the lower end of 2012 than they were when that happened because of the slow freeze  ⁇ 2012 ⁇  that went right back to the curve, but the winter is almost upon the ice."</seg>

<seg id="25">But the winter warm in October has been very quiet, with temperatures over the last six months.</seg>
<seg id="26">"It was such a cool summer," says Mayer.</seg>

<seg id="31">What is happening this year in the north, the reduction of ice has improved the Arctic climate over the last number of years.</seg>
<seg id="32">According to this press release,  ⁇ Climate Temperatures have risen to between 0.5C in the past 10 years and 1982 respectively, primarily due to the sun's sensitivity to temperature that began to break in 1979.</seg>

<seg id="2">The hotel manager says they do inspections but never find one</seg>
<seg id="3">This is simply a dinner in a room you wouldn't want to see: the bedbug.</seg>
<seg id="4">But in recent times, bedbugs have been seen at the Qavavalle hotel where patients from Nunavik stay at their hotel when they come to the city.</seg>
<seg id="5">The issue of bedbugs being seen at Nunavik boarding homes in Montreal is of great concern to patients and their families.</seg>
<seg id="6">This picture shows an uptick in the throat singing of Omega's Cecilia Dotka seen last month in the lobby of her mother's room at the Cullodie Hotel in the Cotonou de la Torre d'Alvarez.</seg>
<seg id="7">(Interjection from here on Cecilia Tudor)</seg>
<seg id="8">In the middle of October, Cecilia Cucuta visited her mother at the C ⁇ te d'Ivoire hotel here in C ⁇ te d'Ivoire where she was visibly distraught: behind a blanket she had seen in El K ⁇ nig, which turned out to be a photo of her.</seg>
<seg id="9">Cutska described seeing Eugenie's bedbug. She spoke to a patient from the Nunavik patrol station here at Ublivik Hotel. In this case, a group of rooms were boarding, 39 people gathered, on the first floor when the plane was overflowing.</seg>
<seg id="10">Kutcher called her mother and told her she would never be there again.</seg>
<seg id="11">The hotel's general manager, Sadiq Abdul Naidu, told Nunatsiaq News last week that he is in charge of the Holy See.</seg>
<seg id="12">That was the case a few days ago, when he was undergoing inspections, and he had the toxicology reports, they couldn’t find anything.</seg>
<seg id="13">One room inspection revealed that the bed had been infested with bedbugs, but they are no longer in this room.</seg>
<seg id="14">Abbot Nuno also revealed in an email that she had been staying with patients who had seen the bedbugs.</seg>
<seg id="15">Given the importance of the Umbrella Centre's operation, Abdul Nasser said that all rooms had been programmed this year and continued to be inspected and processed if required.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Nunatsiaq News couldn’t talk to the Nunavik Public Health Board or the Moto  ⁇ Quawei-Queens who deal with the Nunavik Hospital in Montreal with bedbugs and what they are doing about it.</seg>
<seg id="17">These are M ⁇ N concerns that have been written on the Internet by Andrew Nunn.</seg>
<seg id="18">"It appears that the passengers are taking shelter because of the glitch and decided not to stay in the hotel," wrote George Tulsa, the president of Relev on October 16.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Please let me know what it is and where and when the dispute will be resolved.</seg>
<seg id="20">We need to keep patients informed of the treatment of bedbugs. ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="21">The Ukiivik Medical Boarding Home/Burgues are providing regular care before they enter.</seg>
<seg id="22">There are bedbug infestation in Montreal: severe bedbugs were forced to close government offices here in Casino-Florida last month.</seg>
<seg id="23">And if you have bedbugs from the north, this wouldn't be the first time, as was the case in 2010 in Winnipeg.</seg>
<seg id="24">The bedbugs are very cute: they're small, but they're easy to chew, chew and paint from the skin after they bite.</seg>
<seg id="25">As with most bedbugs in a piping bag, this melanin helps to reduce the blood flow and doesn’t affect the digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other end of the pipe, igloos are pumped out of blood, sometimes about five minutes, after they melt, they start looking for blood and it’s seeping all over the place.</seg>
<seg id="27">These bedbugs eat five to ten days and can last for a whole year, they are at the bottom of the fountains, bottles and other hot meals, dark and they come out when they want to eat.</seg>
<seg id="28">The interesting thing about these bedbugs is that they don't live in cramped conditions, so they end up staying asleep and dying.</seg>
<seg id="29">So you can store your bags in the air for more than two days if you don't have heat.</seg>
<seg id="30">Make sure you avoid bedbugs while out on the land, check out the house's head, bottom and don't put your bag in bed.</seg>
<seg id="31">And if you go home, wash your clothes before going to the bedroom and check your bags to make sure they don't have any bedbugs.</seg>
<seg id="32">If you see the bedbug infestation at the Montreal hotel, you can call 311 cities to complain.</seg>

<seg id="7">NIRB’s hearing on Baffinland’s proposal to expand its mine at Mary River suddenly stalled over the next two days of meeting in Pond Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Wednesday, November 6, NTI President Aluki Kotak issued a motion calling for the immediate suspension of this last public meeting and for the meeting to continue in the next eight months to a year.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was a very quiet day for the members to join with me in looking forward to the Baffinland Iron Ore Project.</seg>
<seg id="10">Baffinland’s engineers had a very nice face, sometimes they move their arms and they just turned to the table when Mr. Quirke was making his motion.</seg>
<seg id="11">"We are concerned that this public meeting will be concluded without any conditions being completed.</seg>
<seg id="12">People need input and a genuine dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="13">Whoever is here would like to understand both what is occurring and how it would affect NTI and the organizations," Mr. Quirke says while this Chamber is full of presenters and people.</seg>
<seg id="14">It affects all aspects of people's lives," she says</seg>
<seg id="15">The motion was subsequently tabled on the occasion of the fifth session in Iqaluit, which was just about an hour away.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Nunavut Impact Review Board’s first agenda was scheduled to proceed with a public meeting in Pond Inlet to be held on November 8 and 9.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Nunavut Impact Review Board accepted Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated’s motion, this meeting was cancelled and the Pond Inlet community meeting was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="18">Over the course of a week, the Bavarian representatives who wished to have their say were repeatedly pressed about their plans to build a railway line from the north-west of the Netherlands to the Finnish border ports.</seg>
<seg id="19">When it comes to the railways and other parts of the port itself, it is all the more possible that the company is producing ever greater amounts than the current 6 million tonnes of steel a year produces up to 12 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="20">But what is noticeable during the week is that Baffinland’s proposal to amend its project permits by striking out its existing restriction and substituting a limited shipping ban, 20 times the length of rail re-supply and 176 ships per year.</seg>
<seg id="21">The motion to adjourn the meeting was supported by everyone who had an opportunity to speak, many of them concerned with the uncertainty associated with the project.</seg>
<seg id="22">P. J. Akeeagok, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association president, told Nunatsiaq News that he believes the Nunavut Impact Review Board process ensures that  ⁇ people have the opportunity to interview these values ⁇  and that it  ⁇ provides residents with the opportunity to voice their concerns at all times. ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="23">Akihito also said that the resolution was not anticipated, but was scheduled to be formalized on the final day of the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bangladeshi officials view Kuwait's move as a move to impose a boycott.</seg>

<seg id="26">As far as I am concerned, if you are going to decide your future, then you need to be informed in order to make a proper decision.</seg>
<seg id="27">There was a lack of it here. ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="28">Representatives of the North Baffin community also unanimously voted in favour of the motion.</seg>
<seg id="29">"There needs to be more information and research done," said Amanda Hans-Man, a research scientist from Pond Inlet's Hunters and Trappers Organization.</seg>
<seg id="30">He said the project "would potentially have serious consequences for our vitality and humanity and our place in the world."</seg>
<seg id="31">Some of the participants at the table expressed their dissatisfaction with the Mary River project, and would like to see it continue because Baffinland is working on behalf of Nunavut, but they had too many questions and concerns about the proposed expansion.</seg>
<seg id="32">"We hear it's like it's under water and it's not adequate," said Peter Ivalu, who is representing the Hamlet of Igloolik.</seg>
<seg id="33">"The whole message has to be translated.</seg>
<seg id="34">Everything must be transparent."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Government of Nunavut also agreed with this motion, stating that there is a lack of consensus among stakeholders and this is the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Government of Canada also supported the motion, but stated that the Nunavut Impact Review Board may make a decision on the duration of the moratorium.</seg>
<seg id="37">Through his legal team, Pavlin said that they were disappointed with the motion to end the stay for eight months and were disappointed that this resolution was not informed.</seg>
<seg id="38">"The four things that came to this announcement at that meeting were likely to go ahead as of November 2," said Brad Armstrong, a lawyer with Baffinland.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Someone didn't say they didn't plan to start that day either.</seg>
<seg id="40">Whatever the issue was it was not worth stopping them from coming forward. ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="41">Meagan Lord Hogan-Howe, the senior vice president of recycling for Poundland, said the delay would affect the "intermittent deficiencies" of the project.</seg>
<seg id="42">"However there are a number of steps we are taking to ensure continuity of supply and security for 3,000 Canadian citizens on the job market, with 476 being born.</seg>
<seg id="43">We need to know that people are going to work with us.</seg>
<seg id="44">We need to take time to sort out the scale of the problems with the project," Lohr-Hale says.</seg>
<seg id="45">Although the Qikiqtani Inuit Association has stated that they can’t help in dealing with phase 2, Akeagok stated that they will continue to work on the public awareness program and that the project’s economic impact will not be limited.</seg>
<seg id="46">"We don't miss Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="47">We are working with them.</seg>
<seg id="48">We own the Inuit Nunangat that they shop.</seg>
<seg id="49">We support Inuit employment," he says.</seg>
<seg id="50">"We spent a significant amount of money and time on projects to make this project profitable for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="51">So, with that in mind, we have to find a balance.</seg>
<seg id="52">But at this time there is nothing. ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="53">Mr. Akeeagok also stated that the community's uncertainty as to the impact of the railways on caribou is important to him.</seg>
<seg id="54">"As an Inuk, these things have great implications for our cultural rights.</seg>
<seg id="55">This was very evident by the elders when they were here not only for themselves but also for the future.</seg>
<seg id="56">That is what I am concentrating on.</seg>
<seg id="57">My decisions are not just for now, but for the next generation.</seg>
<seg id="58">Do I leave them with a better foundation than it was before?</seg>
<seg id="59">That's basically the basis on which to make decisions, no matter how culture you are," he says.</seg>
<seg id="60">In response to this recommendation, the Nunavut Impact Review Board provided applicants with an opportunity to submit written submissions by November 15.</seg>
<seg id="61">From that point, the Nunavut Impact Review Board will provide a written submission to the motion and a timeline.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nunavut Legislative Assembly approves amendments to the Income Tax Act</seg>
<seg id="2">"It is our government that is doing a lot of work to bring the Cuban revolution back to profit"</seg>
<seg id="3">Member Adam Martin asked the Minister of Finance Mr. George Hickes this question on Bill 26, An Act to Amend the Income Tax Act, at the Justice Committee meeting on Wednesday, November 6.</seg>
<seg id="4">Nunavut’s Legislative Assembly recently updated the Nunavut Income Tax Act to introduce amendments to the Consumer Tax Act.</seg>
<seg id="5">The changes, which were read for the third time on Wednesday, November 6, included increases to the personal cost of $13,325 to $US16,000.</seg>
<seg id="6">This will result in taxpayers making more than $3,000 a year before they have to pay Nunavut’s income tax.</seg>
<seg id="7">The other change here is an increase in the living tax credit from $1,200 to $1,500.</seg>
<seg id="8">This means that if taxpayers make more than $60,000 of their salary, they will receive an additional $300 in the Income Tax Program.</seg>
<seg id="9">As well, the Nunavut Business Credit Corporation’s rate for small businesses decreased from 4 percent to 3 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10"> ⁇  Our government is making a major effort to ensure that royalty payments are returned and turned into a profit ⁇ ," said Finance Minister George Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Federal Government’s decision to raise the fuel tax rate in Nunavut on July 1, to bring the fuel price down to a more reasonable rate of 5 cents per litre while the Government of Nunavut introduced the Cuban rebate program, which subsidizes the increase in fuel prices by 50 cents a litre.</seg>
<seg id="12">During discussions on the reform of the Income Tax Act, Members of the Nunavut Legislative Assembly agreed that the Cuban tax revenue should be returned to the people of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="13">They couldn’t agree on how best to do that.</seg>
<seg id="14">Adam Lightstone, the MLA for Iqaluit-Manirajak, was concerned that, as a result of the reduction in income tax rates, the government would have to apply the tax on government operations.</seg>
<seg id="15"> ⁇ It is my understanding that we are in a critical situation with the federal government and that our own economy is only 10 to 15 percent of our assistance.</seg>
<seg id="16">It's vital that we use our own revenue sources to run what we need," said Liechtenstein.</seg>
<seg id="17"> ⁇ Why is the government trying to use Cuban tax collections to subsidize government operations? ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="18">"Since the tax payments we're getting now it's only partially from the Government of Nunavut and it's been Cuban enough for our own Cuban friends," responded Hicks, adding, "I think we wouldn't be very satisfied if we were just indexing the Cuban accounts to other revenue sources and not have that revenue recovered."</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr. Liechtenstein also indicated that this amendment to the Income Tax Act would be the most appropriate way to provide tax relief to Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="20">It also indicated that these tax benefits are for the Government of Nunavut to use as its primary means of reducing Nunavut’s hunger.</seg>
<seg id="21"> ⁇ Climate change is a matter of great concern to me and something that needs to be worked on now and for the future.</seg>
<seg id="22">Having said that, I have put forward some suggestions to our government as to how we can develop or do something for the people of Nunavut in regard to energy efficiency," said Mr. Lichtstein.</seg>
<seg id="23"> ⁇ Why are these ideas not being taken into consideration and proposed to use the Cuban tax credit? ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="24">Mr. Hickes responded by saying that each department needs specific projects.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some departments have been working on a number of initiatives, including the Qulliq Energy Corporation, which is responsible for developing an energy-efficient LED street lighting system for all of Nunavut and that was approved at that meeting some time in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2019/20 The GN thinks it will raise around  ⁇ 2 million in Cuban tax payments.</seg>
<seg id="27">This would be broken down as follows:</seg>
<seg id="28"> ⁇  2 million dollars for the government’s higher heating costs for social housing and government buildings such as schools and health centres.</seg>
<seg id="29"> ⁇  3.6 million for a new Nunavut Co-op rebate.</seg>
<seg id="30"> ⁇  6.2 million dollars in return for Nunavummiut and Nunavut jobs in this fiscal year as a result of amendments to the Income Tax Act.</seg>
<seg id="31">But for Lichtstein this is a miscalculation.</seg>
<seg id="32"> ⁇ On the 50 percent dividend from the Heating Oil Tank Replacement Program and the 50 percent dividend from the Company Tax Credit, why is there such a small space for energy conservation activities? ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="33">Mr. Hickes responded by saying that the federal government’s current tax rate is increasing every year for the next five years, and although this 50% deductible from the gas tax will continue, the year-over-year increase in tax credits would generate additional revenue for other projects.</seg>
<seg id="34">The Bill's second reading was passed on November 6 and had third reading last night.</seg>
<seg id="35">Despite this, Mrs Lochbihler, from yesterday's birth, admitted to the bar that she had only slept for three hours and left.</seg>
<seg id="36">In a subsequent email to Nunatsiaq News, Lightfoot said she was not satisfied that she was going to vote for the legislation.</seg>
<seg id="37">"I do not agree with the conditions set out in Rule 26, because I do not think we are setting a good year's policy," wrote Liechtenstein's Diamantopoulou who was planning to comment on the bar.</seg>
<seg id="38">"The purpose of the Carban Tax is to reduce emissions from fossil fuels and emissions from the industrial and climate change discussions.</seg>
<seg id="39">If this Act includes an energy tax credit for individuals and businesses who want to reduce energy consumption, or if the Government of Nunavut established a mechanism to assist people in purchasing and developing energy efficient products, then I would have been very pleased to have voted in favour of this act. ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="40">While Liechtenstein is not satisfied that this protocol was passed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Mr. Hickes noted that he was receptive to suggestions on how to use the Cuban tax revenue to bring down Nunavut’s tobacco use.</seg>
<seg id="42"> ⁇ I strongly encourage anyone to write a letter to their MLAs or the government with a view to taking action in this area. ⁇ </seg>

<seg id="5">From April to September of 2018, over 51,000 people visited Nunavut communities that are not Nunavut residents.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is a commitment made in the Nunavut Tourism Annual Report 2018/119 by the Department of Economic Development and Transportation, which was tabled in the Legislative Assembly earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="7">The same people who came over here spent a total of $271,383,000 on participation and travel expenses.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report does not mention the exact amount to be spent on journeys other than journeys.</seg>
<seg id="9">On a balanced basis, there were approximately 16,750 visitors from Nunavut who were not residents from May to October of 2015, in line with this year’s Nunavut Household Survey.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Baffin and Kivalliq regions have the most visitors from July to September of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="11">The island was visited by 95,600, of which just over half (53.2 percent) came to Iqaluit with funding of 75.1 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="12">Pond Inlet and Pangnirtung are the second and third communities that are visited here from the Baffin region.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the Kivalliq region, Rankin Inlet had 33,600 visitors and they spent $68 million, just behind Baker Lake and Arviat.</seg>
<seg id="14">Cambridge Bay was one of the Kitikmeot communities that was visited.</seg>
<seg id="15">Drink by Owen Olsen’s research vessel from Juliette to Kimmirut in August 2019.</seg>
<seg id="16">In 2018, there were 3,404 cruise ship passengers travelling to Nunavut within two and a half hours.</seg>
<seg id="17">Cruise ship operators spent $388,351 on community service, the report also said.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the weather and ice conditions caused more than half of the cruise ships to come to Nunavut to visit.</seg>
<seg id="19">Departments were allocated conditions in which eight passenger traffic controllers in 23 traveling from Nunavut stopped in July to September of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="20">The ships carry 3,404 passengers in total.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just over half, or about 59 percent of the cargo Inuit landed in Pond Inlet from Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="22">Iqaluit is the second largest cruise ship with 8.3 percent, followed by Qikiqtarjuaq, which is 6.1 percent and Grise Fiord with 5.9 percent.</seg>
<seg id="23">The cruise ship visits to Pond Inlet didn’t just use a total of $245,565, but the guests were the most visited of the 100 hours of the 189.5 hour cruise trip in Nunavut, according to the report.</seg>
<seg id="24">Cambridge Bay, Gjoa Haven, Kimmirut, and Kugluktuk were not visited by cruise ships in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to the report, both Cambridge Bay and Gjoa Haven were expecting seven visitors, but both were cancelled due to weather.</seg>
<seg id="26">There was a report written by Cambridge Bay and Gjoa Haven that impacted the cancellation of a cruise ship with a total loss of approximately $25,000.</seg>
<seg id="27">The information contained in the report is from visitors to air quality monitoring in 2018, which included a survey of cruise ship operators and other visitors to Nunavut last year.</seg>
<seg id="28">In 2018, the Government of Nunavut responded to community concerns from Pond Inlet and Clyde River regarding the activities of these cruise ships.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to the report, the Government of Nunavut consulted with the Association of Northern Research Vessel Directors and all the cruise ship operators in an effort to avoid going through this route.</seg>
<seg id="30">It also stressed that the industry is an independent development, requiring government support for development.</seg>
<seg id="31">In Nunavut, this means training and employment for Nunavummiut in the tourism sector.</seg>
<seg id="32"> ⁇ There's always been a lack of commitment and skills to do various tourism activities.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the absence of skilled workers, tourism has not yet fully realised its potential.</seg>
<seg id="34">Skills have been known to play a key role in tourism in Nunavut," the report said.</seg>
<seg id="35">Mr. Speaker, the Government of Nunavut’s Sealift Program, which empowers 12 people a year to work in passenger vessels as part of the study, the report says.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to the report, all the Nunavut Government tourism inspectors are all Inuit.</seg>
<seg id="37">"In the past, tourism data is often lacking, which leads to uncertainty about the size of the economy and its potential to contribute to Nunavut's economy," the report said.</seg>
<seg id="38">The department's grant program has helped 115 projects in the tourism-related field in 2018, bringing the total value to $1,272,822.</seg>
<seg id="39">These projects include:</seg>
<seg id="40"> ⁇  Nunatta Sunakkutaangit Museum, Voice of Nunavut Exhibition: $50,100</seg>
<seg id="41"> ⁇  Paige Golf Classic Tour: $48,383</seg>
<seg id="42"> ⁇  Igloolik Hamlet, Production of Igloolik Design: $81,785</seg>
<seg id="43"> ⁇  Artificial Intelligence (Amazon.com), Untold Stories to Release: $99,872</seg>

<seg id="1">Mr. Mary River: If it’s an economic issue, let’s make it a reality.</seg>
<seg id="2">MPs should be interested in seeing Baffinland’s profits rise</seg>
<seg id="3">Participants sit in the town of Katuna Hall for the fourth consecutive day when the NRA held a public meeting in Baffinland iron ore mine on the highway to expand its application in Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="4">Nunavut’s approach to law enforcement in the area of industrial development, which began in 1993 with the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, has not had a major role but has resulted in a wide range of regulatory, environmental and socio-economic studies at the Mary River iron ore mine over the past decade.</seg>
<seg id="5">This was demonstrated in Iqaluit earlier this month, when the Nunavut Impact Review Board held its last public meeting for a $900 million dollar highway expansion proposal from Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation following its sudden resignation due to confusion and misunderstanding.</seg>
<seg id="6">The last two day meetings scheduled for the next seven days were to be held in Pond Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="7">By the same token, Baffinland is already worth billions of dollars, with the various iron ore deposits now in a state of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="8">For the record, the Nunavut Impact Review Board has yet to decide on a resolution from Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated which would, if approved, result in a delay of eight to twelve months.</seg>
<seg id="9">And Baffinland's landowners, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, said they could not in the foreseeable future support or accept a deal to pave the road to expansion.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association’s technical division, Qikiqtaaluk Corporation has stated that they are in full support of it.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is also the Arctic Co-operatives Limited.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is a very special program.</seg>
<seg id="13">As for Portland, the Vice President of Recycling, Meagan Lott-Hale, for his part, noted that the company is only concerned about whether the project will be viable, saying, "We are going to do a great deal to maintain and protect the country's 3,000 jobs, with 476 of them living on the job."</seg>
<seg id="14">Last week, Parvinenko announced in a Nunatsiaq News that it is terminating 490 South contract workers and 96 subcontractors in the civil construction industry.</seg>
<seg id="15">That brings us to one of the biggest unanswered questions surrounding the project: the existence of the Baffinland Iron Curtain.</seg>
<seg id="16">Baffinland has stated that the mine's economic potential is uncertain but if regulators allow the construction of a 110-kilometre railway in the Mary River area and its production to go up to 12 million tonnes a year, they could do so 176 times as much as they need to realize the potential of the East Coast.</seg>
<seg id="17">The problem is, they didn’t come up with a public report to help deal with this.</seg>
<seg id="18">And from time to time, more expert groups turned out to be asking the question.</seg>
<seg id="19">What happened a year ago, though they have nothing to show for it was not to stop the holders of what they say is confidence.</seg>
<seg id="20">For example, in the summer and fall of 2018, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association sued Baffinland to protect them from the Nunavut Impact Review Board.</seg>
<seg id="21">On August 31 of that year, the Nunavut Impact Review Board made a decision that the federal government will not accept the previous and smaller annual production of 4.2 million tonnes of steel up to 6 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="22">As a result, Baffinland and their co-management partners, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, worked extremely hard.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a few weeks, a letter was written to senior decision makers on this issue, Dominique Leblanc, who at that time was the federal Northern Minister, in order to reverse the Council's decision.</seg>
<seg id="24">Why is that?</seg>
<seg id="25">Funding.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Inuit Association noted with alarm that the Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation will be required to provide a significant amount of funding and assistance, worth more than $20 million here in the new Inuit Impact and Benefit Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="27">Ottawa agreed.</seg>
<seg id="28">Especially with the Qikiqtani Inuit Association concerns about the possibility of funding the mine, the federal government approved Baffinland’s proposal last year.</seg>
<seg id="29">"We are also concerned about the long-term viability of the Mary River mine and are aware of QIA's concerns about the economic impact of the project as a result of the development applications," Mr. Leblanc wrote in a September 30, 2018 letter signed by federal-provincial-territorial finance minister Carolyn Bennett.</seg>
<seg id="30">In other words, the most important thing is that the federal government does not accept the economic importance and importance of this issue.</seg>
<seg id="31">And they did that even though there was nothing in the budget to show for it.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="33">Because if it’s true that this program is not profitable, then the member should be able to see what he’s saying is true.</seg>
<seg id="34">In all aspects of the Mary River project, Baffinland’s employees should be developing a number of economic benefits with respect to these environmental impact statements.</seg>
<seg id="35">But with the program’s financial ability, the Nunavut Impact Review Board is reluctant to release publicly available symbols.</seg>
<seg id="36">For example, the Nunavut Impact Review Board has recommended that the lengthy financial documents obtained by the Fisheries Management Board from the Arctic be  ⁇ unacceptable ⁇  and not disclosed to the Board on the public record.</seg>
<seg id="37">(Mr. Speaker, this information is still available on our website.</seg>
<seg id="38">The Nunavut Impact Review Board recommended that this document be used after it was released and then deleted because of Baffinland’s request.</seg>
<seg id="39">Under the deal, Baffinland wanted to submit, in an independent, shorter financial statement explaining why Baffinland was able to generate more revenue through a larger production process.</seg>
<seg id="40">This desire to be independent may not be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="41">At least Baffinland is making some amendments to that.</seg>
<seg id="42">In response to this, the Nunavut Impact Review Board made a different decision, which is meaningless.</seg>
<seg id="43">If the federal government is going to be able to make money, then this federal subsidy board has to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="44">Of course, the Nunavut Impact Review Board and other regulators should be asking for more of this type of campaign.</seg>
<seg id="45">They must be ambitious.</seg>
<seg id="46">Mr. Speaker, I would also like to recognize the Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation, the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, and the Qikiqtani Inuit Association.</seg>
<seg id="47">In addition to raising such concerns, the federal government should amend the federal legislation governing the Nunavut Impact Review Board’s practices, the Nunavut Planning Commission and the Program Review Act to clarify how financial information should be handled in the future.</seg>
<seg id="48">Of course if you allow me to comment on what has been said by Mr Papanikolaou, there are still many questions which have not been answered either by Mr Provan's final proposal to broaden the scope of his proposals, relating to the railway impact of the floods, the impact of the ships on the whales, the project's lack of human capacity, and many more.</seg>
<seg id="49">There are a number of questions from Arctic Bay to the south on the proposed highway, which Baffinland was approved in 2013 for its construction capacity, and 18 million tonnes of production for the year, yet it is unclear why Baffinland was asked to produce in 2013 when it was allowed to produce 18 million tonnes a year.</seg>
<seg id="50">It remains unclear why Baffinland has failed with this plan.</seg>
<seg id="51">But the biggest question is how this project can ever be sustainable.</seg>

<seg id="9">UK GDP was defined at around 2.4 per cent in 2018/19, which is 0.6 per cent higher than previously thought.</seg>
<seg id="10">To that end, the Quebec Finance Minister, Eric  ⁇ ebedee, announced on November 7 that the $857 million that had been announced would be brought into compliance in a short period of time.</seg>
<seg id="11">Two things are going to happen that have already been envisaged under the Child Tax Benefit and the Child Benefit Supplement.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It's a renewed boost to the UK economy and the financial chaos that has brought the UK through this success," Jarrett said in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Our economic growth in Queensland gives us the opportunity to reduce debt and to kick-start the government's commitments."</seg>
<seg id="14">In the case of this programme, Quebec is eliminating the additional support provided to families of children implemented by Philip Clement's Liberal government in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">Through this program, there is an additional allowance for child care on top of the daycare subsidy to make up for a day’s income.</seg>
<seg id="16">This subsidy was increased to $15 a day for higher earners.</seg>
<seg id="17">The family that makes up 50 thousand dollars has not received any additional support.</seg>
<seg id="18">The November 7 news release is set to reimburse Quebec's childcare payment of $8.25, eliminating the additional costs for all income earners.</seg>
<seg id="19">This new fee in Nunavik will be used through the Kativik Regional Government program in Nunavik for children.</seg>
<seg id="20">According to the Quebec City press release, this new payment will be for this year, and the following news release is that the Montreal Canadiens reported that the program is scheduled to begin on January 1, 2019.</seg>
<seg id="21">As of next week, the head of the Early Childhood Services Division of the Department of Community and Government Services, Julie-Anne Petty, was not informed of how or when these new fees would begin in Nunavik.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Putin was respected for his efforts in the service and for his environmental contribution"</seg>
<seg id="3">Sanikiluaq's mausoleum is erected in front of the Nunavut Justice Centre on Wednesday, November 20, evening, in the presence of former MLA and Minister Peter Kattuk, who died from his early morning illness.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Sanikiluaq Community Centre was erected on Wednesday, November 20 before the Nunavut Department of Justice in Iqaluit, in honour of Peter Kattuk from Sanikiluaq, who passed away on the morning of a long illness.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr. Kattuk, 69, a respected MLA, Mr. Maui and the community leader from his home, joined the Nunavut Territory as early as February 15, 1999, to vote in the Hudson Bay riding for the first Nunavut Legislative Assembly and these were the first meeting on April 1 of the same year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Peter Kattuk (left) with former Commissioner of Nunavut Peter Irniq on April 12, 2000, when Mr. Kattuk was sworn in as Nunavut Minister.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the beginning of the Legislative Assembly, Mr. Kattuk became the Minister of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth on April 12, 2000 to replace the Honourable Donald Havioyak, who retired from his position.</seg>
<seg id="8">On December 17, 2001, Mr. Kattuk was removed from his duties as Minister of Executive and Intergovernmental Affairs and Services, where he served on this portfolio until 2004.</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2004, the Sanikiluaq voters re-elected Qammaq Tasiujarjuaq, as MLA for 2008.</seg>
<seg id="10">"He was the representative for Hudson Bay for eight years for two terms of office and I send my condolences to his family," Nunavut Speaker Simeon Mikkungwak said in a news release.</seg>
<seg id="11">Born on June 2, 1950, Mr. Kattuk spent many years in Sanikiluaq on environmental issues, as mayor and community leader.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the early 1990s, he was a member of the Sanikiluaq Impact Review Board, which collects local knowledge about the effects of a major hydro project developed near Northern Quebec due to the impacts of ice and sea ice on the Belcher Islands.</seg>
<seg id="13">The event became the subject of a report entitled "The Hudson Bay Voices: A Traditional Knowledge by Inuit and First Nations of the Hudson Bay Area."</seg>
<seg id="14">As the mayor of Sanikiluaq, Mr. Kattuk has also spoken out against the current situation in Churchill with respect to a hydroelectric power plant proposal.</seg>
<seg id="15">Subsequent to that, Kattuk was a member of the Nunavut Hudson Bay Interagency Working Group, named the Nunavut Hudson Bay Consortium.</seg>
<seg id="16">This group, formed by the Government of Nunavut, Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated and the Hamlet of Sanikiluaq, is to monitor the events in Sanikiluaq’s adjacent area with the second hydro transmission line proposal, which has also been put on hold ever since, in the areas of Eastmain and Rupert River.</seg>
<seg id="17">And in 1996, Mr. Kattuk was a member of the Nunavut Social Development Council, a body set up in 1993 under the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="18">Peter Kattuk speaks at the Nunavut Legislative Assembly on February 19, 2008, during his second term in Hudson Bay.</seg>

<seg id="20">This is Paul Okalik, when Nunavut was the Premier, who appointed Mr. Kattuk as Minister of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth in April of 2000, saying that Mr. Kattuk incorporated Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit before it was too evident.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Pita was involved in the study of Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit long before this information was available," Mr. Okalik said in a press release in April 2000.</seg>
<seg id="22">Before we became the Minister of Human Resources in 2001, Mr. Kattuk had to deal with an  ⁇ ambitious ⁇  laughing stock.</seg>
<seg id="23">This happened when NTCL shipped the gasoline to Nunavut and damaged the snowmobiles in the Baffin and Kivalliq regions.</seg>
<seg id="24">During his time in charge, Mr. Kattuk also faced a different challenge: the Government of Nunavut's decision not to use NTCL and re-supplied the petroleum products division of Woodward’s Limited.</seg>
<seg id="25">He was forced to run for re-election in October 2017, but lost third place behind Alan Remnick's runner-up.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trudeau Government 2.0: Don't expect too much</seg>
<seg id="2">"Even if you can feel hopeless"</seg>
<seg id="3">Jane Webb was then Minister of Indigenous Services on March 23, 2018, along with Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami President Nathan Obed, when he announced that the federal government would eliminate all Inuit-owned lands by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="4">Not a year ago he resigned as a federal councillor.</seg>
<seg id="5">Did you find out during the Federal election campaign that neither the leadership had much to say about the issues of Nunavut and other northern jurisdictions.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is absurd.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most importantly lawyers seem to think that the majority of Canadians, because of the southerners, there are not enough people who would vote for them even though they are talking about the northern residents that the majority of Canadians have never heard of.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Liberal Government acknowledged this fact, which led to the collapse and the resignation of the party which was lagging far behind Northern and Northern policies in the days ahead of the start of the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="9">During the election campaign, the focus was on aboriginal issues, many of which raised northern issues, which were not adequately addressed.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a new era marked by the dissolution of Justin Trudeau's new government, and with the new board sworn into office on November 20, it is little wonder if they will continue to do so without a hitch.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is one of the possible symbols.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is about the noticeable commitments made to the North since the Trudeau Government became Prime Minister in 2015: abolish at least 50% (at least 50%) of tuberculosis in the north by 2025 and fully eliminate it by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="13">This included an initial contribution of $27.5 million over five years, the use of which would be  ⁇ organized ⁇  by four members of the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami.</seg>
<seg id="14">But at one point, Mr. Speaker, it seems like a broken promise, starting with the tuberculosis eradication project that was undertaken by the federal government, Ms. Jane Bachelet, the former Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development said that.</seg>
<seg id="15">He resigned from Trudeau's legal team on March 4 in protest at Trudeau's unfair treatment of Judith Friesen-Robert.</seg>
<seg id="16">He did this within four days of Mr. Trudeau coming to Iqaluit to apologize for Canada’s unfair treatment of people with tuberculosis in the 1950s and 1960s.</seg>
<seg id="17">From then on, they remained silent on the North's nuclear issues.</seg>
<seg id="18">Despite the campaigns, there wasn't much to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="19">And so far, the anti-inflammatory campaign has stalled.</seg>
<seg id="20">For example, in the Northwest Territories, with tuberculosis rates between 2006 and 2016, which recorded 248.5 percent of the population of 100,000 residents, the Department of Health has only participated in one community.</seg>
<seg id="21">That's what they did in N.Y. in 2018, when an outbreak of leukaemia and a boy with a 14-year-old boy died of this condition while in hospital from Jan. John's.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Nunavik, 313 people suffered from tuberculosis between 2006 and 2016, which is associated with tuberculosis in the Inuit homeland, where 234 cases are diagnosed in 100,000 cases.</seg>
<seg id="23">But there doesn't appear to have been any community-based studies in Nunavik since late 2018, when Wichita first made the news.</seg>
<seg id="24">Indeed, in Nunavut, not too long ago, there was a public inquiry into tuberculosis, when Stephen Harper and his Conservative party were in charge, long before Trudeau’s Liberal Party was elected.</seg>
<seg id="25">For Nunavut, there have been 670 people diagnosed with tuberculosis between 2006 and 2016, which is now 171.8 out of 100.000 and there has been work done on that.</seg>
<seg id="26">(There is no impact other than Inuvialuit in the Northwest Territories.</seg>
<seg id="27">There, he wasn't on a real lung transplant (between 2007 and 2016).</seg>
<seg id="28">Alzheimer's disease is a symptom of a lack of resources.</seg>
<seg id="29">That’s one of the concerns that have been brought to my attention.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it is true.</seg>
<seg id="31">If people do not have enough food and live in inadequate housing, tuberculosis can develop.</seg>
<seg id="32">Another thing to keep in mind is that the crisis in Cape Dorset, in this case a 12-week tuberculosis study, ended in May.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 2016, the unemployment rate was at 27.3%.</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2015, the average 15-year-old's net income was  ⁇ 18,933 over the same period.</seg>
<seg id="35">Of the 370 units, 120 units were in need of extensive repair.</seg>
<seg id="36">Under Canada’s overcrowding situation, 140 units from 370 units were deemed "unacceptable" by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Act.</seg>
<seg id="37">This means a shortage of bedrooms due to the size of the family members living in them.</seg>
<seg id="38">There are also a few people in Canada that don’t have housing.</seg>
<seg id="39">It's no surprise that in the last twenty years, tuberculosis has been declared a crisis for Nunavut and other parts of the North.</seg>
<seg id="40">And it is not unreasonable to think that tuberculosis could be eradicated in these communities unless significant changes are made to increase the supply and quality of care.</seg>
<seg id="41">But in the final days of the campaign, Mr. Trudeau's legal team made no concessions on public housing, but reiterated their 2016 and 2017 package of operational commitments.</seg>
<seg id="42">In this way, they were not even able to be reprimanded for their language, they were not even concerned about the fact that they had made their comments.</seg>
<seg id="43">This is also demonstrated by the history of the Canadian infectious disease emergency, which is approximately 300 times higher than the rate of tuberculosis in non-aboriginal Canada.</seg>
<seg id="44">In Nunavut, it might not be as good.</seg>
<seg id="45">Last year’s report found that one in every 100 babies born in Nunavut may have this disease.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the event that they are not too concerned about these urgent issues, how are they concerned about the Trudeau or Liberal Governments dealing with other issues such as mental illness, the need for housing in the communities, the need for more education and more?</seg>
<seg id="47">If you can be creative, don't expect too much.</seg>
<seg id="48">Otherwise, be prepared for bankruptcy.</seg>
<seg id="49">Note: Statistics on TB continue to be developed by the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami’s  ⁇ Environmental Scan ⁇  Strategy, released in November 2018.</seg>

<seg id="5">After a number of months of poor staffing, the Kativik Community Constables can now see that they have applied for additional RCMP officers,</seg>
<seg id="6">Police Chief Jean-Pierre Lafferes came on board to inform the Centre's Local Government meeting on November 26 about the progress made so far.</seg>
<seg id="7">This included the completion of ten new detachments in every community by the RCMP from the Ontario Police College over the same week.</seg>
<seg id="8">The hiring process also included former employees who have dropped out of retirement to be able to speak with a job in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because of a lack of personnel, the Kativik Society has had all of the RCMP members from Quebec with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, who are from Saskatchewan, who do not have RCMP members.</seg>
<seg id="10">As of September, 20 Quebec police officers were stationed in Nunavik.</seg>
<seg id="11">K-pop police numbers have continued to decline slowly while the K-pop community is recruiting more officers, and Leverkusen reported that in early 2020 they may no longer use K-pop police.</seg>
<seg id="12">Cultivating skills development begins</seg>
<seg id="13">The Inuit Societal Values Training Centre was also posted on the community policing website on November 18.</seg>
<seg id="14">The training was organized by the Kativik Regional Police and Laval University and includes information on Nunavik’s customs, culture, and policing practices here in Nunavik.</seg>
<seg id="15">This person has three hours of training and after they have completed their training, they are identified when they apply for the position.</seg>
<seg id="16">"This training is meant to help the Centre's entire community police team choose the culture of how they perceive it," Leveraux said.</seg>
<seg id="17">The second module is nine hours long and requires all officers to be trained, says Levers.</seg>
<seg id="18">The project is expected to be completed by the beginning of the new fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="19">The cameras will have to be used by police</seg>
<seg id="20">The other area that was added by the RCMP and appreciated by the members was the need to have the cameras in place for the officers’ work.</seg>
<seg id="21">This equipment is being tested and they are using six cameras at this time.</seg>
<seg id="22">"This work was started because of the desire of Nunavik residents to have the community of Kativik to have the police presence at the community level again through their work," Lazarus says.</seg>
<seg id="23">"The Kashmiri community police are aiming to give people a sense of their duty to come and live together more."</seg>
<seg id="24">Kuujjuaq Councillor Jobie Takapik hoped that these cameras would help people who have had problems with the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="25">"We hear from the police that they do not do the right things and that even those states don't want to talk seriously.</seg>
<seg id="26">They intimidate the police," Taqapik said.</seg>
<seg id="27">"There are areas in which body cameras need to be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">He also stated that if only one or two officers mistreat the Inuit, this impacts a lot, and it concerns the whole RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="29">He feels that with these cameras, they start to take pictures of what the police are doing and that they can be put into place in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="30">Leverkusen said the device would come into effect in January.</seg>
<seg id="31">He added that 'serious irregularities and inappropriate actions will not be tolerated' by the police.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I just retired from the police force a week ago because of our program in Northern Ireland not being up to par," he says.</seg>
<seg id="33"> ⁇ We don’t want a huge police presence in Nunavik. ⁇ </seg>

<seg id="1">Nunavut Neighbours Regional Round Table talks about renewable energy in the North</seg>
<seg id="2">Representatives from Greenland, Canada and the United States of America discuss ideas and experiences</seg>
<seg id="3">Bruno Pereira, President of the Qulliq Energy Corporation (QEC) presents this year’s Northern Perspectives and Communities Summit in Iqaluit, November 22, 2019.</seg>
<seg id="4">(Interjection from the U.S. Congress of General Counsel)</seg>
<seg id="5">The renewable energy experts from the north met in Iqaluit on November 21 and 22 to consider and share their experience with the Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="6">Attendees from Nunavut, the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, Greenland and Judith Spears spoke about the devastation they experienced when dealing with different communities.</seg>
<seg id="7">The sit-in, called Optimism Optimization Systems, an electrifying technology and data-driven approach to game management, incorporating new technologies and engagement with stakeholders, was designed by U.S. officials in collaboration with the Government of Nunavut and the Qulliq Energy Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="8">Bruno Pereira, president of the Qulliq Energy Corporation, said the meeting was a result of past conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="9">"In terms of wanting to adopt the renewable energy sector in our area, we'd really like to know what it does to others, and find out how their projects have actually been successful or downloaded," Pereira said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Pereira also said that despite the importance of bringing representatives together to discuss fuel conservation, Nunavut has a number of events in the area of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="11"> ⁇ Some communities can go through so they are not in the real population of Nunavut communities.</seg>
<seg id="12">But they have a lot of challenges like us, in terms of having the capacity, to be able to deal with the communities, so we can see some similarities. ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="13">Chris Rosales, director of the Centre for Renewable Energy in Alaska, said the Alaskan Energy programme contributed to the state's renewable energy development.</seg>
<seg id="14"> ⁇ We have been able to build 80 communities that have been able to use renewable energy on top of the diesel in Tisu.</seg>
<seg id="15">So we think that we now know how this has helped," Mr. Rossell ⁇  said.</seg>
<seg id="16">This program, designed to promote the recycling of economic development projects, also benefits Alaska in the area of lower energy costs.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ross said that in Osaka's south west, five communities were working together to install windmills and that these came into effect in the energy sector.</seg>
<seg id="18">"There is now an integrated knowledge-based approach to how to manage and manage wind resources and help each other to organize," Rosales says.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Alaska, like Nunavut, the home heating bills are very expensive.</seg>
<seg id="20">Rose said the community is using wind turbines not only for light but also for heat recovery.</seg>
<seg id="21"> ⁇ What they have done is they put small furnaces into people’s houses and these are covered with diamonds that seem to be on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="22">When the winds go higher, they put the energy into the heat, and they've developed a very small way of measuring the heat and power of people being diagnosed," Mr. Rose says.</seg>
<seg id="23">"In areas covered by the heat ban, this one can be kept warm.</seg>
<seg id="24">They can be turned off or burned in a home that is suitable for them, and in the event of failure they can find alternative heating sources. ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="25">But in Greenland, the installation of windmills has been difficult, says Newsis Eric Hagstrom, a technical professor of recycling at Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="26">Low temperatures and long darkening are said to be a challenge for wind farms in southern Africa that have made it difficult to take advantage of Arctic conditions, says Mr Haugitz.</seg>
<seg id="27">Mr Haggas also said in the two windmills that they did well to re-establish areas other than land on Greenland's west coast, but they were doomed to fail.</seg>
<seg id="28">"We can also say that in Greenland we have had more election campaigns that can deliver the resources that they are entitled to.</seg>
<seg id="29">At least two of these winds were installed in at least 200 different locations and one in 150 locations was also inspected," he says.</seg>
<seg id="30">One of the windshields went down, on the other hand, because the heat was too thick for the cold and it caused engine damage, Haveritz says.</seg>
<seg id="31">During the 2019 federal election campaign, three political parties said that if elected the territory's Tis Hazel fuels would be decommissioned by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="32">While it may take some time to develop a recycling program that will be viable in the north, Mr. Hassett said the use of fossil fuels was an urgent priority.</seg>
<seg id="33">"What we have to do is move away from fossil fuels, towards climate change, because now there is something wrong with it.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is a legal issue because if you're not going to be using fossil fuels you need resources but there's no money for it.</seg>
<seg id="35">Adequate funding is the right thing to do, she says.</seg>
<seg id="36">Pereira said it was a rewarding experience to speak with people who live in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="37">"I think that something else needs to be thought about, which is how to start working on getting recycling implemented.</seg>
<seg id="38">Some people have been using the equipment and they were having problems down south even though they were qualified but they couldn’t get from the north.</seg>
<seg id="39">Once we have that financial capacity we will know what the problems are," Pereira said.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Government of Nunavut should involve the Inuit of Nunavut in the development of the Education Act: Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated</seg>
<seg id="2"> ⁇ This is an important policy change that will impact many Inuit parents and Inuit children in Nunavut ⁇ </seg>
<seg id="3">Aluki Kotierk, President of Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, speaks before the Standing Committee on Legislation during its consideration of Bill 25, An Act to Amend the Education Act and the Inuit Language Protection Act.</seg>
<seg id="4">By Alookie Kootoo, President of Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated</seg>
<seg id="5">Subject: Minister Joanasie’s Letter to Nunatsiaq News re: Bill 25 An Act to Amend the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act</seg>
<seg id="6">Minister Joanasie’s letter was tabled in Nunatsiaq News on November 25, 2019 in reference to discussions between the Department of Education and Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated on Bill 25, which indicated that these consultations were conducted in a spirit of mutual respect and provided that NTI had the opportunity to express its concerns.</seg>
<seg id="7">The minister is of the view that he co-operates with NTI in the public meetings and NTI hearings that the Government of Nunavut sees as having a role to play in those meetings.</seg>
<seg id="8">That is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="9">Inuit have the right under Article 32 of the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement to participate in the development of social and cultural policies, and to organize social and cultural programs and services, including administration.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is a different matter of principle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bill 25 proposes amendments to the Education Act and the Inuit Language Protection Act to provide for the regulation and administration of the Inuit Language Protection Act.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is a fundamental policy change that will have a significant impact on the number of people with children and people with children in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="13">In this way, Inuit have the right to participate in the development and the process of integration.</seg>
<seg id="14">NTI did not have the opportunity to participate in the development of policy proposals outlined in Bill 25.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is not just a breach of the government’s obligations outlined in the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, it is a history that shows that the working relationship has led to the achievement of policies that better reflect Inuit goals and objectives.</seg>
<seg id="16">NTI has been working on Bills with the Government of Nunavut, such as the Inuit Language Protection Act, the Official Languages Act and the Wildlife Act.</seg>
<seg id="17">Recognizing that it is sustainable, NTI contacted the Premier and the newly elected government to co-ordinate the working relationship and the sharing of Inuit priorities, including education, language and culture.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Department of Education did not submit a legislative proposal to NTI on August 31, 2018 until March 31, 2018, when the department presented a draft plan for community consultations.</seg>
<seg id="19">NTI had less than a week to review Bill 25 and plan and prepare for the Nunavut consultation tour.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is not a relationship.</seg>
<seg id="21">The department conducted consultations with the right witness, and did not seek solutions or accommodate the concerns raised by individuals, NTI and other organizations such as District Education Authorities (DEAs) and the Coalition of Nunavut District Education Authorities (DEAs) were also present.</seg>
<seg id="22">I am working further with the Minister of Education on the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement to ensure that clear commitments are made under Article 32, and that the department must operate with due diligence, objectivity and responsibility and take full advantage of the Queen’s partnerships with the Inuit.</seg>
<seg id="23">NTI’s belief that a rewrite of the Education Act to be carried out in partnership with Inuit is a fundamental change in the way the department operates, as well as the overall recognition of human rights.</seg>
