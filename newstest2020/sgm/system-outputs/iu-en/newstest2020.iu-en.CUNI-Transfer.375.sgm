<seg id="72">Hon. Paul Quassa (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="73">Good day to my fellow residents of Igloolik, my colleagues, and all Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="74">I would like to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Dr. Donna Maine-Kimmaliardjuk for being awarded the 2018 Youth Award in Winnipeg.</seg>
<seg id="75">She is the first Inuk medical practitioner to become an Inuk.</seg>
<seg id="76">Dr. Kimmaliardjuk was born in Chesterfield Inlet and is the first Inuk cardiologist to be born in Chesterfield Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="77">This is the fourth year of a six-year program at the University of Ottawa.</seg>
<seg id="78">Mr. Speaker, Dr. Kimmaliardjuk was admitted to the Baffin Regional Hospital in 2014. He is the only registered cardiac doctor in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="79">In 2016, he became a member of the Aboriginal Affairs Advisory Committee for HIV/AIDS, which represents Inuit.</seg>
<seg id="80">During her tenure as a Member of the Legislative Assembly, she promotes Inuit societal values and Inuit societal values.</seg>
<seg id="81">Mr. Speaker, the Order of Excellence Award represents the highest honour of indigenous peoples to their people.</seg>

<seg id="86">Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the Minister of Health and Social Services for his dedication and dedication to Inuit and Health and Social Services. This is a testament to our youth here in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="87">I know that when I talk about my congratulations to Dr. Kimmaliardjuk, I’m sure that her endeavours will be very important to us.</seg>
<seg id="88">Minister of Justice, Ms. Iqalukjuak.</seg>
<seg id="89">Minister’s Statement 047 – 5(1): Rankin Inlet Healing Centre Sewing Program (Iqaqrialu)</seg>
<seg id="90">Hon. Jeannie Iqalukjuak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="91">The inmates participating in the Fur Production and Design Program are wearing parkas, mitts, sealskin pants, rubber bags, and a dryer.</seg>
<seg id="92">Rosemary Angugaaq is run by Sandy, a well-respected elder and sewing talent worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="93">He recently travelled to Norway to teach seal skins.</seg>
<seg id="94">She was a student of Nunavut Arctic College’s Fur Program and started the Fur Program with the Literacy Council of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="95">Rosemary is helping inmates develop culturally appropriate, healthy, and culturally appropriate healing methods for Inuit language and culture.</seg>
<seg id="96">Mr. Speaker, the Sewing Program will work with and support the On-The-Land Camp Program. Inmates learn how to hunt and learn how to prepare skins and food.</seg>
<seg id="97">These furs and skins will be used in the Sewing Program.</seg>
<seg id="98">The programs are intended to help inmates reintegrate into their communities. By the end of their sentences, they are encouraged to become more active in a non-criminal manner.</seg>
<seg id="99">Mr. Speaker, I recently visited the Rankin Inlet Healing Centre and I was very pleased to see the impact of the cultural programs, especially on community elders like Rosemary Chan.</seg>
<seg id="100">Minister of Family Services, Minister Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="101">Minister’s Statement 048 – 5(1): Red Certificate Program (Savikataaq)</seg>
<seg id="102">Hon. Joe Savikataaq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I say “good day” to the people of Arviat.</seg>
<seg id="103">Mr. Speaker, the program includes certified heavy equipment, heavy equipment, and mechanics.</seg>
<seg id="104">In September 2016, the Heavy Equipment Training Program, which includes three components, was announced in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="105">This allows Nunavutmiut to take on-the-job training courses. It is also a certificate program that is known by the Nunavut Apprenticeship Program.</seg>
<seg id="106">In November of 2017, Nunavut received the Red Seal Certification Program for heavy equipment, loaders, and mechanics.</seg>
<seg id="107">As part of the Heavy Equipment Training Program, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker, the graduates of the Provincial Professional Studies Certification Program demonstrate their expertise and skills and are able to work anywhere in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="108">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to announce that we have been able to present the Order of Nunavut to Canada for the prestigious achievement of the Order of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="109">Minister of Education, Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="110">Minister’s Statement 049 – 5(1): New Funding for Early Childhood Programs (Joanasie)</seg>
<seg id="111">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon, my colleagues, the people of Cape Dorset and Kimmirut.</seg>
<seg id="112">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to announce today that the Department of Education will be providing O&amp;M funding to qualified daycares.</seg>
<seg id="113">Mr. Speaker, the increase is a result of the three-year Business Plan that my department has developed for early childhood education and childcare programs in two phases since the agreement was signed in September 2017 with the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="114">Mr. Speaker, this current fiscal year will see eligible daycares receive increased funding at a minimum of $1,918.80 with a maximum of $45,494.80 depending on the number, type, and location of these daycares.</seg>
<seg id="115">As long as daycares do not increase their childcare costs and additional costs they will be eligible to receive similar funding in the next fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="116">Mr. Speaker, this funding will not only help daycares manage their operating expenses, it will also help families with childcare costs without increasing the costs.</seg>
<seg id="117">Mr. Speaker, we are proud to be able to provide this funding to support daycares and families.</seg>
<seg id="118">I also believe, and I am sure we share in the belief that this funding will have a positive impact on the stability of both funding and daycare costs.</seg>
<seg id="119">Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="120">Minister’s Statement 050 – 5(1): Nunavut Mining Symposium (Sheutiapik)</seg>
<seg id="121">Hon. Elizabeth Sheutiapik (interpretation): Good day, Nunavummiut and my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="122">Mr. Speaker, mining is the cornerstone of Nunavut’s economic development.</seg>
<seg id="123">My department is committed to supporting the mining sector so that Nunavummiut can benefit from these activities.</seg>
<seg id="124">Mr. Speaker, a national event will be held in Iqaluit for the 21st annual Nunavut Mining Symposium from April 9 to 12, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="125">This conference provides an excellent opportunity for people to explore the next generation of Nunavut’s mineral exploration and mining sectors to ensure that our communities know and participate in mining and exploration in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="126">It is anticipated that this year’s Mining Symposium will continue with every successful attendance in Nunavut and we expect more than 400 participants.</seg>
<seg id="127">Mr. Speaker, I look forward to welcoming the mining industry, Inuit organizations, exploration companies, communities, and other stakeholders to this important conference.</seg>
<seg id="128">Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would like to encourage all Members of the Legislative Assembly and the public to participate in this public event on April 11.</seg>
<seg id="129">Mr. Speaker, this is not just an opportunity to get some good ideas, but it also reflects the impact of search and rescue. I will ensure that all parties involved respond appropriately.</seg>
<seg id="130">Members’ Statements. Member for Hudson Bay, Mr. Rumbolt.</seg>
<seg id="131">Member’s Statement 096 – 5(1): Happy Birthday to Fifth Grandchild (Rumbolt)</seg>

<seg id="135">Member’s Statement 097 – 5(1): Empowering Kitikmeot Youth (Qirngnuq)</seg>
<seg id="136">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="137">What I will be talking about is a good way for our youth to think about and plan for the future.</seg>
<seg id="138">I rise today to share good news with my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="139">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to inform the House that Inuit youth from across the Kitikmeot will be gathering in Cambridge Bay next week for the 2018 Kitikmeot Youth Skills Gathering.</seg>

<seg id="160">Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, Mr. Lightfoot.</seg>
<seg id="161">Member’s Statement 098 – 5(1): Tobacco Legislation (Lighthizer)</seg>
<seg id="162">Mr. Lighthizer: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="163">I rise today to address concerns that have been raised by my constituents regarding the legalization of marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="164">I just received a letter that said, “My family here in Iqaluit are in a public housing unit next year.</seg>
<seg id="165">In the last couple of years we have had to move from smoking, we have had to move from smoking because the smell, the smoke coming into my house is very strong.”</seg>
<seg id="166">The letter goes on to state that “I am deeply concerned about the effects of smoking on my children. I put my children first and others in this situation.”</seg>
<seg id="167">Mr. Speaker, as residents of Iqaluit and my family, we share condominiums.</seg>
<seg id="168">Mr. Speaker, the effects of second-hand smoke have on non-smokers.</seg>
<seg id="169">For a long time, you don’t smoke it. You can smell it. It’s a sickness that has been known by the government and it has been passed in the House by the Government of Nunavut and it has been passed in the House to make sure that people don’t smoke.</seg>
<seg id="170">As a father and a child, I don’t want them to be affected by these kinds of health hazards that include tobacco and marijuana vapours.</seg>
<seg id="171">As my colleague from Pangnirtung pointed out, the member asked the Minister of Health about the health risks associated with marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="172">In conversations with my constituents, many of them share similar concerns.</seg>
<seg id="173">Mr. Speaker, I recognize that when you’re dealing with issues like this, you have to be flexible and balanced.</seg>
<seg id="174">The federal government’s proposed decriminalization of the Tobacco Control Act is just a few months from now.</seg>
<seg id="175">I would like unanimous consent to conclude my statement.</seg>
<seg id="176">The member is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statement today. Are there any nays?</seg>
<seg id="177">Mr. Lighthizer, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="178">Thank you, my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="179">Under this legislation, elders will be able to possess and smoke marijuana. However, the government will have to develop a policy on how to regulate the use of marijuana in the community.</seg>
<seg id="180">Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Rankin Inlet North, Chesterfield Inlet, noted last week that the Government’s own research and results have clearly indicated that there is a concern with the agriculture and acquisition of public housing units and condominium units.</seg>
<seg id="181">Mr. Speaker, I believe that when this legislation is introduced in the Legislative Assembly, it will need to clearly address these concerns and I look forward to the best possible resolution for my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="182">Before we proceed, members will note that our colleague, Mr. Akoak, is absent from the House due to illness and is absent from the House today.</seg>
<seg id="183">I wish Mr. Akoak a speedy recovery.</seg>
<seg id="184">Member for Baker Lake, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="185">Member’s Statement 099 – 5(1): Increase Teaching Opportunities in Baker Lake (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="186">Mr. Mikkungwak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="187">I say “hello” to the people of Baker Lake and all Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="188">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage our government to increase training opportunities in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="189">Mr. Speaker, Baker Lake’s rapidly growing population will be extremely important when we begin to provide more training and employment opportunities for Baker Lake residents.</seg>
<seg id="190">Mr. Speaker, Piqqusilirivvik operates programs in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="191">This could be expanded so that the public can have a better understanding and experience of Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit.</seg>
<seg id="192">Mr. Speaker, the idea of establishing a university in Nunavut has been expressed, and Agnico Eagle Mines has indicated that they would be willing to support such a move.</seg>
<seg id="193">I think it would be best if we put it right in the middle of Nunavut because Canada is right in the middle of the country.</seg>
<seg id="194">Mr. Speaker, as one of my colleagues pointed out, it’s very important that we take these issues as quickly as possible before they pass.</seg>
<seg id="195">Government tires rotate very slowly, but at the same time we have to encourage and encourage whenever something comes up in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="196">Mr. Speaker, this is the beginning of the Fifth Assembly, and I too would like to see us take a big step forward.</seg>
<seg id="197">Expanding training opportunities in communities such as Baker Lake would be a good step forward.</seg>
<seg id="198">Member for Kugluktuk, Ms. Kamingoak.</seg>
<seg id="199">Member’s Statement 100 – 5(1): Concerns about Larga Boarding Home</seg>
<seg id="200">Mr. Mikkungwak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="201">Good afternoon, colleagues, Kuglukturmiut, and Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="202">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage the government to more closely monitor the day-to-day operations of medical boarding homes.</seg>
<seg id="203">Mr. Speaker, my constituents have raised a number of concerns and concerns that may have been addressed some time ago.</seg>
<seg id="204">Food problems and garbage bins are often broken down for months.</seg>
<seg id="205">Mr. Speaker, it is important that the government ensures that services paid for by Nunavummiut are delivered.</seg>
<seg id="206">I understand that the boarding homes have to accommodate a lot of people on a daily basis but it is also important however that they are comfortable and well taken care of.</seg>
<seg id="207">Mr. Speaker, it is unclear whether boarding homes will be part of the review of the Medical Travel Policy.</seg>
<seg id="208">I look forward to seeing the results of the review and the recommendations that will be made to improve the services and conditions of the boarding home.</seg>
<seg id="209">Member for Aivilik, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="210">Member’s Statement 101 – 5(1): Congratulations to Rosaline Ejangiaq (Netser)</seg>
<seg id="211">Mr. Netser (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Rosaline Ejangiak of Repulse Bay.</seg>
<seg id="212">Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker, a young graduate of the Canadian Academy of Education and Culture, Language, Elders and Youth Achievement Award.</seg>
<seg id="213">Mr. Speaker, the Harnessee Elder National Post Secondary School Scholarship is a scholarship that is given to high school students even though it was a very difficult time for them to succeed.</seg>
<seg id="214">Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize Ms. Ejangiaq for her courage and dedication to continuing her education.</seg>
<seg id="215">Many of our young people face challenges and challenges in completing their post-secondary education.</seg>
<seg id="216">I ask all members to join me in congratulating her on her achievement. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="217">Member for Pangnirtung, Ms. Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="218">Member’s Statement 102 – 5(1): Praise Mike Honoured Canada under 150 (Nakasuk)</seg>
<seg id="219">Mr. Nakasuk (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="220">Good afternoon, my colleagues, my relatives, and the people of Pangnirtung.</seg>
<seg id="221">I rise this afternoon to congratulate a constituent of mine from Pangnirtung who was recognized by Dennis Patterson.</seg>
<seg id="222">I would also like to congratulate an 18-year volunteer for search and rescue in Pangnirtung, Poosie Mike, who has worked for the Search and Rescue Organization for 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="223">The last name on my list is Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Maine.</seg>
<seg id="224">Member’s Statement 103 – 5(1): Budget Reflections (Maine)</seg>
<seg id="225">Mr. Maine (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="226">I say “good day” to the people watching the video, Inuit and Qallunaat.</seg>
<seg id="227">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share some observations and recommendations on the government’s financial management system.</seg>
<seg id="228">Mr. Speaker, for those of us who are new here, the last couple of weeks have been a learning experience and experience.</seg>
<seg id="229">Mr. Speaker, as Chair of the Regular Members’ Caucus of the Legislative Assembly, I would like to thank all of my colleagues for the opportunity to work together since the beginning of the new Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="230">Mr. Speaker, I am proud to say that we made a strong public statement on Friday that the Legislative Assembly will no longer accept or accept and that the government must respect its own procurement policies.</seg>
<seg id="231">Mr. Maine (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My colleague from Iqaluit-Tasiluk introduced a very important motion on Friday, which we will move forward with when the House reconvenes its spring sitting.</seg>
<seg id="232">Mr. Speaker, we are a non-governmental government and this is not always a functioning jurisdiction.</seg>
<seg id="233">For example, as I mentioned last week in my opening comments, when I was dealing with the college’s capital estimates, the government listened to our concerns and even made significant changes to the budget.</seg>
<seg id="234">I look forward to seeing more of this happening in the weeks and years ahead, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="235">Mr. Speaker, over the last few weeks, Members of the Legislative Assembly have asked a lot of questions on a daily basis.</seg>
<seg id="236">I think it’s fair to say that we have set a target and it’s clear that we need to do more research on government spending.</seg>
<seg id="237">It’s not enough if we just count our revenues.</seg>
<seg id="238">I would like unanimous consent to conclude my statement, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="239">The member is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statement today. Are there any nays?</seg>
<seg id="240">Mr. Maine, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="241">Mr. Maine: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="242">Mr. Speaker, I am talking about measuring outcomes.</seg>
<seg id="243">Mr. Speaker, this information needs to be made public in the Legislative Assembly so that we as elected Members of the Legislative Assembly can make informed decisions, and should any funding be increased, decreased, or decreased, or eliminated, because we have limited resources.</seg>
<seg id="244">Mr. Speaker, I will use the following examples.</seg>
<seg id="245">I think it’s fair to say that we can agree that the government’s administration of the Income Tax Rebate Program for harvesters is not enough to support harvesters.</seg>
<seg id="246">The Department of Environment, which administers the government’s Harvester Support Program, needs to carefully review its programs and how it can adjust its targets for harvesters to support the cost of fuel.</seg>
<seg id="247">Mr. Speaker, I will also take this opportunity to highlight some of the government’s grants and contributions programs.</seg>
<seg id="248">As we all know, the government has spent tens of millions of dollars on development and promotion.</seg>
<seg id="249">We are aware of the value of the loans that have been made to commercial businesses.</seg>
<seg id="250">We know who gets the money.</seg>
<seg id="251">We don’t know what the purpose of this funding was.</seg>
<seg id="252">We don’t know how many Inuit hired from that fund, we don’t even know what the money was used for.</seg>
<seg id="253">Mr. Speaker, as you know, I can only speak to this issue for a long time, but I’ll leave it at that.</seg>
<seg id="254">In addition, I want to see a clear picture of the budget operations of the Legislative Assembly and I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to strengthen our budget in support of all communities and constituents.</seg>
<seg id="255">Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="256">Member’s Statement 104 – 5(1): Two More Elders Taken Out of Care</seg>
<seg id="257">Mr. Towtongie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="258">Mr. Speaker, residents of Rankin Inlet North and Chesterfield Inlet, I rise today to pay tribute to our eldest, Annie Tatty, who is travelling to Ottawa by air.</seg>
<seg id="259">Also one of our oldest people, Amarok, as I stand today in the House, is sent to Gjoa Haven because there is no elder in Rankin Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="260">I want to be heard by the Member for Rankin Inlet North and Chesterfield Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="261">As soon as I was elected in November, when I was looking at the budget for the Department of Health and Social Services, I asked the minister: where are the plans for the establishment of an elders facility in Rankin Inlet or in Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="262">I was told by the Minister of Health and Social Services that all of us, as MLAs, care for our elders.</seg>
<seg id="263">At the Pond Inlet session, this issue will be brought up.</seg>
<seg id="264">I am waiting.</seg>
<seg id="265">A couple of days ago I rose when we were dealing with capital estimates and I didn’t see it, it was set aside for an elders facility.</seg>
<seg id="266">I was told that I was not allowed to talk about this because I had to resign.</seg>
<seg id="267">However, I was grateful to our Chairman, Allan Rumbolt, who told me that I could continue with my passion towards an elders facility.</seg>
<seg id="268">Now I stand up for myself as an elected official because I am not acceptable.</seg>
<seg id="269">Sending elders south is not acceptable.</seg>
<seg id="270">In order to be a good Member of the Legislative Assembly, we have told our elders to be proud of them and to send them outside of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="271">Member for Amittuq, Mr. Qauniq.</seg>
<seg id="272">Member’s Statement 105 – 5(1): Recognition of Hall Beach and Igloolik Volunteers for Search and Rescue</seg>
<seg id="273">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thought I was forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="274">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my pride in my fellow residents.</seg>
<seg id="275">The search and rescue teams work very hard to search for the people of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="276">They only use their own transportation.</seg>
<seg id="277">I rise today to congratulate the Hall Beach Search and Rescue Team: Chaired by Kyle Issigaitok, second place was George Innuksuk, and co-ordinated by Martha Gibbons Tupik.</seg>
<seg id="278">Another elder, Abraham Ullaraq, is an elder.</seg>
<seg id="279">As I stated, he is the first person to go out and do a search and rescue. He is an elder.</seg>
<seg id="280">Our elders tell the truth.</seg>
<seg id="281">We don’t think that the future is going to be created.</seg>
<seg id="282">Now I’m on this side of the House. Although I do disappoint myself, I think I should have listened again.</seg>
<seg id="283">This is not going to happen to the young people, so when you go out on the land, be prepared.</seg>
<seg id="284">Mr. Speaker, I would also like to recognize the Igloolik Search and Rescue Team. They had a meeting this week in Hall Beach and now spring is upon us, so I wish everyone a safe trip.</seg>
<seg id="285">With that being the case, Mr. Speaker, if you are travelling, please use SPOT devices and ask the elders where I go. If I go, I will catch up.</seg>
<seg id="286">Things like that.</seg>
<seg id="287">I rise today to reiterate that the Department of Community and Government Services has one snowmobile and they have been requesting a response from the Department of Community and Government Services.</seg>
<seg id="288">I would like to see more support provided to search and rescue organizations.</seg>
<seg id="289">That’s it.</seg>
<seg id="290">The last name on the list for South Baffin, Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="291">Member’s Statement 106 – 5(1): Cape Dorset Athletes (Joanasie)</seg>
<seg id="292">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="293">The Cape Dorset High School Sam Pudlat School will be hosting this event and anyone else will be invited to learn music or songwriting skills.</seg>
<seg id="294">Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Cape Dorset Choir. I would also like to thank the Canadian Theatre and the support of the Hamlet of Cape Dorset.</seg>
<seg id="295">There are no nays.</seg>
<seg id="296">Member for Quttiktuq, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="297">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="298">I would like to recognize four people in the Gallery.</seg>
<seg id="299">He is the first Federal Parks Officer in Nunavut. He is Jenna Fern and her staff and always takes care of me and our children, my wife, Carol Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="300">I would also like to thank my sister, Naomi Kok Kuluguq.</seg>
<seg id="301">Another employee of the Legislative Assembly who came to Iqaluit to attend school. She stays with us as our daughter. She always takes our daughter to school and I am very proud of her. Please join me in welcoming Jayden Natanine.</seg>
<seg id="302">Maybe I’ll give you a little bit of background.</seg>
<seg id="303">When I was a child, I was still a child…</seg>
<seg id="304">…I was expecting a seal for the first time in a lake.</seg>
<seg id="305">I don’t think there were many people who were expecting a seal pup in a lake, but we were on a sandy island.</seg>
<seg id="306">They helped a lot and I was my mother and father.</seg>
<seg id="307">I would like to thank them for coming here.</seg>
<seg id="308">Mr. Uttak and your spouse, welcome to your Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="309">Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="310">Mr. Towtongie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="311">My parents in Wager Bay, my mother is now a park. All of us were given pictures and I recognize you very much and thank our eldest and youngest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I was staying in Igloolik and Theresa Uttak gave me a cup of tea and Louie Uttak. Thank you for your excellent food and I will be staying with you again.</seg>
<seg id="313">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="314">Welcome to the Gallery.</seg>
<seg id="315">Member for Kugluktuk, Ms. Kamingoak.</seg>
<seg id="316">Mr. Mikkungwak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="317">I would like to recognize Naomi Cox Kuluguqtuq and Carol Akeeagok, who are my relatives.</seg>
<seg id="318">Naomi is from Grise Fiord and I don’t have that many relatives every day.</seg>
<seg id="319">Welcome to your Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="320">Member for Pangnirtung, Ms. Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="321">Mr. Nakasuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would also like to recognize and congratulate my husband for being here, Andrew Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="322">Welcome.</seg>
<seg id="323">Mr. Nakashuk, welcome to the Gallery.</seg>
<seg id="324">Recognition of Visitors in the Gallery. I have no more names on my list.</seg>
<seg id="325">We will move on in our orders of the day.</seg>
<seg id="326">We will start with the Hon. Member for Iqaluit-Tasiluk, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="327">Question 123 – 5(1): Legal Aid Bill (Hickes)</seg>
<seg id="328">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="329">My questions are for the Minister of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="330">Mr. Speaker, as I indicated to my colleagues over the last couple of weeks and weeks, I have raised the issue of referees’ training and standardized training.</seg>
<seg id="331">Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the minister if, as a government, he will be introducing legislation for the Western Premiers.</seg>
<seg id="332">Minister of Justice, Minister Iqaqrialu.</seg>
<seg id="333">Hon. Jeannie Iqalukjuak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker and I thank Mr. Hickes for the question.</seg>
<seg id="334">As of today, the Government of Nunavut doesn’t have a Code of Values and Ethics.</seg>
<seg id="335">Mr. Speaker, the department is well aware that we have hired a number of companies to work in our communities, such as health centres.</seg>
<seg id="336">We are currently in the process of reviewing the policy for establishing a Nunavut Business Credit Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="337">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="338">As the minister said, he was one of the last provinces in Canada that doesn’t have a private penny policy. We want to make sure that we have the private sector that has the ability to be accountable and provide professional services.</seg>
<seg id="339">Mr. Speaker, in every region, we have passed legislation on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="340">I guess my next question is: once they’re doing a review of the Public Service Act, will a legislative proposal be tabled in the House?</seg>
<seg id="341">Minister Iqaqrialu.</seg>
<seg id="342">Hon. Jeannie Iqalukjuak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="343">Your final supplementary, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="344">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="345">I thank the minister for that commitment.</seg>
<seg id="346">Mr. Speaker, I would just like to take this opportunity to note that the Department of Justice has oversight responsibility for the RCMP. Does the Law Enforcement Division work with the Department of Community and Government Services to coordinate the contract if the Government of Nunavut has a contract?</seg>
<seg id="347">Hon. Jeannie Iqalukjuak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) The regulations or policies are prepared by the Department of Justice or any other department in drafting policies, so we try to involve our department from the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="348">I don’t have that information in front of me, but I can look into it and get back to you.</seg>
<seg id="349">Question 124 – 5(1): Status of Clean-up in Baker Lake (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="350">Mr. Mikkungwak (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="351">My questions are for the Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="352">I would like to follow up on some of the questions that I asked the minister last week regarding the clean-up of the contaminated site in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="353">In one of his responses to me, the minister indicated that a “final report” would be prepared and submitted to the Qulliq Energy Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="354">Will the minister commit to providing copies of the report to both the Hamlet Council of Baker Lake and as the MLA for the community?</seg>
<seg id="355">Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation, Minister Iqaluk.</seg>
<seg id="356">Hon. Jeannie Iqalukjuak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Yes, Mr. Mikkungwak, I can commit to doing that.</seg>
<seg id="357">Your first supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="358">I thank the minister for that commitment.</seg>
<seg id="359">Mr. Speaker, I would be pleased to hear that the Qulliq Energy Corporation would be willing to work with the Hamlet of Baker Lake to clean up the remaining site. Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to hear that news for the hamlet when I return to the community next week and I encourage the hamlet staff and the QEC to meet with their colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="360">Mr. Speaker, I don’t think that would be possible because the Qulliq Energy Corporation’s headquarters are located in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="361">The minister indicated that the Qulliq Energy Corporation has already spent $1.68 million to date on the clean-up.</seg>
<seg id="362">Can the minister clarify how much it would cost to clean up the remaining site?</seg>
<seg id="363">Minister Iqaqrialu.</seg>
<seg id="364">Hon. Jeannie Iqalukjuak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) The total clean-up project would be approximately $10 million. The Power Corporation has that kind of money that I mentioned earlier since the creation of Nunavut and the federal government is responsible for cleaning up the site.</seg>
<seg id="365">We have been very interested in working with the Hamlet of Baker Lake to clean up the current contaminated site.</seg>
<seg id="366">Your final supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="367">As I noted in my questions last week, the federal and territorial governments have not finalized the rates yet.</seg>
<seg id="368">Mr. Speaker, I am in support of the Qulliq Energy Corporation’s position on the damages caused by the Qulliq Energy Corporation’s failure to comply with the Affordable Energy Fund when it was under the federal government’s responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="369">Will the Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation commit to working with the Minister of Justice to review and clarify legal options that may be open to this issue?</seg>
<seg id="370">Hon. Jeannie Iqalukjuak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Yes, as the Minister of Energy and Justice, we will work together to resolve this issue.</seg>
<seg id="371">Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, Mr. Lightfoot.</seg>
<seg id="372">Question 125 – 5(1): School Strike Policy (Lighthizer)</seg>
<seg id="373">My questions are for the Public Service Act.</seg>
<seg id="374">Over the past few years, the Public Service Annual Report has been tabled in the Legislative Assembly on the Public Service Annual Report of the Public Service of the Government of Nunavut concerning the use of the Public Service Act.</seg>
<seg id="375">Unfortunately, the 2016-17 annual report did not include this information.</seg>
<seg id="376">Will the minister provide the Legislative Assembly with that information?</seg>
<seg id="377">Minister of Finance, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="378">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="379">It seems like the member wants us to go through the annual report and I’m sure that we will be able to table it at that time because it’s published throughout the year.</seg>
<seg id="380">I don’t know if it’s going to be there, but I can look into it.</seg>
<seg id="381">Your first supplementary, Mr. Lighthizer.</seg>
<seg id="382">I would just like to ask the minister if he can provide that information to the House as to how many employees took advantage of the FANS program in 2016-17.</seg>
<seg id="383">Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="384">Speaker (interpretation): The question has been taken as notice.</seg>
<seg id="385">Member for Pangnirtung, Ms. Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="386">Question 126 – 5(1): Status of Old Pangnirtung Health Centre (Nakasuk)</seg>
<seg id="387">Mr. Nakasuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="388">My questions today are for the Minister of Community and Government Services.</seg>
<seg id="389">Mr. Speaker, I have asked the minister about the old Pangnirtung Health Centre that is no longer usable after the new health centre was installed and opened.</seg>
<seg id="390">Although the old health centre has not been used for a long time, it remains closed.</seg>
<seg id="391">My question for the minister is: does the minister have any idea of what’s going to happen with the old health centre?</seg>
<seg id="392">Minister of Community and Government Services, Minister Kusugak.</seg>
<seg id="393">Hon. Paul Kusugak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="394">I thank my colleague for that question.</seg>
<seg id="395">When these old buildings are no longer being used by the Government of Nunavut, when they are no longer being used by the Department of Executive and Intergovernmental Affairs, questions arise as to whether other government programs would be used.</seg>
<seg id="396">The old health centre, which was built in 1975 in Pangnirtung, went through the same process.</seg>
<seg id="397">The Department of Health no longer wants to use it.</seg>
<seg id="398">We did consult with various governments and we did not hear from anyone interested in it.</seg>
<seg id="399">According to the Government of Nunavut’s policies, we are now making plans to see if the hamlet would like to see it transferred to the Hamlet of Repulse Bay.</seg>
<seg id="400">If they don’t want it, then we would go further to the communities that don’t have any income.</seg>
<seg id="401">There is a process that goes through the GN’s disposal process.</seg>
<seg id="402">That’s where we are at right now.</seg>
<seg id="403">Your first supplementary, Ms. Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="404">If I understood the question correctly, the communities have been asked if they want to start taking over these positions or what is the status of that?</seg>
<seg id="405">Hon. Paul Kusugak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="406">We haven’t heard any requests from the government.</seg>
<seg id="407">At this time, we are in the planning stages to see if the hamlet would be interested in this project. At this time, we are in the planning stages to see if the hamlet would be interested in this project.</seg>
<seg id="408">That is where we are at right now.</seg>
<seg id="409">Your final supplementary, Ms. Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="410">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="411">I don’t know if the hamlet or the hamlet would be interested, but if it doesn’t work from there, what happens when the old government buildings are no longer being used?</seg>
<seg id="412">I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="413">There are four types of holes that we use.</seg>
<seg id="414">For example, when the old Pangnirtung Health Centre was no longer wanted by health professionals, we asked if they were interested in other government departments.</seg>
<seg id="415">They didn’t want it so we will look into it to see if the hamlet wants it.</seg>
<seg id="416">Those are the types of things that we use when we go through that process.</seg>
<seg id="417">Member for Aivilik, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="418">Question 127 – 5(1): Social Services Client Travel Policy (Netser)</seg>
<seg id="419">Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation) I am a seal.</seg>
<seg id="420">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="421">I would like to start off today by saying “good afternoon” to them. Ever since I have been here, I haven’t said “good afternoon” to them, so I say “good afternoon” to them.</seg>
<seg id="422">We will be going home soon.</seg>
<seg id="423">Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that some of Nunavut’s most vulnerable people have to travel south for treatment, away from their families.</seg>
<seg id="424">Mr. Speaker, I agree with you that when you are visited by a family member, it really changes.</seg>
<seg id="425">The Department of Family Services’ Travel Policy is on the government’s website dated June 2013 and came into force on March 31, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="426">It is my understanding that the previous Minister of Family Services has agreed to change the Family Travel Policy.</seg>
<seg id="427">Can the minister indicate if any changes to the Department of Family Services’ Client Travel Policy have been made since 2013 and, if not, will it change after March 31 of this year?</seg>
<seg id="428">Minister of Family Services, Mr. Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="429">Hon. Joe Savikataaq: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="430">Mr. Speaker, I can’t speak on behalf of the minister myself first, but what I can say is that the policy will be in place until the end of March 2018 and it will remain in place until the new changes are made.</seg>
<seg id="431">I haven’t heard of any Department of Family Services staff working to change the policy.</seg>
<seg id="432">If it needs to be changed, we can look at it and see if it needs to be changed, but we can’t change it unless we review it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="433">If there is a need for a change that seems to be beneficial to the clients and the government then we can look into it.</seg>
<seg id="434">Your first supplementary, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="435">Mr. Netser (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="436">The Department of Family Services’ Family Travel Policy states that an elder in the care of the Department of Family Services, who is in the care of the Department of Family Services, can be visited by two family members or guardians on an annual basis.</seg>
<seg id="437">Can the minister confirm whether or not this policy has been amended to allow two visits per year to occur?</seg>
<seg id="438">Two return tickets, two of them can travel at the same time or one can travel twice.</seg>
<seg id="439">Just to be clear, there are two return tickets per year for one client.</seg>
<seg id="440">Your final supplementary, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="441">Mr. Netser (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Will the minister commit to considering changing the family travel policy for adults in care?</seg>
<seg id="442">The policy will expire very shortly and at the end of the day, we will have to review it, but I can’t commit at this time until we review the whole policy.</seg>
<seg id="443">I’m sure there’s going to be a review in terms of all the travel that the Department of Family Services pays for is medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="444">We will have to work with the Department of Health and Social Services to make sure that the policies are adhered to, but I can’t commit to anything else at this time because the Medical Travel Policy will expire soon and I’m sure that the contents of the policy will be reviewed very carefully.</seg>
<seg id="445">Member for Netsilik, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="446">Question 128 – 5(1): Update on Medical Travel Office (Qirngnuq)</seg>
<seg id="447">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="448">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Health.</seg>
<seg id="449">Mr. Speaker, from time to time, a number of my constituents come to my office in the community to seek support for their medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="450">Mr. Speaker, the minister often tells the House that Nunavummiut can call the Patient Relations Office if they have concerns.</seg>
<seg id="451">Mr. Speaker, language and where you come from is a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="452">Can the minister tell us what other avenues the Office of Patient Relations can be made aware of?</seg>
<seg id="453">Minister of Health, Ms. Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="454">Hon. Pat Angnakak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="455">I understand your concern.</seg>
<seg id="456">I don’t have that information with me at this time. He also has an email address and a fax number.</seg>
<seg id="457">Your first supplementary, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="458">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) I don’t know if I answered the question, but I don’t know which way I’ll ask it.</seg>
<seg id="459">Mr. Speaker, the Information and Privacy Commissioner has raised concerns about privacy concerns, and </seg>
<seg id="460">The Ombudsman has a form that identifies complaints or concerns.</seg>
<seg id="461">But if you don’t have a fax machine, they can’t send it on their own. They don’t have all the computers and they can’t take pictures of what’s going to be put on the computer, the e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="462">Can the minister clarify why the Office of Patient Relations is not allowed to send a fax to the Office of the Legislative Assembly?</seg>
<seg id="463">An Hon. Member: Good question.</seg>
<seg id="464">Ms. Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="465">That’s a very good question.</seg>
<seg id="466">I think it’s because the fax machines are getting smaller and smaller out there. With the rapid advancement of technology as a government, we’re starting to use more technology than paper.</seg>
<seg id="467">According to my substantiation sheet, the government has a website that can be viewed at www.patientrelations@gov.nu.ca. Every community has health centres.</seg>
<seg id="468">If you want to fax the application forms, you can send them out. There are also government liaison officers in every community.</seg>
<seg id="469">They can be sent by fax to our headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="470">If the patient relations office didn’t have a fax machine, I would be able to find out why.</seg>
<seg id="471">Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="472">Question 129 – 5(1): Income Support Policies</seg>
<seg id="473">Mr. Towtongie: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="474">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="475">Mr. Speaker, I would like to follow up on some of the questions that were asked by the Member for Kugluktuk regarding the Income Support Program.</seg>
<seg id="476">Mr. Speaker, the minister indicated that the Income Support Program Review Division is one of the programs to make sure that income support clients receive a signed program.</seg>
<seg id="477">Can the minister describe how exploring a project will lead to good selection when it is clear that it does not have a mandate?</seg>
<seg id="478">Minister of Family Services, Minister Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="479">In regard to the Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission, I would think that if there is no job available, then it’s useless, but sometimes they can get a job or a short job.</seg>
<seg id="480">Perhaps, if it was the appropriate time for the search and rescue team to go to another department at the appropriate time while there is work to be done.</seg>
<seg id="481">Your first supplementary, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="482">This income support is a policy and not a Government of Nunavut policy.</seg>
<seg id="483">If it was an Act like an Arts and Crafts Act then we wouldn’t be able to do that as Members of the Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="484">What I see is when a young person doesn’t have a job to do on their own, and they ask them to sign a blank cheque on a monthly basis, and that’s what they’re going to do every month, it’s kind of embarrassing and touching, and I’m sure that the income support recipient has put themselves down because they don’t get a job.</seg>
<seg id="485">Can the minister clearly explain what specific Nunavut-specific policies are available for outpost camps?</seg>
<seg id="486">Right now it is a binder that is not geared towards Nunavut in the north.</seg>
<seg id="487">The policy is for Nunavut only.</seg>
<seg id="488">The Nunavut Land Claims Agreement applies only to Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="489">The Income Support Program was reviewed and the policy changed.</seg>
<seg id="490">At this time, there is still money available for income support and the Child Tax Deduction for Nunavut income support recipients.</seg>
<seg id="491">He signed a petition and I would like you to see me again because I feel for them.</seg>
<seg id="492">If you don’t have a job, then you won’t be able to get a job. However, we have to make good choices. However, we will look into this further.</seg>
<seg id="493">Question 130 – 5(1): Mine Training</seg>
<seg id="494">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="495">I rise today to direct my question to the Minister of Economic Development and Transportation.</seg>
<seg id="496">Mr. Speaker, I firmly believe that when the mining sector tries to create jobs and take care of the environment, the benefits come from it.</seg>
<seg id="497">I guess my question today will be in regard to apprenticeship programs.</seg>
<seg id="498">Last year, you tabled the 2017-18 Main Estimates for the Department of Economic Development and Transportation and it states that there was $200,000 involved in the Nunavut Mine Training Program.</seg>
<seg id="499">Can the minister provide an example of how much money was spent in 2017-18?</seg>
<seg id="500">Mr. Speaker, I hope I was understandable.</seg>
<seg id="501">Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Ms. Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="502">Hon. Elizabeth Sheutiapik (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="503">I also thank the member for his question.</seg>
<seg id="504">In terms of the Mine Training Program, what I can say is that it doesn’t include all the details of how it was used.</seg>
<seg id="505">The department is working with the Department of Family Services, Nunavut Arctic College, the federal government, the mining industry, and Inuit organizations to develop a number of programs to prepare Nunavummiut for opportunities in mining. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="506">Your first supplementary, Mr. Harper.</seg>
<seg id="507">Coming back (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="508">I thank the minister for that answer.</seg>
<seg id="509">Is it possible for the Department of Finance to increase or decrease the budget for the 2018-19 fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="510">Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="511">I can’t respond to that question at this time, but I’m sorry if I can go back to the member’s question about how the $200,000 has been spent.</seg>
<seg id="512">The Kitikmeot Corporation Apprenticeship Program, $61,000 was used for this program, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association Literacy Program for the Baffin region, $60,000, and the Hamlet of Arviat’s Employment Readiness Program of $78,000.</seg>
<seg id="513">Thank you for clarifying my question.</seg>
<seg id="514">Mr. Speaker, as you may have noticed last week, I tabled a number of mine-based projects called the Northern Erie Mining Company, which is called Northern Quebec.</seg>
<seg id="515">They will be working near Hall Beach this spring.</seg>
<seg id="516">I wonder if the minister and his department can work with the Northern Air Company, not just the Northern Air Company but with the mining companies, to see how they can benefit from training opportunities in the High Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="517">Mr. Speaker, Hall Beach is an outpost camp and they’re going to be getting a lot of money. However, I would like to thank the people of Hall Beach.</seg>
<seg id="518">You also stated that you will be supporting the mining industry.</seg>
<seg id="519">What I’m trying to ask, Mr. Speaker, is: will you be able to deal with the funding that you have identified for the Mary River project?</seg>
<seg id="520">There is Mary River in the Baffin region, there’s Kivalliq region, there’s Kivalliq region, there’s Gold Mine in the Kitikmeot.</seg>
<seg id="521">Will these issues be dealt with properly?</seg>
<seg id="522">For example, as an Inuk, if I wanted to pursue a higher career, how would I qualify for training and how would the Department of Economic Development and Transportation be able to assist me?</seg>
<seg id="523">Hon. Elizabeth Sheutiapik (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also thank the member for raising a good question because ED&amp;T is not responsible for that.</seg>
<seg id="524">There are inter-departmental partnerships with the Department of Education and the Mine Training Division, and it’s also important to recognize that the mining sector varies from community to community. We need to take that into consideration.</seg>
<seg id="525">Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="526">Oral Questions.</seg>
<seg id="527">Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Maine.</seg>
<seg id="528">Question 131 – 5(1): Support for Medical Staff (Maine)</seg>
<seg id="529">Mr. Maine (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="530">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="531">First of all, I would like to state that my question relates to many communities, not just my community.</seg>
<seg id="532">I’m sure this is happening all over Nunavut, especially with our nurses and health professionals.</seg>
<seg id="533">Mr. Speaker, if they know, one of the reasons why they are overworked in English is because they don’t have enough jobs in English. They have to fill one nurse.</seg>
<seg id="534">The reason for the lack of staff is because of the lack of staff and because of the lack of staff, there is a lot of work to be done.</seg>
<seg id="535">It seems obvious that this causes poverty.</seg>
<seg id="536">I hope I was understandable because I am speaking in Inuktitut, even if I was understood.</seg>
<seg id="537">If I say it in English, Mr. Speaker, the number of employees is increasing. Due to the lack of staff, the workforce is getting tired and the workload is increasing.</seg>
<seg id="538">My question for the minister is: can the minister tell the House what steps his department has taken to provide additional support to health care workers in communities that have a lot of work to do?</seg>
<seg id="539">Minister of Health, Ms. Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="540">I thank the member for that very important question.</seg>
<seg id="541">The issue of staffing the health centre is very important and we have been working very hard as a department to make sure that we don’t have a shortage of staff at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="542">We would like to see that happen, but we do have a shortage.</seg>
<seg id="543">I know that yes, I know that the nurses are exhausted.</seg>
<seg id="544">Our department does its best to do what it can.</seg>
<seg id="545">We just did that in the community. When the nurse is tired, we sent more nurses to provide support.</seg>
<seg id="546">The other information that I have is that the person who sends the nurse out is when there is a lot of work to do.</seg>
<seg id="547">When a nurse does something, whether it’s on vacation or sick leave, or a nurse in that situation, we look at where we can get an escort from within the community.</seg>
<seg id="548">In terms of recruiting nurses, we don’t want to decrease the number of nurses in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="549">Your first supplementary, Mr. Maine.</seg>
<seg id="550">Mr. Maine: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="551">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="552">I think we’re all concerned about the department’s staffing numbers. I’ll use my two communities as an example, it’s clear that there are still too many vacant positions in the health centres.</seg>
<seg id="553">In Essex, 70 percent are vacant, and Arviat is 44 percent vacant.</seg>
<seg id="554">I know that it’s a challenge and it’s a difficult one.</seg>
<seg id="555">So I would like to ask the minister if she could explain the challenges that her department faces in terms of having adequate staff at community health centres that are always very busy.</seg>
<seg id="556">Hon. Minister.</seg>
<seg id="557">We can’t retain them after 30 months. They are trained and maybe they’re not new. It’s very difficult to be a nurse in a community.</seg>
<seg id="558">One of the things that you have to look at is the Department of Community and Government Services. We have been working very hard to set up the Department of Community and Government Services.</seg>
<seg id="559">Your final supplementary, Mr. Maine.</seg>
<seg id="560">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="561">Maybe we should put it another way. Mr. Speaker, we all know that there are problems in the communities. There is always a lot of work to do and there is always a shortage of health professionals.</seg>
<seg id="562">I would like to understand clearly what is actually happening to address these problems in the communities. What is being done and what is being considered to address these problems in the communities?</seg>
<seg id="563">What is being done and what is being considered to ensure that our nurses and other health professionals are supported by the department?</seg>
<seg id="564">Hon. Pat Angnakak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="565">Just to be clear, I don’t have that level of detail in terms of operations and maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="566">For example, if we’re open only for emergencies, they can’t make an appointment on a regular basis because of the workload, or if there are too many nurses leaving for whatever reason.</seg>
<seg id="567">In the department, as I said earlier, trying to fill all of the positions is a challenge because we are competing with the rest of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="568">That’s what we’re trying to do. I know that they work with people who have experience in the north, not in the north, like Northern Manitoba.</seg>
<seg id="569">I know that the Department of Health and Social Services is well aware of the processes that our nurses use.</seg>
<seg id="570">It’s not an easy fix, but I have to keep working on it. If you have any ideas, let me know.</seg>
<seg id="571">Question 132 – 5(1): Insurance Policy for Government Property (Hickes)</seg>
<seg id="572">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="573">My questions are for the Minister of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="574">As we all know, Mr. Speaker, every community in Nunavut has a wide range of infrastructure, terminal buildings, health centres, schools, and office buildings.</seg>
<seg id="575">My question to the minister is: when the insurance is in place, is that infrastructure going to be one-on-one or is it done separately on a case-by-case basis?</seg>
<seg id="576">Minister of Finance, Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="577">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="578">Each of our infrastructure has different policies and some don’t even have policies at all. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="579">Mr. Speaker, I recently saw on the news that in some of our communities, there was another school burning down.</seg>
<seg id="580">Mr. Speaker, the Department of Finance is trying to solve the infrastructure problem by having a proper contingency plan. We learned that our own cost in Arctic Bay is $10 million.</seg>
<seg id="581">What impact will it have on the WCB in the event of another school fire? Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="582">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Today, the current insurance coverage has increased from $10 million to $20 million for schools as a result of fires.</seg>
<seg id="583">We continue to lobby the Department of Education and all of us to lobby the federal government to address these very costly and unfortunate incidences.</seg>
<seg id="584">So I think we should all try and demonstrate that we can continue to work with safety measures. We need to show that our own costs are increasing and that we have our own insurance system. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="585">Yes, I understand exactly where I’m concerned, but I don’t know if the Municipal Insurance Program will cover half of the cost.</seg>
<seg id="586">I asked that question.</seg>
<seg id="587">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="588">Mr. Speaker, the new $20 million is for school fires.</seg>
<seg id="589">Our schools and other buildings have to pay $1 million on their own.</seg>
<seg id="590">There are different things.</seg>
<seg id="591">I can’t say how many schools will have to burn down, they are no longer insured.</seg>
<seg id="592">Mr. Speaker, I sincerely hope that we don’t have a fire in this government and I thank all of the Members of the Legislative Assembly and I have to keep pushing for this because this is a school for our children and for the public...</seg>
<seg id="593">Not only for the schools but also for the hospitals as these are very important services that we provide.</seg>
<seg id="594">Any damage is a challenge to our clients and I continue to push for these facilities.</seg>
<seg id="595">So Mr. Speaker, a reminder.</seg>
<seg id="596">It’s a public building. It’s a public building. It’s a public building. It’s a public building. It’s a public building. It’s a public building.</seg>
<seg id="597">I applaud you for bringing that forward to the House. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="598">Question 133 – 5(1): Expansion of Educational Opportunities in Baker Lake (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="599">My questions are for the Minister responsible for Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="600">Mr. Speaker, as I noted in my Member’s Statement, the Fifth Legislative Assembly of Nunavut has an opportunity to bring our territory to a brighter future.</seg>
<seg id="601">Can the minister tell the House if he would be willing to reopen the idea of establishing a university in your community in partnership with the private sector and other stakeholders?</seg>
<seg id="602">Minister responsible for Nunavut Arctic College, Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="603">I thank the Member for Baker Lake for that question.</seg>
<seg id="604">With Nunavut Arctic College, we advertised various campuses outside of Nunavut to see how we can work together.</seg>
<seg id="605">We have heard of various organizations, such as Agnico-Eagle, who are interested in establishing a university for Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="606">We would like to see this go ahead, but to date, we have been negotiating an agreement with Nunavut Arctic College to try and work together with Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="607">Mr. Speaker, I strongly believe that we need to provide funding for increased education from Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit to the Piqqusilirivvik Cultural School Diploma Program.</seg>
<seg id="608">I feel that Baker Lake would be a very good location for that kind of expansion.</seg>
<seg id="609">Can the minister clarify whether he and his officials have spoken with the board of governors of Nunavut Arctic College to come up with a vision of how more opportunities for post-secondary education can be delivered to Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="610">Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="611">With Nunavut Arctic College, we would like to see more opportunities for Nunavummiut to pursue post-secondary education in their communities. We would like to see more and more opportunities available for Nunavummiut to take post-secondary education in their communities. We would like to see more and more awareness of this online program.</seg>
<seg id="612">In regard to the member’s question about the Piqqusilirivvik Cultural School, we are looking at how we can expand it further.</seg>
<seg id="613">Yes, the Board of Governors of Nunavut Arctic College will be involved. My staff, the president of Nunavut Arctic College, and the vice-president of Nunavut Arctic College, will be making plans to move this forward.</seg>
<seg id="614">Your final supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="615">Mr. Mikkungwak: Mr. Speaker, I recognize that the previous government accepted a recommendation that Nunavut Arctic College not be established at that time.</seg>
<seg id="616">Will the minister commit to getting back to this issue and reporting back to the House on how he is aware of it?</seg>
<seg id="617">Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="618">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thank Mr. Mikkungwak for the question.</seg>
<seg id="619">The option of building a university in Nunavut is being considered by a number of people.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Agnico Eagle Mines Corporation is also proposing $5 million to build a new university if there is interest in it.</seg>
<seg id="621">I think the discussions are ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="622">Right now, over the next four years, I don’t know if we want to go that route. Once the feasibility study is done, that would be part of the study.</seg>
<seg id="623">Members, please note that the time for question period has expired.</seg>
<seg id="624">Mr. Maine.</seg>
<seg id="625">Motion 015 – 5(1): Extension of Question Period (Maine)</seg>
<seg id="626">Mr. Maine (interpretation): Pursuant to Rule 39(7), I move, seconded by the Hon. Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, that question period be extended. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="627">The motion is in order and the motion is not debatable.</seg>
<seg id="628">All those in favour of the motion, raise your hand.</seg>
<seg id="629">Opposed.</seg>
<seg id="630">As such, we have extended the allotted time for oral questions by 30 minutes, starting from now on.</seg>
<seg id="631">Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Maine.</seg>
<seg id="632">Question 134 – 5(1): Grants and Contributions (Maine)</seg>
<seg id="633">Mr. Maine (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="634">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Environment.</seg>
<seg id="635">I rise today to ask about the Department of Environment’s Harvesters Assistance Program and I would like to understand how they provide assistance to our hunters.</seg>
<seg id="636">Looking at our government’s main estimates for 2017-18, there are three main areas.</seg>
<seg id="637">Let me speak in English so that I can be clear, there are three grants that the Department of Environment administers, disaster compensation, and the Fur Pricing Program.</seg>
<seg id="638">The department has been allocated $150,000 for this fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="639">Mr. Speaker, I would first like to ask the minister: can the minister describe how the Department of Environment determines the effectiveness of these programs?</seg>
<seg id="640">Minister of Environment, Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="641">Hon. Elizabeth Sheutiapik (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="642">The auction was held three times a year and the auction was recently held in early March. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="643">Your first supplementary, Mr. Maine.</seg>
<seg id="644">I thank the minister for that information.</seg>
<seg id="645">Mr. Speaker, the information that has been provided to this House over the years is something that I really wanted to see and I think the hunters should see.</seg>
<seg id="646">In 2011, the Department of Environment reported that the sale of sealskins at auction amounted to $800,000.</seg>
<seg id="647">In 2012, it cost $1.1 million and in 2013, it was $1.04 million.</seg>
<seg id="648">Mr. Speaker, can the minister provide me with an update on the status of the sealing industry this year? I would like to get the latest information on whether this year or last year’s sealing industry is still a viable source of revenue?</seg>
<seg id="649">Hon. Elizabeth Sheutiapik (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="650">I can't say where they are at right now because I don't have the latest bids.</seg>
<seg id="651">What I can tell you is that after the Northern Lights Fur Trade Show, sales of sealskins go up and I’m sure they will, but at that time, we will be able to find out the results of the fur auction. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="652">Your final supplementary, Mr. Maine.</seg>
<seg id="653">I also thank the minister.</seg>
<seg id="654">This will be my last question, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="655">I wonder if the Department of Environment can consider whether they can provide more funding to our harvesters.</seg>
<seg id="656">With respect to fox hunting, we are all aware of the issue of sealskins in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="657">I believe that the amount of money that is used for one year is too small, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="658">I think it’s too small.</seg>
<seg id="659">I would like to ask the minister if he agrees with me and if he can look into this further in the coming months.</seg>
<seg id="660">I agree with you, and I look forward to bringing forward to this House a request for an increase if you support it.</seg>
<seg id="661">Question 135 – 5(1): Compensation for Damage to Hunters and Trappers (Keyootak)</seg>
<seg id="662">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Environment.</seg>
<seg id="663">Mr. Speaker, as we all know, in Nunavut, hunters are often victimized by polar bears. Their cabins are damaged and their snowmobiles are damaged.</seg>
<seg id="664">Mr. Speaker, the Disaster Compensation Program provides compensation for damages. However, it is very difficult to replace the equipment that has been damaged.</seg>
<seg id="665">Has the funding for damaged property been spent this year?</seg>
<seg id="666">Minister of Environment, Ms. Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="667">I’m sorry I didn’t hear everything.</seg>
<seg id="668">Can he repeat his question?</seg>
<seg id="669">Speaker (interpretation): Please repeat your first question, Mr. Keyootak.</seg>
<seg id="670">Our equipment, snowmobiles and cabins are damaged by polar bears, especially when we are away.</seg>
<seg id="671">Mr. Speaker, we know that there are compensation programs available for damages and damages that we have left behind.</seg>
<seg id="672">My question was: has this year’s budget been used for damages?</seg>
<seg id="673">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you for that clarification.</seg>
<seg id="674">Minister of Environment, Ms. Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="675">Your first supplementary, Mr. Keyootak.</seg>
<seg id="676">The minister indicated that he would respond once he gets that information.</seg>
<seg id="677">Can the minister provide a breakdown of how much has been spent in the Baffin, Kivalliq, and Kitikmeot regions?</seg>
<seg id="678">Yes, I will give him a breakdown.</seg>
<seg id="679">Question 136 – 5(1): Early Childhood and Early Childhood Services (Hickes)</seg>
<seg id="680">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Education.</seg>
<seg id="681">The announcement from the Minister of Education this afternoon indicated that all licensed daycares will be able to get additional licenses depending on where they are located.</seg>
<seg id="682">How much is being considered to be provided to licensed daycares?</seg>
<seg id="683">Minister responsible for the Housing Corporation, Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="684">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="685">I thank Mr. Hickes for the question.</seg>
<seg id="686">The Department of Education’s Executive and Intergovernmental Affairs Committee approved a three-year agreement. Over the next three years, it has been divided into four.</seg>
<seg id="687">I would like you to have a clear breakdown of what that amount is, the O&amp;M total of $1.1 million per year, broken down by year.</seg>
<seg id="688">Those are the numbers that I have.</seg>
<seg id="689">I thank the minister for that clarification.</seg>
<seg id="690">Mr. Speaker, when I review the Child Day Care Act in Nunavut, it lists Early Childhood Education Act, No. 17. It says that all employees who deal with day-to-day childcare require adequate training. That is one of the expectations that I have.</seg>
<seg id="691">Mr. Speaker, I know that in the Early Childhood Education Program, Arctic College is responsible for that.</seg>
<seg id="692">I’m just wondering if the minister could give us an idea of how they’re doing, how they’re doing, how they’re doing, how they’re doing, how they’re doing, how they’re doing, how they’re doing, how they’re doing, how they’re doing, how they’re doing, how they’re doing, and how they’re doing, how they’re doing, and how they’re doing, how they’re doing, how they’re doing, how they’re</seg>
<seg id="693">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also thank Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="694">Training is part of the agreement for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="695">The $1.1 million is outside of O&amp;M.</seg>
<seg id="696">We would like to get more certified educators in early childhood education and early childhood education.</seg>
<seg id="697">So that’s one of the things that we’re looking forward to expanding is training on-the-job training, and we’re looking forward to that over the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="698">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thank the minister.</seg>
<seg id="699">I look forward to getting that information from the House.</seg>
<seg id="700">When I look at the daycare staff and the curriculum that is available, I always hear that when employees are trained, they seem to be more effective in their training.</seg>
<seg id="701">Mr. Speaker, I have also heard concerns that there is a lack of income for daycare workers.</seg>
<seg id="702">Providing consistent education to our children in early childhood education is critical to maintaining stability in the workforce.</seg>
<seg id="703">This funding is to help daycare workers get better wages so that they can work there as full-time employees rather than working there on a part-time basis.</seg>
<seg id="704">Yes, I agree with Mr. Hickes. I fully understand and agree with him. We want our children to be well prepared. We want them to learn and succeed in life before they enter the school system.</seg>
<seg id="705">That’s what we’re trying to do to provide support to daycare staff.</seg>
<seg id="706">Part of the agreement is that as long as the parents don’t increase the cost of childcare services, I think we can do something to ensure that the staff at the daycare are adequately compensated for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="707">We’re still working on it to make sure that we have daycare workers throughout Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="708">Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Maine.</seg>
<seg id="709">Question 137 – 5(1): Inuit Employment Requirements for Government Contracts</seg>
<seg id="710">Last Friday, March 16, I asked the Minister of Community and Government Services some questions. I had a discussion with the minister and I wanted more information on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="711">The number of Inuit working within the Nunavut Housing Corporation will be increasing.</seg>
<seg id="712">Mr. Speaker, the minister and I seem to agree that he was in support of increasing Inuit employment.</seg>
<seg id="713">About 20 percent of this is related to the construction of the Baffin Correctional Centre and the docking facilities in Iqaluit and Pond Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="714">If I understood your question correctly, Mr. Speaker, the ratio is between 20 percent and 15 percent.</seg>
<seg id="715">Can the minister explain how we would change the bid process to increase the number of RFPs?</seg>
<seg id="716">Minister of Community and Government Services, Minister Kusugak.</seg>
<seg id="717">I’m sure the minister understands that when projects are undertaken, the Department of Community and Government Services provides assistance to the departments that are going to have the facilities.</seg>
<seg id="718">If it’s going to be a docking facility, if we’re talking about the Department of Economic Development and Transportation, we’re talking about correctional facilities.</seg>
<seg id="719">We work with them to make sure that the contracts are being adhered to. We assist them because we don’t have any control over that.</seg>
<seg id="720">We work with the client departments to determine how many Inuit can be employed.</seg>
<seg id="721">We try to make sure that they don’t go over budget and if they’re going to go over budget, then they’re going to fall through the cracks and we try to make sure that they get what they’re supposed to be able to get.</seg>
<seg id="722">At this time, I can’t say that once the tenders have been released, they will be tendered. I don’t think it’s possible to change that at this time, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="723">I have a question on that.</seg>
<seg id="724">If the change is not possible, then what happens to the Inuit Employment Equity Program?</seg>
<seg id="725">Can the Department of Community and Government Services do the work?</seg>
<seg id="726">I hope I was clear, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="727">Can the minister tell me, maybe tell the House why when employees from other communities want to work in construction, are employees from Nunavut entitled to the same benefits as employees from outside of Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="728">Hon. Lorne Kusugak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="729">I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="730">Mr. Speaker, the Nunavummi Nangminiqaqtunik Ikajuuti Contracting Appeals Board investigates issues and sets the Inuit Employment Policy:</seg>
<seg id="731">Scope of work;</seg>
<seg id="732">Individuals who are available to work based on their education;</seg>
<seg id="733">There are other community programs that can affect Inuit employment opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="734">Mr. Speaker, we encourage contractors at the local level to hire locally from the regional centres in Nunavut, before they start recruiting outside of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="735">We encourage people who come to Nunavut to look for jobs.</seg>
<seg id="736">We encourage that.</seg>
<seg id="737">We also work closely with the client departments to achieve those goals.</seg>
<seg id="738">Your first supplementary, Mr. Maine.</seg>
<seg id="739">Mr. Maine (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="740">My last question, Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask the minister: will he commit to working with his department to work with the Department of Community and Government Services on major infrastructure projects?</seg>
<seg id="741">Will the minister commit to working with the Department of Community and Government Services to ensure that jobs are created and that Inuit are able to apply for jobs in construction projects that are outside of the territory?</seg>
<seg id="742">Will the minister commit to ensuring that the same criteria will be taken into consideration to ensure that Nunavut residents are included in the NNI Contracting Appeals Board?</seg>
<seg id="743">Mr. Speaker, I believe that the Government of Nunavut as a whole encourages people who are looking for jobs to hire Nunavummiut first.</seg>
<seg id="744">That is the way we have always been set up and we will continue to do that.</seg>

<seg id="788">Bill 2 is in your legislation binder.</seg>
<seg id="789">Moving on. Do you have witnesses that you would like to bring to the table? Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="790">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) If I may, I would like to have my officials sit with me.</seg>
<seg id="791">Chairman (interpretation): Does the committee agree to bring in the witnesses?</seg>
<seg id="792">Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the witnesses in.</seg>
<seg id="793">Mr. Akeeagok, for the record, please introduce your witnesses and proceed with your opening comments.</seg>
<seg id="794">To my left is my Assistant Deputy Minister, Dan Carlson.</seg>
<seg id="795">Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to appear before the Committee of the Whole to present Bill 2, Interim Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, 2018-19.</seg>
<seg id="796">As a government, we are requesting you to spend $491,804,000 between April 1, 2018 and June 30, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="797">Mr. Chairman, at this time of year, the Minister of Finance has been here for the entire fiscal year. However, as the Fifth Legislative Assembly, we have just recently sat down and we are still in the planning stages.</seg>
<seg id="798">With that being the case, at this time, the 2018-19 budget is in the planning stages. We will be bringing it to Yellowknife for the upcoming spring sitting in May and June.</seg>
<seg id="799">To that end, Mr. Chairman, we are proposing interim appropriations to enable the department to fulfill its mandate to provide services to Nunavummiut in the coming months.</seg>
<seg id="800">This is a must-attend approach to setting aside money for this year after the election.</seg>
<seg id="801">Mr. Chairman, all departments and territorial corporations have had the opportunity to review these interim appropriations. Our calculations are based on departmental spending and cash flow over the last four years.</seg>
<seg id="802">We are satisfied that this amount will be sufficient to operate the operations of the Legislative Assembly as a result of its review and the passage of its annual budget.</seg>
<seg id="803">These are some of the highlights of the Act. These funds are:</seg>
<seg id="804">$8.62 million for the Office of the Legislative Assembly;</seg>
<seg id="805">$11.66 million for the Department of Community and Government Services;</seg>
<seg id="806">$29.08 million for the Department of Finance;</seg>
<seg id="807">$49.1 million to the Department of Family Services;</seg>
<seg id="808">$32.44 million for the Department of Justice;</seg>
<seg id="809">$10.77 million to the Department of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth;</seg>
<seg id="810">$64.1 million to the Department of Education;</seg>
<seg id="811">$85.77 million for Health and Social Services Headquarters;</seg>
<seg id="812">$8.32 million for the Department of Environment;</seg>
<seg id="813">$82.73 million for the Office of the Department of Community and Government Services;</seg>
<seg id="814">$23.29 million for the Department of Economic Development and Transportation office;</seg>
<seg id="815">$73.39 million for the Nunavut Housing Corporation; and</seg>
<seg id="816">$12.54 million for Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="817">Mr. Chairman, that concludes my opening comments.</seg>
<seg id="818">At this time, we are open to questions or comments.</seg>
<seg id="819">Do members have any general comments?</seg>
<seg id="820">Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="821">Mr. Towtongie: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="822">I was reading the Inuktitut version of the bill. $32.44 million for the Department of Justice. The Inuktitut version is $32.44 million for the Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="823">So there is a difference in Inuktitut between $8.62 million and $8.62 million for the Office of the Legislative Assembly, is that for the Legislative Assembly or the Department of Justice?</seg>
<seg id="824">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Just for clarification, the Office of the Legislative Assembly is requesting $8.62 million. The Department of Justice is seeking $32.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="825">I apologize if the translation was incorrect. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="826">The English version is correct.</seg>
<seg id="827">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="828">It’s just a question in regard to the interim appropriation. We’re not at a percentage, so I think that’s what we’re looking at in terms of the actual expenditures and the budgeting process that we’re talking about.</seg>
<seg id="829">Mr. Speaker, I know that there has been a lot of debate on financial management and the minister has indicated that there is a need for real change to ensure that proper departments are able to provide services to Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="830">It doesn’t have anything to do with that, Mr. Chairman. It applies to the bill because it affects the bill.</seg>
<seg id="831">So I’m just wondering if there have been any changes in the way the money is allocated for the next fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="832">Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="833">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="834">To date, there have been no real changes to O&amp;M, but I’m sure we will see the capital budget process in the fall. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="835">Are there any more general comments?</seg>
<seg id="836">If members have any questions on the opening comments, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="837">If not, we will continue with the clause-by-clause review.</seg>
<seg id="838">Go to Bill 2 in your white legislation binder.</seg>
<seg id="839">Bill 2, Interim Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="840">Chairman: Clause 2. Agreed?</seg>
<seg id="841">Chairman (interpretation): Go to Schedule on page 2. Page 3 in Inuktitut. Schedule. Interim Appropriation for the Period April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="842">Vote 1: Operations and Maintenance. Interim Appropriation. Total Operations and Maintenance. $491,804,000.</seg>
<seg id="843">Thank you, Mr. Maine, do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="844">Mr. Maine: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="845">I think I should have brought this up earlier, but I have a question on grants and contributions.</seg>
<seg id="846">It’s my understanding that the numbers are based on percentages of the year, but some of the grants and contributions are already spent. The funding for the whole year will be depleted as soon as April 1.</seg>
<seg id="847">I just want to clarify for the Grants and Contributions Economic Development Program or the Nunavut Housing Corporation. How is that handled? The funding is not for a year-round, but some of the programs are administered annually.</seg>
<seg id="848">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="849">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) That’s a good question.</seg>
<seg id="850">Under the Appropriation Act, I noted in my opening comments that the department has been working on the last four years. Some of them have been allocated for the first three months of grants and contributions.</seg>
<seg id="851">What I can say is that Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation are one of the largest departments. As you can see here, the grants and contributions are for operations and maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="852">When it comes to requests, if they have to go through an application process, each department has different approaches and that’s why, in the last four years, all departments have their spending on a quarterly basis. The Department of Finance looks at them and they come to an agreement with the departments on how their grants and contributions work.</seg>
<seg id="853">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="854">My next question to the minister is: can the minister tell the House if there are any projects that have been put on hold or are they just going to go through the normal process?</seg>
<seg id="855">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Maine.</seg>
<seg id="856">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="857">Hopefully tomorrow, we will see some of the work that needs to be done in the future. The budget that we have been able to put together in the Fifth Legislative Assembly with direction from departments. So the next three months will be the same. In May, we will be looking at those projects again.</seg>
<seg id="858">Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="859">I’m sorry, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="860">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank the minister and his officials.</seg>
<seg id="861">In the Main Estimates, $491,804,000 is above the breakdown.</seg>
<seg id="862">The first part of the bill is $8,623,000. In the opening comments, the minister stated $8.26 million.</seg>
<seg id="863">The $3,000 is unchanged and the total amount is $54,000.</seg>
<seg id="864">Why is it that way?</seg>
<seg id="865">That is my question.</seg>
<seg id="866">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="867">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="868">The bill is a three-page document in Inuktitut and we’re trying to get the actual numbers approved.</seg>
<seg id="869">Those are the exact numbers.</seg>
<seg id="870">As I stated in my opening comments, I have reduced the numbers in English to keep them close to the main numbers and I have stated that I don’t want to say all of the decreases. We have reduced them by numbers.</seg>
<seg id="871">The numbers that we’re looking at in the Bill are accurate, he just doesn’t call them all.</seg>
<seg id="872">Total Supplementary Appropriation. $491,804,000. Do you agree?</seg>
<seg id="873">Clause 5. Do you agree?</seg>
<seg id="874">Chairman (interpretation): Do members agree to Bill 2 as a whole?</seg>
<seg id="875">Do members agree that pursuant to Rule 62(2), that Bill 2 can immediately be placed on the orders of the day for third reading?</seg>
<seg id="876">Minister Akeeagok, do you have any closing comments?</seg>
<seg id="877">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to thank my officials for getting this ready so that we can have this government operational until June.</seg>
<seg id="878">I thank you very much to all Members of the Legislative Assembly for your help in approving this funding request. I look forward to sitting in this House when we go through the whole budget in May and June.</seg>
<seg id="879">Thank you all.</seg>
<seg id="880">Bill 2 is concluded.</seg>
<seg id="881">I will now ask the minister if we can proceed with his opening comments on Bill 3?</seg>
<seg id="882">Bill 03 – Supplementary Appropriation (Operations &amp; Maintenance) Act, No. 3, 2017-2018 – Consideration in Committee</seg>
<seg id="883">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="884">I will keep my officials here, and I want everyone to know that once we get to the other departments, I will be able to bring in additional staff when needed, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="885">Mr. Chairman, is that my opening comments?</seg>
<seg id="886">I am here to present to you Bill 3, Supplementary Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, 2017-2018, No. 3. Through this bill, the government is proposing to increase its budget by $56,602,000 for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="887">$49 million to the Department of Health to cover over-expenditures in the Department of Health, medical travel, mental health and treatment programs, elder care, hospital physician services, and TB assessments;</seg>
<seg id="888">$6.2 million to the Department of Justice to cover the cost overruns of the RCMP, Corrections, and the Department of Justice; and</seg>
<seg id="889">The $1.402 million deficit went to the Children, Family Services and Banking Division.</seg>
<seg id="890">Mr. Chairman, that concludes my opening comments. I welcome any questions or comments that members may have.</seg>
<seg id="891">Are there any general comments?</seg>
<seg id="892">Supplementary Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) 2017-18, No. 3. Family Services. Not Previously Authorized.</seg>
<seg id="893">Total Children and Family Services. $1,402,000.</seg>
<seg id="894">I just saw that number in the substantiation sheets and it still doesn’t give me a clear picture, but I think it’s important to point out exactly where the focus is.</seg>
<seg id="895">Hon. Joe Savikataaq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="896">Hon. David Savikataaq: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="897">I don’t have the breakdown of how many, but I think that’s two-fold. We send more foster children outside of Nunavut. The number of visits that we receive outside of Nunavut has increased.</seg>
<seg id="898">For example, there’s an elder from Igloolik, Gjoa Haven, I’m not sure which community he is in. He’s in Ottawa, so that he can visit the community.</seg>
<seg id="899">We do visit the families that are not supported by the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="900">The majority of people who are sent outside of Nunavut are not eligible for seniors in Nunavut. As I stated earlier, there are more visits from the communities.</seg>
<seg id="901">With the amalgamation of all the elders’ programs that the Department of Family Services is responsible for. I’m just wondering if the Department of Health and Social Services has ever taken over the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="902">Although the minister alluded to some of the issues, some of them are not directly related to the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="903">Some of them are in the care of the Department of Health and Social Services, elders are in the care of the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="904">That was one of the examples I used. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="905">I understand that there is a need to visit some of the children who are in foster care. The money is usually with the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="906">What I am asking is are there still elders who are receiving social assistance that have not been transferred to the Department of Health?</seg>
<seg id="907">Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="908">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Based on the information that I have, the information that was transferred to the Department of Health has been transferred.</seg>
<seg id="909">They are not transferred to the Department of Health and Social Services that are still administered by the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="910">I’m just wondering if there are any other non-decentralized programs in Family Services. Looking at this information and looking at our business plan, I think they have all been transferred. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="911">If the Minister of Family Services can provide more details, I would appreciate it.</seg>
<seg id="912">It’s up to Minister Akeeagok to ask another question.</seg>
<seg id="913">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="914">I thought the question was, “Are there still people in the Department of Health and Social Services?”</seg>
<seg id="915">The answer I gave was that the Department of Health and Social Services is there right now.</seg>
<seg id="916">We are still on Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="917">In terms of the supplementary appropriation, it’s for the Department of Family Services to determine what the deficit was. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="918">I thank the minister for that clarification.</seg>
<seg id="919">I understand better now.</seg>
<seg id="920">Maybe I should ask another question that is more understandable.</seg>
<seg id="921">Is the Department of Family Services still looking after the elders? Does the Department of Family Services still have the resources to deal with the elders?</seg>
<seg id="922">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Yes, there is still some work to be done for seniors, so I would like the Minister of Family Services to be more specific.</seg>
<seg id="923">I am aware of the government’s programs, the Senior Fuel Subsidy Program, the Senior Fuel Subsidy Program, the Senior Citizen Supplementary Benefit Program, and the Department of Family Services probably looks after people over the age of 60.</seg>
<seg id="924">If I missed something, Minister Savikataaq can help me answer the question. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="925">Thank you to both ministers for clarifying that.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my last question.</seg>
<seg id="927">When people are sent outside of Nunavut, are they still eligible for income support and are they eligible for income support?</seg>
<seg id="928">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Through you, Mr. Chairman, I would like Minister Savikataaq to respond to that question. (interpretation ends) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="929">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="930">It varies depending on the situation.</seg>
<seg id="931">Sometimes they are eligible for income support but I can’t say that they are the same for all of them.</seg>
<seg id="932">I have detailed questions under the department.</seg>
<seg id="933">It indicates that they will be donating the surplus from other departments.</seg>
<seg id="934">As it stands now, do other departments in this region support all Nunavummiut?</seg>
<seg id="935">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) It doesn’t affect all regions.</seg>
<seg id="936">Also, from the Department of Family Services, almost all of that was transferred to the Department of Health, the Income Support Program.</seg>
<seg id="937">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="938">I thank the minister for that answer.</seg>
<seg id="939">When you’re going to be transferring money to other departments from different departments, when do you identify when there is a possibility of going into a deficit and how do you deal with the deficit?</seg>
<seg id="940">I don’t know if this has an impact on our proceedings, Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="941">The department reports on a monthly basis and at the end of the fiscal year, a little over-expenditure to allow departments to re-budget their budgets. If that’s not possible, then we have to go through a supplementary appropriation.</seg>
<seg id="942">We are on page 4.</seg>
<seg id="943">Mr. Maine.</seg>
<seg id="944">The documents that we have before us indicate that the number of people in residential care is increasing. From the 189 people in residential care, there were 243.</seg>
<seg id="945">Do you anticipate that this number will continue to grow?</seg>
<seg id="946">What is the increase in the number of people requiring care?</seg>
<seg id="947">Are you aware of the reasons for the increase in the number of people requiring care?</seg>
<seg id="948">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="949">The numbers have been changing for a number of years. Will that be included in the budget, starting from last year’s budget, I don’t want to be approving supplementary appropriations so that you can have accurate budgeting.</seg>
<seg id="950">Will that be factored in?</seg>
<seg id="951">So I guess the trend is increasing. Once we go page by page, it’s going to be noticeable that we’re talking about changes. If they don’t keep up with the budget, then we look at our budget.</seg>
<seg id="952">We will have questions when we get to the main estimates. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="953">In your substantiation sheet that was provided by the department, it states that there is a surplus.</seg>
<seg id="954">It also mentions the department’s recently revised Income Support Program.</seg>
<seg id="955">So I’m just wondering if the minister could indicate where the surplus from the Income Support Division is spent on administration, or is the majority of the money going to income support recipients?</seg>
<seg id="956">Which areas did you increase?</seg>
<seg id="957">I am trying to understand where the surplus went, where was it spent?</seg>
<seg id="958">Is the Income Support Case Management System being redundant or is the Income Support Program increasing? Where did the rest go?</seg>
<seg id="959">Chairman: Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="960">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) There are a number of issues with the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="961">They have been hired to administer their functions while they’re moving from another department to another department and some of these people have started working on who they are and how they work.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the Income Support Program, there was funding for that, and the government’s response was that they send people out to residential care for a variety of people.</seg>
<seg id="963">There are a number of reasons why the Department of Family Services has reached its budget shortfall for the current fiscal year. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="964">I will stay there.</seg>
<seg id="965">Mr. Speaker, this information indicates that the department spends more money than it spends on income support.</seg>
<seg id="966">Will the budget be used for staff housing or income support?</seg>
<seg id="967">My colleague, Mr. Savikataaq, can respond to the question better.</seg>
<seg id="968">Mr. Savikataaq, go ahead.</seg>
<seg id="969">The changes to the Income Support Program have a significant impact on the budget. I can use this as an example.</seg>
<seg id="970">The National Child Benefit Supplement was deducted from their income and income support.</seg>
<seg id="971">The Child Benefit Supplement was deducted from the Income Support Program, which will no longer be the case. Now, income support recipients will be receiving more money than the Income Support Program.</seg>
<seg id="972">We are on Total Children and Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="973">Not Previously Authorized. $1,402,000.</seg>
<seg id="974">Justice. Operations and Maintenance. Not Previously Authorized.</seg>
<seg id="975">Total Department of Justice, to be Voted. $2,600,000.</seg>
<seg id="976">Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="977">Mr. Netser (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="978">Mr. Minister, welcome.</seg>
<seg id="979">It says here that it’s for the purchase of new drugs. I’m just wondering if the minister has any plans to change the Marijuana Act by the Government of Canada this summer.</seg>
<seg id="980">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Like you, Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask my witness to change the Deputy Minister of Justice to go to the witness table and remove my deputy, so I will respond to the member’s question.</seg>
<seg id="981">Does the committee agree to bring in the witnesses?</seg>
<seg id="982">Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the witnesses in.</seg>
<seg id="983">For the record, Mr. Akeeagok, please introduce your witness.</seg>
<seg id="984">To my left is the Deputy Minister of Justice, Bill MacKay.</seg>
<seg id="985">If it’s okay with you, I can respond to the question.</seg>
<seg id="986">Mr. Chairman, that’s a very good question from the Department of Justice with respect to the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="987">This does not apply to marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="988">We don’t want the drugs coming to Nunavut because these are new drugs that we need to learn and implement.</seg>
<seg id="989">In December, at the Finance Ministers’ Meeting, the funding that will be provided through the Department of Health and Social Services, 25 percent of the funding from the federal government will go to the RCMP for drug testing.</seg>
<seg id="990">This is a two-part project.</seg>
<seg id="991">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="992">My next question here is in regard to the high cost of housing in the communities.</seg>
<seg id="993">I’m just wondering if the minister could explain why it’s in there for housing costs.</seg>
<seg id="994">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="995">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) This is related to the RCMP getting nine more RCMP officers in different communities and that’s why they provide staff housing.</seg>
<seg id="996">When there are additional RCMP officers, through government contracts, we have to purchase housing. The additional costs were around $300,000. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="997">Mr. Maine, did you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="998">Mr. Maine: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="999">The minister talked about the $2.6 million breakdown of the $300,000 for housing.</seg>
<seg id="1000">Can you elaborate a little bit more on that?</seg>
<seg id="1001">Hon. David Akeeagok: Maybe I might skip a number.</seg>
<seg id="1002">I’ll ask my officials.</seg>
<seg id="1003">Those are the numbers.</seg>
<seg id="1004">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1005">I thank the minister for his response in regard to the $1 million that is going towards mobile equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1006">Why were these vehicles not expected to be purchased?</seg>
<seg id="1007">I believe it was supposed to be included in this budget, if I understood you correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Was this the reason why you had to purchase new vehicles?</seg>
<seg id="1009">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. That’s a good question.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The $1 million is for vehicle replacement.</seg>
<seg id="1011">We have a contract with the RCMP and there are a number of different things happening there.</seg>
<seg id="1012">Mr. Speaker, last year, the GN’s Motor Vehicle Information System (ATV) was not replaced very much due to lack of funding.</seg>
<seg id="1013">The Department of Community and Government Services was trying to reduce the number of delays, but this year, the Motor Vehicle Damage Prevention Program has resulted in the purchase of essential vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1014">That’s why there has been a significant jump this year.</seg>
<seg id="1015">They’re not buying too much, but their equipment continues to deteriorate.</seg>
<seg id="1016">With respect to the RCMP contracts, the RCMP’s “V” Division has a contract with the RCMP. Please don’t hesitate to buy this. We don’t do that very often.</seg>
<seg id="1017">However, in our discussions with the federal government, we are able to come to an agreement and that is why it seems to have increased significantly.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Mr. Maine (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1019">I know my colleague alluded to this issue.</seg>
<seg id="1020">These are new drugs, which I believe are the most dangerous drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1021">Will this equipment be made available to all the communities or will it be made available to all the communities?</seg>
<seg id="1022">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Yes, all RCMP officers will receive this equipment for all communities.</seg>
<seg id="1023">So that’s the new equipment that we have for the RCMP and for the public that may be in that situation. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1024">I’m just wondering if the RCMP has any plans in place or if they haven’t found any new drugs, which communities have the RCMP found to date?</seg>
<seg id="1025">Yes, for the people that are coming into our communities, it’s a tragedy and I hope they have a break.</seg>
<seg id="1026">However, the communities have been impacted twice and most of the Canadian emerging markets are coming up here in the Northwest Territories.</seg>
<seg id="1027">It’s a very dangerous situation and I’m very afraid that people will be applying for drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1028">It would be better if you don’t take those things but the things that are coming up are dangerous and I applaud the RCMP for making plans.</seg>
<seg id="1029">Mr. Maine: I thought we were done.</seg>
<seg id="1030">That’s my last question.</seg>
<seg id="1031">I’m just wondering if you could clarify that for me.</seg>
<seg id="1032">In the document that we have provided, it states that we have recruited more RCMP officers. In nine or six communities across Nunavut, they have been decentralized to different locations.</seg>
<seg id="1033">That was just a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1034">Moving on, Mr. Hickes, do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the $2.6 million that you’re asking for, it talks about court interpreters going to court. You said that there are seven judges that need interpreters from the court.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) At this time, no, there are a number of interpreters in the Department of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1037">I’ll leave that for now. In the Minister’s Statement, it also talks about the need for new telephones and the need to continue with the old system.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Given the fact that they’re going to have to replace new equipment, will they be setting aside some money for new equipment or will they be requesting additional funding once they know the number from the RCMP?</seg>
<seg id="1039">Yes, this is in the planning stages for the department. We requested the funding and that’s what we have planned for.</seg>
<seg id="1040">The Department of Finance has a business plan that the Minister of Public Works and Services will be there and the RCMP plans in the event that marijuana legislation is passed, as my colleague has pointed out, is in the planning stages, but there is no additional funding for marijuana. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In terms of other correctional facilities, overtime, it talks about having fully staffed, full-time staff at the Baffin Correctional Centre. What is the total number of inmates?</seg>
<seg id="1042">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Item 8. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1043">Did he say eight?</seg>
<seg id="1044">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Can the minister clarify that?</seg>
<seg id="1046">Through you, I’ll have Deputy Minister MacKay respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1047">Mr. MacKay: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1048">The Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Health and Social Services has a lot of people working in other departments. If the weather permits, they have to stay there. So that’s part of the overtime cost.</seg>
<seg id="1049">When there’s a blizzard, they can’t go home. So the staff, who just said that they’re going to come back to work, do they double the number of employees when the blizzard is blowing?</seg>
<seg id="1050">Mr. MacKay, can you clarify that?</seg>
<seg id="1051">Yes, there have been two incidents now. If there is a blizzard, they are immediately dispatched to the Baffin Regional Health Centre and if there is a blizzard, they are sent to the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="1052">Mr. Lighthizer.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Mr. Lighthizer: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1054">My questions are for the Minister of Justice. First of all, the RCMP has identified housing needs for the nine new RCMP officers.</seg>
<seg id="1055">When you get an RCMP officer, are they provided with housing separately?</seg>
<seg id="1056">I am happy to say that one of my staff, who is playing hockey, lost his arm by one of the staff members. I am sure that he will recover and my deputy minister can’t write.</seg>
<seg id="1057">He will have to whisper.</seg>
<seg id="1058">In terms of the nine RCMP officers, the RCMP receives housing from the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="1059">As I stated earlier, we work with the RCMP on various contracts.</seg>
<seg id="1060">I would like to make it clear that 70 percent of the RCMP cost is paid by the Government of Nunavut and 30 percent is paid by the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="1061">The RCMP, through their contracts, are provided by the federal government. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1062">Mr. Lighthizer: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1063">I’m just wondering if the RCMP will be providing housing for all RCMP officers?</seg>
<seg id="1064">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) When the RCMP puts a staff member in a community to stay in a community, they identify how long they have to stay in the community.</seg>
<seg id="1065">That’s how they operate differently because they don’t keep their RCMP officers on the land.</seg>
<seg id="1066">They don’t expect to get their own house in the communities at all times, but it depends on the number of RCMP officers that are provided with housing in the communities.</seg>
<seg id="1067">That’s where the RCMP operates differently.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When they identify a need for an RCMP officer, they try to include all 25 communities as soon as possible. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1069">It is unfortunate that the RCMP does not try to integrate into the communities.</seg>
<seg id="1070">When the RCMP buys their own homes, how does the Income Support Program work?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Lighthizer.</seg>
<seg id="1072">I don’t think anybody should be asking questions like that.</seg>
<seg id="1073">I don’t think we should expect them to own their own homes and that’s why they are provided with housing.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Mr. Akeeagok, if you want to comment on that, it’s up to you.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1076">That was a very good comment, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1077">The RCMP, the public out there, even though they only spend three years in the community, is involved in community fundraising.</seg>
<seg id="1078">If an RCMP officer wants to get housing, they apply to the federal government for housing.</seg>
<seg id="1079">It’s the federal government’s salary rather than our own. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1080">My last question for the RCMP is: how much was that contract for the RCMP?</seg>
<seg id="1081">Page 5 of the bill. $40,071,000.</seg>
<seg id="1082">If approved, it will be $42,671,000 for this contract. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1083">Thank you for that clarification.</seg>
<seg id="1084">The third item is the Corrections Division. Overtime and casual employment.</seg>
<seg id="1085">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Lighthizer. We’re just on Law Enforcement. We haven’t gotten there yet. Can you wait for your question?</seg>
<seg id="1086">We are now asking questions on Law Enforcement. (interpretation ends) Are there any further questions?</seg>
<seg id="1087">Mr. Lighthizer: Yes, finally, for law enforcement.</seg>
<seg id="1088">In the minister’s letter, it also clarifies that the total amount of funding was $40 million, with strict enforcement spending of $30 million, which is projected to increase to $42 million.</seg>
<seg id="1089">What is the projected $42 million worth of spending projected for the end of the fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="1090">Maybe I could ask the member if he could give us the exact numbers.</seg>
<seg id="1091">If there is a number, I would like some assistance. I sent the letter on Friday and I believe I found the $30 million, but if he could elaborate a little bit more.</seg>
<seg id="1092">A letter dated March 16 to the Chairperson of the Regular Members’ Caucus was received by the Minister of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="1093">The letter that I am referring to is on page 4, page 4. There are five in total.</seg>
<seg id="1094">I would also like to thank the member for asking about the contents of the letter that we tabled.</seg>
<seg id="1095">The $30 million has been spent this year, and the plan is $42 million.</seg>
<seg id="1096">The RCMP’s “V” Division describes how they’re going to spend and how much they’re going to spend. That’s why we’re asking for $2.6 million. That’s why I wrote that letter.</seg>
<seg id="1097">I’m looking at $2.6 million for Project One in the Member’s Statement, it indicates that the RCMP operates in areas where they don’t have the capability of using ATVs. At the top of that, it says that it’s a historical request.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Mr. Speaker, the Legislative Assembly has indicated that the Department of Justice is proposing to restructure the Directorate. However, due to the unique nature of its operations, it requires an additional $2.6 million to cover compensation and benefits for staff, training, recruitment, and organizational issues.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Then he talks about the $2.6 million for additional staff and casual salaries. At the same time, the $2.6 million is mentioned that they have a radio station.</seg>
<seg id="1100">Can you clarify that, Mr. Chairman?</seg>
<seg id="1101">There were already questions from my colleague, Mr. Akeeagok, if you want to elaborate further, it’s up to you.</seg>
<seg id="1102">The breakdown that I mentioned earlier, if you look at the bottom, there is a further breakdown of Program 3. There is an increase of $2.6 million for corrections.</seg>
<seg id="1103">There are two separate projects, which are estimated at $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1104">This includes RCMP radios, housing needs, vehicles, and a number of emergency situations. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1105">Thank you, Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="1106">If we’re talking about $2.6 million, what is the total amount of that, I don’t understand that. Could you clarify that?</seg>
<seg id="1107">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="1108">On page 5 of our business plan, we’re dealing with law enforcement in the amount of $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1109">Further down there, “Corrections, $2.6 million,” it says, “Total Corrections Division is not responsible for that. Right now, we have $2.6 million in law enforcement.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Do you have any questions?</seg>
<seg id="1111">Mr. Towtongie (interpretation): Thank you for clarifying that.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When I read the Inuktitut version of the main estimates in English, it seems like it’s an estimate in Inuktitut.</seg>
<seg id="1113">Can you clarify what that means? Are you projecting estimates or projections for 2017-18?</seg>
<seg id="1114">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1115">On the right hand side of the page, not previously authorized, we’re still in 2017-18. The main estimates are projected to be a little over that. That’s why we’re seeking Legislative Assembly approval for the supplementary appropriation for the Department of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1116">A total of $6.2 million, of which $2.6 million would go to the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="1117">That’s what we’re requesting from the Legislative Assembly. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1118">I was just confused because it sounds like the Inuktitut version, they are projections.</seg>
<seg id="1119">I almost understand my question, but I’m done.</seg>
<seg id="1120">We’re on Law Enforcement. $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Next on the list is the total Registries and Court Services, $1 million.</seg>
<seg id="1122">Total Corrections. $2,600,000.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Mr. Lighthizer: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Mr. Speaker, my question is in regard to corrections and I know it’s an annual overspending. If memory serves me correct, it’s just overtime.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Am I correct?</seg>
<seg id="1126">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1127">The member is correct that the majority of the overtime will be paid as well as casual employees.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Mr. Lighthizer: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1129">If memory serves me correct, the Baffin Correctional Centre currently employs 12-hour shifts. Is that correct?</seg>
<seg id="1130">Given the fact that the correctional facilities are overcrowded and overtime, has the department given any consideration to having three or eight-hour shifts in the correctional facilities?</seg>
<seg id="1131">Through you, Deputy Minister MacKay can respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The member is correct that they work 12 hours a week.</seg>
<seg id="1133">Mr. Speaker, the FANS program is set up for two hours, 42 hours a week. They will be working overtime after 42 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1134">As a result of this agreement, overtime was reduced from $4 million to $2.49 million.</seg>
<seg id="1135">As a result, the Corrections Division’s deficit went from $4.5 million to $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1136">We are moving forward with the overtime pay and we will continue to do that.</seg>
<seg id="1137">A reminder to have your cellphones turned off and shut them down.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Mr. Lighthizer: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1139">They travel overtime and work 42 hours a week.</seg>
<seg id="1140">Are employees working 50 or 60 hours a week?</seg>
<seg id="1141">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1142">That’s too detailed. We have to provide it to the House and we will provide it in writing.</seg>
<seg id="1143">Our deputy minister can’t answer that question.</seg>
<seg id="1144">We don’t have that information.</seg>
<seg id="1145">I don’t think I know what kind of information is required for the operation of the facility.</seg>
<seg id="1146">I would like to ask these questions.</seg>
<seg id="1147">What kind of training are they receiving?</seg>
<seg id="1148">Through you, I would like Deputy Minister MacKay to respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1149">I think I answered that question. Under the Training and Training Supplementary Appropriation for the Department of Justice, it’s going to be used under the Corrections Division.</seg>
<seg id="1150">At this time, we don’t provide any training.</seg>
<seg id="1151">We have a trainer who is contracted out and it costs a lot of money because of the overtime that they’re doing the training, they have to be replaced by someone else, and that’s why it’s costing them more to do the training.</seg>
<seg id="1152">We’re also looking at other ways of better planning and budgeting to make sure that the staff in the corrections and court system get better training so that we don’t have contractors.</seg>
<seg id="1153">Ms. Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="1154">I wanted to know when the $2.6 million was talked about, including employee training.</seg>
<seg id="1155">What kind of training will be provided to employees and casuals?</seg>
<seg id="1156">Both the Corrections and Court Services Division provide training to casual and casual employees.</seg>
<seg id="1157">Part-time workers are hired on a contract basis. However, there are several weeks of orientation and orientation sessions that are provided to people who work in corrections, such as conflicts, disputes, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1158">Can the Minister of Justice ask what kind of programs the Corrections Division has or should I be asking questions?</seg>
<seg id="1159">I don’t know if they have that level of detail. Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="1160">Through you, Deputy Minister MacKay can give us a brief overview of what they do. If you will allow him, Deputy Minister MacKay.</seg>
<seg id="1161">Ms. MacKay.</seg>
<seg id="1162">I don’t have the numbers, but I will be able to report back to the member on what kind of training is provided to the inmates.</seg>
<seg id="1163">Depending on which low-risk inmates are housed in the Iqaluit International Correctional Centre, they are provided with pre-trades training so that they can get into the workforce. They are trained and trained to work at the Baffin Correctional Centre.</seg>
<seg id="1164">The Akausisarvik Correctional Centre also has programs in place for each inmate based on their needs. Addictions counselling is also offered at the facility, anger management counselling, and so on, depending on what the inmate needs are and what the reason is for their incarceration.</seg>
<seg id="1165">Even though they can’t leave jail, they also receive training so that they can get into the workforce after they leave jail, which is usually a graduation of high school. They also have a pre-vocational training program in the jail.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The Rankin Inlet Correctional Centre provides assistance to inmates.</seg>
<seg id="1167">There are different programs that we provide.</seg>
<seg id="1168">Mr. Nakasuk: I’m done.</seg>
<seg id="1169">We are on page 5.</seg>

<seg id="1178">Sergeant-at-Arms, you can change the staff at this time.</seg>
<seg id="1179">Does the committee agree to bring in the witness?</seg>

<seg id="1188">I don’t have too many questions, but when we’re talking about elders’ facilities in Nunavut, there are three continuing care facilities that will be funded by various elders.</seg>
<seg id="1189">A couple of days ago, when I was asking questions about the feasibility of a pre-feasibility study in Igloolik and Gjoa Haven, they’re looking at expanding their elders’ facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1190">At that time the minister did not know how many beds there were going to be for the study.</seg>
<seg id="1191">So I’m just wondering if we can get an update as to where we are at with that.</seg>
<seg id="1192">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you for the question.</seg>
<seg id="1193">This year’s Preplanning Action Plan is below that. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1194">What will this preplanning entail and what is the status of it now?</seg>
<seg id="1195">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Through you, Mr. Chairman, I would like the Deputy Minister of Health to respond to that because he knows more about the capital.</seg>
<seg id="1196">The Department of Health already planned last year’s capital estimates for 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Can the minister indicate if this project can proceed with the expansion of the Igloolik Health Centre?</seg>
<seg id="1198">With that in mind, after the election, I’m sure the government was going to have a new agenda, but I’m just wondering if there are any options for expanding the facility in Igloolik.</seg>
<seg id="1199">It hasn’t gone very far, but we expect that there will be more movement once we know the government’s mandate.</seg>
<seg id="1200">In conclusion, when we talk about the use of government resources to identify deficiencies in our infrastructure, I would suggest to the department that some of the responsibilities that come out of this government are in the area of elder care.</seg>
<seg id="1201">Mr. Speaker, I am optimistic that this is an ongoing process to maximize the use of existing infrastructure and identify opportunities within Nunavut for new infrastructure that is currently on the waiting list.</seg>
<seg id="1202">That was more of a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1203">I would like to follow up on my colleague’s questions regarding the operations of elders’ homes.</seg>
<seg id="1204">I would like to know what the breakdown of the $900,000 is.</seg>
<seg id="1205">I’m just wondering if the minister could give us an idea of what infrastructure is going to be allocated to those homes.</seg>
<seg id="1206">The $900,000 is divided into three regions, totalling $300,000 each for three elders.</seg>
<seg id="1207">Mr. Maine (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) I’m just wondering if the minister is referring to the Nunavut Housing Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="1208">What is the process of the Department of Health and Social Services announcing any cost savings?</seg>
<seg id="1209">The three communities that are operated by the government, not by the government, have recently issued new contracts. This has been one of them.</seg>
<seg id="1210">If there is a need to increase or decrease, then the Department of Health and Social Services and the Department of Health and Social Services meet with the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="1211">When they have to work together, they work together.</seg>
<seg id="1212">They meet the requirements of Canada and Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1213">In this report, it talks about the three facilities that have just opened and require two- and three-level residential care. There are a number of factors that indicate that the majority of these homes are in need of higher-quality care and aging facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1214">Going back to the money, I’m just wondering: in the next few years, do they anticipate that the cost of operating these facilities will continue to increase or is there going to be a cap or is there going to be an increase in the cost of operating them?</seg>
<seg id="1215">At the beginning of the contract, three were under the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="1216">The Department of Health finally took over the contract in April 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1217">What we brought to the attention of the Department of Health and Social Services is a little bit different than the Department of Family Services. We looked at it from a medical standpoint. It was based on the level of care that they are receiving and who they are receiving.</seg>
<seg id="1218">One of the recommendations was the Food Mail Program.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When we looked at the contract, the elders’ facility was not able to provide the services that were required.</seg>
<seg id="1220">We’re projecting a deficit of $855,000 last year and we’re looking at a budget proposal of almost $900,000 right now.</seg>
<seg id="1221">If I’m wrong, you can correct me if I’m looking at the budget for mental health services across Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1222">We have to deal with trauma.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Is there any talk of setting aside money for mental health treatment?</seg>
<seg id="1224">We’re here. We’re just talking about additional O&amp;M. We’re not talking about actual costs.</seg>
<seg id="1225">I don’t think that’s fair enough for the Legislative Assembly or any other way.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Do you have any further questions, Ms. Towtongie?</seg>
<seg id="1227">Thank you for that clarification.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The Mental Health Contract for 2017-18 was $16.7 million. I think it was $6.2 million. What is the status of that?</seg>
<seg id="1229">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1230">Mr. Chairman, we’re on $5.9 million and that’s part of the $43.1 million that the member is asking about.</seg>
<seg id="1231">The exact details of the $16 million and the $10 million is there.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Perhaps I can get Deputy Minister Stockley to elaborate on the details. Through you, Deputy Minister Stockley, why there is an additional $10 million for this project? If you can allow him to respond.</seg>
<seg id="1233">It’s good to hear that Nunavutmiut are asking for help, and I think that’s one of the things that I’m trying to say is that I think it’s good to hear that Nunavutmiut are asking for help, and I think that’s one of the things that I’m talking about.</seg>
<seg id="1234">That’s why we have increased the number of people going to treatment centres.</seg>
<seg id="1235">I know they have mental health problems and addictions.</seg>
<seg id="1236">There are also costs outside of the Department of Health and Social Services. Under the Department of Justice, there are court-ordered detoxification programs that go through the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Before we proceed to Directorate, we will take a five-minute break.</seg>
<seg id="1238">&gt;&gt;Committee recessed at 18:03 and resumed at 18:10</seg>
<seg id="1239">I would like to call the committee meeting back to order.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Total Health and Social Services. $43,100,000.</seg>
<seg id="1241">Under the Out-of-Territory Long-Term Care Strategy, you have identified the need for palliative care.</seg>
<seg id="1242">There is no Dementia Research Centre in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1243">That’s what I’m interested in.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Are they looking at the possibility of having a Dementia Research Centre in Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="1245">It’s one of them right away, but it’s not at the top level.</seg>
<seg id="1246">These are the types of initiatives that are being undertaken by the Department of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth.</seg>
<seg id="1247">On the same page, the Out-of-Territory Long-Term Health and Social Services Annual Report, the last paragraph on the Non-Insured Health Benefits Program is under the Non-Insured Health Benefits Program.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Mr. Speaker, I kind of woke up to the minister’s letter. The breakdown of the department did not include any of the items within the budget to address the deficit.</seg>
<seg id="1249">So I’m just wondering if his department is going to spend all of its money in this area.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This year, we’re requesting $5.9 million for adult care and we’re requesting $5.9 million to send the elders to the appropriate facilities. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1252">My question was more in relation to the Department of Health’s overall budget.</seg>
<seg id="1253">If I’m wrong, Deputy Minister Stockley can correct that.</seg>
<seg id="1254">However, I believe that was a question that I can answer with respect to the over-expenditures that have been incurred by the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="1255">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you for clarifying that.</seg>
<seg id="1256">The money hasn’t been spent within the department, so we move the money over to the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The balance for the Department of Health is $49 million.</seg>
<seg id="1258">The letter that I just sent today will be translated into Inuktitut today. It was sent in English on Friday and the attachment doesn’t have a number on the over-expenditures and over-expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="1259">That’s a very small amount compared to what we’re asking for in the supplementary appropriation. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1260">Although I appreciate you mentioning the Schedule for the Mobile Equipment Fund, I was trying to refer to the letter that we received from the minister on page 4. It’s broken down into different programs and funding.</seg>
<seg id="1261">Under the Department of Family Services, I’m just wondering: what is the department doing to advertise the surplus that they can use for recycling?</seg>
<seg id="1262">Why hasn’t the Department of Health done that?</seg>
<seg id="1263">The Department of Health and Social Services or the Department of Health had no indication that they were going to have a surplus.</seg>
<seg id="1264">On page 5, it states that the Department of Health and Social Services will require an additional $49 million. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1265">It doesn’t talk about the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="1266">In the Department of Health and Social Services, as I know, there’s a breakdown of the amount of money that’s left over in the last couple of years.</seg>
<seg id="1267">Can the minister provide us with a breakdown of all of the Department of Health’s programs that have surpluses in their deductions when there is a deficit?</seg>
<seg id="1268">You’re asking for very detailed information that may not be available at this time.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Minister Akoak…</seg>
<seg id="1270">…Mr. Akeeagok, go ahead.</seg>
<seg id="1271">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for recognizing me.</seg>
<seg id="1272">We don’t have that level of detail.</seg>
<seg id="1273">We will be able to table it in the House at a later date. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1274">I’ll move on to Elders’ Facility Operations and Maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="1275">On the second bullet, it states that at present, elders’ facilities are operated under contract by non-profit Nunavut organizations.</seg>
<seg id="1276">I just want to say that this is a very good program for any Nunavut organization.</seg>
<seg id="1277">So I’m hoping that they will be contracting as many people as possible.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Moving on to the next bullet, it talks about 24-hour seniors and it states that the Department of Health provides housing 24-hour, 7-day-a-week for the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The Senior Citizen Supplementary Benefit Policy states that the Senior Citizen Supplementary Benefit Program has to be administered according to the Act.</seg>
<seg id="1280">I would like to ask the Department of Health and Social Services whether or not the elders’ facilities meet the minimum requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1281">I responded to that question a little while ago.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The Department of Health and Social Services has entered into a new contract. This increase is due to the Department of Health’s Code of Values and Ethics.</seg>
<seg id="1283">The Department of Health and Social Services meets regularly to make sure that everything is being followed.</seg>
<seg id="1284">Mr. Mason.</seg>
<seg id="1285">Can you clarify if these elders’ facilities meet minimum level of care?</seg>
<seg id="1286">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1287">It’s a new contract and we have increased it by $900,000 to $5.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="1288">They have been assured by the three organizations that they will try to keep up with that and they will try to keep up with that, but they haven’t really reached the level of care that they need.</seg>
<seg id="1289">As the minister indicated, they’re trying to catch up on that. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Mr. Netser (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1291">I’m getting a little bit quiet now.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In regard to medical travel, they’re asking for $50 million, and I have brought this up many times in the House about patients who go to hospitals who don’t have an appointment, especially in my constituency, who go to Winnipeg and then find out that they don’t have an appointment set up.</seg>
<seg id="1293">Does the Department of Health and Social Services have a list of patients who have gone down to Winnipeg who have been cancelled their appointments and are not kept informed of them, and I’m just wondering if the Department of Health has a list of how much it costs for those patients who didn’t have an appointment, travel, accommodation, and so on. (interpretation) Thank you, Thank you, Mr. Mr. Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1294">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1295">The Minister of Health has committed to reviewing all patients and those patients who have not been seen or changed due to appointments.</seg>
<seg id="1296">One of the things that the government is looking at is actually looking at doing a thorough review of the Consumer Affairs Act to find out where the wrongdoing occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Mr. Speaker, our MLAs have been asking questions about these types of things and we hope to include them in the review.</seg>
<seg id="1298">I would like to thank the member for raising this issue and we can look into it together.</seg>
<seg id="1299">That will be part of the review process to make sure that people who went to see a doctor have no appointment. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1300">Mr. Netser (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) I look forward to the review report.</seg>
<seg id="1301">At this time, there was $5.5 million for TB cases in Broughton Island and I believe it was on February 26, the federal government made a significant amount of money to ITK. I believe it was $82 million and $80 million was set aside for TB testing.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Has the government, or Health and Social Services made a request or has ITK made a request to assist with this? We received some funding from the Government of Nunavut. Has our government discussed this matter with them to see if they can contribute to the cost of tuberculosis?</seg>
<seg id="1303">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1304">That’s a very good question.</seg>
<seg id="1305">At this time, the Government of Canada announced that the 2018-19 budget will be included in the Inuit-specific TB Prevention Strategy, which again states that ITK will allocate funding over a five-year period for the Inuit Circumpolar Conference.</seg>
<seg id="1306">At this time, the Department of Health and Social Services Advisory Committee, which is comprised of representatives from Inuit communities, and the Department of Health and Social Services is part of that committee.</seg>
<seg id="1307">At this time, the additional funding that was going to be provided by the federal government, and I as the Minister of Finance haven’t seen the details yet.</seg>
<seg id="1308">I look forward to seeing more details. If Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami does a good job, they understand us very well as the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="1309">That’s how it works.</seg>
<seg id="1310">We will be kept informed as to what’s happening with that. Through the minister, we will be kept informed on that very good question.</seg>
<seg id="1311">I would like to ask another question in regards to medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="1312">It states here that medical travel has no control over the issue of interest rates and contract increases.</seg>
<seg id="1313">I’m just wondering if the Department of Health has any idea why the costs are going up.</seg>
<seg id="1314">With the 5.6 percent projected annual cost increase, what are the main reasons for this increase?</seg>
<seg id="1315">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Through you, I would like my Deputy Minister, Mr. Stockley, to answer that question.</seg>
<seg id="1317">Medical travel and medivac travel are increasing every year.</seg>
<seg id="1318">We’re seeing more and more patients going to the hospital on scheduled medical travel, so that could be a good thing because they’re diagnosed early and that’s why they’re sent out.</seg>
<seg id="1319">At the same time, tuberculosis has been very high. Across Canada, we have the lowest vaccination rates in Canada. That’s one of the reasons why it’s so low.</seg>
<seg id="1320">I’ll give you an example.</seg>
<seg id="1321">There were approximately 60 medical evacuations in December.</seg>
<seg id="1322">We are continually reviewing the number of medevacs every week, but at this time of year, in the springtime, people who are suffering from respiratory illnesses have to face emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="1323">The combination of medical travel and medivac travel has all increased.</seg>
<seg id="1324">Mr. Chairman, I’m not going to go into the details, but I’m just trying to find out what the reasons are for the increase.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Is the population in Nunavut going to be good? Are they getting sick?</seg>
<seg id="1326">Can I get a little bit of an explanation? My question is: are we catching up or are we falling behind with the number of people who are sick?</seg>
<seg id="1327">I would like Deputy Minister Stockley to respond to that.</seg>
<seg id="1328">It’s unfortunate that the Department of Health and Social Services has one of the highest rates of overcrowding in Canada. Overcrowding causes a lot of health problems, but we have made some progress, but I’m sure that it will alleviate some of the housing shortages.</seg>
<seg id="1329">We also added the additional load for the Baffin Regional Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="1330">We try to reduce the amount of medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="1331">We are moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="1332">The other category is the Telehealth Technology Program in the three regions.</seg>
<seg id="1333">You’re going to be hearing more about the operations and maintenance budget.</seg>
<seg id="1334">I thank the minister for that answer.</seg>
<seg id="1335">I look forward to the Main Estimates for the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Under the Mental Health Supplementary Appropriation of $10.5 million, I think it’s encouraging to hear that these are very important issues.</seg>
<seg id="1337">When I look at the substantiation sheet, it doesn’t indicate what the reason is for the increase of $10.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="1338">I’m just wondering: has your department been pressuring the government to increase the number of people with mental health issues and what is the reason for that?</seg>
<seg id="1339">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Both diagnosis and mental health issues.</seg>
<seg id="1340">During the Fourth Legislative Assembly, suicide prevention was declared an urgent need for the government to take action.</seg>
<seg id="1341">With the new system in place, we will continue to encourage people who haven’t been trained to be diagnosed by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1342">It will change the lives of our people and make sure that Members of the Legislative Assembly continue to raise this issue in the House and the public.</seg>
<seg id="1343">My last question on the Mental Health Strategy is: how many services are we providing to people in care outside of Nunavut with mental health issues?</seg>
<seg id="1344">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 64.</seg>
<seg id="1345">How does it change from the past?</seg>
<seg id="1346">We don’t have that information in front of us, but if the member wants that information, we will be able to provide it to him, perhaps in the O&amp;M budget.</seg>
<seg id="1347">I’ll move on to something else about the Qikiqtarjuaq TB study. I think all of us agree that it’s very encouraging to hear.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Will the equipment and equipment be kept by the Department of Health and Social Services for testing in other communities or are they too small or will they remain in the community?</seg>
<seg id="1349">Through you, I’ll have Deputy Minister Stockley respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1350">I’m just wondering if the minister could comment on whether or not that equipment is going to be included in the capital estimates for the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="1351">I am lost.</seg>
<seg id="1352">It’s under capital. Can I get clarification on that?</seg>
<seg id="1353">Through you, I’ll have my Deputy Minister, Stockley, respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1354">The majority of these assets came from the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Some of the things that we received from the federal government are things like a bathtub, a Red Seal, a Wizard, a Band-Aid Kit, a Band-Aid, a Band-Aid, a Bed-Aid, a Department of Health, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Maine: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1357">My last question, probably my last question.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Under the Department of Health and Social Services Recruitment and Retention Strategy, the department has been very successful in reducing the number of agency nurses.</seg>
<seg id="1359">I would like to ask, this year’s payments from previous years, what changes have been made to the funding that is being paid to them?</seg>
<seg id="1360">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Instead of hiring agency nurses, we are using more nurses here in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Over the last year to date, we have been using more of our nurses.</seg>
<seg id="1363">This is my last question.</seg>
<seg id="1364">If I get the breakdown of the $8.6 million, I would appreciate it.</seg>
<seg id="1365">Broken down by category, for the 2017-18 fiscal year, full-time employees were understaffed by a surplus of $52.5 million, casuals’ budgets exceeded $45.3 million, overtime pay, $15.7 million, and a catalogue of nurses exceeded $0.1 million, totalling over $8.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1366">I just have one question. Just to break down what you said, I just want to add to Mr. Maine’s question.</seg>
<seg id="1367">I don’t want to get into the details.</seg>
<seg id="1368">If there is a nurse in Sanikiluaq who is in an emergency situation in the middle of the night, when someone has to leave, they have to work overtime. I know the staff have to work overtime.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1370">I know the minister was answering questions today about what the department is doing to recruit nurses.</seg>
<seg id="1371">I’ll leave that alone for now.</seg>
<seg id="1372">But I just want to say that when we look at the budgets of the Department of Health and Social Services, physicians, contract psychiatrists, medical travel, and so on, it’s always shown up as supplementary appropriations every year.</seg>
<seg id="1373">The number for Mental Health and Social Services has changed drastically from last year. I think it was $6.8 million to $7.8 million in supplementary appropriations last year.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Earlier in my Member’s Statement on the budget process, what changes have been made, the Minister of Finance indicated that they haven’t made any changes at this time, but I believe that it’s time to make real changes because we keep coming back and forth and approving them as they always do in supplementary appropriations.</seg>
<seg id="1375">When you know that you’re going to have to go over budget, when you’re actually setting up the main estimates, you’re going to have to come up with the dollar values that are needed instead of adding to it.</seg>
<seg id="1376">That’s just a comment, but I would like to hear from the minister on that comment.</seg>
<seg id="1377">I feel exactly the same way. I think that’s one of the things that we’re looking at seriously is the fact that the Legislative Assembly of the Fifth Legislative Assembly has been considering these issues. We’ve had discussions with some departments, the Department of Health, and the Department of Justice continually come back for supplementary appropriations.</seg>
<seg id="1378">I’m very pleased that we’re discussing this in the main estimates and I’m working closely with my colleagues on this.</seg>
<seg id="1379">I have answered some of the health issues. Ever since I became the minister, the Department of Health has always been called the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="1380">That’s one of the things that we need to do, to get the main estimates right, to correct the errors, to make sure that they are corrected, without changing the budgeting process, we need to recognize that we need to do that.</seg>
<seg id="1381">We have to go through the Legislative Assembly to make those changes.</seg>
<seg id="1382">One of our Members of the Regular Members’ Statements made a very interesting point.</seg>
<seg id="1383">I am also saying that we have to work closely together as Members of the Legislative Assembly, because we really need that.</seg>
<seg id="1384">The 2017-18 over budget is one of the challenges that we face, and I look forward to working with the Premier and the Members of the Legislative Assembly. We don’t need to be in this House. If we know exactly how much money each department spends, then we don’t need to go back to the House.</seg>
<seg id="1385">I just wanted to say that and thank you, Mr. Chairman, for giving me this opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="1386">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1387">I appreciate the minister recognizing that there is a need for improvement.</seg>
<seg id="1388">Again, I just wanted to reiterate, as he had indicated, that the Department of Justice has always had an impact on the attendance of the people that are sitting with us. The overtime for nurses and other legislation goes back and forth to the Legislative Assembly and I’m going to bring that up for the next three and a half years.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Again, I think they need to be formally recognized and I think the Minister of Human Resources is looking at how we can ensure that the government’s capacity is filled.</seg>
<seg id="1390">As we move forward in developing the existing positions in our organizational structure, if we fill those positions where there are weaknesses, Mr. Maine talked about how challenging jobs in the public service can be that cause stress and illness to some of our employees, we need to take a step back and evaluate how we can move forward in filling those positions, where our strengths and strengths are.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If I’m talking about overtime, I’m looking forward to finding out more and moving forward, where priorities are and initiatives, so we can look forward to what we can do.</seg>
<seg id="1392">That was just a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Mr. Mikkungwak, did you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1394">Mr. Mikkungwak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1395">I just have one question. The Mental Health Contract and the Mental Health Services Contract, on the fourth bullet, it states that “The Department of Justice pays for the Medical Travel Contract.” Is that included in the $10.5 million?</seg>
<seg id="1396">I’ll make it brief. Yes, it’s members.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Mr. Lighthizer, do you have any further questions?</seg>
<seg id="1398">My final question is in regard to Mr. Maine and Mr. Hickes’ questions.</seg>
<seg id="1399">That’s my last question. It’s an $8.6 million deficit. It’s just an indication of a $143 million shortfall. You’re indicating $151 million to $8.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1400">Is that for all the salaries and benefits of the department?</seg>
<seg id="1401">Hon. David Akeeagok: Yes, those are for compensation and benefits.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Mr. Lighthizer: Thank you Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1403">Is this $151 million 100 percent accurate?</seg>
<seg id="1404">This represents a $25 million increase in compensation and benefits.</seg>
<seg id="1405">I don’t think anyone has ever been at 100 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1406">As I mentioned earlier, the full-time, part-time, overtime orders, if I put them together, I think what we’re trying to do is we’re asking for $8.6 million. That’s what we’re asking for in our estimates for compensation and benefits.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Just a few minutes from now, there are a lot of things on the list.</seg>
<seg id="1409">Moving on to the minister’s letter on page 4, the Medical Travel Policy was $63.8 million for the fiscal year 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1410">I am just wondering why the money was allocated in the 2016-17 fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="1411">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. If I can just wait a moment for 2016-17, I don’t have that information in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1413">Mr. Lighthizer, we’re trying to deal with 2016-17, not 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1414">I’ll try and keep in mind that 2016-17 is off the books.</seg>
<seg id="1415">I was asking about the Medical Travel Budget last year. What I would like to do is what the department will be allocating for 2018-19?</seg>
<seg id="1416">For 2017-18, he doesn’t anticipate next year, but Mr. Akeeagok may not have the figures in front of him, Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) I think it’s too early for the May budget speech for 2018-19.</seg>
<seg id="1418">We are voting on interim appropriations for 2017-18. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1419">What I’m saying again is that there is a problem with the formula that the minister provided. There are a lot of differences in the actual expenditures. The actual expenditures that we’ve been doing on an annual basis until the correction is made, I would hope to be in place for the next year, but at that time I will be making a formal request for the Department of Health’s operations and maintenance budget.</seg>
<seg id="1420">So I don't want to see the Legislative Assembly seeing additional funding every year.</seg>
<seg id="1421">So I would like to get into the details of the Department of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth.</seg>
<seg id="1422">That’s more of a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Chairman (interpretation): Mr. Qirngnuq, do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1424">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1425">I have one question in regard to medical travel. In order to be clear in English, the third bullet for April, the number of scheduled air ambulances has increased from last year.</seg>
<seg id="1426">It talks about medical travel. The increase in the number of people with chronic illnesses has increased and the number of births has increased.</seg>
<seg id="1427">However, the cost of medical travel is going up.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Mr. Mikkungwak, do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1429">I’m sorry, I thought you had your hand up.</seg>
<seg id="1430">We are on Health. Operations and Maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="1431">We’re done. $43,100,000. If you go down to the bottom, Total Department. $49 million.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Not previously authorized.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Go back to page 2. Supplementary Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) 2017-18, No. 3. Schedule 1. Operations and Maintenance. Supplementary Appropriation. $56,602,000.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Go to Bill 3 in your legislation binder.</seg>
<seg id="1435">I’m sorry, let me backtrack.</seg>
<seg id="1436">Bill 3, Supplementary Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, No. 3, 2017-18.</seg>

<seg id="1439">Chairman: Clause 5. Agreed?</seg>
<seg id="1440">Chairman (interpretation): Do members agree to Bill 3 as a whole?</seg>
<seg id="1441">Chairman (interpretation): Do members agree that pursuant to Rule 62(2) that Bill 3 can immediately be placed on the orders of the day for third reading?</seg>
<seg id="1442">Minister Akeeagok, do you have any closing comments?</seg>
<seg id="1443">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Mr. Chairman, I really appreciate the questions that were posed in the Main Estimates for the coming year, and the hard work of our staff in putting together the best estimates that we can do here.</seg>
<seg id="1444">With that, we will be able to adjust the budget.</seg>
<seg id="1445">Before we move on to the next bill, please remove the Members of the Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="1446">I thank the minister for his good work and I will now rise to report progress.</seg>
<seg id="1447">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you. Did you want someone else to bring in?</seg>
<seg id="1448">Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the witness out.</seg>
<seg id="1449">Moving on, Bill 4.</seg>
<seg id="1450">Mr. Akeeagok, please proceed with your opening comments.</seg>
<seg id="1451">Bill 04 – Supplementary Appropriation (Capital) Act, No. 4, 2017-2018 – Consideration in Committee</seg>
<seg id="1452">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1453">I am here to present Bill 4, Supplementary Appropriation (Capital) Act, 2017-18, No. 4.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Through this bill, the government is requesting an additional $96,000 for 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1455">This supplementary appropriation will provide the Department of Community and Government Services with a non-cash contribution of $96,000, as a result of interest adjustments in negotiations, settlements for leases with the Nunavut Construction Corporation for the Legislative Assembly building, and nine GN offices across the territory.</seg>
<seg id="1456">I would be pleased to take questions and comments.</seg>
<seg id="1457">Are there any general comments on the minister’s opening comments?</seg>
<seg id="1458">It’s the first time that I’ve been involved in that. I’m just wondering why we have to do that.</seg>
<seg id="1459">Can’t the Department of Community and Government Services find their own capital dollars?</seg>
<seg id="1460">Mr. Speaker, one of the things that we need to do in the Financial Administration Manual is to make sure that the interest rate is transparent and transparent.</seg>
<seg id="1461">I don’t think anyone would get any money until they paid those interest rates were higher than expected. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>

<seg id="1519">Speaker (interpretation): Before we go to Item 22, I have an announcement to make.</seg>
<seg id="1520">As Speaker of the Legislative Assembly and Chair of the Nunavut Order Council, I am honoured to take this opportunity to announce this year’s recipients of the Order of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1521">On January 1, 2010, the Order of Nunavut Act came into force.</seg>
<seg id="1522">This means that individuals can be recognized for their hard work and dedication to Nunavummiut and to our communities.</seg>
<seg id="1523">The Order of Nunavut is the highest honour of all Government of Nunavut recipients, medals or medals.</seg>
<seg id="1524">To date, 15 individuals have been awarded the Order of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1525">These individuals have been recognized for their hard work and dedication in a number of areas, including public service broadcasting, education, language advocacy, diversity leadership, and growth.</seg>
<seg id="1526">Mr. Speaker, I am particularly proud to announce two of the recipients of the Order of Nunavut this year: Ms. Vardy Brewster and the other one is Mr. Ludy Palluq.</seg>
<seg id="1527">I am very pleased to have Mr. Palluq in the House today.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Welcome, Mr. Palluq.</seg>
<seg id="1529">As my colleagues are aware, Betty Brewster is well known as an interpreter for many years.</seg>
<seg id="1530">In 2016, she was recognized for her work and dedication in her work with the Inuit Uqausinginnik Taiguusiliuqtiit Language Award.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Mr. Pudluk was a Member of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories from 1975 to 1995.</seg>
<seg id="1532">During his many years of service, Mr. Palluq represented the High Arctic communities and played a key role in the creation of Nunavut.</seg>

<seg id="2">“The North right now is linked to what is happening tonight.”</seg>
<seg id="3">"Rodney Howard-Brown, the Reverend Evangelicals of Florida, is ordained in Iqaluit on August 27."</seg>
<seg id="4">(Photographer Thomas Runner)</seg>
<seg id="5">By Thomas Roaner Nunatsiaq News</seg>
<seg id="6">"Religious Reverend Evangelistic, better known for actions, climate change, and economies of the world that will eliminate the Sacramento faithful, came to the Iqaluit Church on August 27."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Rodney Herbert-Browne, a Saud Africa resident who moved to the Jonathan Styles, told delegates here in the Tampa Bay area last year that world leaders honoured Lucifer and drank Inuit blood donation."</seg>
<seg id="8">He preached for over an hour at the Iqaluit church to over 100 people.</seg>
<seg id="9">But the information is not for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="10">“The whole North right now is tied to what is happening tonight.</seg>
<seg id="11">"If you want Light (Ozone), please stand here (Parish Table), or you can leave."</seg>
<seg id="12">"It is up to you,” Mr. Huffett-Brown said after two and a half hours of work."</seg>
<seg id="13">Approximately 50 people attended.</seg>
<seg id="14">“I didn't fly several thousand miles to play.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I didn't come here to be liked, and I didn't come here to ask for your permission…remember: When Jesus died of a stroke, he wanted people to leave the room.”"</seg>
<seg id="16">"The turnout was mostly Inuit with infants, teenagers and elders."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Inside the church at the Christian Vallis Church in the Iqaluit Rued Noor area, children running between chairs."</seg>
<seg id="18">"On the outside, the church and the mosque face each other just behind the parking lot, both facing Ted Doug Lake."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Herbert-Brown’s guidance was part of an organized event from Bill Prankard Evangelistic Association’s Arctic Hope Project, in Ottawa."</seg>
<seg id="20">The organization did not respond to Nunatsiaq News when it was drafted to hear about this issue.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The Evangelical History Program, which is the 119 out of 300 people to attend in all of Nunavut’s major events, began after an hour of action."</seg>
<seg id="22">"First, the Iqaluit Parish Choir launched the evening in Iqaluit followed by the Evangelical Reverend Louis Arreak, who helped set up the Christian Vallis Church."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Eric Garnier, the Reverend of the Howard-Brown Revel of the Church of England, gave a 40-minute speech about the President."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Louis Arreak, the Iqaluit Pangilistic and singer, sings Rodney Haufer-Brown before his speech."</seg>
<seg id="25">(Picture by Rebel Ministers Enterprises)</seg>
<seg id="26">”God loves a generous donor”</seg>
<seg id="27">Mr. Garnier asked attendees to submit their email addresses to the registrar and to follow the Huffin-Brown Instagram.</seg>
<seg id="28">He issued permits to purchase the Hayward-Brown Okpik products.</seg>
<seg id="29">"The author of Howard-Brown’s book, Killing the World, talks about the experiences of the Troubled Economy 200 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="30">"“This is talking about someone who doesn't like Sacramento, that's exactly what he's talking about,” Mr. Garnier says."</seg>
<seg id="31">Mr. Speaker, Mr. Garnier then presented an 18-minute video about Howard-Brown’s history (Evangelical).</seg>
<seg id="32">"At the end of the video, Ms. Howard-Brown prayed that those who donate money to the church of God would be given something for the spirits that the church has protected."</seg>
<seg id="33">"“God loves a donor,” Ms. Howard-Brown said in the video."</seg>
<seg id="34">Mr. Garnier honoured his parents at the end of the video.</seg>
<seg id="35">"“One is spreading and one is collecting and we are celebrating the vegetables, so if you have a spreadsheet here, it goes to the church in your account."</seg>
<seg id="36">That is amazing.”</seg>
<seg id="37">"He then handed out the bags to be placed and told these people that in their capacity to get the “best gift to the soul,” whether it be financial, financial, or financial, to go to RMI Canada, using a credit card or their cellphones."</seg>
<seg id="38">"“I keep telling people, instead of putting the biggest payroll into the CHTOs or the new telephone line…Let them use it for church promotion and spiritual blessing."</seg>
<seg id="39">Is that correct?”</seg>
<seg id="40">Many people filled out forms and taped the bag and put it in a blue summer tank.</seg>
<seg id="41">Some people just turned around and held that bag in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="42">One female Inuk grabbed a blank bag and put it in a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="43">Mr. Speaker, the issue of accessing assistance in a country that is very difficult for many. Almost half of Nunavut’s population is dependent on income support, including food security and housing insecurity.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Ms. Howard-Brown did not respond to requests for an interview from Nunatsiaq News, so it is unclear how much she earned."</seg>
<seg id="45">Mr. Speaker, his Income Support Program is confidential to anyone. However, his website states that he provides training in 158 communities.</seg>
<seg id="46">It also states that individuals wishing to participate in the FANS program are eligible for income tax credits.</seg>
<seg id="47">Mr. Speaker, Mr. Garnier told the attendees to raise their hands and hold the donations of the Rebel Church.</seg>
<seg id="48">"“Dad, we thank you for this gift, and we thank you for representing your soul, let it go to our bank account,” Mr. Garnier says."</seg>
<seg id="49">Three litres of fuel were collected at full capacity.</seg>
<seg id="50">Rodney Howard-Brown imitates the woman's upper hand with his hand.</seg>
<seg id="51">Reverend Patterk Netser called his friend</seg>
<seg id="52">"The Reverend Evangelist is already based in Nunavut, escorting most of the communities."</seg>
<seg id="53">"The Bingo Symposium held annually and, between the 2000’s, steadily increased."</seg>
<seg id="54">"One official responsible for such a summit, Roger Armbuster, told Nunatsiaq News in 2004 that these conferences are a major sticker for issues such as social breakdowns such as violence and abuse."</seg>
<seg id="55">But Ms. Howard-Brown's model of investing in reclamation and reality therapy may be new to Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="56">"Patterk Netser, a long-time advocate of Christian religion and now Nunavut’s Minister of Housing and Nunavut Arctic College, has been called Herbert-Brown’s “Oskimo Friend” and has told him that climate change is not true."</seg>
<seg id="57">"Mr. Netser declined to be interviewed in Nunatsiaq News but said, “Ronnie is a friend of mine and we talk to each other.”"</seg>
<seg id="58">"When asked to respond to Ms. Howard-Brown’s numerous press shots, which have also said that the United States Supreme Court should be shot in the U.S. Constitution is unacceptable, Mr. Netser says, “What happens in America is not my responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="59">I am especially concerned about my constituents and the people of Nunavut.”</seg>
<seg id="60">"Rodney Howard-Brown, the Reverend Evangelicals of Florida, holds a ceremony in Iqaluit on August 27. (photographer Thomas Runner)"</seg>
<seg id="61">“Tonight’s light on the ice”</seg>
<seg id="62">"After an hour of action, Ms. Howard-Brown -- the main focus -- turned to the Reverend’s table."</seg>
<seg id="63">"In “The Light Tonight on the Ice,” this missionary says to over 100 people, most of them Inuit, of all ages."</seg>
<seg id="64">"“If you don't want the light, just run to the door while you can.”"</seg>
<seg id="65">"Within an hour, Ms. Howard-Brown’s voice would turn louder and louder."</seg>
<seg id="66">He would take a break and say, “What’s going to happen?” He would say, “What’s going to happen?” He would say, “What’s going to happen?” He would say, “What’s going to happen?” He would say, “What’s going to happen?”</seg>
<seg id="67">"“I know I don't feel like I'm from Africa, so I'm because my parents used to let me in, they never let me out,” he says with a laugh."</seg>
<seg id="68">“Moses was the first Secretariat (Talbot).</seg>
<seg id="69">He broke the first one and had to go back and get another one.</seg>
<seg id="70">And Adamie and Evie were the first ones to produce Apple products.”</seg>
<seg id="71">"Mr. Howard-Brown gained a reputation, for his most part, by providing a laugh at the meetings and making the attendees laugh."</seg>
<seg id="72">"His grandson was approached by an asthma attack when he was two years old and he laughed for 12 minutes before stopping, Horvath-Brown says."</seg>
<seg id="73">Herbert-Brown has been a frequent critic of other Evangelicals who are also proud of the world.</seg>
<seg id="74">Referred to as the Auditor General of Canada, where religious preachers become humorous and chaotic, Mr. Herbert-Brown has responded to the protesters by saying that they are not satisfied with the breath and that they are going to go to a dangerous place.</seg>
<seg id="75">"Mr. Arreak, from Iqaluit as Vangillis and as a singer who helped with this event, gave members a laugh during his preamble."</seg>
<seg id="76">"“This is not a funeral, why are people sad?”"</seg>
<seg id="77">Herbert-Brown said that.</seg>
<seg id="78">Mr. Arreak is laughing.</seg>
<seg id="79">“We are serving Jesus and he is alive.”</seg>
<seg id="80">Mr. Arreak laughed loudly.</seg>
<seg id="81">"“I like this missionary,” he says to Mr. Arreak, his laughter is louder."</seg>
<seg id="82">Mr. Howie-Brown shares a laugh while others are just laughing.</seg>
<seg id="83">“They are very happy.</seg>
<seg id="84">"Enjoy the water, from places like reservoirs forever.”"</seg>
<seg id="85">Mr. Arreak laughed and started laughing. He started beating from the roof of the house.</seg>
<seg id="86">“This is real.</seg>
<seg id="87">No one is going to be arrested tonight.”</seg>
<seg id="88">"Mr. Arreak, who has told the Nunatsiaq News that he does not want to speak to the media, laughs again."</seg>
<seg id="89">"Ms. Howard-Brown also spoke in plain language, saying that the language was understood in the aboriginal language of Omar Papua, the New Guinea missionary."</seg>
<seg id="90">(interpretation ends) Man-on-C-Pa.</seg>
<seg id="91">"Ron-Pam-Goo-Pa,” he says."</seg>
<seg id="92">Rodney Howard-Browne is inviting guests to the church table so that they can have a bright air.</seg>
<seg id="93">Some Not Laughing</seg>
<seg id="94">However, many Mr. Howard-Brown preachers don't find it funny and funny.</seg>
<seg id="95">There were a lot of shuffles coming out when he wasn't finished.</seg>
<seg id="96">"Without touching the unilingual attendees, Ms. Howard-Brown had two people yelling at her before they left."</seg>
<seg id="97">“Where are you going Brenda?</seg>
<seg id="98">Hi.</seg>
<seg id="99">Hi!</seg>
<seg id="100">Are you leaving?”</seg>
<seg id="101">Mr. Howard-Brown said to one man and he was silent as he left the church.</seg>
<seg id="102">"“You come in and take pictures on your phone and then you leave."</seg>
<seg id="103">You are a reporter for the Daily News here?”</seg>
<seg id="104">The attendees are laughing.</seg>
<seg id="105">"“What would it be like to say when I take it and take it back ... find out who it is and why it is taking pictures and why to leave,” he says to one of his staff."</seg>
<seg id="106">"After putting them in the booth after the presentation, Ms. Howard-Brown suddenly grabs the two ladies in the seats because they don't like their sight."</seg>
<seg id="107">“Are you back alive?</seg>
<seg id="108">"What are you, Jeff Whitehorse?”"</seg>
<seg id="109">The audience is laughing.</seg>
<seg id="110">“I have never seen people sitting right at the edge of the House who can't change.</seg>
<seg id="111">"So you can jump around in other places, or maybe you are better than others.”"</seg>
<seg id="112">The two ladies got up and started leaving.</seg>
<seg id="113">“I’m just trying to ask a question.</seg>
<seg id="114">"That’s what I do, it’s my job."</seg>
<seg id="115">I know the human health condition.</seg>
<seg id="116">Don't be anything for me.</seg>
<seg id="117">It is not a laughing matter.</seg>
<seg id="118">The whole North right now is tied to what is happening tonight.”</seg>
<seg id="119">Event staff are telling attendees not to take pictures or recordings.</seg>
<seg id="120">"However, they filmed the whole process."</seg>
<seg id="121">There are even people running around crying when Heather-Brown touches them and they are filmed very close to them.</seg>
<seg id="122">"Photographs from Rebel Churches on NTC’s Facebook page show a number of people attending despite the loss of their face -- their faces are visible, iced, mouths closed, or just lying on the floor."</seg>
<seg id="123">Lady Harvard-Brown touched her hand on the floor and cried under the thin mattress.</seg>
<seg id="124">"In front of him, Mr. Howard-Brown and his staff go to touch a couple of people."</seg>
<seg id="125">This event was originally geared towards St. Jude.</seg>
<seg id="126">"This event was originally intended to be here at St. Jude’s Anglican Church in Iqaluit, but it was changed."</seg>
<seg id="127">"This change was changed by invitations from Ms. Howard-Browne, Secretary General of St. Joamie."</seg>
<seg id="128">"David Parsons, the Anglican Bishop of the North, said he was not aware that Ms. Howard-Brown was going to be ordained in St. Jude."</seg>
<seg id="129">"If he had known, he is saying that he would have resigned because Ms. Howard-Brown was overwhelming."</seg>
<seg id="130">"As a result, the Local Anglican Church did not comply with the requirement to have permission from the Bishop for the event, Mr. Parsons says."</seg>
<seg id="131">"The Anglican Church is responsible for instilling sensitivity, and also deals with other religious groups, Mr. Parsons says."</seg>
<seg id="132">"“But there is a good belief in each other, and you don't deal with issues that would not be acceptable to religion and people who go to church there.”"</seg>
<seg id="133">In Ms. Howe-Brown's case it seems to be another matter.</seg>
<seg id="134">“I am not here to fight for religious wishes.</seg>
<seg id="135">"If religion was to be an Arctic event, then it would be a historical event in the North,” he says to the audience."</seg>
<seg id="136">“I don't come for invitations.</seg>
<seg id="137">"Need…if you have enough light, please be receptive.”"</seg>

<seg id="1">"With poor attendance, Canada has quietly launched a new Northern Policy Document"</seg>
<seg id="2">Liberals say this new policy creates a “huge change of direction”</seg>
<seg id="3">"Many harpoons grow in Cape Dorset, Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="4">"In the federal election tomorrow, the Liberal Government unveiled the long awaited Northern Policy Framework."</seg>
<seg id="5">(File Photo)</seg>
<seg id="6">By Jim Bell</seg>
<seg id="7">"The day before the Federal Election Campaign began, the Liberal Government, with minimal turnout, launched its long-awaited Northern and Northern Policy Framework on September 10."</seg>
<seg id="8">"This document, which marks the first phase of Continuing Action, replaces the Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s 2009 Northern Strategy and the Harper government’s 2010 Statement on Foreign Policy."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is designed to guide federal policy in the North up to 2030 – but there is no implementation plan or political direction for future action.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Those are the things that are going to be done in phase 2, the action plan states."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Despite these efforts, this initiative from Carolyn Bennett, Minister of Public-Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Affairs, said that this policy document reflects a “huge change in direction to the Federal Government.”"</seg>
<seg id="12">The introduction of this policy has been delayed as expected.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Earlier this year, Mr. Barnabas announced that this policy would be introduced in June."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CBC reported earlier this month that a news release scheduled to be held in Yellowknife in August has been cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Under the Liberal Party Policy there are eight “Goals,” including action items, and ten (10) “Principles.”"</seg>
<seg id="16">"It addresses a wide range of policy issues, including community and regional economic development, infrastructure, aboriginal rights, environmental protection, National Defense and Foreign Policy."</seg>
<seg id="17">"When Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, on December 20, 2016, announced that his government would be developing a new policy, he even stated that there would be a “coordinated” approach between northern governments and aboriginal organizations."</seg>
<seg id="18">"As a result, more than 25 aboriginal organizations, including the Government of Nunavut, the Northwest Territories, the Yukon, Manitoba, Quebec and Newfoundland-Labrador, participated in the framework."</seg>
<seg id="19">"“In developing the Canadian Northern and Northern Policy Action Plan, our partners helped us understand and raise awareness of the limited opportunities and opportunities for different regions, responsibilities and land rights across the North,” Mr. Bennett said in a news release."</seg>
<seg id="20">"And some of the partners also wrote letters of intent, which were produced in a separate policy document."</seg>
<seg id="21">Some comments do not address federal policy</seg>
<seg id="22">"For example, ITK, the Government of Nunavut, the Government of the Northwest Territories and the three territorial governments have shared their own personal terms."</seg>
<seg id="23">But there is something happening.</seg>
<seg id="24">These letters that have been submitted to the tribunal may not be able to represent the federal policy.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is for example a sign that the Federal Government may run into conflicts of interest with the over 31 working groups.</seg>
<seg id="26">"“While this action paper is part of the process, it is not a clear indication of the views of the Federal Government or other partners,” the action document states."</seg>
<seg id="27">The document also states that the approval process was challenging.</seg>
<seg id="28">"“The ideas, goals and goals and aspirations of the conference are based on many ideas and ideas."</seg>
<seg id="29">What this means is that there are agreements between the federal government and the aboriginal people involved in the approval process.”</seg>
<seg id="30">You can find garbage bags for northern policy and I am tabling it here.</seg>
<seg id="31">8 Goals</seg>
<seg id="32">"Here are eight goals in action, highlighting federal initiatives."</seg>
<seg id="33">"• A strong, sustainable, diversified and sustainable community and regional economy."</seg>
<seg id="34">• That Canada's North and Arctic Indigenous Peoples be sustainable and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="35">• The people of Canada's North and the Arctic should be safe and protected.</seg>
<seg id="36">• A stronger business environment where differences from other parts of Canada can be corrected.</seg>
<seg id="37">• The Act is guided by the Arctic as an effective tool to develop new opportunities and opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="38">• Knowledge and understanding of the guidelines for decision making.</seg>
<seg id="39">• Canada’s Arctic and the Arctic’s livelihoods are healthy and continue to strive.</seg>
<seg id="40">• Aajiiqatigiinniq helps to maintain and restore trust between indigenous and non-Inuit.</seg>
<seg id="41">These objectives begin with a variety of “projects” that have been further identified.</seg>
<seg id="42">Ten Principles</seg>
<seg id="43">"In order to achieve these goals and objectives, the policy document outlines the principles underneath, which are designed to “continue to provide direction for implementation of the mandate”:"</seg>
<seg id="44">"• Decisions about the North will be made in cooperation and involving northern interests, rights, needs and northern interests."</seg>
<seg id="45">"• The rights and positions of federal, provincial, provincial, aboriginal and municipal governments will be respected."</seg>
<seg id="46">"• Organizing must be used and respected, socially, culturally, economically and environmentally mindful."</seg>
<seg id="47">"• Meeting with Aboriginal Peoples on an ongoing basis, using the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission as a starting point, would be a great achievement."</seg>
<seg id="48">"• As climate change is a real issue on the land, action plans will be undertaken by a wide range of stakeholders, including its impact on indigenous peoples, who continue to rely on land and wildlife for cultural, economic and food security."</seg>
<seg id="49">"• The Policy and Action Plan will identify inequities and equality, and implement resources such as the Gender-Based Analysis &amp; Plus Strategy that will address potential impacts on different aspects of society."</seg>
<seg id="50">"• This will be a process that takes into account various constitutional initiatives such as rights, interests and circumstances such as Inuit, Northern Indigenous and Métis are respected, clarified and implemented."</seg>
<seg id="51">"• The Federal Government recognizes Inuit, First Nations and First Nations as aboriginal peoples of Canada, in this sense of inequity, rights knowledgeable communities, with their own history, with the federal government."</seg>
<seg id="52">"• Working to build relationships based on the right, respect, teamwork must reflect the needs, priorities and circumstances of each individual."</seg>
<seg id="53">"• All organizations, from independent sources to universities and colleges, as well as non-profit organizations, community organizations and independent Canadians, have a major role to play in building a stronger Canada’s North."</seg>

<seg id="1">Nunavut Conservative Candidate Blasts Carbon Tax Increase Costs for “Every Thing”</seg>
<seg id="2">Leona Aglukkaq discusses her campaign plans for Nunavut</seg>
<seg id="3">"Leona Aglukkaq, a Nunavut Conservative candidate, shows Conservative President Andrew Chenier flowers at the Sylvia Grinnell Park during his visit to the city on June 19."</seg>
<seg id="4">(Photographer Emma Toronto)</seg>
<seg id="5">By Emma Tarrant</seg>
<seg id="6">"The Nunavut Conservative candidate says that if the Conservative Party were to become a government, they would eliminate the carbon tax because it “increases the cost of everything else.”"</seg>
<seg id="7">Leona Aglukkaq began her campaign in Nunavut travelling to communities.</seg>
<seg id="8">Nunavut’s Solicitor General began her campaign with an event held in Iqaluit on September 12 at the Frobisher Lodge.</seg>
<seg id="9">Afterwards she flew to Rankin Inlet the following day before returning to Iqaluit next week.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Nunatsiaq News had an opportunity to talk to Ms. Aglukkaq while she was in Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="11">"This carbon tax (Carbon Tax) “increases airfares, groceries, shipping, hunting and homeownership,” reads Aglukkaq's campaign poster."</seg>
<seg id="12">Ms. Aglukkaq also told Nunatsiaq News that this tax has had a negative impact on day cares and seniors’ homes as a result of increased heating costs.</seg>
<seg id="13">“All arts and crafts are affected by this carbon tax.”</seg>
<seg id="14">Ms. Aglukkaq said.</seg>
<seg id="15">“Mr. Speaker, the Smoke Tax Rebate Program, when we can’t afford it all, it’s like you can’t afford it. It’s like you can’t do the opposite of a computer.”</seg>
<seg id="16">"However, George Hickes, the Nunavut Finance Minister, announced in May that under an agreement with Ottawa, electricity and aviation fuel in Nunavut now belonged to this tax, he said they were exempt."</seg>
<seg id="17">The Government of Nunavut and the Government of Nunavut subsidizes half of the carbon tax for Nunavut residents.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Ms. Aglukkaq’s candidates for Nunavut have four priorities: affordable housing, mental health and employment."</seg>
<seg id="19">“How can we, as a government and the private sector and the Government of Nunavut, work together to address this huge housing need across the north?”</seg>
<seg id="20">"Mr. Speaker, one of Ms. Aglukkaq’s campaign priorities is to “Develop an action plan that will include housing for special needs, elder housing and disability.”"</seg>
<seg id="21">"Federal and territorial governments should also consider ways to promote homeownership, Mr. Okalik."</seg>
<seg id="22">Ms. Aglukkaq also mentioned the Northern Employment Opportunities Program and the Mental Health Training Program for Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="23">"“Nunavut is a vast coastal jurisdiction in Canada and we are still left with the need for marine infrastructure in our communities, so we have to consider large scale projects like this in the North,” he says."</seg>
<seg id="24">"“We need to address the need for housing, equipping Nunavummiut with mental health services so that we can help our communities.”"</seg>
<seg id="25">"When asked if she would be relaxing the federal Nutrition North Canada Program, Ms. Aglukkaq said that the carbon tax on groceries has increased the cost of living through increased airfares."</seg>
<seg id="26">"When asked if he thought about using this program, and if not, what he would do other than the carbon tax, he indicated that he would talk to the Nutrition North Canada Board."</seg>
<seg id="27">"He said that once the Conservative Government becomes a government, this council would always exist."</seg>
<seg id="28">“It is very important to have people in the north who can tell the government how to improve the program.</seg>
<seg id="29">This is not a very good project.</seg>
<seg id="30">Not everything is perfect in the world.</seg>
<seg id="31">But there has to be a subsidy for northern food.”</seg>
<seg id="32">"Ms. Aglukkaq did not want to be specific on how she would talk about the Nutrition North Canada Program, but said that there should be a subsidy for food and that “elimination” would not help."</seg>
<seg id="33">"Recently, research published in the Canadian Public Health Association Journal suggested that food is becoming more difficult in Nunavut through the Nutrition North Canada Program, as outlined in the Canadian Community Health Survey."</seg>
<seg id="34">"Ms. Aglukkaq indicated that her experience as the Minister of Environment would help to address climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but she did not specifically say what her role would be."</seg>
<seg id="35">He stated that he would support the Kivalliq Hydro-Fibre Link and Greece Bay Road and the Kitikmeot Port Project.</seg>
<seg id="36">“Are we going to be able to stop using fossil fuels in the near future?</seg>
<seg id="37">"No,” he says."</seg>
<seg id="38">"When Conservative President Andrew Schell travelled to Iqaluit last June, he stressed the need for Nunavut to develop a recycling program, saying it is a “real challenge” under the current Liberal Government."</seg>
<seg id="39">Ms. Aglukkaq stated that she believes that policies have been put in place to talk to people about recycling development and that there is no guarantee that they will be put in place right now.</seg>
<seg id="40">"“The Nunavut Land Claims Agreement provides information on how businesses should be dealt with in the north. The Land Claims Agreement, in my view, will be the most important environmental plan."</seg>
<seg id="41">"It protects our land, protects our waters, protects our wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="42">“It’s already set out the criteria for how projects should be done.</seg>
<seg id="43">It has become a legal issue that we should be proud of.</seg>
<seg id="44">"And the decisions on the north have to come from the people of the north, not from Ottawa.”"</seg>
<seg id="45">"Ms. Aglukkaq left the headquarters to travel to Pond Inlet and Arctic Bay on September 19, her office said."</seg>
<seg id="46">"He also plans to go to Pangnirtung, Qikiqtarjuaq and Whale Cove before going to the Keewatin and the Kitikmeot."</seg>

<seg id="4">Mr. Clendenberg has been the Languages Commissioner since 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">By Nunatsiaq News</seg>
<seg id="6">"Nunavut’s Legislative Assembly will soon be seeking a new Languages Commissioner, following the resignation of Helen Klengenberg from this position."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Mr. Clendenberg, Nunavut’s languages commissioner, effective June 2017, resigned not too long ago due to health issues."</seg>
<seg id="8">"As the Languages Commissioner is responsible for the Solicitor General of Nunavut and is required to report to the Legislative Assembly, we now have Mr. Clendenberg’s successor."</seg>
<seg id="9">"That would be done through the Management and Services Board, which is the Standing Committee of Members responsible for the Legislative Assembly's operations, as Speaker Simeon Mikkungwak said in a brief statement since September 17."</seg>
<seg id="10">"“I think the Management and Services Board will start the process of hiring this person in the near future and we will make an announcement if necessary on an interim basis,” Mr. Mikkungwak said."</seg>
<seg id="11">"The role of the Languages Commissioner, under the mandate of the Official Languages Act, is to provide language rights monitoring in Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Klengenberg was appointed in 2017 after a lengthy search for almost a year, with the sudden resignation of Sandra Inutiq in June 2016."</seg>
<seg id="13">Inutiq resigned from her position a month after submitting a report on the Qikiqtani General Hospital stating that the hospital does not have a language policy and does not provide services to Inuktitut and French-speaking patients.</seg>
<seg id="14">He also indicated that the Deputy Minister of Health spent a year trying to get the necessary documentation for the assessment.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Subsequently, the Legislative Assembly put out an RFP for the position three times before Mr. Clendenberg was appointed."</seg>
<seg id="16">"In 2017, the Languages Commissioner’s position had annual pay ranges from $119,000 to $170,000 a year, northern allowance of $15,016 a year, 25 days a year for paid leave and other benefits."</seg>

<seg id="6">Cambridge Bay (GN) Agrees to a New Polar Bear Management Plan</seg>
<seg id="7">This was a press release from the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board members at the Kitikmeot Wildlife Management Board meeting in Cambridge Bay last week.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The starting point for the new polar bear management plan is to have a balanced male and female polar bear hunt for Nunavut polar bears, this Nunavut Wildlife Management Board Chairman Dan Shewchuk, told delegates."</seg>
<seg id="9">"The meeting in Cambridge Bay is the first of three regional wildlife boards that this individual and Jason Akeeagok, the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board Executive Director, would like to attend."</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Akeeagok said that the polar bear management plan was a “tremendous undertaking.”</seg>
<seg id="11">"“We will do what we can to make sure that this happens before the polar bear season is over,” he says."</seg>
<seg id="12">"This plan has been under consideration for almost five years and it was mentioned in the business plan last March in Iqaluit at the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board meeting."</seg>
<seg id="13">The plan runs until 2029.</seg>

<seg id="18">Polar bear quotas have been established by region (e.g. Male only) of these polar bears…and kills of polar bears are included in the year polar bear quotas established by the communities.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Although this new plan will not increase the total allowable harvest at this time, a new total allowable harvest may be considered as a result of new data collection."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Under the previous plan, the Nunavut communities were allowed to harvest one female and to harvest two male polar bears through the annual community polar bear tags."</seg>

<seg id="25">As a result, some communities no longer have tags to protect their polar bears.</seg>

<seg id="1">Inuktitut Roman Roman Roman Orthography – Reflections and Development and Persistence</seg>
<seg id="2">The gift of today to our children and future generations</seg>
<seg id="3">The Inuktitut Roman Orthography Writing System is accessible to all Inuit languages across Canada.</seg>
<seg id="4">Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami has stated that it will not replace Roman orthography and in the Inuit homelands, traditional orthography and so on.</seg>
<seg id="5">Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami has also stated that the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami will not have to change traditional writing systems.</seg>
<seg id="6">By Métis Miaji ᓭ munn</seg>
<seg id="7">"I was very proud to hear that the Members of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami have unanimously approved the new Inuktitut syllabic writing system, with the name of Inuktitut Roman Orthography 5167 that was released earlier this month."</seg>
<seg id="8">Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami means the “unity of Canada's ordinary people” and there are few good examples of the strength that our people in the Middle East have shared for the survival of our culture and language.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is very encouraging to me at this time.</seg>
<seg id="10">"In June 2011, 5196, when I was the President of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, we launched a brave campaign to change the education program."</seg>
<seg id="11">"We launched a National Challenge to Inunnguiniq Inuinnaqtun Inuinnaqtun 5312 Education System with 10 Strong Points of Instruction, a shared vision to ensure our children have the skills they need to be educated, safe and secure in Inuktitut culture and language."</seg>
<seg id="12">򀿿Our recommendations included the establishment of a standardized Public Records System.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ordinary 5312 Canadians have taken many years to reach and reach this new era of colonialism.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Inuinnaqtun 5312; the Language Reviewers in every community in the Inuit Region provided an Inuktitut version of Roman orthography 5167;.</seg>
<seg id="15">This means that we will have one writing system for all Inuit to learn their language that can be used properly.</seg>
<seg id="16">The use of this new writing system will grow rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The Duda Inuinnaqtun 5312;  it will not replace or eliminate the community's traditional writing system, as it will be used to participate in the Tamatta Spelling System to improve Inuinnaqtun ᓀ  communications."</seg>
<seg id="18">The gift we give today to our children and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="19">I can now imagine that ordinary citizens of 5312 Canadians will be able to communicate better and share illuminating records of teaching materials and excellent teaching materials can be a concern when 5312 and our children will be able to graduate from high school and be able to speak both languages.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Mr. Speaker, in the world, we are faced with challenges as individuals and as a result of our attempts to treat western societal values, our culture, our families, and our language."</seg>
<seg id="21">But we are here today.</seg>
<seg id="22">In previous years we had to look at past experiences to find out who we are today and why we are today ᑌ򀿿 we need to find out where we are today.</seg>
<seg id="23">So I believe my goal is that we have a two-stroke approach now. Are we going to have to keep going back to page 5357 or are we going to be focusing on future opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="24">The use of Inuktitut in Roman orthography 5167;The use of the Canadian public as a whole tells me that we want to move forward as a united society.</seg>
<seg id="25">"ᑌ about eight years ago when we started developing a national strategy for Inuit education, we were able to implement the word Inuinnaqtun (5283; inuktitut) to mean all individuals in each language, regardless of their dialect."</seg>
<seg id="26">To me this has given me a chance to see ordinary 5312; unified Mr. Speaker, 5312; it gives us an opportunity to go over all the actions that are not true to the barriers that we face.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Our language, our identity, and our identity are entrenched, and the health of our language makes us healthy."</seg>
<seg id="28">I hope that we will be able to use all Inuktitut terminology and spelling and move forward in the future ᑌᓭ as we work together to fill vacant lots we try to work with each other as individuals.</seg>

<seg id="4">(Image)</seg>
<seg id="5">"In this way, the Quebec Government has not taken advantage of the responsibilities of aboriginal peoples, Mr. Ledo said."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Mr. Ledger apologized -- the first of 142 opinion reports -- at the National Aboriginal Peoples Conference on Wednesday, October 2, two days after former Supreme Court Justice Jack Owens, the former Commission Director released his report."</seg>

<seg id="8">He said he would review all of the decisions and find out exactly why there was such a discrepancy.</seg>
<seg id="9">"“A lot of the laws, policies, practices or departmental practices that are used to treat inequality and inequity are getting to the point where they are not providing adequate services to First Nations and Inuit,” Mr. Vence said in his September 30 report released."</seg>

<seg id="1">Three Legal Professions Promise to End Nunavut’s Teal Fuel Consumption By 2030</seg>
<seg id="2">“This is an ambitious project.”</seg>
<seg id="3">Students walk in four corners of Iqaluit on September 27 to participate in the Global Climate Change Initiative.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three lawyers running for the federal government have announced their intention to end Nunavut’s dependence on diesel fuel by generating electricity by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="5">(Photographer Dustin Paktar)</seg>
<seg id="6">By Dustin Paktar</seg>
<seg id="7">"In this year’s federal election, three law firms announced that Nunavut’s dependence on diesel fuel for electricity will be suspended until 2030."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Currently all 25 communities in Nunavut have diesel-powered plants operated by the Qulliq Energy Corporation, the only Power Corporation in Canada that do not have a modified lighting system in their communities."</seg>
<seg id="9">Changing that would be a huge and costly project.</seg>
<seg id="10">"“This is an ambitious project,” says Martha Leonier, Senior Arctic Renewable Energy Officer for the World Wildlife Fund."</seg>
<seg id="11">"“It's probably possible, just a little bit of luck.”"</seg>
<seg id="12">The Green Party’s campaign promises to “implement renewable energy.</seg>
<seg id="13">"By 2030, all of Canada’s energy systems will be renewable."</seg>
<seg id="14">This includes outpost camps in northern communities such as diesel fuel to be decommissioned.”</seg>
<seg id="15">"The Liberal Party stated that it would be “moving forward financially to make sure that the Inuit communities are no longer dependent on fossil fuels but have the power to generate clean, renewable energy sources -- like hydro, wind and solar energy -- by 2030.”"</seg>
<seg id="16">The New Timothy Party (NDP) stated that it will “target Canada to generate energy from greenhouse gases by 2030… This is carbon-neutral power by focusing on communities and creating jobs.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We would assist in applying for programs such as community ownership and operation of clean energy projects to provide employment for residents and qualified persons, and to work with aboriginal and circumpolar communities on decommissioning of Teal Oil.”"</seg>
<seg id="18">"Under the Department of Environment and Climate Change Canada reports released earlier this year, air pollution in Nunavut accounts for less than 1 percent of the impact."</seg>
<seg id="19">"In 2017, Nunavut produced 0.6 megatonnes of greenhouse gas emissions, more than 18,000 vehicles."</seg>
<seg id="20">"In the same year, Alberta, which has been named Canada’s most populous country, produced approximately 84 million vehicles with a capacity."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Despite this, Nunavut has seen an increase in greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent since 2005, with the largest increase in Canada and Alberta almost doubling, which is the second largest increase in the same area."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Even if there were any changes to the Power Corporation’s three MLAs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the impact on Canada’s carbon monoxide emissions would still be minimal."</seg>
<seg id="23">Will the communities be getting this equipment.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Nunavummiut pay the highest rate of electricity compared to any other jurisdiction in Canada, and funding for energy would help to reduce that."</seg>
<seg id="25">"However, taking action on renewable energy projects may not be the balancing act of payments that are currently in place for energy projects."</seg>
<seg id="26">"Last month, the United Nations Wildlife Management Board issued a report outlining how a renewable energy source could provide energy to all 25 communities in Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="27">"They found that with a reduction of 8 percent -- primarily due to the risk of a project or other sources of revenue -- Baker Lake, Coral Harbour, Iqaluit and Rankin Inlet would save money by moving to 20 percent renewable energy, including a direct payment system for up to 15 years."</seg>
<seg id="28">The survey also indicated that 16 other communities have a 4 percent subsidy -- roughly the Qulliq Energy Corporation’s loan limit -- and roughly $2 million in subsidy and a 20 percent loan transfer.</seg>
<seg id="29">"However, the report only talks about the feasibility of these projects, suggesting that moving renewable energy would be cheaper than the current energy costs."</seg>
<seg id="30">But relocating communities that are qualified for renewable energy would be a huge task.</seg>
<seg id="31">"“It would take a lot of consultation, and they would have to start next year in order to achieve the energy goals of each community,” says Leneau."</seg>
<seg id="32">"“They would have to go to the communities, work with them on what they want to do, and how the communities envision energy, see what their priorities are and what the communities most consider as important places of transportation and hunting.”"</seg>
<seg id="33">"This does not include such things as installing modular equipment for solar or wind, which would take about two years to put together properly, or projects for the Qulliq Energy Corporation to ensure that renewable energy sources are reliable for their equipment."</seg>
<seg id="34">"Moving all communities 100 percent from renewable energy, which the three MLAs are proposing, would not only be a long-term commitment but also a significant investment."</seg>
<seg id="35">"While the New Timothy Party (NDP) and the Liberal Party have not announced how much funding they would contribute to the move, the Green Party announced last week."</seg>
<seg id="36">"As part of its campaign activity spending report, the Green Party announced that it will provide $150 million over five years to relocate all of the outpost camps and northern communities -- not just Nunavut’s Teal Oil Decommissioning Program."</seg>
<seg id="37">It is not acceptable however.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Mr. Leonard explained that if communities like Arctic Bay were to relocate or at least 60 percent of their power plant, operating costs would have to be about $27.8 million."</seg>
<seg id="39">"Under the same report, for other communities to try and achieve 60 percent renewable energy, they would have to use a higher rate."</seg>
<seg id="40">"In Iqaluit, it is estimated that it will cost approximately $148 million."</seg>
<seg id="41">"Although it is evident that it is less than the $250 million to $500 million dollar energy project that was proposed by the City, this would apply to one community that the Green Party is proposing."</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Leneau does not anticipate that the federal government would fully pay for these projects, but they did indicate that the scope of work and how they would be done and that it would take time."</seg>
<seg id="43">"Looking at the 2030 deadline, you won’t have much time."</seg>
<seg id="44">"“In terms of solar energy, I think it would take two to five years."</seg>
<seg id="45">"In terms of wind energy, you would think it would take five to seven years to do it,” says Leonard when asked about how much energy they would be doing."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Looking at these deadlines and splitting them into 25 communities and if they’re going to be doing a lot of work at the same time in remote communities and the land is not always available, Leonard is thinking about how to get it done."</seg>
<seg id="47">"“I think that if you want to reach those targets, that is going to be a big change."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Even if we don't reach 100 percent, then there is a lot of interest.”"</seg>
<seg id="49">"Note: This handbook deals with federal candidates including the Green Party, Liberal Party and the New Democrats (NDP)."</seg>
<seg id="50">"At the time of putting this book together, the Conservative Party has not announced what they are running for, so they are not included in this report."</seg>

<seg id="1">Subject: Operational Early Childhood and Childcare Issues</seg>
<seg id="2">We must recognize the important role that early childhood education and childcare workers in Nunavut play in our workforce.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Laakkuluk Williamson Patrick, the Chair of the Footprints Daycare Board, is seeking additional support from the Government of Nunavut for quality early childhood education and childcare based on Inuit language and culture."</seg>
<seg id="4">By Nunatsiaq News</seg>
<seg id="5">Correspondence to the Premier of Nunavut, Joe Savikataaq, and the Minister of Education, David Joanasie, and Minister Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="6">I am one of the people who have children who are very sensitive to our language and culture.</seg>
<seg id="7">"As the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Footprints Daycare, the only Inuktut language school for children in the Early Childhood Education Program in Iqaluit and is the only Iqaluit in the capital of Nunavut to provide daycare services for children who already speak Inuktitut."</seg>
<seg id="8">"The Footprints Daycare Centre was closed from August 21 to September 12, 2019 due to staff shortages. In addition, it has been operating without staff for almost a year."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Very few people apply for jobs at the Footprints Daycare because they are not paid enough (Iqaluit has the highest daycare rate), employees who don’t have any benefits or housing because they are seen as low as a woman working at the daycare."</seg>
<seg id="10">"The daycare is now open again, but the emergency operation is challenging: we lost one of our very good employees who resigned tirelessly."</seg>
<seg id="11">"We now have a part-time office worker, full-time daycare coordinator, two childcare workers and each parent who work rotating at the daycare (all of them have criminal records and safety checks), full-time, while we are looking for someone to hire, who is certified."</seg>
<seg id="12">"This process is rarely used, but for those of us who have children, we believe in the safety of our children and that the Inuktitut-speaking witness table be open."</seg>
<seg id="13">There is still a danger of closing the facility permanently.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Nunavut’s daycare operations are currently non-profitable. Childcare workers are expected to provide one of the most important child-related services to provide quality early childhood education, which is based on Inuit culture and language, although it is undervalued and under-resourced."</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr. Speaker, the non-profit organization relies on a number of sources of funding from the Department of Family Services. The Embrace Life Council is a volunteer to run the Nunavut Daycare Early Childhood Education Program.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Childcare workers suffer from a lack of pay and benefits, lack of training for their jobs and lack of housing for staff."</seg>
<seg id="17">Childcare workers are now being asked to work below their needs for self-reliance or family support.</seg>
<seg id="18">We are facing a difficult time in our daycares due to the unique staffing requirements required to have the skills necessary to promote and preserve the Inuit language and culture from an early age in our children; Tumilty hires only Inuktitut speakers.</seg>
<seg id="19">We are 100 percent Inuit employed.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, with the high turnover of our employees, we have a hard time recruiting staff. Due to the lack of competition and the lack of benefits, employees have resigned.</seg>
<seg id="21">"So, it affects the early childhood programs and the early childhood programs."</seg>
<seg id="22">Inuit need to be supported in this regard and value our language and culture for the education of our children.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Government of Nunavut should consider ways to better support quality early childhood education and ensure that the daycare is based on Inuit language and culture.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Provide effective and valued early childhood education and child care workers with compensation from competitors and benefits, including housing for their work, vacation time, training at work and school."</seg>
<seg id="25">Footprints envision the daycare expanding to the public and providing more resources so that more Inuit children can have a place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We are now looking for a larger daycare facility to make this vision work, so we have raised close to $80,000 for the new space that has been raised."</seg>
<seg id="27">It proposes the following amendments to the Government of Nunavut:</seg>
<seg id="28">"• Combining early childhood and childcare workers into Government of Nunavut employees to provide competitive wages for Government of Nunavut employees, consistent with the Government of Nunavut’s expenditures in eight categories, which are applied to employees in the Nunavut school system;"</seg>
<seg id="29">• Incorporating the operations and maintenance of daycares across Nunavut into the education system;</seg>
<seg id="30">"• Provide benefits to early childhood and childcare workers but not limited to short-term measures including long-term sick leave, vacation pay, bilingual pay, parental leave and housing"</seg>
<seg id="31">• Establish an organization to support all daycares in Nunavut;</seg>
<seg id="32">• Working with daycares to immediately address urgent and pressing issues, together, we will work together to develop a long-term plan to change the way the child care system operates.</seg>
<seg id="33">We must recognize the important role that early childhood education and childcare workers in Nunavut play in our workforce.</seg>
<seg id="34">To ensure that our daycares are staffed, fully staffed, and that all staff receive benefits.</seg>
<seg id="35">We have to keep our daycares open.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Changing the way the child care system operates will allow Nunavut early childhood and day care workers to value their work. This will allow them to take a significant step forward in the early childhood and daycare operations to change in the best way possible in the lives of children, including learning the Inuktitut language, growing up with a strong foundation of Inuit culture, and being able to participate fully in the rest of Canada."</seg>
<seg id="37">"Sincerely, Mr. Speaker."</seg>

<seg id="9">"Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated President Aluki Kuuttiq and Louis Tapardjuk, a former Government of Nunavut minister and a member of the Inuit Uqausinginnik Taiguusiliuqtiit, the Nunavut Language Rights Tribunal, came in on time and sat."</seg>
<seg id="10">"The photographers were organized to broadcast live on NTI’s Facebook page, featuring the video's various web sites for English speakers who speak English, and the attendees were almost all Inuinnaqtun and listened to the conversation."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Kuuttiq welcomed the attendees and began speaking in Inuktitut, while Inuktitut speakers sometimes agreed to their heads and clapped their hands."</seg>
<seg id="12">"For those who can’t speak Inuktitut, including this writer, they just sat there with their eyes."</seg>
<seg id="13">Some people just walked out.</seg>
<seg id="14">Some people are just listening and working on their phones while they are waiting for English to be translated into English.</seg>
<seg id="15">There were no English versions.</seg>
<seg id="16">Welcome to this amazing community for many people in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="17">"“It is called the Inuit Cultural Education Program so we wanted to, especially when we were talking about the Inuit language, we wanted to use the Inuit language,” Kuuttiq said at the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="18">“Louie and I discussed this and we know that there will be no interpreters available but we felt that it is important to use our language when we talk about the need for help and promotion of our language.”</seg>
<seg id="19">"The International Conference, which brings together northern experts from the North and the South, began a long time ago, involving more Inuktitut speakers and activists, making the conference more focused on Inuit needs and more interactive between Inuit and non-Inuit educated."</seg>
<seg id="20">"The Inuktitut consultation, regarding language rights, seemed to indicate that they were in the process of developing this."</seg>
<seg id="21">Mr. Speaker, Mr. Curtis’s presentation outlined a number of pieces of legislation that require further promotion and protection of the Inuktitut language in Nunavut where there are more Inuit and more Inuktitut speaking people.</seg>
<seg id="22">"These pieces of legislation come from the United Nations (Jonathan Cousins) Act on the Rights of Aboriginal Peoples (Cree) to the Legislative Assembly and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the National Inquiry on Murdered and Indigenous Missing Indigenous Women and Girls, and Girls, and Girls, and Languages Act."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Kuuttiq described a number of recent Inuit deaths, in part, to language and cultural harbours, such as Annie Kootoo, who passed away due to liver loss in 2017, and 15-year-old Eileen Kuniliusie, who also died of tuberculosis in the same year."</seg>
<seg id="24">“Inuit want to live healthy lives and have the right to live.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Canadian Inuit must not die due to lack of access and services comparable to other Canadians,” Kuuttiq wrote in his presentation."</seg>
<seg id="26">"In his statement, Mr. Tapardjuk talked about a recent Iqaluit incident in this case where the RCMP went to an elder to report that their adopted son had died of a needle shot at a youth centre."</seg>
<seg id="27">This woman is single and does not speak English.</seg>
<seg id="28">Mr. Tapardjuk said that the RCMP had to stop the vehicle in order to get help with the bad news.</seg>
<seg id="29">"“There are a number of things that could have been done through this story if this person had the help to change their life completely, they didn't even have an interpreter,” Kuuttiq told Nunatsiaq News."</seg>
<seg id="30">“In many cases Inuit who speak English and Inuktitut are invited to do the work.</seg>
<seg id="31">"We are considered to be interpreters at any given time, even if we don’t know the people."</seg>
<seg id="32">Sometimes it is confidential.</seg>
<seg id="33">"So, that’s why I can say it’s a violation of human rights.”"</seg>
<seg id="34">"Mr. Kuuttiq noted that at least Inuktitut-speaking people in Nunavut should have access to professional services in their language in areas such as health, justice and education."</seg>
<seg id="35">Even those are not available.</seg>
<seg id="36">He and other leaders continue to lobby the Federal Government to protect their language and identity at home.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ottawa passed a new Aboriginal Language Act in June which has been criticized by NTI and ITK, saying that their decisions have been ignored.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Mr. Kuuttiq said he wanted people to know, “We are the ones who have the authority."</seg>
<seg id="39">Let us speak in Inuktitut when we go to the store.</seg>
<seg id="40">Let’s speak in Inuktitut when we go to the bank.</seg>
<seg id="41">Let’s speak Inuktitut when we go to school.</seg>
<seg id="42">"If we start speaking more Inuktitut and don't take into account the unilingual people, then they will be given a larger portion of the requirements.”"</seg>

<seg id="1">Qikiqtani Inuit Association Announces Fees for Tourism Operators in Inuit Own Communities</seg>
<seg id="2">Expense immediately</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tourism operators who visit the Qikiqtani region of Nunavut will now have to pay tourism bills to access the Inuit land, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association announced at its annual general meeting in Iqaluit from October 8 to 10."</seg>
<seg id="4">"Commercial tourism operators must now pay for people to travel to their own communities in the Qikiqtani region, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association announced at their annual general meeting in Iqaluit on Wednesday, October 9."</seg>
<seg id="5">The Qikiqtani region has the highest number of cruise ships in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Pond Inlet received 17 cruise ships this summer, while Iqaluit was visited by four."</seg>
<seg id="7">"“The Inuit of the Qikiqtani communities have been concerned about this because of the increasing number of tourism activities that are happening in our region, especially with the people who are carrying cruise ships."</seg>
<seg id="8">"The Qikiqtani Inuit Association decided to set up a tourism operators’ compensation package to assist people in the communities most impacted by cruise ships,P. J. Akeeagok, Qikiqtani Inuit Association President, said in a news release."</seg>
<seg id="9">A news release from the Qikiqtani Inuit Association’s Land and Recycling Division raised the issue of new payments.</seg>
<seg id="10">The new expenditures include:</seg>
<seg id="11">• Aircraft Landing on Inuit Land: $150 when Landing</seg>
<seg id="12">• Helicopter Landing on Inuit Land: $100 Landing</seg>
<seg id="13">• Fundraising Tammaativvik in Inuit communities: $50 a day</seg>
<seg id="14">• Commercial Visitor Access Less than 6 Hours in Inuit Communities: $25.00 a Day</seg>
<seg id="15">"The total amount would go to HTOs closest to tourism industry access, the report said."</seg>
<seg id="16">The other half would go to the Qikiqtani Inuit Association.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The ships that carry passengers into Nunavut have between 150 and 400 passengers, Roseanne D’Arcy, Qikiqtani Inuit Association Director of Land and Recycling, said at the QIA meeting."</seg>
<seg id="18">This $25-a-day fee would apply to all passengers who are transporting passengers to Inuit communities, or ILOs (Inuit own communities).</seg>
<seg id="19">"“Regardless of the number of people on the ship that are on the Inuit own land, they will be charged based on the number of people on the ship,” Mr. D’Arcy told the Board."</seg>
<seg id="20">Mr. O'Brien stated that the ships that bring passengers to the Qikiqtani Inuit Association will have to submit to the Qikiqtani Inuit Association the number of passengers per month or before they start boating.</seg>
<seg id="21">"“If the ship carries 350 passengers, we would charge 25 dollars a day per person."</seg>
<seg id="22">"So the larger Inuit vessels would have to pay anywhere from $10,000 to $20,000 to land on Inuit own land,” Mr. De'Antonio says."</seg>
<seg id="23">"In communities where there are many ships with Inuit in the summer, like Pond Inlet, the HTO would get anywhere from $50,000 to $70,000 in fees, he goes on to say."</seg>
<seg id="24">The new payment will also assist the Qikiqtani Inuit Association in the development of a land use database.</seg>
<seg id="25">"This way, tourism operators will be notified when applying for new fees to access Inuit owned lands."</seg>
<seg id="26">Mr. D'Arcy noted that the Qikiqtani Inuit Association established the fees based on other organizations’ fees for tourism.</seg>
<seg id="27">"For example Ootoona, Parks Canada charges 25 dollars per person to go to National Park."</seg>
<seg id="28">"The hamlets also charge people to transport cruise ships and tourism operators to their communities, Mr. D’Arcy also says."</seg>
<seg id="29">"“The ships that carry passengers that are able to get into their own communities are penalized for that only if the Inuit actually come into our own community,” he says."</seg>
<seg id="30">"Joe Attagutaluk, Qikiqtani Inuit Association Secretary/Finance Officer, asked if it was possible to increase these costs in the future."</seg>
<seg id="31">"Mr. D’Arcy said that it would be possible to change it, but it would have to be discussed and established by the Qikiqtani Inuit Association Board."</seg>
<seg id="32">“This is a fun initiative.</seg>
<seg id="33">"We are once again leading the way that Inuit can benefit their communities,” Mr. Akeeagok told the Board."</seg>
<seg id="34">"The payments will be effective immediately, the QIA said."</seg>

<seg id="1">Baffinland’s huge rail cargo raises concerns for residents of Pond Inlet</seg>
<seg id="2">“Is Baffinland thinking that without knowing the Nunavut Impact Review Board or the government prior to approving the project?”</seg>
<seg id="3">"The cruise ship, Biglift Barentz, was anchored by the Premier in Hebein, Germany last summer."</seg>
<seg id="4">"In the crater you will see two possible construction units, which are 33 and 34 metres high, these are the Baffinland iron ore mine that came from Tyson Crank and delivered to the Mary River mine this summer."</seg>
<seg id="5">Two smaller units are also being shipped from the front.</seg>
<seg id="6">"This is for the Strategic Highway Expansion Program, which has not yet been approved by the Legislative Assembly."</seg>
<seg id="7">(Picture by Tyson Crank)</seg>
<seg id="8">Community leaders in Pond Inlet are frustrated with the huge ship carrying rail parts. The Baffinland Iron Ore Corporation will be putting the Baffinland iron ore mine in Pond Inlet this summer.</seg>
<seg id="9">"What they are concerned about is Baffinland’s proposed expansion of the Phase II Plan, which has not yet been approved by the authorities, Baffinland brought in two large, ten-storey modular units from Primeau, Germany, which is the company’s docking facility in Mary River in the north Baffin."</seg>
<seg id="10">"They also brought in two smaller units that may be constructed and large pieces of rail that would be used for construction, such as access roads and land-based piles."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Baffinland, in November 2018, announced to rights groups and their partners in the Qikiqtani Inuit Association that they would be bringing the material to the Nunavut Impact Review Board and the Nunavut Water Board."</seg>
<seg id="12">But the people of Pond Inlet are finally finding out about this.</seg>
<seg id="13">When the ship Bibbs Bruns arrived at the Baffinland port here in Baffinland this past August they were carrying modular buildings to be used for the expansion of the train.</seg>
<seg id="14">When the people of Pond Inlet saw a ship passing by their community they were the first to hear of a carrier, two other ships carrying the rail highway parts arrived shortly after and more passengers are expected to arrive by the summer of 2020.</seg>
<seg id="15">“We only found out about three or four weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We see dry cargo going through the Pond Inlet area,” Joshua Arreak, Director of the Pond Inlet Hunters and Trappers Association told Nunatsiaq News."</seg>
<seg id="17">“We wondered why and who they were and how to do that.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We haven’t received any information from the Nunavut Impact Review Board, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association or anyone else."</seg>
<seg id="19">"We didn’t expect that at all,” Arreak says."</seg>
<seg id="20">“We have not heard from the Qikiqtani Inuit Association or the Nunavut Impact Review Board.</seg>
<seg id="21">I don’t know.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have problems with Inuit organizations.</seg>
<seg id="23">"They don’t keep us informed,” Mr. Okalik said."</seg>
<seg id="24">The Nunavut Impact Review Board was aware of the upcoming sealift season.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Neither the Nunavut permit officer nor any federal minister approved Baffinland’s expansion plan, which would result in a 110-kilometre rail link between Mary River and Mary River, creating an additional 12 million tonnes a year, and transporting up to 200 times a year."</seg>
<seg id="26">This project cannot be completely rejected by the federal government until the final public announcement that the Nunavut Impact Review Board has decided to take place on November 2 in Iqaluit and conclude on November 8 and 9 in Pond Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="27">"The Nunavut Impact Review Board, which in its comments did not consult with stakeholders, said that it would be bringing in sealift material for the railroad that was mailed to Baffinland last July 25."</seg>
<seg id="28">"The Nunavut Impact Review Board told the companies that if Phase II is not approved, Baffinland would be responsible for the shipping of goods, which may cost several million dollars, from the mine site."</seg>
<seg id="29">It also indicated that the sealift resupply would not impact the Nunavut Impact Review Board’s decision on the project.</seg>
<seg id="30">"In an e-mail dated October 17, the Nunavut Impact Review Board Executive Director, Ryan Perry, indicated by law that the Nunavut Impact Review Board cannot approve or approve marine activities."</seg>
<seg id="31">"“The Nunavut Impact Review Board was prepared to simply say that these actions would be included in the evaluation process and that all infrastructure construction projects would have to be moved if this proposal was rejected after the board’s review,” Mr. Perry wrote."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is an aerial photograph of Biblical Bruns. Just this summer the ship brought in modular buildings for Baffinland to be used for the Baffinland rail expansion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"One of the units, described as a “Vandalism Building,” is 33 metres high, 23.5 metres high and weighs 1,470 tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="34">"Another thing, referred to as the “Pollution House,” is 34 metres high."</seg>
<seg id="35">"So each unit, which is part of a pre-constructed demolition and decommissioning unit, is equal to a 10-storey building -- possibly higher than the ones built in the Eastern Arctic."</seg>
<seg id="36">However, Baffinland has not been authorized to use these devices.</seg>
<seg id="37">"“Baffinland will identify these assets as ‘Project Two Only.’ Unless Phase II Proposal Consideration is complete,” the company wrote in its July 19 report to the Nunavut Impact Review Board."</seg>
<seg id="38">Materials housed in Inuit Own Land</seg>
<seg id="39">"In their joint submission to the authority, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association and Baffinland wrote that the property would be located on Inuit own land, in accordance with the Qikiqtani Inuit Association’s commercial lease agreement with the company."</seg>
<seg id="40">"For Mr. Arreak and so on, an action such as the idea that Baffinland has already been approved for the project."</seg>
<seg id="41">“The people of Pond Inlet are not happy.</seg>
<seg id="42">Is Baffinland “Is Baffinland thinking that without knowing the Nunavut Impact Review Board or the government prior to approving the project?</seg>
<seg id="43">"I don't know,” he says."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Rob Chester, the technical advisor for the Hamlet of Pond Inlet, was granted permission by the Mayor of Pond Inlet, Joshua Shewchuk, to speak to Nunatsiaq News on behalf of the hamlet."</seg>
<seg id="45">"“Baffinland has been working on the idea of approving Phase 2,” Chester said by email."</seg>
<seg id="46">"“If the Nunavut Impact Review Board or the Nunavut Impact Review Board had the authority to do that, the final impact would be to put more pressure on the Nunavut Impact Review Board in terms of overseeing and approving proposals."</seg>
<seg id="47">"That is a concern,” Chester said on behalf of the Hamlet."</seg>
<seg id="48">"“Aside from the actions that are being taken, the Hamlet feels that they should not have done that."</seg>
<seg id="49">"This has been done on the financial side and on the assumption that Baffinland will be approved in Phase 2,” he also writes."</seg>
<seg id="50">"“Our main concern is the wildlife, the marine mammals and the places they go."</seg>
<seg id="51">We would be the most impacted community in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="52">That is our concern.</seg>
<seg id="53">"The money is not going to give back the wildlife,” Joshua Arreak said on behalf of the hunters and trappers organizations, quoting from an issue that has been raised in Pond Inlet over the years regarding marine transportation for the Baffinland Plan."</seg>
<seg id="54">"As for non-governmental organizations such as Oceans North, which has asked for input on the upcoming meeting of Baffinland’s expansion plan, said it supports “responsible development” at the Mary River mine."</seg>
<seg id="55">"However, it also noted that Baffinland’s exports have not taken into account the potential environmental impacts, and are unhappy with Baffinland’s decision to export large metals from Mary River rather than from Northern Hudson Bay, which was made possible in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="56">"“It is strange that residents are dissatisfied with the large volume of shipments of rail parts to Baffinland prior to the legal approval of this expansion,” says Chris Debbie, Deputy Minister of Policy and Policy Analyst for Marine North."</seg>
<seg id="57">Existing resources taken from TysonCrank</seg>
<seg id="58">The items that are being shipped to Baffinland are part of a pre-constructed railway addition that Baffinland inherited from the Tyson Multi-Purpose Dealer in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="59">"Two large buildings, first of which came in, were designed in Brighter Lake, while the third one is designed to be a railway loading station, designed in Stenton, Boland, Diakura reported in a news release."</seg>
<seg id="60">"Baffinland also brought in their loader, a seat belt for movement and a number of pieces of equipment to be used for the railroad."</seg>
<seg id="61">"Property descriptions of Baffinland’s submissions to the Nunavut Impact Review Board and the Nunavut Water Board included heavy equipment and access roads, as well as propellers and dump trucks."</seg>
<seg id="62">"Tyson Crank’s first shipment to Baffinland, a ship called the Big Lift Barentz, weighed 5,500 tonnes of goods, and left Brighter Lake in early August."</seg>
<seg id="63">"Two other cruise ships brought in additional supplies this summer, and more will be arriving in the summer of 2020, Diaspora said."</seg>
<seg id="64">"Through a co-operation agreement with the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, Baffinland agreed to contribute an additional $18 million in reimbursement for the remediation of the Mary River mine if the project ceased, the Water Board’s letter stated."</seg>

<seg id="2">Inuit women account for 15 percent of attendance at the Women’s Centre</seg>
<seg id="3">"Maria Poole-Benton, the Executive Director of This Women’s Centre (Chez Doris), Women’s Centre and Kathy Wong, a city councillor representing Peter-McGill in Montreal on   October 16."</seg>
<seg id="4">(Picture from the City of Montreal)</seg>
<seg id="5">"The Town of Montreal here in Ville-Murray has given us the opportunity to begin an expansion program initiated by the Women’s Centre, a day centre for homeless women, which has been converted to a land-based facility that was acquired last year."</seg>
<seg id="6">"The residents’ decision, announced on Wednesday, October 16, will allow for the establishment of a new facility not far from the centre, which will convert it into an emergency night women’s centre."</seg>
<seg id="7">"The women’s centre, Women’s Day Centre at 1430 cents Street in Montreal, is open every day of the week for women in need."</seg>
<seg id="8">A lot of people live.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The women's centre is here right now at Sammie Street, not too far from Alder Road and Kapoo Beach, the Gathering House for People in Town."</seg>
<seg id="10">"The Women’s Centre is well known by many Inuit women, of which 15 percent goes to the centre."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Scheduled to open in the winter of 2021, this building for emergency nights was purchased from a subsidized $1 million Montreal businessman Andrew Harper through the Joyce Community Foundation in Montreal."</seg>
<seg id="12">"“Thanks to the new housing we have, we will be able to house 22 beds for homeless women,” said Marina Packer-Benton, the executive director of Chess Christian, said in a news release following the event at the women's centre."</seg>
<seg id="13">"“Currently, women make up 25 percent of the homeless population in Montreal, but the benefits for women are not enough."</seg>
<seg id="14">This project is a step in the right direction.”</seg>
<seg id="15">"The good news about the drop-in centre expansion was announced less than a week after this individual who stayed in the centre, Clara Wagersoak, who was originally from the Northwest Territories, passed away on October 11 in the hospital."</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr. Bowler-Boyden told Nunatsiaq News that Wager Bay's daughter after she committed suicide while in custody she was suffering from chronic illness.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The majority of people who go to the centres end up in cities because of housing shortages and legal problems, Mr. Bowler-Wheyden says."</seg>
<seg id="18">"A lot of people go to the women’s centre and go to bed during the day. There are six beds in the facility. There are only a few hours of sleep and then they end up outside at night."</seg>
<seg id="19">That is going to change with the fact that there is going to be a new bed in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Now, the women’s centre, which attracts approximately 100 women every day, provides services and programs to address women’s needs through homelessness, food insecurity, mental health and substance abuse."</seg>
<seg id="21">Mr. Bowler-Boyden noted that the number of Inuit women entering the program has not changed significantly since 2018.</seg>
<seg id="22">"“However, we have guided women who need more support than they really need such things as clothing and bathtubs,” she says."</seg>
<seg id="23">"As the only women’s day centre in Montreal, the St. Therese’s Women’s Centre is now open seven days a week from 8:30 a.m. to 3:00 p.m."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Due to its ability to run the Income Support Program, the Women’s Centre was suspended for a weekend without providing services for six months in 2014 due to lack of funding."</seg>
<seg id="25">"“We are hoping that we will get some financial assistance from Makivik, but we don't know if we will get it this time,” says Mr. Bowler-Benton."</seg>
<seg id="26">"The Women’s Centre also operates the Inuit Impact Benefit Program, but the Women’s Centre raises funds to carry out this program, which accounts for approximately 70 percent of its operations from $1.7 million a year."</seg>

<seg id="1">Nunavut Liberals do not take advantage of Liberals</seg>
<seg id="2">"On the serious questions, the Liberals were not very generous."</seg>
<seg id="3">Mr. Lamela Qaqqaq's victory on October 21 is a testament to his refusal to accept Liberal policy for Nunavut and the North.</seg>
<seg id="4">Do you recall the Liberal Press Release?</seg>
<seg id="5">They put out a report in a row.</seg>
<seg id="6">More than we can remember.</seg>
<seg id="7">"That doesn’t matter, because the majority of Nunavut’s voters released on October 21, they didn’t produce anything."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Since 2015, Justin Trudeau and other Liberal governments of Nunavut have published numerous news releases."</seg>
<seg id="9">Some of the information was new.</seg>
<seg id="10">"But in the end, the people of Nunavut were just saying, “Oops.”"</seg>
<seg id="11">"But in the end, the focus was on politicians. Since 1961, Canadians have been focusing on them for change: the New Timberland Wrestling."</seg>
<seg id="12">"This historic achievement of Mamallaq Qaqqaq is a testament to the dissatisfaction with Mr. Trudeau's approach to northern and northern Canada, which includes a lack of commitment to the ongoing discussions of Inuit-Federal Relations."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Since 2015, Mr. Trudeau has been working with governing organizations like ITK, NTI, QIA and others."</seg>
<seg id="14">However, this week's election demonstrates to Nunavummiut that the Inuit-Federal Partnership is not working.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Which is somewhat ironic, because in the end I don't think the Liberals were able to really answer the questions."</seg>
<seg id="16">"It is well known by most people in Nunavut that some of the biggest concerns are economic and social issues: housing shortages, food insecurity, high cost of transportation, chronic tuberculosis and suicide is an issue that continues on almost every day."</seg>
<seg id="17">"But when he last came to Nunavut on October 8, Mr. Trudeau had little news about these concerns."</seg>
<seg id="18">He talked about the South Baffin region talking about climate change and the loss of polar bears.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Those are national concerns, but if we have an election this year, Nunavummiut would like to hear their concerns about housing and the high cost of living."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Instead, the Sylvia Grinnell River site is also a photographic site, not for Nunavut voters, but for southern Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="21">"In doing so, he did not address the pressures of Nunavummiut and Nunavut Liberal candidate Megan Beyonce-Lyall, even though she should have received more support from the president of the Liberal Party."</seg>
<seg id="22">"On issues such as food prices and food insecurity, the Liberals took action, establishing a higher level of support for the Nutrition North Canada Program, and providing additional funding, $12.5 million a year for aboriginal harvesters in Nunavut and elsewhere in the North West."</seg>
<seg id="23">But the Harvester Support Program has to be established and no one can say why this is happening.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Also on August 1, Mr. Tootoo played a major role in Iqaluit and Arctic Bay, signing an MOU to establish a Lancaster Sound Marine Conservation Area Area Area Marine Conservation Area and promising to start a new conservation area called Area."</seg>
<seg id="25">"In doing so, he is putting hundreds of millions of dollars into communities in North Baffin for small craft harbours and protection jobs."</seg>
<seg id="26">He also talked a lot about preservation, such as trying to meet with First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="27">"The inefficiency of doing this is: coughing about tuberculosis in an overcrowded building, the word “meet” doesn’t make much sense."</seg>
<seg id="28">"With that in mind, do you remember the Liberal Government’s big announcement about tuberculosis?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"This was done in early 2018, when Jane Philpott, the then Health Minister of Canada, announced that TB would be eliminated in the Inuit homeland by 2030."</seg>
<seg id="30">But Mr. Philpott, the Federal Minister who promised to take on this responsibility has disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="31">"In light of Trudeau’s actions with Joamie Freud and his controversial handling of the S.N.C. Lavalin, Philpott resigned from the House."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Since then, the Liberals have not heard anything about their efforts to eradicate tuberculosis."</seg>
<seg id="33">"Like the Harvesters’ Support Program, I think it’s stuck in the Inuit-Federal Relations, so it’s interesting that the discussions that he made about eliminating tuberculosis are in jeopardy."</seg>
<seg id="34">"And people know that tuberculosis is a result of poverty, inadequate nutrition and inadequate housing."</seg>
<seg id="35">"But on the housing side, Mr. Trudeau offered an already heated and metaphor last summer."</seg>
<seg id="36">"And the Government of Canada’s Social Housing Program, “Coordinated Approach” with ITK, has not been an unprecedented step."</seg>
<seg id="37">We would also like to congratulate Mamela Qaqqaq on her win.</seg>
<seg id="38">"As one of the fourth Divisional Lawyers of the Legislative Assembly, she will need support in order for her to be heard."</seg>
<seg id="39">Let the people of Nunavut give their time and support.</seg>
<seg id="40">"Qaqqaq won two professional medals: Leona Aglukkaq and Megan Pickell-Lyall."</seg>
<seg id="41">Mr. Speaker, I sincerely hope that these two individuals continue to fight for the benefit of Nunavummiut and the North.</seg>

<seg id="1">Members questioned Cabinet about the $80 million increase in the Weber Alphabet Access Road Project</seg>
<seg id="2">“From the perspective of my colleagues, we have a very good idea of how we can spend $80 million.”</seg>
<seg id="3">"Joelie Qarnik, MLA for Amittuq, was one of the Members of the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut questioning the Government on this $80 million increase in the Iqaluit-Nuuk Middle East Weber Alphabet Program."</seg>
<seg id="4">Some Nunavut lawyers are questioning the unspecified benefits of the expansion of the Nuuk-Iqaluit Webber Centre project.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Last August, the Government of Canada committed $151 million to the project, which was dedicated to the 1,700 kilometre Weber Alphabet Nuuk, from Greenland to Davis Strait to Iqaluit."</seg>
<seg id="6">From there it would be shipped to Kimmirut.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The Government of Nunavut will develop the framework and initiate the project, which should be completed in 2023."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Last year, the Legislative Assembly approved this project, which was estimated to cost $126 million."</seg>
<seg id="9">"“After this year, we were informed that the project cost had increased due to inflation and it was estimated to be in the range of $209 million,” John Main, MLA for Arviat North-Whale Cove, said in his Member’s Statement on Wednesday, October 23."</seg>
<seg id="10">"This is an 80 million dollar difference, Mr. Maine says."</seg>
<seg id="11">"“From the perspective of my colleagues we are able to make a good decision on the feasibility of $80 million,” Mr. Maine says."</seg>
<seg id="12">The federal contribution comes from the Rural and Northern Community Infrastructure Fund for the Investment in Canada Plan.</seg>
<seg id="13">The project is now before the Legal Services Board as they review the Main Estimates for 2020/21.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Later on in Question Period, Joelie Qarniq, MLA for Amittuq asked Mr. Quassa Kusugak, Minister of Community and Government Services, about the $80 million increase that the government plans on doing business."</seg>
<seg id="15">"This process, as defined in the Government of Nunavut’s Fiscal Planning Assistance Program, “is intended to ensure that the project has clear interpretation, and that they have access to information on the development side, an appropriate cost estimate and a time frame, prior to the start of the budget planning process.”"</seg>
<seg id="16">"“Has there been any pre-planning work done, yes or no?”"</seg>
<seg id="17">The invitation asks Ms. Kusugak.</seg>
<seg id="18">“The planning has been completed and the feasibility study is still underway.</seg>
<seg id="19">"When we were informed, we realized that it was going to be much more expensive,” Kusugak says."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Mr. Maine, who is sitting next to me in the House of Commons, is rising to ask more questions to Mr. Kusugak."</seg>
<seg id="21">“Can the minister indicate how this huge project cost has increased over the past year?”</seg>
<seg id="22">"Ms. Kusugak reiterated that after funding requests were approved last year, the department re-evaluated the project and increased the cost of the project."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Ms. Kusugak reiterated that, in May 2019, her department felt that her funding request would have to increase to $201.6 million to “maximize the federal contribution available to the program if necessary.”"</seg>
<seg id="24">"The following day, on October 24, Mr. Maine rose again in question period to follow up with the Minister of Finance, Mr. George Hickes, on the same issue."</seg>
<seg id="25">"“Under the Financial Management Board, what steps were taken and what steps were taken to inform the department of the $80 million cost increase in this budget process?”"</seg>
<seg id="26">Maine asked.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Mr. Hickes noted that due to the lack of federal support for the project, and in addition to the successful Marine Research Centre, the Government of Nunavut also increased its support."</seg>
<seg id="28">“The Department of Community and Government Services referred it back to the Financial Management Board for the purpose of finding out that there was a deficit.”</seg>
<seg id="29">"Mr. Hickes also noted that the Government of Nunavut contributes half of the (25 percent) program, while the federal government contributes 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="30">"“As the Government of Nunavut, we don’t have to pay $80 million. We would have to pay 25 percent of that."</seg>
<seg id="31">"We’re going to be looking for…over the next few years, additional resources to complete this project,” he adds."</seg>

<seg id="2">Sally Ford after election for Federal Government speaks out on the need for change</seg>
<seg id="3">"Charlie Ford, President of Makivik Corporation, issued a news release following the October 22 federal election, stating that Nunavut needs its own federal regulator."</seg>
<seg id="4">By Elaine Sorome</seg>
<seg id="5">"Makivik President Charlie Ford echoed his comments about the Nunavik Law Centre’s location during a ceremony to announce the new Member of the Legislative Assembly, Sheffield Frobisher."</seg>
<seg id="6">"“We will be consulting with the Electoral Land Titles Commission to make sure that this is understood, that Nunavik has its own bureaucracy that is geared towards our community, which we would like to see happening right now in light of our self-reliance program,” he says."</seg>
<seg id="7">“We need that at the provincial level.”</seg>
<seg id="8">"Apipik-James Bay-Nunavik-Eeyu is the largest federal government program in Quebec, ranging from southern Nunavik to La Valley-de-Wal inland communities. Approximately four of the six 2019 federal candidates are residents, including Papoosie to Black Quebec quebec quebec quebec quebec quebec."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Nunavik leaders have been calling for their own government for their land since 1972.</seg>
<seg id="10">"In 2002, the Kativik Municipal Government, including Makivik, went to the Federal Electoral Boundaries Commission for this purpose and reappointed it in 2011."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Since then the division was expanded in 2013, adding two communities further south."</seg>
<seg id="12">"The regions were re-designed, under the Commission, to try to balance the population."</seg>
<seg id="13">"For the whole of Quebec, there are about 100,000 people in the region, while Appati-James-Nunavik-Yo has less than 85,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="14">"With Nunavik’s population of approximately 13,000, Nunavik has been far below that, but its leaders have been vocal about the issue of Nunavik’s independent society."</seg>
<seg id="15">"The smallest federal capital is Labrador, which has a population of 26,000, while Newfoundland has a population of about 80,000."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Mr. Papoosie won the Northern Quebec election by over 11,000 votes, or 40 percent, behind the Liberal and Conservative candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Ford offered her congratulations to Green Party candidate Keira Qafauna-Whitley, an Inuk from Churchill, who came in fifth place with over 1,000 votes."</seg>
<seg id="18">"In his speech in Ford, he welcomed Mr. Pruee to visit Nunavik as soon as possible."</seg>
<seg id="19">"“I look forward to meeting with them, and his support for self-sufficiency is very appreciated, and on issues such as enforcing the Jonathan Chen Act on the rights of indigenous peoples,” Ford says."</seg>
<seg id="20">"There was a lot of news for Black Quebec to President Ace-Francois Blanchard, whose party won 32 seats for Quebec."</seg>
<seg id="21">"“It is our hope that you will support us in the development of our mandate in Nunavik – in the areas of law and economic development – and in legislation that we can establish appropriate partnerships,” says Ford."</seg>
<seg id="22">"“However, in the spirit of Quebec independence, Inuit have long contributed to the Canadian unity.”"</seg>
<seg id="23">"Mr. Ward set up the election, although the Liberal Party did not have a seat in the new government, to allow the different parties to come together and meet with the rest of Canada."</seg>
<seg id="24">"“Mr. Justin Trudeau has a strong government that does not have a seat, and he can work with other Party MLAs, NTI, Black Quebec, Green, Conservative and independent candidates -- to pass legislation and bring them to the House of Commons, and work towards getting them together,” he says."</seg>
<seg id="25">"In terms of Nunavut’s newly elected NTI MLA, Mamela Qaqqaq from Baker Lake, made some positive comments."</seg>
<seg id="26">"“I remember the NTI meeting in Baker Lake in 1871 with Tagak Curley,” Ford says."</seg>
<seg id="27">“We were young at that time.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Re-implement the Public Health Strategy (RSV) in Nunavut, thousands of people say"</seg>
<seg id="2">"“For Inuit, you could save money on the number of lung cancer patients”"</seg>
<seg id="3">This Air Ambulance Nunavut Lyall Life Line is parked at the Iqaluit International Airport this summer while airplanes are flying.</seg>
<seg id="4">"In some years, when children suffer from respiratory infections (RSV), respiratory synchronization virus, they have to be sent out and this can result in airline usage and hospitalization costs a lot of money."</seg>
<seg id="5">"This included Dr. Anna Banerjee and her fellow teachers at the Toronto University Health Centre in 1989. She first introduced this program through change.org at the end of September, and I would like more than 1,000 signatures to be signed."</seg>
<seg id="6">"However, when this report was finally published, 23,322 names were collected…and now they want to reach 25,000 signatures."</seg>
<seg id="7">The Public Health Strategy states that the Government of Nunavut would protect many deaths and reduce the need for medical travel by implementing the Palliative Care Program for all infants under the age of six.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Palimab is a preventative disease, although it is not a vaccine, and it is a marketing campaign called Synagis."</seg>
<seg id="9">"It has been proven that in infants there are more respiratory diseases ranging from RSV, the acronym for “respiratory synchronization virus,” which is a matte that enters the lungs, and causes a serious illness called bronchitis."</seg>
<seg id="10">"However, Dr. Michael Patterson, the Chief Medical Officer of Nunavut, noted in an interview with Nunatsiaq News that the Government of Nunavut allocates Palliative Bay from 11 percent to 12 percent for children under the age of 2."</seg>
<seg id="11">"“We use it more for infants at risk of developing RSV, and for those who support the UK's submission to Palimab,” he says."</seg>
<seg id="12">"These include infants born alone, under 35 weeks of pregnancy, or babies with chronic lung disease or heart disease."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Parnauji, an associate professor of pediatrics at the Toronto University School of Medicine, has been writing curriculum for the past 15 years about the persistence and cost of RSV in the north."</seg>
<seg id="14">"In terms of the results of the study, she is very dissatisfied with the current Nunavut Health Care Policy and says that all Nunavut infants need this Cancer Prevention Program."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Dr. Anna Banerjee, Associate Professor of Pediatrics at the Toronto University School of Medicine, said after studying Inuit infants with a flu vaccine called Palliative Care would make a difference in their lives and finances."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Government of Nunavut’s Food Price Index is very useful.</seg>
<seg id="17">He stated in his research that the RSV disease is a chronic and multi-faceted disease and has resulted in the creation of a wide range of air ambulances and medical travel to the Nunavut Public Health Agency.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The cost of preventative medicine is very high: about $5,600 per patient."</seg>
<seg id="19">"However, at this cost, Mr. Speaker, the planner and many people believe that this is a significant subsidy."</seg>
<seg id="20">"In most cases, in Nunavut, we have a lot of early illnesses and medevacs are the most effective way to deal with it."</seg>
<seg id="21">"“We have done a lot of cost studies that have shown in the north that if we put more money into Plymouth, it would save us money,” he said in an interview."</seg>
<seg id="22">"The cost analysis, published in 2013, tracked the number of lung illnesses in Kitikmeot infants: it was set at 389 out of 1,000."</seg>
<seg id="23">"The study, which was conducted from January 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010, found that the cost of hospitalization for this disease had increased to $57,535."</seg>
<seg id="24">"In the Qikiqtani region, lung cancer rates in infants were as high as 2002 out of 1,000 infants and in the Kivalliq, 230 out of 1,000 newborns."</seg>
<seg id="25">This means that the Government of Nunavut has spent $5.9 million on terminally ill Qikiqtani Region and approximately $5.7 million on Kivalliq Infant Health Centres. That was the case during the study.</seg>
<seg id="26">"However, as a result, the Kivalliq had the highest rate of lung cancer hospitalization: $63,686."</seg>
<seg id="27">"“For Inuit, it saves money, because lung cancer is very high,” he says."</seg>
<seg id="28">Head of Ontario Nursing Association supports petition</seg>
<seg id="29">“Inuit infants are ten times more likely to require hospital treatment for respiratory illnesses than ”at-risk“ infants and the disease is even more severe in its sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Although this is a major problem, Inuit infants in Nunavut do not receive health care,” Mr. Gandy wrote in the submission."</seg>
<seg id="31">"There is also a situation with professionals identified in the North West School of Health, the Canadian Health Association and the Canadian Health Research Institute for Aboriginal Peoples."</seg>
<seg id="32">However, healthy infants born in Nunavut at the end of the year do not receive the Cancer Prevention Program -- whether they come from vulnerable communities outside of Iqaluit and have a higher incidence of chronic lung illnesses.</seg>
<seg id="33">Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker, I think the Minister of Health and Social Services is saying that he’s dealing with these errors.</seg>
<seg id="34">“I have worked very hard.</seg>
<seg id="35">I have shown them what I am explaining to the public.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Carolyn Bennett, Jane Webbot, have seen my notes and said it is credible,” she says."</seg>
<seg id="37">Nunavik vaccinates all infants</seg>
<seg id="38">"He also revealed that, unlike Nunavut, health officials in Nunavik have given Palliative Care Program to all infants over the past three years."</seg>
<seg id="39">"In the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut on October 18, the Minister of Health George Hickes said in response to questions from Iqaluit-Niaqunnguu MLA Pat Angnakak that the Government of Nunavut should take a close look at Nunavik activities."</seg>
<seg id="40">"“We are following up on that project,” says Hickes."</seg>
<seg id="41">Ms. Arnakak noted that RSV (Lung Disease) has had a devastating impact on the family.</seg>
<seg id="42">"“Not too long ago, I know that the baby had to be sent to the hospital for RSV and it has a huge impact on the family, especially when this is a very young child."</seg>
<seg id="43">However Mr. Hickes defended the Government of Nunavut’s current approach and insisted that the Government is not saving money for Inuit only by providing this service.</seg>
<seg id="44">“This is not a legal or policy decision on the cost.</seg>
<seg id="45">"It depends on the quality of health care that we do,” Hickes says."</seg>
<seg id="46">Mr. Patterson goes on to say that the Nunavik Health Care Program was passed three years earlier, starting with infants under the age of six.</seg>
<seg id="47">"“We are still waiting for the numbers on that, and if we find out that there is a cost savings by lending Palliative Mab, then we will implement that very quickly,” Mr. Patterson says."</seg>
<seg id="48">"But, in his view, there is still not enough concrete evidence to implement Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="49">"“There are two things that I don’t agree with in terms of trying to get a petition and the other one is to show that this has been completed, or that there is some scientific evidence on that."</seg>
<seg id="50">"There are a lot of people who still have questions,” he says."</seg>
<seg id="51">The use of the Palimab in Nunavut comes from a long time ago.</seg>
<seg id="52">"In 2008, the Government of Nunavut completely refused to participate in the Panniqtuuq Research Project on the RSV, or any major industry in Greenland, Nunavik and the Northwest Territories."</seg>

<seg id="7">"Ten years ago, Godfrey, a Churchill plumber, stove mechanic and builder, ran into a conflict with housing expert Claude Janelle."</seg>
<seg id="8">"“We started talking about affordable housing in the north,” Mr. Gabbard says."</seg>
<seg id="9">“Housing in the north is too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="10">It started from there.”</seg>
<seg id="11">From there they have developed the design of the small units taking into account the northern climates.</seg>
<seg id="12">The houses have metal siding and roofs that are windy and can last longer than normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It is designed with sandwiches, roofs and ceilings and has three layers of windows to keep the heat out."</seg>
<seg id="14">"They have floor-to-ceiling furnaces, not wall-to-wall furnaces, trying to balance the temperature throughout the building."</seg>
<seg id="15">"“I think that’s the only way we can do it in the north,” Mr. Gabbard says."</seg>
<seg id="16">“There are a lot of problems with the boilers and the furnaces go to a certain part.</seg>
<seg id="17">People say that their feet are starting to freeze.</seg>
<seg id="18">Their houses are well insulated, but they are walking in.”</seg>
<seg id="19">The design for Nunavik Construction is a one bedroom cabin.</seg>

<seg id="22">"The Nunavik Construction Corporation has a wide range of conditions with small units, four bedroom units, and alternate units that are accessible to them."</seg>
<seg id="23">"They can add an extra room and it can be expanded, for example, when the children are older."</seg>
<seg id="24">"The building that is being advertised in Churchill is one bedroom, which is five metres from the ground and ten metres from Tuktu."</seg>

<seg id="26">Behind the bedroom is the washroom.</seg>
<seg id="27">The power plant is located in another building adjacent to that building.</seg>
<seg id="28">It took approximately two hours to complete the building by putting it in place and putting the electrical and plumbing together.</seg>
<seg id="29">"This house can be purchased for $228,000, for the garbage and everything else, says Mr. Godfrey."</seg>
<seg id="30">"In Nunavik, a house costs between $500,000 and $600,000, he says."</seg>
<seg id="31">"“We are trying to build affordable housing that has adequate space and problems with the water supply system,” says Mr. Godfrey."</seg>
<seg id="32">"“I have been a plumber, oil burner mechanic for many years now and a lot of the designs are already fixed, the pipes are inadequate, the boiler system is inadequate."</seg>
<seg id="33">I have been building these things for many years and now we have something that is more suitable for the North.”</seg>
<seg id="34">"The houses are built in Soprak, Quebec, and they are built within a month, Godfrey said. They were loaded by trucks and then shipped by ship."</seg>
<seg id="35">"After we get the order and if the booking is on time for the sealift, the building could be in place for the next summer."</seg>
<seg id="36">"“In the future, if this goes well, we are thinking about building jobs in the north,” he says."</seg>

<seg id="8">"Last October, when Juda Sarpinak of Igloolik started hunting seals, he had to go by snowmobile."</seg>
<seg id="9">"When he was trying to do the same thing the following year, he had to go boating."</seg>
<seg id="10">"In Nunavut and other northern territories, it is the same thing."</seg>
<seg id="11">"“This is the first time I have seen this permafrost in my entire life,” says Willie Aglukark, who has lived in Gjoa Haven for almost 40 years."</seg>
<seg id="12">That is correct.</seg>
<seg id="13">"As of October 15, sea ice deposits were at 5.118 million square kilometres, the lowest level since records began in 1968."</seg>
<seg id="14">"“Depending on where we are at, we may be doing it a month later than we were last year,” says Georges Langey, Technical Analyst with Geological Services Canada."</seg>
<seg id="15">But this is not the first time this year that the sea ice has been too low.</seg>
<seg id="16">April was also one of the worst ice conditions ever recorded.</seg>
<seg id="17">After that, July was one of the most popular publications ever.</seg>
<seg id="18">"In August, the erosion of the ice slowed down."</seg>
<seg id="19">"“We were on par with the lowest levels of ice in 2007 and 2016, but higher than in 2012,” says Walter Mayer, Senior Research Analyst in the Canadian Institute of Technology and Geoscience."</seg>
<seg id="20">"“But we are at a lower level than the 2012 lows at this time because of slower freezing temperatures -- 2012 quickly returned to normal, but last winter, the ice melted.”"</seg>
<seg id="21">"As of October 15, the ice thickness of the ice was lower than in 2012, which was at its lowest level at that time."</seg>
<seg id="22">(Certificate from NCDC)</seg>
<seg id="23">The level of sea ice is dependent on global warming.</seg>
<seg id="24">"“If there is water that doesn't have ice and the temperature is colder than the water, then the climate change even though it's in the outer space will cool down and the water will cool down or freeze up very quickly,” says Lawrie."</seg>
<seg id="25">"However, the Arctic temperatures in October have been relatively mild, with extreme temperatures in the past six months."</seg>
<seg id="26">"“It was a great summer,” says Mr. Mayer."</seg>
<seg id="27">"As of April, the monthly temperature remained the third warmest -- at the Arctic temperature -- on record, with May and August at the highest."</seg>
<seg id="28">(Picture from UNEP)</seg>
<seg id="29">This year’s event will bring even greater results.</seg>
<seg id="30">"“Through things like global warming like human consumption vehicles, we have seen a decrease in sea ice thickness from 1979,” says Pascal Pattuji, Director of GRID-Geneva, in a news release released by the Jonathan Nissan Environmental Program (UNEP)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"One example of what is happening this year in the Arctic, is that the reduction in ice conditions has contributed to Arctic warming over the years."</seg>
<seg id="32">"According to this press release, “Global warming has increased to 0.5 C.C. over the last decade between 1982 and 2017, primarily due to the Solar Atmosphere System deteriorating in 1979."</seg>
<seg id="33">This is twice as fast as the rest of the world.”</seg>
<seg id="34">This summer has not been an exception.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Although the year-to-year trend continues, ice conditions are now recovering."</seg>
<seg id="36">"“The ice is just freezing up,” says Ms. Aglukkaq."</seg>
<seg id="37">"In the past ten days, since October 20, the sea ice has increased by approximately 1.5 million square kilometres, including the water near Gjoa Haven."</seg>

<seg id="9">"After a brief silence, Mr. Howard said, “No.”"</seg>
<seg id="10">They are here with a lot of laughter.</seg>
<seg id="11">"A week later, in an interview with Nunatsiaq News, Mr. Howard said, “That’s why I thought my support might not be heard.”"</seg>
<seg id="12">"Herbert, who grew up in Hamilton, came to Iqaluit through Meeford, Ontario, a community in Collingwood close to George Bay."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Although he has been here for the first time, he has come from the North."</seg>
<seg id="14">"In his ten years as Emergency Health Officer for the Canadian Armed Forces, the Arviat area has been tented in the middle of winter."</seg>
<seg id="15">"“So I understand the snow, I understand the cold weather, but at the same time they have to do something about it."</seg>
<seg id="16">It seems like it’s in another part of the world and that’s why I came here.</seg>
<seg id="17">"And the department is a very diverse department,” says Mr. Howard, referring to the Iqaluit Fire Department amalgamation -- some of them are professional firefighters and others just volunteer."</seg>
<seg id="18">That was the only thing that Mr. Howard did not take to Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition to their experience in firefighting and emergency preparedness -- which rarely happens in other areas -- it was also due to the frequency of fires in Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="20">"“What has happened in this department is overwhelming,” says Mr. Howard."</seg>
<seg id="21">"“There is a lot of work going on here and looking at the resources that are in place.”"</seg>
<seg id="22">"The activities that the department is doing are things like, and now Heather, the new one here, from water problems and the lack of volunteers, to fires and the fact that the fire hall is too small."</seg>
<seg id="23">“We can't change this overnight and there doesn't seem to be a lot of change in the middle of the night.</seg>
<seg id="24">"If we keep going forward and we don't go backwards I would be happy,” says Mr. Haughey."</seg>
<seg id="25">"“To me, it’s a fun project."</seg>
<seg id="26">"The excitement is that we are trying to do something and we know that we can do something about it.”"</seg>
<seg id="27">"On the first question of being appointed as the city’s Director of Emergency Management, “I am a Toronto Assistant,” says Howard with a smile."</seg>
<seg id="28">“It’s nice to hear that some people are supporting the fire hall in Toronto.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I brought a Stanley Cup flag, so I hope that we will be able to show it by vehicle if they win the Stanley Cup within 20 or 30 years.”"</seg>

<seg id="1">Bedbug infestation is a concern for Nunavik patients travelling to Montreal</seg>
<seg id="2">The boarding home manager says they do inspections but they never found anything.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is just a meal that you wouldn't want to see in your room: the bedbug.</seg>
<seg id="4">"But just recently, bedbugs have been seen at the Korvail Boarding Home where patients from Nunavik stay when they come to the city."</seg>
<seg id="5">Exposure to bedbugs at Nunavik Boarding Homes on medical travel to Montreal continues to be a concern for the boarding home and their families.</seg>
<seg id="6">This picture shows the bedbug that Cecilia Tukshaka saw last month in her mother’s room here at the Coroner Boarding Home in Kirt de Lees Granular.</seg>
<seg id="7">(Picture by Cecilia Tukosaka)</seg>
<seg id="8">"In mid-October, Cecilia Kuutsaka was visiting her mother at the Corility Boarding Home here in Kirt de Lees Granville. She was very scared: she saw a bug under the blanket, which she filmed."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr. Speaker, Ms. Kuutsaka pointed to the patient relations officer in Nunavik at the Ublivik Boarding Home, in this case there are several bedrooms, 39 all together, on the first floor when it is full."</seg>
<seg id="10">Kuutsaka called her mother and told her that she would never be there again.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The hotel's president, Sadio Abdul Noor, told Nunatsiaq News last week that he was dealing with bedbugs."</seg>
<seg id="12">"That was the case a few days ago, with all the testing done, with the Trichinosis Report, they couldn’t find anything."</seg>
<seg id="13">"One room test found that there were bedbugs in there, but they are no longer there."</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr. Speaker, Abdul Noor also posted e-mails of patients who had seen bedbugs.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Given the importance of the operation of the Ublivik Boarding Home, Mr. Andrew Noor said that all rooms were worked on this year and were regularly inspected and dealt with if required."</seg>
<seg id="16">Nunatsiaq News was not able to talk to all the Nunavik Community Health Boards or Module du nord-québec which deals with the Nunavik Health Centre in Montreal about bedbugs and what to do about it.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Speaker, the MNQ has sent a number of concerns via email to Mr. Andrew Noor.</seg>
<seg id="18">"“It seems like the boarders are seeing bedbugs and they don’t want to stay in hotels anymore,” writes George Delilah, President of Ublivik on October 16."</seg>
<seg id="19">“Let me know what it is and what it is and when it will be resolved.</seg>
<seg id="20">We have to inform the patients that the bedbugs were dealt with.”</seg>
<seg id="21">Ublivik always looks after the patients’ closets/bags before they enter.</seg>
<seg id="22">There are bedbugs in Montreal: the infestation caused the government offices to be closed at Complexes Guy-Favre last month.</seg>
<seg id="23">"And if there are bedbugs in patients in the North, this would not be the first case, as was the case in 2010 in Winnipeg."</seg>
<seg id="24">"The bedbugs are very disgusting: they are very small, but they get very cold because they chew, they get very old and they get very bad skin after they bite the skin."</seg>
<seg id="25">The bedbugs have a tube that can be transmitted to the blood so that the blood doesn’t get too thick and it doesn’t affect the blood.</seg>
<seg id="26">"For another pipe, the bedbug is pumped out of blood, sometimes within five minutes, and after they have melted, they start looking purple and they seem to have bubbles."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Bed bugs eat every five to ten days and can live for a whole year, staying in areas such as bottom layers, peas and other hot, dark and appearing when they want to eat."</seg>
<seg id="28">"The good news is that bedbugs don’t stay cold, so they end up sleeping and dying."</seg>
<seg id="29">So you can kill your containers outside for a couple of days if it doesn’t have warmer temperatures.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Try to avoid bedbugs while you are out on the land, check on the roof of the house, look at the bottom of the floor and don’t put your bags in bed."</seg>
<seg id="31">"And when you go home, wash your clothes before they go into your room and make sure that your bags don't have bedbugs."</seg>
<seg id="32">"If you see the bedbug in the Montreal boarding home, you can call 311 cities for problems."</seg>

<seg id="1">"Baffinland Conference Cancelled, More Gathering in Pond Inlet Cancelled"</seg>
<seg id="2">“Inuit have to be involved in the process.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It affects every aspect of Inuit life,” says NTI President"</seg>
<seg id="4">"Representatives from Igloolik and Pond Inlet are listening to Aluki Kuuttiq, President of Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, in a motion to stop the Nunavut Impact Review Board’s final meeting of the Baffinland Project 2 expansion Wednesday, November 6, in Iqaluit."</seg>
<seg id="5">(Photographer Emma Tarrant)</seg>
<seg id="6">By Emma Tarrant and Elaine Ashoomie</seg>
<seg id="7">"The Nunavut Impact Review Board’s meeting on Baffinland’s proposed expansion of the Mary River Iron Ore Project ended abruptly, with another two days of meeting in Pond Inlet cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="8">"On Wednesday, November 6, Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated President Aluki Kuuttiq moved a motion to immediately end this last public meeting and to continue the session for eight months to a year."</seg>
<seg id="9">When he spoke loudly, it was very interesting to hear people who wanted to speak to their counterparts just looked around, as the members looked around with Baffinland to see what they were going to do with the incident.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The Baffinland Task Force had facial hair stops, sometimes moving their arms and turning to the table as Kuuttiq made his motion."</seg>
<seg id="11">“We are concerned that this public meeting will be completed without action being completed.</seg>
<seg id="12">People need to be consulted and have good dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Whoever is here would like to understand all the issues raised and how it would affect NTI and the organizations,” Kuuttiq says as the House is full of speakers and people."</seg>
<seg id="14">"It affects every aspect of people’s lives,” he says"</seg>
<seg id="15">"The motion was introduced during the Fifth Session in Iqaluit, just before the end of the hour."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Nunavut Impact Review Board’s first agenda was set to proceed with the consultation process in Pond Inlet so that the community can participate on November 8 and 9.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The Nunavut Impact Review Board approved Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated’s motion, condemned the meeting and cancelled the meeting in Pond Inlet."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Throughout the week, Baffinland representatives who wanted to have an opportunity to speak on their plans to build a rail link north from Mary River to the Mary River port."</seg>
<seg id="19">"This is a rail road and other parts from the dock. It would make it easier that the company is producing a larger volume now with 6 million tonnes of mercury a year producing up to 12 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="20">"What is striking this week is that Baffinland’s proposal to amend its program permits by removing its production limits and putting in place a restricted export ban, 20 times a rail return and 176 sealift a year."</seg>
<seg id="21">"The motion to adjourn the meeting was supported by unanimous consent to have a say, many of whom expressed concerns about the uncertainty surrounding the project."</seg>
<seg id="22">"P. J. Akeeagok, Qikiqtani Inuit Association President, told Nunatsiaq News that he believes in the Nunavut Impact Review Board’s process to ensure that “people have the opportunity to ask questions about these issues” and that it “allows residents to voice their concerns on an ongoing basis.”"</seg>
<seg id="23">"Mr. Akeeagok also said that the motion was not expected, but was well organized on the last day of the session."</seg>
<seg id="24">Baffinland officials are watching Kuuttiq as the mover of the protest.</seg>
<seg id="25">“I think it would be that there are too many questions that haven't been resolved yet.</seg>
<seg id="26">"The way I see it, if you are going to decide your future, then you have to be well informed to make good decisions."</seg>
<seg id="27">There was not enough here.”</seg>
<seg id="28">Representatives from the North Baffin communities unanimously agreed to the motion.</seg>
<seg id="29">"“There has to be more information and research done,” says Amanda Hanson-Maine, a researcher with the Pond Inlet Hunters and Trappers Organization."</seg>
<seg id="30">He stated that the project “may have serious implications on our values and our human and international reputation.”</seg>
<seg id="31">"Some members at the table expressed their dissatisfaction with the Mary River project, and wanted to continue Baffinland’s work in Nunavut, but there were too many questions and concerns about the proposed expansion."</seg>
<seg id="32">"“What we hear is that it is too flooded and unacceptable,” says Peter Ivalu, who represents the Hamlet of Igloolik."</seg>
<seg id="33">“All the information has to be translated.</seg>
<seg id="34">Everything has to be transparent.”</seg>
<seg id="35">"The Government of Nunavut concurred with the motion, in this regard, noting that there is a significant disagreement between the proponent and the shareholder, which is a deterrent."</seg>
<seg id="36">"The Government of Canada also supported the motion, but stated that the Nunavut Impact Review Board could make a decision on the length of time that the moratorium would take."</seg>
<seg id="37">"Through its Legal Services Division, Baffinland said that they were dissatisfied with the motion to suspend the Legislative Assembly for eight months and were dissatisfied with the motion until they were informed."</seg>
<seg id="38">"“All of the things that came here at the communiqué conference could have gone ahead as of November 2nd,” says Brad Armstrong, Legal Counsel for Baffinland."</seg>
<seg id="39">“None of them said they weren't prepared to start on that date.</seg>
<seg id="40">In no way did any statement deter them from appearing in this House.”</seg>
<seg id="41">"Megan Loehr-Hoyer, the Vice-President of Recycling for Baffinland, said the delay would have an impact on the “immediate problems” of the project."</seg>
<seg id="42">"“But we will do all we can to provide and protect 3,000 Canadians with jobs, 476 of whom are Inuit."</seg>
<seg id="43">We have to know that people are going to work with us.</seg>
<seg id="44">"We have to have an opportunity to see how much of a problem the project might be,” Mr. Loehr-Hoyer says."</seg>
<seg id="45">"Although the Qikiqtani Inuit Association has stated that they can’t contribute to Phase 2, Mr. Akeeagok said that they will continue to work on the Inuit Impact Review Program and that the program will remain economically viable."</seg>
<seg id="46">“We are not satisfied with the Mary River project.</seg>
<seg id="47">We are working with them.</seg>
<seg id="48">We own the Inuit land where they work.</seg>
<seg id="49">"We support Inuit employment,” he says."</seg>
<seg id="50">“We have invested a lot of money and work to make this project viable for some time.</seg>
<seg id="51">"So with that in mind, we have to find a balance."</seg>
<seg id="52">But right now there is nothing.”</seg>
<seg id="53">Mr. Akeeagok also noted that the community’s uncertainty about the impact of the railroad on our caribou herds is important.</seg>
<seg id="54">"“As an Inuk, these things have had a direct impact on our cultural rights."</seg>
<seg id="55">"It was evident to the elders that when they were here that they were not thinking about themselves, this is also part of our future."</seg>
<seg id="56">And that is what I am focusing on.</seg>
<seg id="57">"My decisions right now are not just for the present time, but for the next generation."</seg>
<seg id="58">I leave them with a better foundation than I did before?</seg>
<seg id="59">"That is the foundation of decision making, no matter what your culture is,” he says."</seg>
<seg id="60">"By way of motion, the Nunavut Impact Review Board allowed the Nunavut Impact Review Board to submit submissions by November 15."</seg>
<seg id="61">"From there, the Nunavut Impact Review Board will provide written submissions to the motion and the length of the waiting period."</seg>

<seg id="1">Nunavut Legislative Assembly Approves Amendments to the Income Tax Act</seg>
<seg id="2">“Mr. Speaker, our government is working diligently to restore the Coppermine Tax Rebate Program as a source of revenue.”</seg>
<seg id="3">"Member Adam Maychrun asked the Minister of Finance, George Hickes, about Bill 26, An Act to Amend the Income Tax Act, during the Department of Justice meeting on Wednesday, November 6."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Nunavut Legislative Assembly updated the Nunavut Income Tax Act to amend the Copper Tax Act.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The changes, which were read for the third time on Wednesday, November 6, included an increase in private mortgage payments from $13,325 to $16,000."</seg>
<seg id="6">"This will result in taxpayers making close to $3,000 a year before they have to pay the Nunavut Income Tax."</seg>
<seg id="7">"The other change is to increase the living tax burden from $1,200 to $1,500."</seg>
<seg id="8">"This means that taxpayers who earn more than $60,000 will be reimbursed an additional $300 through the Income Tax Act."</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, the Nunavut business tax rate for small businesses has dropped from 4 percent to 3 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">"“Our government is working aggressively to make sure that we recover our Copper Payments as a source of revenue,” says Finance Minister George Hickes."</seg>
<seg id="11">"The Government of Canada’s new Copper Tax Rebate Program came into effect in Nunavut on July 1, to bring the fuel price up to 5 cents per litre. The Government of Nunavut introduced the Copper Rebate Program, which helped reduce the cost of fuel."</seg>
<seg id="12">"During discussions on the proposed income tax reform, Nunavut MLAs agreed that coffee tax revenues should be returned to Nunavummiut."</seg>
<seg id="13">However, there was no consensus on how best to do this.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Adam Lightstone, MLA for Iqaluit-Manirajak, expressed concern that, and I quote, “With the reduction in income tax rates, the Government of Nunavut’s Copper Tax Rebate Program will have to be applied to government operations.”"</seg>
<seg id="15">“It is my understanding that we are in dire need of federal support and that our own revenues are only 10 to 15 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">"If we really need to use our own revenues for our operations,” says Lighthizer."</seg>
<seg id="17">“Why is the government trying to use the Copper Tax Rebate Program to subsidize government operations?”</seg>
<seg id="18">"“The Copper Tax Payments that we are developing will be a fraction of that would be with the Government of Nunavut and Copenhagen has tried to make it suitable for our own coffee,“ responds Hicks, adding, ”I don't think we would be very satisfied if we just put the Copper Payments into other revenue Revenue Revenue Revenue Coffers.”"</seg>
<seg id="19">Lighthizer also suggested that amending the Income Tax Act would be the most appropriate way to reimburse Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="20">"They also indicated that the Copper Tax Benefit coming to the Government of Nunavut was intended to, in reducing Nunavut’s dependence on coffee."</seg>
<seg id="21">“Climate change is a major concern to me and it needs to be addressed now and for future generations.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Having said that, I have brought forward a number of ideas for our government on how to come up with solutions or alternatives to help Nunavummiut reduce their energy consumption,” says Lighthizer."</seg>
<seg id="23">“Why have these ideas not been considered and proposed to be used in the Copenhagen Tax Rebate Program?”</seg>
<seg id="24">Mr. Hickes responded by saying that each department, which is responsible for specific projects, is listening.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Some departments have begun work with other departments, including the Qulliq Energy Corporation, which is responsible for developing an energy efficient LED street lighting system in Nunavut and this was approved at the meeting shortly before that."</seg>
<seg id="26">"In 2019/20, the Government of Nunavut thinks it will generate approximately $12 million in Copenhagen tax revenues."</seg>
<seg id="27">It would be broken down as follows:</seg>
<seg id="28">• Two million dollars for the government for more expensive furnaces for public housing and government buildings such as schools and health centres.</seg>
<seg id="29">• 3.6 million dollars for the new Nunavut Coffee Rebate.</seg>
<seg id="30">• 6.2 million dollars will be returned to Nunavummiut and Nunavut jobs this year as a result of amendments to the Income Tax Act.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, for Lighthizer, this is a mathematical error.</seg>
<seg id="32">"“When you look at a 50 percent rebate from the refinery and an additional 50 percent from the Copper Tax Rebate, why is there so little room for energy conservation activities?”"</seg>
<seg id="33">"Mr. Hickes responded that the Federal Fixed Rate for Copper Tax will increase every year over the next five years, and even though this 50 percent deduction from gas stations will continue, next year increasing the tax credit will generate additional revenue for other projects."</seg>
<seg id="34">The Bill received second reading on November 6 and had third reading on the evening of November 3.</seg>
<seg id="35">"In spite of that, Mr. Speaker, the day before her new son told the House that he had been sleeping for three hours and left."</seg>
<seg id="36">"Shortly after in an email to Nunatsiaq News, Mr. Lighthizer stated that he was not satisfied that he was going to vote on the Act."</seg>
<seg id="37">"“I don't agree with the circumstances of Bill 26, I don't think there is a proper set-up of the year policy,” wrote Lighthizer D’Arcy, who was going to speak to the Legislative Assembly."</seg>
<seg id="38">“The purpose of the Copper Tax is to reduce the amount of fuel and crabs that come from the workplace and talk about climate change.</seg>
<seg id="39">"If this Act included an energy tax rebate for individuals and businesses who wish to contribute to energy efficiency, or if the Government of Nunavut had put in place measures to help people purchase and develop energy efficiency programs then I would have been very pleased to have passed this Act.”"</seg>
<seg id="40">Despite Mr. Lighthizer's dissatisfaction, this bill was passed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Mr. Hickes commented that he was very receptive to suggestions on how to use the Copper Tax revenues to reduce Nunavut’s coffee industry.</seg>
<seg id="42">“I strongly encourage members of the public to write letters to their Members of the Legislative Assembly or to the Government of Nunavut with ideas of what could be done in this area.”</seg>

<seg id="4">(Photos from Emma Toronto)</seg>
<seg id="5">"From April to September 2018, over 51,000 people visited Nunavut from outside of Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="6">"This is a reference to the Nunavut Annual Tourism Report for 2018/19 by the Department of Economic Development and Transportation, which was tabled in the Legislative Assembly earlier this month."</seg>
<seg id="7">"The same people that came here spent a total of $271,383,000 in registration and travel expenses."</seg>
<seg id="8">The report does not address actual expenditures other than travel.</seg>
<seg id="9">"On average, there were approximately 16,750 visits from non-Nunavut communities from May to October 2015, based on that year's Nunavut Exit Survey."</seg>
<seg id="10">"The Baffin and Kivalliq regions have the most visited from July to September 2018."</seg>
<seg id="11">"The Qikiqtaaluk region received 95,600 visitors, and just over half (53.2%) came to Iqaluit with a budget of $75.1 million."</seg>
<seg id="12">Pond Inlet and Pangnirtung are the second and third communities visited here in the Baffin region.</seg>
<seg id="13">"In the Kivalliq, Rankin Inlet received 33,600 visitors and spent $68 million, followed by Baker Lake and Arviat."</seg>
<seg id="14">Cambridge Bay was one of the Kitikmeot’s most visited communities.</seg>
<seg id="15">Drinkers of the Wayne Orson Research Vessel sail from Yukon to Kimmirut in August 2019.</seg>
<seg id="16">"In 2018, 3,404 cruise ships travelled to Nunavut in the last two and a half months."</seg>
<seg id="17">"The Coast Guard spent $388,351 on community services, the report also indicates."</seg>
<seg id="18">However, weather and ice conditions affected 50 percent of the ships that wanted to visit Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The Department was given the status of eight passengers operating 23 departing Nunavut from July to September 2018."</seg>
<seg id="20">"The ships carried 3,404 passengers in total."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Just over half of that, or roughly 59 percent of the cargo shipped to Pond Inlet landed in Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Iqaluit is the second most visited vessel with 8.3 percent, followed by Qikiqtarjuaq, with 6.1 percent visits and Grise Fiord with 5.9 percent."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Cruise ship visits to Pond Inlet not only spent a total of $245,565, but these tourists were the most visited 100 hours of the 189.5 hours of cruise ship visits from Nunavut, according to the report."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Cambridge Bay, Gjoa Haven, Kimmirut and Kugluktuk were not visited by cruise ships in 2018."</seg>
<seg id="25">"According to the report, both Cambridge Bay and Gjoa Haven were expecting seven visits, but both were cancelled due to weather."</seg>
<seg id="26">"The report indicated that Cambridge Bay and Gjoa Haven had an impact on cancellations of cruise ships with a combined loss of approximately $25,000."</seg>
<seg id="27">"The feedback from the report came from the Cruise Exit Survey 2018, which was conducted by cruise ship operators and other visitors to Nunavut last year."</seg>
<seg id="28">"In 2018, the Government of Nunavut had to address community concerns from Pond Inlet and Clyde River regarding the use of cruise ships going through hunting grounds."</seg>
<seg id="29">"According to the report, the Government of Nunavut consulted with the Alliance for Northern Research Vessel Operators and all cruise ship operators to avoid the passage."</seg>
<seg id="30">"It also stated that while tourism is an independent development, the government needs support for development."</seg>
<seg id="31">"In Nunavut, this means developing and employing Nunavummiut in the tourism industry."</seg>
<seg id="32">“There is always a lack of interest and skilled people in different tourism sectors.</seg>
<seg id="33">"In the absence of skilled tradespeople, tourism has not been fully realized for its potential."</seg>
<seg id="34">"Training has a long history in the tourism industry in Nunavut,” the report states."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Mr. Speaker, the Government of Nunavut’s Inuit Cruise Ship Training Program, which trains 12 Inuit a year to work as part of the Inuit Cruise Ship Research Program, the report says."</seg>
<seg id="36">"According to the report, all Government of Nunavut tourism inspectors are Inuit."</seg>
<seg id="37">"“Traditionally, tourism data is lacking, thereby creating uncertainty about the size of the economy and its ability to contribute to the Nunavut economy,” the report states."</seg>
<seg id="38">"The department has assisted 115 tourism-related projects in 2018, totalling $1,272,822."</seg>

<seg id="2">MLAs are very interested in Baffinland earnings disclosure</seg>
<seg id="3">Participants are sitting in Iqaluit at Katt Hall on the fourth day of the Nunavut Impact Review Board held a public meeting on the proposed Baffinland iron ore mine rail road expansion proposal at Mary River.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Nunavut’s approach to regulatory compliance for industrial development, which began in the 1993 Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, has not been to deal with issues such as corruption, conflicting environmental and socio-economic studies at the Mary River Iron Ore Mine over the past decade."</seg>
<seg id="5">"This was advertised in Iqaluit earlier this month, when the Nunavut Impact Review Board held its last public meeting on the $900 million rail line expansion proposal from the Baffinland Iron Ore Corporation amid sudden disruption of confusion and misunderstanding."</seg>
<seg id="6">The last day of the seven-day meeting scheduled for Pond Inlet was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="7">"At the same time, with Baffinland costing tens of billions of dollars, the multi-dimensional iron ore mine is in jeopardy."</seg>
<seg id="8">"At the time of writing this, the Nunavut Impact Review Board still had to make a decision on a resolution from NTI that, if approved, it would delay it by eight to 12 months."</seg>
<seg id="9">"And the Baffinland Land Credit Corporation, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, said in the near future that they could not support or approve an expansion of the railway."</seg>

<seg id="13">"On behalf of Baffinland, the Deputy Minister of Recycling, Megan Loehr-Hoyer, commented on this fact that the company was concerned about the viability of the project, saying, “We will take significant steps to stabilize and protect Canadians with 3,000 jobs, 476 of whom are Inuit.”"</seg>
<seg id="14">"Last week, Baffinland reported in Nunatsiaq News that it laid off 490 southern contractors and 96 contractors from Inuit labour."</seg>
<seg id="15">That brings us to one of the biggest unanswered questions on the project: the Mary River funding.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Baffinland has said that the mine's economic potential is uncertain unless regulators permit the construction of a 110-kilometre rail link to Mary River and increase production by 12 million tonnes a year, which would allow them to travel 176 times through the Eclipse Sound."</seg>
<seg id="17">"The problem is, they didn’t come up with a public report to help with that."</seg>
<seg id="18">"And from that point on, most of the professionals did not ask questions on that."</seg>
<seg id="19">"A year ago, even though they didn't have something to show up that didn't stop the Stakeholder Statement of Trust."</seg>
<seg id="20">"For example, in the summer and fall of 2018, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association stamped with Baffinland to protect them from the Nunavut Impact Review Board."</seg>
<seg id="21">"On August 31 of that year, the Nunavut Impact Review Board decided that the Federal Government should not approve ahead of time and in a smaller fiscal year, from 4.2 million tonnes of mercury to 6 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="22">"So Baffinland and their partner, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, did a lot of work."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Over the next few weeks, correspondence was sent to the senior decision makers on this side, Dominique Leblanc, who was then the federal Northern Affairs Minister, asking the board's decisions to be reversed."</seg>
<seg id="24">Why?</seg>
<seg id="25">With the money.</seg>
<seg id="26">"The Inuit Association said that they were shocked at the Mary River mine's potential, that they would have to provide a significant amount of funding and assistance, worth over $20 million to the people here in the new Inuit Impact and Benefit Agreement."</seg>
<seg id="27">Ottawa agreed.</seg>
<seg id="28">"In light of the Qikiqtani Inuit Association’s concerns about the feasibility of funding the mine, the federal government approved Baffinland’s proposal last year."</seg>
<seg id="29">"“We are also concerned about the long-term viability of the Mary River Iron Ore Project and the knowledge of the Qikiqtani Inuit Association (QIA) concerns that an economic development project would comply with the development application process,” Leblanc wrote in a September 30, 2018 letter signed by the Federal-Aboriginal Minister, Minister Minister Carolyn Barnard."</seg>
<seg id="30">"In other words, the most important MP in the public… . The Federal Government has agreed that economic prosperity is important and vital to it."</seg>
<seg id="31">And they did that even though there was no accounting showing in there.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Because if it is true that this project is not profitable, the Member of the Legislative Assembly for what the Member is saying should want to see what he is saying."</seg>
<seg id="34">"In every aspect of the Mary River project, the Baffinland staff -- as required -- must produce hundreds of benefits for the Mary River project."</seg>
<seg id="35">"But in terms of the project’s financial capacity, I don’t think the Nunavut Impact Review Board is very interested in releasing public signs."</seg>
<seg id="36">"For example, the Nunavut Impact Review Board has recommended that a lengthy financial statement obtained by the Canadian Coast Guard from the Northwest Passage be “irrelevant” and not be formally tabled in the Council’s Public Registry."</seg>
<seg id="37">(The letter is still on our website).</seg>
<seg id="38">The Nunavut Impact Review Board recommended that this recommendation be adopted after the letter was tabled and subsequently withdrawn at Baffinland’s request.</seg>
<seg id="39">"In this case, Baffinland wanted to submit, separately, a shorter financial statement stating why Baffinland could generate more revenue through higher production."</seg>
<seg id="40">This desire to be independent may be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="41">At least Baffinland has made some adjustments to that.</seg>
<seg id="42">"In response to this, the Nunavut Impact Review Board made a different decision, which is ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="43">"If the federal government is going to invest in economic development, then this Federal Income Support Board should do the same."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Surely, the Nunavut Impact Review Board and other regulators should be looking for additional resources to do such a thing."</seg>
<seg id="45">They have to be aggressive.</seg>
<seg id="46">"Also, the Baffinland Leases Land, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association."</seg>
<seg id="47">"In addition to these types of concerns that may arise again, the federal government should amend the federal legislation governing the Nunavut Impact Review Board’s practices, the Nunavut Planning Commission and the Program Review Act, to clarify how financial information should be dealt with in the future."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Although I wish I had the opportunity to speak, there are still a lot of questions that remain unanswered about Baffinland’s final expansion proposal, related to the railroad's impact on caribou, the impact on sealift whales, the program’s lack of Inuit employment, and much more."</seg>
<seg id="49">"There are many questions on the Arctic Bay/South Baffin Rail Port Proposal, which Baffinland received approval in 2013 to construct, and 18 million tonnes per year, it is not clear why Baffinland was asked to build in 2013 when they were allowed to produce 18 million tonnes a year."</seg>
<seg id="50">It is still unclear why Baffinland has not proceeded with this plan.</seg>
<seg id="51">But the biggest question is how will this program be sustainable.</seg>

<seg id="2">Economic growth is keeping pace with Quebec’s promises.</seg>
<seg id="3">Children and teachers were here at the Aqevik Preschool in Clyde River in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Earlier this year, the Quebec Government increased support for families in the Early Childhood Education Program, based on family income."</seg>
<seg id="5">"On November 7, 2019, the Non-Insured Health Benefits Program was cancelled and the Early Childhood Education Program was set at $8.25 per day."</seg>
<seg id="6">(Picture by Nunavikkchildcare.ca)</seg>
<seg id="7">By Elaine Ashoomi</seg>
<seg id="8">"The economic restructuring in Quebec has resulted in additional funding for family and child services in Quebec, including Nunavik."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Quebec’s GDP was identified as being 2.4% for 2018/19, which is 0.6% higher than previously thought."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Meanwhile, Quebec’s Finance Minister, Eric Jarrett, announced on November 7 that $857 million will be used to meet the stated fiscal needs of the Government of Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="11">Two things that will be coming out of this will be the envy of the Child Welfare Program and the Child Benefit Program.</seg>
<seg id="12">"“A renewal of the Quebec Economy and Prosperity has demonstrated Quebec’s success in this area,” Mr. Jarrett said in the press release."</seg>
<seg id="13">“Economic growth in Quebec gives us an opportunity to reduce the deficit and fulfill the government’s promises.”</seg>
<seg id="14">"With this program, Quebec repeals the Extended Family Services Program that was implemented by the former Liberal Government in 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Under this program, there is additional support for childcare on top of the per-day wage."</seg>
<seg id="16">This subsidy was increased by $15 a day for higher income earners.</seg>
<seg id="17">"For families who make less than $50,000, there was no increase in the subsidy."</seg>
<seg id="18">"The November 7 news release will restore the Quebec Day Care Fee of $8.25, eliminating the surcharge for all income earners."</seg>
<seg id="19">This new fee in Nunavik will be applied through the Kativik All Communities Government Program in Nunavik for child welfare.</seg>
<seg id="20">"According to the Quebec News Release, this new fee will be for this year, and the Montreal Gazette reported that this will be effective January 1, 2019."</seg>
<seg id="21">"As of last week, the head of the Early Childhood Services Centre of Municipal Government, Julie-Anne Beattie, had not been informed as to how or when these payments would start in Nunavik."</seg>
<seg id="22">Premier Francois Legault’s government first proposed a phased-in approach to reducing the need for additional resources and eliminating it completely by 2022.</seg>
<seg id="23">A healthy economy and an emerging fiscal surplus of $4 billion for the 2019/20 fiscal year accelerates the process.</seg>
<seg id="24">"As well as removing payments for child care, the Quebec Government is moving forward with a child tax increase that was promised to be in place in 2021."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Effective January 2020, the Government of Quebec announced that families here will receive an increase of $779 per year."</seg>
<seg id="26">"This subsidy is attached to the income threshold, with a minimum credit of $1,000 to a maximum of $2,515 per year."</seg>
<seg id="27">"The new Act on Child Equality is less than the Liberals are able to waive the Northern Allowance for the eldest child."</seg>
<seg id="28">"“Today, we will complete the implementation of various measures to help the people of Quebec,” Jarrett says."</seg>
<seg id="29">“We are giving money back to Quebec a lot quicker.”</seg>

<seg id="2">“Peter was well respected for his efforts in providing services and environmental support”</seg>
<seg id="3">"Sanikiluaq's opera has been erected in front of the Nunavut Bar on Wednesday, November 20, the evening, in memory of former MLA and former Minister Peter Kattuk, who passed away on the morning of a long illness."</seg>
<seg id="4">"The Sanikiluaq Community Infrastructure was erected on Wednesday, November 20 in front of the Nunavut Justice Centre in Iqaluit, in honour of Peter Kattuk of Sanikiluaq, who died that morning after a long illness."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Mr. Kattuk, 69, a respected member of the Legislative Assembly, the Maoyak and the community leader's home, became a member of Nunavut's inaugural Assembly on February 15, 1999, when voters from Hudson Bay voted for this first Nunavut Legislative Assembly and the group held its first meeting on Assembly."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Peter Kautuq (left) joined former Nunavut Commissioner Peter Irniq on April 12, 2000, when Mr. Kattuk was sworn in as Nunavut's Minister."</seg>
<seg id="7">"At the beginning of the Assembly, Mr. Kattuk was appointed Minister of Culture, Language, Elders &amp; Youth on April 12, 2000 to replace Member Donald Havioyak, who resigned from his position."</seg>
<seg id="8">"On December 17, 2001, Mr. Kattuk was transferred from his portfolio to the Minister of Community and Government Services, having held the portfolio until 2004."</seg>
<seg id="9">"And in 2004, Sanikiluaq voters re-elected Mr. Kattuk for Hudson Bay, as an MLA until 2008."</seg>
<seg id="10">"“Peter was the representative of Hudson Bay for eight years in two elections and his family is in my thoughts,” Nunavut Speaker Simeon Mikkungwak said in a news release."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Born on June 2, 1950, Mr. Kattuk spent many years in Sanikiluaq on environmental issues, serving as mayor and community leader."</seg>
<seg id="12">"In the early 1990s, he was a member of the Sanikiluaq Impact Review Board, which locally collects known impacts on the huge hydro infrastructure built near Northern Quebec due to the impact of ice and marine life on the Belcher Islands."</seg>
<seg id="13">The result was a report titled “Hudson Bay Tapes: A Cultural Knowledge of Inuit and First Nations in the Hudson Bay Area.”</seg>
<seg id="14">"As Mayor of Sanikiluaq, Mr. Kattuk also spoke in protest at the now decommissioned Churchill Power Plant Water Stop Proposal."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Later Mr. Kattuk was a member of the Nunavut-Hudson Bay Working Group, which was called the Nunavut Hudson Bay Neighbours Association."</seg>
<seg id="16">"This group, formed by the Government of Nunavut, Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated and the Hamlet of Sanikiluaq, is monitoring what is happening in the Sanikiluaq area for phase 2 of the Hydro Moratorium Application, which has been stalled since then, between the Eastmain and Rupert rivers."</seg>
<seg id="17">"And in 1996, Mr. Kattuk was a member of the Nunavut Social Services Board, an organization set up in 1993 under the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Peter Kautuqtuq spoke to the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut on February 19, 2008, near the end of his second term as Member for Hudson Bay."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Kunuk Tattuinee, President of the Arctic Co-operatives Limited, remembers that Mr. Kattuk was “doing a lot of things,” taking this seafood from Sea Urchins from Sanikiluaq."</seg>
<seg id="20">"This is Paul Okalik, when Nunavut was Premier, appointed Mr. Kattuk as Minister of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth in April 2000, saying that Mr. Kattuk had incorporated Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit before he knew much about it."</seg>
<seg id="21">"“Peter was involved in the study of Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit quite a while before that without much information,” Mr. Okalik said in a press release in April 2000."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Before he was Employment Minister in 2001, Mr. Kattuk had to deal with the “rusty” humour."</seg>
<seg id="23">That’s what happened with NTCL bringing gasoline into Nunavut and causing damage to snowmobile engines in the Baffin and the Keewatin.</seg>
<seg id="24">"During his time in charge, Mr. Kattuk did something else: the Government of Nunavut's decision not to use NTCL and redirect the supply to Woodward's Partners in Labrador."</seg>
<seg id="25">"He ran for re-election in October 2017, but came in third after Allan Rumbolt."</seg>
<seg id="26">"“Peter was well respected for his dedication to technical services and environmental initiatives,” Mr. Mikkungwak said in a statement."</seg>

<seg id="5">The newly elected Member of the Legislative Assembly for Nunavik would like to hear from Inuit leaders about their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="6">Member of the Legislative Assembly Sylvie Frobisher won the Cumberland-James Bay-Nunavik Nomination in last fall’s federal election by 37.7 percent of the vote.</seg>
<seg id="7">"When Black Quebec members of the Legislative Assembly speak more French, he said that he was looking for an Inuktitut interpreter to work with."</seg>
<seg id="8">"“I want to be very clear about the needs of Aboriginal communities,” he says."</seg>
<seg id="9">"To date, Mr. Prubie mentioned two very important urgent needs in Northern Quebec that he knows about health and housing."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Health is a provincial jurisdiction, but it is a federal subsidy, says Mr. Prubie."</seg>
<seg id="11">"In order to increase the Health Care Subsidy Program, the federal government must be mindful of how they allocate their funding."</seg>
<seg id="12">Papoosie has been working on health issues for over 30 years.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Mr. Speaker, when Black Quebec was campaigning, the Government of Nunavut stated that the provinces needed 10,000 housing units over the next decade."</seg>
<seg id="14">"In this case, Mr. Prubie is talking about different designs."</seg>
<seg id="15">"“If we want this new Liberal Government to move forward, then it is up to us to find solutions,” Mr. Pavey says."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Although this new member is not a familiar face to Nunavik, he is hoping to attend the next Annual General Meeting of Makivik, which will be held in March."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Following the election of Mr. Papoosie, Makivik President Charlie Ford issued a news release inviting Mr. Papoosie to visit Nunavik as soon as possible."</seg>
<seg id="18">"“I look forward to meeting with him, and we welcome his support in our endeavours in business support and things like implementing Jonathan Nason’s Charter of Rights for Indigenous Peoples,” Ford says."</seg>
<seg id="19">In consultation with Inuit leaders it would be helpful in their work to help with Makivik's efforts in the private sector.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Mr. Pompeo is a strong supporter of Bill C-262, which would bring the Canadian Charter of Rights to Indigenous Peoples."</seg>
<seg id="21">"There are two different pieces of legislation that his successor, NTI MLA Romeo Sarganas."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Introduced in 2018, Act C-262 was suspended by the Conservative Party this spring but the Liberal Government Representative from the Senate Chamber, Senator Peter Harter, said that if he is re-elected the Liberal Government will have to implement the legislation."</seg>
<seg id="23">"“It is important for me to continue working on Bill C-262 in accordance with the Canadian Constitution of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the work of my predecessor, Romeo Kaganash,” Mr. Says."</seg>

<seg id="1">Trudeau Gov. 2.0: Don't expect too much</seg>
<seg id="2">“If you have good ideas, don’t expect too much.”</seg>
<seg id="3">"Jane Webatt was then the Minister of Aboriginal Services on March 23, 2018, along with ITK President Nathan Obed, when she announced that the federal government would abolish the Inuit land by 2030."</seg>
<seg id="4">Not a year ago, he resigned from the Federal Government Council.</seg>
<seg id="5">Did you find that during the federal election campaign or any of the premiers didn’t really talk about the issues of Nunavummiut and other northern stakeholders?</seg>
<seg id="6">That is not amazing.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The more important legal professions seem to think that the majority of Canadians, because they are in the south, are not enough to vote even if they are talking about northerners that a majority of Canadians have never heard of."</seg>
<seg id="8">"The Liberal Government made this known as a failure of the Northern Strategy a day before the campaign began."</seg>
<seg id="9">"During the campaign period, aboriginal issues, many of which overlap northern issues, were not addressed."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Given the new shrinkage of Justin Toronto’s new government, and the Board of Governors was sworn in to their duties last November 20, it is hoped that they will continue to do so without much hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="11">Here are some of the indicators.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is about one of the most obvious promises made to the North since the Toronto Government took office in 2015: eliminate at least 50% of cases of tuberculosis in the North by 2025 and completely eliminate it by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="13">"This included an initial contribution of $27.5 million over five years, which will be “set up” by four members of ITK."</seg>
<seg id="14">"But it was promised that it smells like a broken promise, starting with this, the former TB Chief Federal Officer, Jane Weblett, the former Aboriginal Services Minister made that statement."</seg>
<seg id="15">He resigned from Trudeau's legal team on March 4th in protest of Trudeau's inappropriate conduct with Jody Wilson-Ripple.</seg>
<seg id="16">This incident occurred less than four days before Trudeau was scheduled to travel to Iqaluit to apologise for Canada's inappropriate treatment of people suffering from tuberculosis in the 1950s and 1960s.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Since then, they have remained silent on the issue of TB."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Even though they ran for office, there was not much attention paid to that."</seg>
<seg id="19">"And to date, efforts to eradicate tuberculosis have stalled."</seg>
<seg id="20">"For example, in the Northwest Territories, where tuberculosis occurred between 2006 and 2016 and was recorded as 248.5 people out of every 100,000. Health officials have conducted only one community in Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="21">"This is what happened in Nairn, in 2018, when we had tuberculosis outbreaks and there was a 14-year-old boy who died as a result of this illness while at the hospital in Jane Johns."</seg>
<seg id="22">"In Nunavik, 313 people were diagnosed with tuberculosis between 2006 and 2016, which is accompanied by tuberculosis in the Inuit homeland, 234 cases out of 100,000 cases."</seg>
<seg id="23">"However, in all communities it does not appear that there have been any studies done in Nunavik since 2018, when Mr. Webbot made the report."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Indeed, in Nunavut not too long ago there was a population study done after tuberculosis outbreak, when Stephen Harper and the Conservative Party were in office, well before Trudeau’s Liberals were elected."</seg>
<seg id="25">"For Nunavut alone, there were approximately 670 people diagnosed with tuberculosis between 2006 and 2016, bringing it to 171.8 out of every 100,000 and there has been work done on it."</seg>
<seg id="26">(One area that has not been affected is the Inuvialuit region of the Northwest Territories.</seg>
<seg id="27">"At that time, no cases of tuberculosis were reported between 2007 and 2016.)"</seg>
<seg id="28">Tuberculosis is a disease that is lacking in resources.</seg>
<seg id="29">That’s why it’s brought up.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it is true.</seg>
<seg id="31">"If people do not have adequate food and housing, tuberculosis can develop."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Another thing in mind, poverty in Cape Dorset, in this case the 12-week TB study ended in May."</seg>
<seg id="33">In 2016 the unemployment rate was approximately 27.3 percent.</seg>
<seg id="34">"In 2015, people aged 15 and over made a little over $18,933."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Out of the 370 units, 120 units were in dire need of repair."</seg>
<seg id="36">"Under the National Overcrowding Rate, 140 units out of 370 units were classified as “unavailable” by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Act."</seg>
<seg id="37">This means that there are not enough bedrooms per household.</seg>
<seg id="38">There are a few people in Canada who are not provided with housing.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Unsurprisingly, over the last 20 years, tuberculosis has been declared an emergency for Nunavut and other parts of the North."</seg>
<seg id="40">It is not to think that tuberculosis could be eradicated in these communities unless significant changes have been made to increase the number of units and make them better.</seg>
<seg id="41">"However, during the last campaign, Trudeau’s lawyers did not offer public housing, but they were reiterating their 2016 and 2017 operating commitments."</seg>
<seg id="42">"In this case, they can’t even be charged for violating their language, nor did they have any concerns about that."</seg>
<seg id="43">"This also reflects the results of the National Pandemic Emergency, where tuberculosis rates in the North are 300 times higher than those of non-Inuit born in Canada."</seg>
<seg id="44">"In Nunavut, it might be worse."</seg>
<seg id="45">Last year’s report revealed that one in every 100 infants born in Nunavut may have this disease.</seg>
<seg id="46">"Given that they are not overly concerned about urgent health issues, what are the concerns of the Trudeau Liberal Government about other issues such as mental health, community housing, education and so on?"</seg>
<seg id="47">"If you think carefully, don't expect too much."</seg>
<seg id="48">"If you don't, you are prepared to go bankrupt."</seg>

<seg id="6">The Chief Superintendent of Police Jean-Pierre Lopez went to the council to update the Kativik Municipal Government Meeting on November 26 on the progress to date.</seg>
<seg id="7">This included the graduation of 10 new Katimajiit Community Constables from the Ontario Police College in the same week.</seg>
<seg id="8">Staffing also included the opportunity for former employees who have dropped out of old age to talk to them about working in the Katimajiit.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Due to the lack of adequate staffing, the Kativik Community Constable has been assigned to the Quebec Royal Canadian Mounted Police, from Sjerrett du Québec, as alternates."</seg>
<seg id="10">"In September, 20 Quebec police officers were stationed in Nunavik."</seg>
<seg id="11">"The Quebec Police Service has been decreasing slowly as the Kativik Community Constables are recruiting RCMP officers, and Lopez indicated that by early 2020, they may no longer be using the Quebec Police Officers."</seg>
<seg id="12">Cultural Awareness Skills Program begins</seg>
<seg id="13">The Inuit Societal Values Training Centre (ASIST) All Communities Constables Network became online on November 18.</seg>
<seg id="14">"The Skills Development Workshop was organized by the Kativik Society of All Communities (RCMP) and Laval University and includes information about Nunavik, Inuit, Culture, and Policing Practices here in Nunavik."</seg>
<seg id="15">"This is a three-hour training program. Once completed, it is evaluated by a new trainee, which is identified as a candidate."</seg>
<seg id="16">"“This training is to assist the Kativik Community Constables in choosing a culture of opinion,” Mr. Lopez says."</seg>
<seg id="17">"The second training program is nine hours long and requires all RCMP officers to practice, says Mr. Lopez."</seg>
<seg id="18">This project is expected to be completed by the new fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="19">Cameras to be used by RCMP officers</seg>
<seg id="20">Another addition that was added to the RCMP and applauded by members was the need to have cameras in place for the officers’ work.</seg>
<seg id="21">They are using six cameras right now.</seg>
<seg id="22">"“This project was initiated by the Nunavik residents’ desire to have the Kativik Community RCMP more visible in their work,” Mr. Lopez says."</seg>
<seg id="23">“The Kativik Community Constable Program aims to ensure that Inuit can be approached and socialized.”</seg>
<seg id="24">Churchill Councillor Jobie Takkiapik was hopeful that the cameras would help people who have had problems with the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="25">“We hear about the RCMP being treated unfairly and they don’t want to say anything.</seg>
<seg id="26">"They are alarmed by the RCMP,” Takijapik says."</seg>
<seg id="27">“The CT scanner has to be used.”</seg>
<seg id="28">"He went on to say that if only one or two RCMP officers mistreated Inuit, this has a profound impact, and concerns the whole RCMP."</seg>
<seg id="29">"The idea is that the CCTV system, which tracks what the RCMP is doing, can be used in the near future."</seg>
<seg id="30">Mr. Lopez indicated that the cameras would be in place by January.</seg>

<seg id="5">Renewable energy experts from the North met in Iqaluit on November 21 and 22 to discuss their ideas and experiences with the North.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Delegates from Nunavut, the Yukon, Northwest Territories, Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, Greenland and Jonathan Styles spoke about the difficulties faced by different jurisdictions."</seg>
<seg id="7">"The gathering, called Optimizing Operations, Intergrating New Technologies and Engaging Stakeholders (Improving Operations, Incorporating New Technologies and Engaging Stakeholders), was developed by U.S. presidents in cooperation with the Government of Nunavut and Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Bruno Pereira, President of the Qulliq Energy Corporation, said that the gathering was an indication of the problems."</seg>
<seg id="9">"“In terms of wanting to adopt renewable energy in our communities, we would really like to know what other people do, and to find out how they have accomplished their jobs or their downfalls,” Pereira says."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Mr. Pereira also said that while it is very important to get representatives together to discuss fuel efficiency measures, Nunavut has a number of activities going on here in Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="11">“Some communities have access roads so they are not in the Inuit communities of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="12">"But like we do they have challenges, in terms of space, being able to work in the community, so we can see people with similar disabilities.”"</seg>
<seg id="13">"Chris Rose, Executive Director of Renewable Energy Programs in Alaska, said the Alaska Energy Subsidy Program has helped foster renewable energy development."</seg>
<seg id="14">“We were able to build 80 communities that have been able to use renewable energy on top of diesel diesel diesel.</seg>
<seg id="15">"So we think that we now know what the benefits are,” Rose says."</seg>
<seg id="16">"This program, designed to promote renewable economic development programs, helps Alaskans in the area of lower energy costs."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Rose mentioned that in Russia South West, the five communities are working together to develop windmills and they are now using them for energy purposes."</seg>
<seg id="18">"“Now there is an integrated knowledge of how to operate and maintain windmills and they can help each other with installing them,” Mr. Rose says."</seg>
<seg id="19">"In Alaska, like Nunavut, home energy bills are very expensive."</seg>
<seg id="20">Mr. Rose said that the communities using windmills are not just for power but also for furnaces.</seg>
<seg id="21">“What they have done is they put small furnaces into people’s houses and they are surrounded by diamonds that look like carpeting.</seg>
<seg id="22">"When the winds get warmer, they go into the power heaters, and they have put in place a small amount of information that the boilers and the Power Corporation will notice,” Mr. Rose says."</seg>
<seg id="23">"“They are surrounded by heat suppression, which keeps the building warm."</seg>
<seg id="24">"They can be turned off or set on fire to a home’s satisfaction, and if they get stuck, they can use another heating system.”"</seg>
<seg id="25">"But in Greenland, the installation of windmills has been a difficult task, as far as News Corp. Eric Hagowski, a technology specialist in recycling in Nuuk."</seg>
<seg id="26">"Extreme cold and long daylight make it difficult for winds in the south to be made from the north, says Mr. Havioyak."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Mr. Haqvist also said that two wind turbines were successfully installed in another location in North Greenland, but they failed."</seg>
<seg id="28">“We can also say that in Greenland, we have been more proactive in accessing the resources that are available.</seg>
<seg id="29">"There are even two wind turbines that have been installed in 200 different locations and one in 150 locations being tested,” he says."</seg>
<seg id="30">"One of the windmills fell off his arm, but on the other hand, the fuel truck was too thick for the cold and caused engine breakdowns, Mr. Hakvik says."</seg>
<seg id="31">"During the 2019 federal election campaign, three political parties announced that if elected, NTCL would be phased out by 2030."</seg>
<seg id="32">"While it may take some time to develop recycling programs that will work in the North, Mr. Havioyak said moving away from fossil fuels is an urgent matter."</seg>
<seg id="33">"“We have to do something to get rid of fossil fuels, because of climate change, because of course there is something wrong now."</seg>
<seg id="34">This is for the Department of Justice because when you are not using fossil fuels you have to have a program but there is no money.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Having the money is a good job, he says."</seg>
<seg id="36">Mr. Pereira said it was an exciting experience in talking to neighbouring Nunavut residents in the North.</seg>
<seg id="37">"“I think that’s something that needs to be looked at in other ways to start working towards recycling."</seg>
<seg id="38">Some Inuit have used the technology and had problems with southern professionals but they can’t do it in the North.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Once we have the financial capacity we will be able to track the deficiencies,” Mr. Barriault says."</seg>

<seg id="1">The Government of Nunavut should involve Inuit in the development of the Education Act: NTI</seg>
<seg id="2">“This is an important policy change that will affect many Inuit parents and Inuit children in Nunavut.”</seg>
<seg id="3">"Aluki Kuuttiq, President of Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, speaks before the Standing Committee on Legislation during its consideration of Bill 25, an Act to Amend the Education Act and the Inuit Language Protection Act."</seg>
<seg id="4">"By Aluki Kuuttiq President, Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated"</seg>
<seg id="5">Subject: Minister Joanasie’s Letter to Nunatsiaq News Article on Bill 25 Consultations</seg>
<seg id="6">"Minister Joanasie wrote in an article published in Nunatsiaq News on November 25, 2019 concerning discussions between the Department of Education and Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated on Bill 25, indicating that these consultations were conducted in good faith and offered to NTI with ample opportunity to voice their concerns."</seg>
<seg id="7">The Minister sees his invitation to NTI for the public meetings and NTI hearings that the Government of Nunavut sees as having worked closely with the previous meetings.</seg>
<seg id="8">That is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Inuit have the right under Article 32 of the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement to participate in the development of social and cultural policies, as well as the development of social and cultural programs and services, including governance."</seg>
<seg id="10">It is a different foundation.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bill 25 proposes amendments to the Education Act and the Inuit Language Protection Act to establish the policies and administration of Inuit language instruction.</seg>
<seg id="12">This fundamental policy change will impact many Inuit parents and Inuit children in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="13">"In this case, the Inuit Right to Participate in the development and design process."</seg>
<seg id="14">NTI was not given an opportunity to participate in the development of policy proposals outlined in the proposed Bill 25.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Not only does it violate the Government’s mandate outlined in the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, its history demonstrates that the working relationship has achieved the goal of implementing legislation that better incorporates Inuit goals and objectives."</seg>
<seg id="16">"NTI has been working with the Government of Nunavut, such as the Inuit Language Protection Act, the Official Languages Act and the Wildlife Act."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Knowing that it could work, NTI contacted the Premier and shortly after the election of the Government to coordinate working together and collaborating on Inuit priorities, including education, language and culture."</seg>
<seg id="18">"The Department of Education did not submit the proposed legislation to NTI until August 31, 2018, at which time the department provided a list of planned community consultations."</seg>
<seg id="19">NTI was given less than a week to review Bill 25 and prepare and prepare for the Nunavut consultation tour.</seg>
<seg id="20">This is not a working relationship.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The department coordinated consultations in the short term, and did not seek solutions or accommodations to concerns raised by the public, NTI and other organizations such as the District Education Authority (DEA) and the Coalition of Nunavut District Education Authorities (CMDEA) were also present."</seg>
<seg id="22">"I further urge the Minister of Education to ensure that the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement's clear mandate is fulfilled under Article 32, and that the department must operate with good intent, obligations and obligations and embrace the dignity of the Queen when it comes to partnering with the public."</seg>
<seg id="23">"NTI’s belief that rewriting the Education Act by enacting Inuit participation in the BIP framework should change the way the department operates, and in general recognize human rights."</seg>
