<seg id="66">&gt;&gt;House commenced at 13:33</seg>
<seg id="67">Speaker (Hon. Joe Enook) (interpretation): Mr. Quassa, please say the opening prayer.</seg>
<seg id="68">Speaker (interpretation): Good afternoon, Premier, members, Nunavummiut who are listening to the radio broadcast and watching the televised proceedings. Welcome to your committee.</seg>
<seg id="69">We will proceed directly to the orders of the day.</seg>
<seg id="70">Premier of Nunavut, Mr. Quassa.</seg>
<seg id="71">Minister’s Statement 046 – 5(1): Nunavut’s 2018 Youth Awards (Quassa)</seg>
<seg id="72">Hon. Paul Quassa (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="73">Good day to my fellow residents of Igloolik, my colleagues, and all Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="74">I would like to share with my colleagues that Dr. Donna Mynn-Kemaliarjuk will be recognized in 2018 for the Youth Abroad Program in Winnipeg.</seg>
<seg id="75">This is the first time that a nurse has been certified as an Inuk.</seg>
<seg id="76">Dakota Kamiliarjuk was born in Chesterfield Inlet and is the first Inuk cardiologist to be…</seg>
<seg id="77">This is the fourth year of the program for a six-year program at the University of Ottawa.</seg>
<seg id="78">Mr. Speaker, Dr. Kimmaliarjuk was able to enter the clinic in 2014 and is the only person named to be a cardiovascular physician in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="79">In 2016 he became a member of the Aboriginal HIV/AIDS Coordinator on behalf of Inuit.</seg>
<seg id="80">When I was a Member of the Legislative Assembly, I spoke about Inuit health issues and Inuit culture.</seg>
<seg id="81">Mr. Speaker, these prizes represent the highest honour of our indigenous peoples.</seg>
<seg id="82">The recipients celebrate their 25th anniversary in 2018 and are proud of 350 indigenous, Inuit, and Métis who have demonstrated their success.</seg>
<seg id="83">The award ceremony celebrates the cultural diversity of indigenous peoples across Canada.</seg>
<seg id="84">This year’s award ceremony will take place on March 23 in Winnipeg.</seg>
<seg id="85">I would like to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Dr. Kamaliarjuk on his achievement.</seg>
<seg id="86">She has done a lot of work on her own and she is very proud of her accomplishments. She is an Inuk and health expert and she is a very good role model for our youth in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="87">I am also aware that while I am talking about this issue, I am very proud of the work that Mr. Kilimnik will be doing. It will be very important to us.</seg>
<seg id="88">Minister of Justice, Ms. Ikidluak.</seg>
<seg id="89">Minister’s Statement 047 – 5(1): Rankin Inlet Healing Centre Sewing (Cambridge Bay)</seg>
<seg id="90">Hon. Jeannie Ikidluak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) I rise today to talk about the cultural sewing program for the men’s Rankin Inlet Healing Centre.</seg>
<seg id="91">The inmates participated in this program, which included sealskin and other sewing programs, such as pelts, sealskin pelts, sealskin pelts, pelts, and sealskin pelts.</seg>
<seg id="92">Rosemary Angutiak is run by Sandy, who is a respected elder and sewing expert worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="93">He recently travelled to Norway to teach about sealskin products.</seg>
<seg id="94">She was a student of Nunavut Arctic College’s Fur Production and Design Program, and she launched the Merkick Program with the Literacy Council of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="95">Rosemary assists inmates in culturally appropriate physical and healthy Inuit language and cultural healing.</seg>
<seg id="96">This sewing program will work with and support the development of land trips. Individuals who are incarcerated will learn how to hunt and how to properly manage their sealskins and their food.</seg>
<seg id="97">The Fur Pricing Program will be used for the sewing program.</seg>
<seg id="98">Projects such as this help inmates to reintegrate into their communities once their sentence expires and they are promoted instead of through criminal behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="99">I recently visited the Rankin Inlet Healing Centre and I was pleased to note the positive impact that cultural programs have had, especially with community elders like Rosemary Sandy.</seg>
<seg id="100">Minister of Family Services, Mr. Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="101">Minister’s Statement 048 – 5(1): Red Seal Program Red Seal (Savikataaq)</seg>
<seg id="102">Hon. Joe Savikataaq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I say “good day” to the people of Arviat and to the students.</seg>
<seg id="103">Mr. Speaker, it’s a certified heavy equipment operator and heavy equipment operator.</seg>
<seg id="104">In September of 2016 the heavy equipment operator training program for these three programs was announced in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="105">This allows Nunavummiut to gain on-the-job training and certification from what is known as accreditation.</seg>
<seg id="106">In November 2017 Nunavut was granted the Red Seal Certification for Motor Vehicles and Motor Vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="107">As part of the heavy equipment operator program, this program passes through the provincial accreditation program, which allows them to gain knowledge and experience in all parts of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="108">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to announce that we have been able to deliver this program to Nunavummiut through the National Academy of Excellence and Diploma in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="109">Minister of Education, Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="110">Minister’s Statement 049 – 5(1): New Funding for Early Childhood Education Programs (Joanasie)</seg>
<seg id="111">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon, my colleagues, residents of Cape Dorset and Kimmirut, Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="112">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to announce today that the Department of Education will be providing O &amp; M funding to eligible daycares.</seg>
<seg id="113">Mr. Speaker, these increases are the result of a three-year program plan that my staff developed for early childhood education and child care, which was a two-year agreement signed in September 2017 with the Government of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="114">Mr. Speaker, this current fiscal year we will see eligible daycares receive an increase in funding of $1,918.80, with a maximum value of $45,494.80, depending on the number and location of these daycares.</seg>
<seg id="115">As long as the daycares do not increase their daycare costs and additional costs, they will not be eligible for similar funding in the next fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="116">Mr. Speaker, this funding will not only assist daycares in managing their operating costs, but will also assist families in accessing additional child care costs.</seg>
<seg id="117">Mr. Speaker, we are proud to be able to provide this funding to support daycares and families.</seg>
<seg id="118">I also believe, and obviously we also believe that this funding will have a positive impact on not changing both the funding and the cost of child care.</seg>
<seg id="119">Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="120">Minister’s Statement 050 – 5(1): Nunavut Mining Symposium (Sheutiapik)</seg>
<seg id="121">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik (interpretation): Good day, Nunavummiut and my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="122">Mr. Speaker, mining is a vital component of Nunavut’s economic development.</seg>
<seg id="123">The department is committed to supporting the mining industry in Nunavut to assist in these activities.</seg>
<seg id="124">Mr. Speaker, Canada is hosting the 21st Annual Nunavut Mining Symposium on April 9 to 12, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="125">This forum provides an excellent opportunity for Inuit to explore the new Nunavut Prospectors and Developers Program to ensure that our communities are aware of and involved in mining and exploration in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="126">We anticipate that this year’s mining symposium will continue to attract more than 400 participants.</seg>
<seg id="127">Mr. Speaker, I look forward to welcoming the mining companies, Inuit organizations, search and rescue organizations, community members, and other stakeholders to this important event.</seg>
<seg id="128">Finally, Mr. Speaker, I encourage all members and members of the public to participate in this public event on April 11.</seg>
<seg id="129">It’s not just an opportunity to get some good stuff, but it’s an impact on the search and rescue. I’ll make sure that you’re responding to the member’s question.</seg>
<seg id="130">Members’ Statements. Member for Hudson Bay, Mr. Rumbolt.</seg>
<seg id="131">Member’s Statement 096 – 5(1): Happy Fifth Birthday to Granddaughter (Rumbolt)</seg>
<seg id="132">Mr. Speaker, five years ago to this day the previous Speaker rose to the occasion when I was a grandson. I have now been five years old.</seg>
<seg id="133">Happy birthday, Jayden.</seg>
<seg id="134">Member for Netsilik, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="135">Member’s Statement 097 – 5(1): Kitikmeot Youth Empowerment (Qirngnuq)</seg>
<seg id="136">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="137">What I am going to say is that it’s a good idea for our youth and it’s a good plan for the future.</seg>
<seg id="138">I rise today to share some good news with my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="139">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to inform the House that Inuit youth from the Kitikmeot will be gathering in Cambridge Bay next week to celebrate the 2018 Kitikmeot Youth Abroad Program.</seg>
<seg id="140">Mr. Speaker, this gathering provides an opportunity for Kitikmeot youth to meet and discuss their priorities and concerns with youth.</seg>
<seg id="141">It includes the following:</seg>
<seg id="142">Mental health;</seg>
<seg id="143">Youth facilities;</seg>
<seg id="144">Conduct abuse;</seg>
<seg id="145">The importance of learning Inuit history, residential school solutions, and peacekeeping; and</seg>
<seg id="146">The protection of the Inuit language and culture continues.</seg>
<seg id="147">Mr. Speaker, the participants from Taloyoak are:</seg>
<seg id="148">Judy Crow;</seg>
<seg id="149">David Tungilik;</seg>

<seg id="158">Pauline Illuituq.</seg>
<seg id="159">Mr. Speaker, I ask all members to join me in wishing them the best of luck in their reunion.</seg>
<seg id="160">Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, Mr. Lightstone.</seg>
<seg id="161">Member’s Statement 098 – 5(1): Smoking Bill (Lightstone)</seg>
<seg id="162">Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="163">I rise today to express concerns that have been brought to my attention by my constituents regarding the issue of marijuana legalization.</seg>
<seg id="164">I recently received a letter saying, “My family as Iqaluit residents are in a public housing unit for a year.</seg>
<seg id="165">Over the last couple of years we have had to move from smoking to smoking. The smoke is very strong in my house.”</seg>
<seg id="166">This letter further indicates that, and I quote, “I am very concerned about the effects of smoking on my children, my children first and foremost in this situation.”</seg>
<seg id="167">Mr. Speaker, as residents of Iqaluit and my family, we are also living in condominium units.</seg>
<seg id="168">Mr. Speaker, dust suppressants affect other people’s smoke.</seg>
<seg id="169">It has been a long time since you’re not smoking. It’s a disease that has been known by the government and it has been regulated by non-smokers.</seg>
<seg id="170">As a father and a child, I don’t want to see any health effects that are associated with tobacco and marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="171">As my colleague from Pangnirtung pointed out, the question was asked by the Minister of Health about the potential health effects of marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="172">I have spoken to many of my constituents and they have the same concerns.</seg>
<seg id="173">Mr. Speaker, I recognize that when you’re dealing with these types of issues, you have to be fair.</seg>
<seg id="174">Mr. Speaker, the federal government has announced that it will no longer tolerate cigarette smoking in Nunavut in the next few months.</seg>
<seg id="175">I seek unanimous consent to conclude my statement.</seg>
<seg id="176">The member is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statement. Are there any nays?</seg>
<seg id="177">Mr. Lightstone, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="178">Thank you, my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="179">Under this legislation, elders will be able to retain and possess marijuana. However, the government will have to decide how to regulate the use of marijuana in the community.</seg>
<seg id="180">Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet also stated last week that the government’s own follow-up and results have also indicated that it is concerned about agriculture and the acquisition of public housing units and condominiums.</seg>
<seg id="181">Mr. Speaker, I believe that when this bill is introduced in the Legislative Assembly, it will clearly address these concerns and I look forward to a positive outcome for my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="182">Before we proceed, I would like to note that our colleague, Mr. Akoak, is not here today due to illness.</seg>
<seg id="183">Mr. Akoak, please save your time.</seg>
<seg id="184">Member for Baker Lake, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="185">Member’s Statement 099 – 5(1): Increased Curriculum in Baker Lake (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="186">Mr. Mikkungwak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="187">I say “hello” to the people of Baker Lake and all Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="188">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage our government to increase the number of training programs in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="189">Mr. Speaker, Qamanittuaq is a growing community. It will be important to take this opportunity to provide additional training and employment opportunities to the residents of Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="190">Mr. Speaker, Piqqusilirivvik manages the program in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="191">This program can be expanded so that the public is more aware and more knowledgeable about Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit.</seg>
<seg id="192">Mr. Speaker, the idea of establishing a university in Nunavut has been discussed, and Agnico Eagle Mines has indicated that they can provide this type of support if it is to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="193">I think it would be best to bring Nunavut to the centre of Canada because it’s the centre of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="194">Mr. Speaker, one of my colleagues stated that it’s very important that we take these things forward before they pass.</seg>
<seg id="195">The government’s wheels are very slow, but we do need to encourage and encourage when something comes out in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="196">Mr. Speaker, this is the beginning of our fifth term as a Legislative Assembly. I, too, would like to see us take a step forward.</seg>
<seg id="197">Expanding the training programs in communities such as Baker Lake would be a great step forward.</seg>
<seg id="198">Member for Kugluktuk, Mr. Kamingoak.</seg>
<seg id="199">Member’s Statement 100 – 5(1): Issues with the Larga Boarding Home (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="200">Mr. Kamingoak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="201">Good afternoon, colleagues, Kuglukturmiut, and Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="202">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage the government to better monitor the day-to-day operations of medical boarding homes.</seg>
<seg id="203">Mr. Speaker, my constituents have raised a number of concerns and it seems a long time ago that these issues should have been addressed.</seg>
<seg id="204">It’s a food problem and it’s a waste of time. It’s a lot of time. It’s broken down and it’s going to take several months.</seg>
<seg id="205">Mr. Speaker, it is important for the government to ensure that services that are paid to Nunavummiut are delivered in a timely manner.</seg>
<seg id="206">I understand that the hotels require a lot of accommodations on a daily basis, but it’s important that they are comfortable and well taken care of.</seg>
<seg id="207">Mr. Speaker, it is unclear whether or not the boarding home will be part of the review of the medical travel review.</seg>
<seg id="208">I would very much like to see the results of the review and the recommendations that will be made to improve the services and the circumstances of the boarding home.</seg>
<seg id="209">Member for Aivilik, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="210">Member’s Statement 101 – 5(1): Congratulations to Rosalie Ejangiaq (Netser)</seg>
<seg id="211">Mr. Netser (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) I rise today to congratulate Rosalie Ejangiaq from Naujaat.</seg>
<seg id="212">He is a young graduate, but he has been a hard-working recipient of the Order of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="213">Mr. Speaker, the Harris elder from the Canadian Scholarship Program provided financial assistance to high school students despite the challenges of success.</seg>
<seg id="214">Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize Ms. Ejangiaq for her perseverance and commitment to continuing her education.</seg>
<seg id="215">Many of our youth are struggling with challenges and challenges to complete their studies at Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="216">Mr. Speaker, I ask all members to join me in congratulating him on his tremendous achievement. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="217">Member for Pangnirtung, Ms. Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="218">Member’s Statement 102 – 5(1): Bussie Mike Recognition under Canada 150 (Nakashuk)</seg>
<seg id="219">Mr. Nakashuk (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="220">Good afternoon, my colleagues, my family, and the people of Pangnirtung.</seg>
<seg id="221">I rise this afternoon to congratulate a constituent of mine from Pangnirtung who was recognized by Dennis Patterson.</seg>
<seg id="222">I would also like to congratulate her for 18 years of volunteer search and rescue service in Pangnirtung, Bussie Mike, who has been working for the search and rescue team for 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="223">The last name on the list, Hon. Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Mike.</seg>
<seg id="224">Member’s Statement 103 – 5(1): Budget Perspectives (Main)</seg>
<seg id="225">Mr. Main (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="226">I say “good day” to the people watching the televised proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="227">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share some observations and recommendations regarding the government’s financial management practices.</seg>
<seg id="228">Mr. Speaker, as new members of this House, over the past couple of weeks we have learned a lot and experience.</seg>
<seg id="229">Mr. Speaker, as Chair of the Regular Members’ Caucus of the Legislative Assembly, I would like to express my appreciation to all of my colleagues for the way in which we have been able to work together since the beginning of the new Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="230">Mr. Speaker, I am very proud that we made a strong statement on Friday that the Legislative Assembly will no longer accept and that the government must respect its own procurement rules.</seg>
<seg id="231">Mr. Main: Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Iqaluit-Tasiluk tabled a very important motion on Friday and we will move forward with the next sitting of the Legislative Assembly during our spring sitting.</seg>
<seg id="232">Mr. Speaker, we are a divided government and it’s not always under control.</seg>
<seg id="233">As an example, as I indicated last week in my opening comments, when we were dealing with the college’s capital estimates, the government listened to our concerns and even changed the funding formula.</seg>
<seg id="234">I look forward to seeing more of that in the coming weeks and years, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="235">Mr. Speaker, over the past few weeks members have asked a lot of questions on a daily basis.</seg>
<seg id="236">I think we can be very frank in saying that we’re clear in our goals and it’s obvious that we need to do a thorough review of the government’s spending.</seg>
<seg id="237">It’s not enough if we’re just counting on people who are going out on the land.</seg>
<seg id="238">Mr. Speaker, I seek unanimous consent to conclude my statement.</seg>
<seg id="239">The member is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statement. Are there any nays?</seg>
<seg id="240">Mr. Main, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="241">Mr. Main (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="242">Mr. Speaker, I’m talking about examples of things that are happening.</seg>
<seg id="243">Mr. Speaker, this information has to be made public in the Legislative Assembly so that we, as elected members, can make informed decisions on whether or not any of the funding requirements should be increased or decreased, or should it be discontinued or removed because we’re dealing with other things that we don’t have enough money to do.</seg>
<seg id="244">Mr. Speaker, I’ll use these examples as an example.</seg>
<seg id="245">I think it’s fair to say that we can agree that the government’s administration of the tax rebate for harvesters is lacking in support of harvesters.</seg>
<seg id="246">The Department of Environment, which manages the government’s harvester support program, must carefully review its programs and how it can be improved to meet its targets for harvesters to support the cost of fuel.</seg>
<seg id="247">Mr. Speaker, I will also take this opportunity to provide another example of the government’s grants and contributions expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="248">We all know that the government has spent a lot of money on development and promotion.</seg>
<seg id="249">We know how much money has been spent on private sector loans.</seg>
<seg id="250">We know who received the funding.</seg>
<seg id="251">We don’t know what this money was actually used for.</seg>
<seg id="252">We don’t know how many Inuit were hired by Nunavummiut from that fund, but we don’t even know what that money was used for.</seg>
<seg id="253">Mr. Speaker, as you know, I can talk about it for a long time, but I’ll stop here.</seg>
<seg id="254">I would like to add that I look forward to seeing the main estimates for the operations of the Legislative Assembly and I look forward to working closely with all members to strengthen our budget with the support of all communities and constituents.</seg>
<seg id="255">Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="256">Member’s Statement 104 – 5(1): Two Additional Elders Travel for Care (Towtongie)</seg>
<seg id="257">Ms. Towtongie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="258">I rise today to offer my condolences to Annie Tatty, who is one of my constituents in Rankin Inlet North and Chesterfield Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="259">As well, one of our oldest elders, Amaruq, who I rise today in the House, is also sent to Gjoa Haven because he doesn’t have an elder in Rankin Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="260">I would like to share that information with the residents of Rankin Inlet North and Chesterfield Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="261">When I was elected in November, when I was looking at the business plan, I asked the Minister of Health, “Where are the plans for the establishment of an elders facility in Rankin Inlet or Nunavut?”</seg>
<seg id="262">I was told by the Minister of Health that all of us, as MLAs, are very sensitive to our elders.</seg>
<seg id="263">The minister stated that during our meeting in Pond Inlet, this will be tabled in the House.</seg>
<seg id="264">I’m waiting.</seg>
<seg id="265">The other day I rose in the House when we were dealing with the capital estimates, but I don’t see it. It’s set aside for an elders facility.</seg>
<seg id="266">I was told that I don’t have to talk about this because I have to stop.</seg>
<seg id="267">However, I was grateful to our Chairman, Allan Rumbolt, for allowing me to continue to express my feelings about the elders facility.</seg>
<seg id="268">I rise today as a politician to express my dissatisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="269">It’s not acceptable for elders to be sent south to places where they have not grown up.</seg>
<seg id="270">We want to be a good legislature and we want to be a good government. We have told our elders to be proud of them and send them out of the territory.</seg>
<seg id="271">Member for Amittuq, Mr. Qiniq.</seg>
<seg id="272">Member’s Statement 105 – 5(1): Recognition of Hall Beach and Igloolik Volunteers and Search and Rescue (coming)</seg>
<seg id="273">Mr. Qiniq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thought I was forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="274">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my pride in my fellow residents.</seg>
<seg id="275">The search and rescue organizations work very hard to find people when there is an emergency.</seg>
<seg id="276">They use it for their own operations.</seg>
<seg id="277">I rise today to congratulate the following individuals from my community of Hall Beach who are involved in search and rescue. They are chaired by Kyle Issigaitok, the vice-chairperson, George Inuksuk, and the director of the Martha Gibbons tent, who is also responsible for medical travel, Daniel Qaunaq.</seg>
<seg id="278">Abraham Ullaq is an elder.</seg>
<seg id="279">This is the first time I have ever stated that this is the first time that a person has travelled to search and rescue.</seg>
<seg id="280">As youth, we need to provide more support and our elders tell us the truth.</seg>
<seg id="281">We don’t think we’re building a future.</seg>
<seg id="282">I’m here now and I’m very disappointed, but I’ll have to listen again.</seg>
<seg id="283">That’s not going to be the case for our youth. When you go out on the land, please be safe.</seg>
<seg id="284">Mr. Speaker, I would also like to recognize the Igloolik search and rescue team that met this week in Hall Beach and it’s now spring time. Please be safe to travel.</seg>
<seg id="285">With that being the case, Mr. Speaker, if you’re going to be travelling to SPOT, GPS-GPS-GPS-GPS, please ask your elders where I go.</seg>
<seg id="286">Those are the types of things.</seg>
<seg id="287">The reason why I rise today is to reiterate that the Department of Community and Government Services has only one snowmobile and has never received a response.</seg>
<seg id="288">I would like to urge the search and rescue organizations to provide more support.</seg>
<seg id="289">That’s it.</seg>
<seg id="290">The last name on the list, Member for South Baffin, Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="291">Member’s Statement 106 – 5(1): Bathurst Inlet Athletes (Joanasie)</seg>
<seg id="292">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="293">They’re going to be using the Sam Pudlat School and anyone else will be invited to participate in the music program or the songwriting program.</seg>
<seg id="294">I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the singers of the Bible for their excellent songs, and I would also like to thank them for being able to travel to Cape Dorset with the Canadian Art Gallery and for assisting the Hamlet of Cape Dorset.</seg>
<seg id="295">There are none.</seg>
<seg id="296">Member for Quttiktuq, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="297">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="298">I would like to recognize four visitors in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="299">I would first like to recognize Jenna Bourne, who is the director of parks in Nunavut, as well as Jenna Bourne, who works for me, along with our children, my wife, Carol Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="300">I would also like to thank my sister Naomi Kudluarok.</seg>
<seg id="301">She is here with us as she is our daughter and she is always going to school. I am very proud of her. Let’s welcome Jaden Natanine.</seg>
<seg id="302">I would like to elaborate a little bit on that.</seg>
<seg id="303">When I was a child, I was still a child….</seg>
<seg id="304">… I was expecting a seal for the first time in a lake.</seg>
<seg id="305">I don’t think there were too many lakes in the lake, but we were in the Sierra Island area.</seg>
<seg id="306">They were very helpful and they were my grandmother, who was my father.</seg>
<seg id="307">I would like to thank them very much for coming here.</seg>
<seg id="308">Mr. Uttak and your officials, welcome to the House.</seg>
<seg id="309">Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="310">Ms. Towtongie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="311">My parents in Ukkusiksalik are now a park. All of us were given photographs and I recognize them and we are grateful to our youngest children.</seg>
<seg id="312">I used to stay in Igloolik and Teresa Uttak gave me a cup of tea and Luis Uttak. I thank you for your excellent food and I will be billeting with you again.</seg>
<seg id="313">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="314">Welcome to the House.</seg>
<seg id="315">Member for Kugluktuk, Ms. Kamingoak.</seg>
<seg id="316">Mr. Kamingoak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="317">I would like to recognize Naomi Kudluarok and Carol Akeeagok, who are my family.</seg>
<seg id="318">Naomi from Grise Fiord, I don’t have family members on a daily basis.</seg>
<seg id="319">Welcome to your Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="320">Member for Pangnirtung, Ms. Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="321">Mr. Nakashuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would also like to recognize and congratulate my husband, Andrew Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="322">Welcome to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="323">Mr. Nakashuk, welcome to the House.</seg>
<seg id="324">Recognition of Visitors in the Gallery. I have no more names on my list.</seg>
<seg id="325">Let’s proceed with the orders of the day.</seg>
<seg id="326">We will begin with the Hon. Member for Iqaluit-Tasiluk, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="327">Question 123 – 5(1): Private Securities Bill (Hickes)</seg>
<seg id="328">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="329">My questions are for the Minister of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="330">I have asked my colleagues over the last couple of weeks and a couple of weeks to look at the training of security officers and to make sure that they’re getting a standardized training program.</seg>
<seg id="331">I would like to ask the minister if this government will be introducing legislation on wastewater.</seg>
<seg id="332">Minister of Justice, Minister Iqalukjuak.</seg>
<seg id="333">Hon. Jeannie Ugyuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) I thank Mr. Hickes for the question.</seg>
<seg id="334">As of today, the Government of Nunavut does not have any regulations for the security services.</seg>
<seg id="335">My department is aware of the company’s role in providing security services in our communities, such as health centres.</seg>
<seg id="336">We are currently reviewing the policy for the establishment of the Nunavut Business Credit Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="337">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="338">As the minister is saying, one of the last jurisdictions in Canada that don’t have a customer account, we want to make sure that they’re capable of responding with the appropriate level of expertise to provide that service.</seg>
<seg id="339">We have introduced legislation in all regions on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="340">My next question is: when they’re reviewing the policy, will there be a legislative proposal coming forward to the House?</seg>
<seg id="341">Minister Iqalukjuak.</seg>
<seg id="342">Hon. Jeannie Ugyuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Mr. Hickes, yes, we can work on developing policies or regulations for the NNI Policy.</seg>
<seg id="343">Your final supplementary, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="344">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="345">I also thank the minister for his willingness to work.</seg>
<seg id="346">Mr. Speaker, I would just like to take this opportunity to note that the Department of Justice is monitoring the RCMP. If the Washington Law Enforcement Division works with the Department of Community and Government Services to coordinate the contract, it should be a contract with the Government of Nunavut if they have a contract with Washington.</seg>
<seg id="347">Hon. Jeannie Ehaloak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="348">I don’t have that information in front of me, but I can look into it and get back to the member.</seg>
<seg id="349">Question 124 – 5(1): Status of Clean-up in Baker Lake (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="350">Mr. Mikkungwak (interpretation): Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="351">My questions are for the Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="352">I asked these questions to the minister last week about the contaminated site in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="353">In one of the responses to me, the minister indicated that the “final report” would be prepared and submitted to the Qulliq Energy Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="354">Will the minister commit to providing a copy of this report to both the hamlet council in Baker Lake and as the MLA for the community?</seg>
<seg id="355">Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation, Minister Cambridge Bay.</seg>
<seg id="356">Hon. Jeannie Ugyuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Yes, Mr. Mikkungwak, I can commit to doing that.</seg>
<seg id="357">Your first supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="358">I thank the minister for that commitment.</seg>
<seg id="359">One of the things that the minister rose to say is that the Qulliq Energy Corporation can work with the Municipality of Baker Lake to clean up the site. Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to share that information with the hamlet when I go back to the community next week and I will encourage the hamlet staff and the Qulliq Energy Corporation to meet with their officials.</seg>
<seg id="360">Mr. Speaker, I don’t think it’s possible that the Qulliq Energy Corporation’s storage facility is located in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="361">The minister indicated that the Qulliq Energy Corporation has already spent $1.68 million to date on cleanup.</seg>
<seg id="362">Can the minister clarify how much it would cost to clean up the remainder of the site?</seg>
<seg id="363">Minister Cambridge Bay.</seg>
<seg id="364">Hon. Jeannie Ehaloak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) The total cost of cleanup would be approximately $10 million to the power corporation for that type of funding. As I stated earlier, the damage was done after the creation of Nunavut and the federal government is responsible for the cleanup.</seg>
<seg id="365">We are committed to working with the Municipality of Baker Lake on the cleanup of the contaminated site.</seg>
<seg id="366">Your final supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="367">In regard to my question last week, the federal or territorial government hasn’t finalized the rates yet.</seg>
<seg id="368">Mr. Speaker, I am in favour of the Qulliq Energy Corporation’s position on the damages that it experienced when it was under the federal government’s responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="369">Will the Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation commit to working with the Minister of Justice to review and clarify the legal options that may be open to this issue?</seg>
<seg id="370">Hon. Jeannie Ehaloak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Yes, as the Minister of Energy and Justice, we will work together to resolve this issue.</seg>
<seg id="371">Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, Mr. Lightstone.</seg>
<seg id="372">Question 125 – 5(1): Early Childhood Policy (Lightstone)</seg>
<seg id="373">My questions are for the Minister responsible for the Public Service Act.</seg>
<seg id="374">In previous years the annual reports of the government’s public service indicated that a number of students were enrolled in educational leave programs.</seg>
<seg id="375">Unfortunately the 2016-17 annual report did not include that information.</seg>
<seg id="376">Can the minister provide the House with that information?</seg>
<seg id="377">Minister of Finance, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="378">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="379">The annual report that the member is referring to, I believe, is going to be tabled in the House every year.</seg>
<seg id="380">I can look into the member’s request and see if it’s going to be there.</seg>
<seg id="381">Your first supplementary, Mr. Lightstone.</seg>
<seg id="382">I would just like to ask the minister: can the minister provide the House with an update on how many employees were enrolled in the 2016-17 school year?</seg>
<seg id="383">Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="384">Speaker (interpretation): The question was taken as notice.</seg>
<seg id="385">Member for Pangnirtung, Mr. Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="386">Question 126 – 5(1): Status of Pangnirtung’s Old Health Centre (Nakasuk)</seg>
<seg id="387">Mr. Nakashuk (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="388">My questions today are for the Minister of Community and Government Services.</seg>
<seg id="389">I have asked the minister before about the old health centre in Pangnirtung. I’m sure we’re no longer using the old health centre after the new health centre was opened.</seg>
<seg id="390">The old health centre has not been occupied for a long time, but it remains closed.</seg>
<seg id="391">I would like to ask the minister what the plans are for the old health centre. I’m wondering if the minister is aware of what the plans are for the new health centre.</seg>
<seg id="392">Minister of Community and Government Services, Minister Kusugak.</seg>
<seg id="393">Hon. Paul Quassa (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="394">I also thank my colleague for that question.</seg>
<seg id="395">When buildings that were previously owned by the government are no longer being used, it becomes a question to the manager of the building to see if it would be used by other government departments.</seg>
<seg id="396">The old health centre was built in 1975 in Pangnirtung and that was the case.</seg>
<seg id="397">The Department of Health doesn’t want to use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="398">We did a series of consultations and we didn’t hear any requests for that.</seg>
<seg id="399">Following the government’s route, we are now planning to see if the hamlet would like to take over the building. That’s where we’re at right now.</seg>
<seg id="400">If they don’t want it, then we would have to go back to the non-profit community to make sure that they don’t want it.</seg>
<seg id="401">There are different avenues that are being disposed of by the government.</seg>
<seg id="402">That’s where we are at right now.</seg>
<seg id="403">Your first supplementary, Mr. Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="404">If I understand the question correctly, the communities have been asked if they would like to be taken into custody or what is the status of that?</seg>
<seg id="405">Hon. Paul Quassa (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="406">We haven’t heard from the government that they want it.</seg>
<seg id="407">At this time we are planning to see if the hamlet would be interested. We have reached that stage and we are planning to see if the hamlet would be interested.</seg>
<seg id="408">That’s where we’re at right now.</seg>
<seg id="409">Your final supplementary, Mr. Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="410">I also thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="411">I don’t know if the hamlet would want it, but if it can’t go ahead, what happens when the government buildings are no longer going to be used?</seg>
<seg id="412">I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="413">There are four main subjects that we use.</seg>
<seg id="414">For example, when the Pangnirtung Health Centre was no longer wanted by the Department of Health, we asked the other government departments if they wanted it.</seg>
<seg id="415">It wasn’t wanted, so we’re going to look into it to see if it’s a wish list for the hamlet.</seg>
<seg id="416">Those are the types of things that we use when we go through that process.</seg>
<seg id="417">Member for Aivilik, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="418">Question 127 – 5(1): Department of Family Services Travel Policy (Netser)</seg>
<seg id="419">Mr. Netser (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="420">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="421">I would first like to say “good afternoon” to them. Since I’ve been here, I didn’t say “good afternoon” and I say “good afternoon” to them.</seg>
<seg id="422">We’re going to be going home very soon.</seg>
<seg id="423">Mr. Speaker, it is regrettable that the most vulnerable people in Nunavut have to travel south for treatment and they are away from their families.</seg>
<seg id="424">I agree with the member that when you’re visiting one of the communities, it changes dramatically.</seg>
<seg id="425">The Department of Family Services’ Travel Policy on the government’s website dated June 2013 came into force on March 31, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="426">I was given to understand that the previous Minister of Family Services had agreed to change the family travel policy.</seg>
<seg id="427">Can the minister confirm if there have been any changes to the Department of Family Services’ Medical Travel Policy since 2013, and if not, will it change after March 31 of this year?</seg>
<seg id="428">Minister of Family Services, Mr. Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="429">Hon. Joe Savikataaq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="430">Mr. Speaker, I can’t speak for the previous minister, but I can say that the policy will be in place until the end of March 2018 and it will remain until the new policy is changed.</seg>
<seg id="431">I haven’t heard of any officials from the Department of Family Services looking at changing that policy.</seg>
<seg id="432">If there is a need to change, we can look at it and we can’t change it, but we have to look at it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="433">If there’s a need to change something that seems to be relevant to clients and the government can look at it.</seg>
<seg id="434">Your first supplementary, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="435">Mr. Netser (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="436">The Department of Family Services’ Medical Travel Policy states that an elder who is under the care of the Department of Family Services can be visited by two family members or guardians on an annual basis.</seg>
<seg id="437">Can the minister confirm whether or not the policy has been amended to allow for two visits per year?</seg>
<seg id="438">Two return tickets, two travel tickets, and one visit twice a year.</seg>
<seg id="439">Just to be clear, there are two returns, two return tickets per year for one client.</seg>
<seg id="440">Your final supplementary, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="441">Mr. Netser (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Will the minister commit to considering changes to family travel programs for elders who are in foster care?</seg>
<seg id="442">The policy will expire very soon, but at the end of the day we will have to review it, but I can’t commit to that right now before the review of the whole policy is done.</seg>
<seg id="443">I’m sure there will be a review of all the medical travel that the Department of Family Services pays for medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="444">We will have to work with the Department of Health to make sure that the policies are adhered to, but I can’t commit to anything else because the Medical Travel Policy will expire soon.</seg>
<seg id="445">Member for Netsilik, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="446">Question 128 – 5(1): Consultation with Office of the Department of Health (Qirngnuq)</seg>
<seg id="447">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="448">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Health.</seg>
<seg id="449">Mr. Speaker, from time to time a number of my constituents come to my office to ask for help with their medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="450">As the minister frequently tells us, even this week he issued a telephone call saying that Nunavummiut can contact the patient relations office if they have concerns.</seg>
<seg id="451">Mr. Speaker, the language and the place where you live, it is a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="452">Can the minister tell us what further steps the Office of Patient Relations can take to ensure that the Office of Patient Relations is notified?</seg>
<seg id="453">Minister of Health, Ms. Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="454">Hon. Pat Angnakak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="455">I understand your concern, but we do encourage people to call a toll-free number so that you can get a response right away.</seg>
<seg id="456">I don’t have that level of detail with me right now. There’s also an electronic device and a fax machine.</seg>
<seg id="457">Your first supplementary, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="458">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="459">Mr. Speaker, the Information and Privacy Commissioner has raised a number of concerns regarding privacy issues. I understand that there is a great need to address the issue of disclosure of personal information in the event of criminal activity.</seg>
<seg id="460">The Office of Patient Relations has a form that outlines any complaints or concerns that may be raised.</seg>
<seg id="461">However, if you don’t have a fax machine, you can’t send it on your own. You don’t have all the computers and you can’t send it to the computer.</seg>
<seg id="462">Can the minister clearly explain why the patient relations office should not be given a fax machine?</seg>
<seg id="463">An Hon. Member (interpretation): That’s a good question.</seg>
<seg id="464">Ms. Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="465">That’s a very good question.</seg>
<seg id="466">I think the reason is that the number of faxes is decreasing out there because of the advanced technologies that we have as a government, because we’re using more broadband than paper.</seg>
<seg id="467">According to my substantiation sheet, the government has a website at www.patientrelations @ gov.nu.ca. There are all health centres in the communities.</seg>
<seg id="468">If you want to send out a fax machine, you can send it out. There are government liaison officers in all the communities.</seg>
<seg id="469">They can be sent by fax to our headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="470">If the patient relations office doesn’t have a fax, I can look into that.</seg>
<seg id="471">Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="472">Question 129 – 5(1): Income Assistance Policies (Towtongie)</seg>
<seg id="473">Towtongie: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="474">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="475">Mr. Speaker, I would like to follow up on some of the questions that were asked by the member from Kugluktuk regarding income support.</seg>
<seg id="476">The minister indicated that the Income Assistance Program will be signed by the department. It’s part of the program selection process.</seg>
<seg id="477">Can the minister clarify how the search for a successful candidate will be conducted without a clear mandate?</seg>
<seg id="478">Minister of Family Services, Mr. Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="479">With respect to the report about enhancements to the selection process, it would be up to me if there’s no work to do, but sometimes they have a short job to do.</seg>
<seg id="480">If it’s appropriate for the department to go to the appropriate department, then it would be up to the appropriate department to do the work.</seg>
<seg id="481">Your first supplementary, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="482">Income support is a policy of the Government of Nunavut and not a policy of the Government of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="483">If it’s a policy like carvings, we wouldn’t be able to change it as MLAs.</seg>
<seg id="484">What I see in the absence of a role for a young person and when they’re in Taloyoak, and they’re asking for a name that doesn’t have a job every month, they’re doing that on a monthly basis, and it’s kind of a shame on them and it’s a shame on them because the income support client has dropped out of their pocket because they don’t have a job to do.</seg>
<seg id="485">Can the minister clearly describe what specific policies can be applied to Nunavut’s smaller communities?</seg>
<seg id="486">Right now it’s just a model that doesn’t apply to Nunavut or to the north.</seg>
<seg id="487">The policy is for all of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="488">It’s only used in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="489">The income assistance review was done and the changes were made to the policy.</seg>
<seg id="490">At this time the income support clients are still eligible for income support and the children’s benefits are removed from the Nunavut Income Support Program.</seg>
<seg id="491">When the contract was signed, I would like to see it again because I feel for them.</seg>
<seg id="492">If they don’t have a job to do, then they can’t get a job. However, the benefits have to be selective. However, this will be looked into further.</seg>
<seg id="493">Question 130 – 5(1): Mine Training Program (coming)</seg>
<seg id="494">Mr. Qiniq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="495">I rise today to direct my question to the Minister of Economic Development and Transportation.</seg>
<seg id="496">Mr. Speaker, I firmly believe that when mining companies are trying to develop and create jobs, they are responsible for the environment.</seg>
<seg id="497">I guess my question today will be on the subject of (interpretation ends) labour-intensive (interpretation) residential school programs.</seg>
<seg id="498">Last year you tabled your 2017-18 main estimates for the Department of Economic Development and Transportation, which included $200,000 in funding for the Nunavut Prospectors Program.</seg>
<seg id="499">Can the minister provide an example of how much money was spent in 2017-18?</seg>
<seg id="500">I hope I was understandable.</seg>
<seg id="501">Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Ms. Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="502">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="503">I also thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="504">What I can say is that it doesn’t have all the details on how it was spent.</seg>
<seg id="505">The department is working with the Department of Family Services, Nunavut Arctic College, the federal government, our mining industry, and Inuit organizations to develop a number of projects that will allow Nunavummiut to plan for opportunities in the mining sector. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="506">Your first supplementary, Mr. Qiniq.</seg>
<seg id="507">Mr. Qiniq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="508">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="509">Will the Department of Finance be increasing its budget or decreasing its budget for the 2018-19 fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="510">Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="511">I can’t respond to that question at this time, but I apologize if I can go back to the member’s question about the $200,000 that he was asking about.</seg>
<seg id="512">The Kitikmeot Corporation’s pre-trades training program was $61,000 for this program, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association’s Literacy Council for the Baffin region, $60,000 for the Arviat hamlet’s Career Development Program, and the $78,000 for the Motor Vehicles Program.</seg>
<seg id="513">Thank you for clarifying that for the member’s question.</seg>
<seg id="514">Mr. Speaker, as you will recall, last week I sent a delegation of mining companies to the Arctic Erie Mining Company.</seg>
<seg id="515">They will be working near Hall Beach this spring.</seg>
<seg id="516">I wonder if the minister and the Department of Economic Development can work with not only the Arctic Airports Division but also with the mining companies to see how they can learn more about the opportunities that are available to them in the High Arctic or to the High Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="517">Mr. Speaker, Hall Beach is a small community and there are going to be a lot of money available.</seg>
<seg id="518">You also stated that you will be supporting the mining companies.</seg>
<seg id="519">Mr. Speaker, my question is: will you be able to deal with the funding that you identified for Mary River?</seg>
<seg id="520">The Mary River project is in the Baffin region and they’re in the Kivalliq and they’re in the Kitikmeot.</seg>
<seg id="521">Are you going to be able to deal with that?</seg>
<seg id="522">As an example, if I wanted to have a higher profile, how would I be able to receive training and how would the Department of Economic Development and Transportation be able to provide assistance?</seg>
<seg id="523">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also thank the member for raising good questions because the Department of Economic Development and Transportation is not responsible for that.</seg>
<seg id="524">The Department of Education has a mine training coordinator and it’s also important to recognize that there are different levels of production that are being developed.</seg>
<seg id="525">Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="526">Oral Questions.</seg>
<seg id="527">Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Mike.</seg>
<seg id="528">Question 131 – 5(1): Support for Hospital Staff (Main)</seg>
<seg id="529">Mr. Mike (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="530">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Health.</seg>
<seg id="531">First of all I would like to say that my question is related to many communities, not just my community.</seg>
<seg id="532">I think it’s a challenge across the territory for nurses and nurses working at the health centre.</seg>
<seg id="533">Mr. Speaker, as the minister is aware, the reason is due to the lack of employment in the English language and the lack of employment in the English language.</seg>
<seg id="534">Due to the lack of staff, we don’t have enough staff to fill the positions due to the lack of staff.</seg>
<seg id="535">It’s obvious that it’s causing poverty. It’s obvious that it’s causing poverty.</seg>
<seg id="536">I hope I was understandable in Inuktitut, if I understood the question correctly.</seg>
<seg id="537">Let me say it in English. (interpretation ends) Mr. Speaker, the number of positions in the department is increasing.</seg>
<seg id="538">My question for the minister is this: can the minister tell us what steps his department has taken to provide additional support to health care staff in the communities who have a lot of work to do?</seg>
<seg id="539">Minister of Health, Ms. Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="540">I thank the member for that very important question.</seg>
<seg id="541">The issue of staffing at the hospital is very important and it’s something that we have been working very hard as a department to make sure that we don’t have enough staff at the health centre.</seg>
<seg id="542">I hope that’s the case, but we have a shortage.</seg>
<seg id="543">I do know that there’s a lot of tiredness in the nurses.</seg>
<seg id="544">The department tries to do what they can.</seg>
<seg id="545">That’s what we did recently in the communities. When we got tired of the nurse, we sent out more nurses to support the nurses.</seg>
<seg id="546">If that’s the case, then the nurse would send them out to the health centre in case there’s too much work to do.</seg>
<seg id="547">When a nurse goes on holidays or when a nurse is sick, we look at where we can get an escort from the community.</seg>
<seg id="548">We don’t want to see a decrease in the number of health care professionals in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="549">Your first supplementary, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="550">Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="551">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="552">I think we’re all concerned about the department’s staffing numbers. For example, in my community, it’s obvious that there are still too many vacant positions in the health centres.</seg>
<seg id="553">In the chart, 70 percent of the positions are vacant. Arviat is 44 percent vacant.</seg>
<seg id="554">I do know the challenge and it’s very challenging.</seg>
<seg id="555">I would now like to ask the minister if he can elaborate on the challenges that his department faces in overseeing the adequacy of staffing at community health centres when they are constantly busy.</seg>
<seg id="556">Ms. Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="557">We can’t retain them after 30 months. When they’re trained and they’re not new, it’s very stressful to get nurses in the communities.</seg>
<seg id="558">You have to take a look at that. Since it’s a community-based program, we have been working very hard to try to address it.</seg>
<seg id="559">Your final supplementary, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="560">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="561">If we can say otherwise, Mr. Speaker, we all know that there are problems in the communities. There is always a lot of work to be done and there is always a shortage of people working in the health centres.</seg>
<seg id="562">I would like to get clarification on exactly what is being done to address these problems in the communities. What is being done and what is being considered to address these problems in the communities?</seg>
<seg id="563">What is being done and what is being considered to ensure that our nurses and other health care professionals are supported by the department?</seg>
<seg id="564">Hon. Pat Angnakak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="565">I just want to be very clear, but I don’t have a list of things that are operational.</seg>
<seg id="566">For example, if we’re open for emergencies, they can’t make an appointment because of the size of the job that they’re supposed to do or if there’s too many nurses that go out on the land for whatever reason.</seg>
<seg id="567">In our department, as I said, trying to fill all the positions, it’s a challenge because we’re competing nationally.</seg>
<seg id="568">That’s what we’re trying to do. I know that they work with people from the north who are trained in the north, but not in the north, such as Manitoba.</seg>
<seg id="569">There are a number of different avenues that we try. I know that the Department of Health is very aware of the practices that our nurses are using.</seg>
<seg id="570">It’s not an easy thing to do, but it’s something that we have to continue to work on. If you have any ideas, I’ll let you know.</seg>
<seg id="571">Question 132 – 5(1): Insurance Policy on Public Property (Hickes)</seg>
<seg id="572">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="573">My questions are for the Minister of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="574">As we all know, Mr. Speaker, every community in Nunavut has a wide range of infrastructure, such as terminal buildings, health centres, schools, and office spaces.</seg>
<seg id="575">My question for the minister is: when it comes to insurance, does that amount of infrastructure go on a case-by-case basis or is it on a case-by-case basis?</seg>
<seg id="576">Minister of Finance, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="577">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="578">Each of our infrastructure has different policies and some don’t even have a policy. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="579">I recently saw in the media that in some of our communities another school was being burned down.</seg>
<seg id="580">The Department of Finance is trying to solve the issue of having a facility that is suitable for insurance. We learned that our own cost in Arctic Bay is $10 million.</seg>
<seg id="581">How will it affect the insurance company in the event of another school fire? (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="582">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Today the insurance premium has increased from $10 million to $20 million to $20 million for schools that have experienced fires.</seg>
<seg id="583">We continue to encourage the Department of Education and all of us to continue to push for these types of initiatives that are very costly, unfortunately, to be burned down.</seg>
<seg id="584">I think it’s something that we should try and demonstrate that we’re continuing to work on safety. We’re doing a better job of promoting that because our own costs are increasing and we’re getting our own insurance. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="585">I do understand the member’s question, but I’m afraid that we’re getting half the cost of insurance in the communities.</seg>
<seg id="586">I had a question.</seg>
<seg id="587">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="588">This will be the new $20 million for school fires.</seg>
<seg id="589">Schools and other buildings have to pay $1 million on their own.</seg>
<seg id="590">There are different things.</seg>
<seg id="591">I can’t say how many schools would have to burn down, but they are no longer covered.</seg>
<seg id="592">I hope that we don’t end up with a catastrophic catastrophe in this government and I appreciate the fact that we all have to continue to push for this because it’s a school for our children and for the public….</seg>
<seg id="593">It’s not just for schools and health centres. These are very important services that we provide.</seg>
<seg id="594">Any damage is a challenge for our clients and I encourage them to continue to push for these facilities.</seg>
<seg id="595">That’s a reminder.</seg>
<seg id="596">This is a public building where all students, the public, schools, health centres, and garages all belong to the public.</seg>
<seg id="597">I applaud the minister for tabling this document in the House. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="598">Question 133 – 5(1): Additional Curriculum for Baker Lake (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="599">My questions are for the Minister responsible for Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="600">Mr. Speaker, as the member mentioned in his Member’s Statement, as the fifth Legislative Assembly of Nunavut, we have a new opportunity to shape our territory into a brighter future.</seg>
<seg id="601">Can the minister tell the House if he can reopen this idea of establishing a university in your community in collaboration with the private sector and other stakeholders?</seg>
<seg id="602">Minister responsible for Nunavut Arctic College, Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="603">I also thank the Member for Baker Lake for that question.</seg>
<seg id="604">We put out an advertisement for different colleges outside of Nunavut and we started looking at how we can work together.</seg>
<seg id="605">Although we have heard of various organizations, such as Agnico Eagle, such as the University of Nunavut, we have heard that they want to create a Nunavut-specific program.</seg>
<seg id="606">We have wanted to move forward on that, but to date we have been trying to come up with an agreement with any outside of Nunavut Arctic College that we would like to work with.</seg>
<seg id="607">I think it’s very important that we provide funding for post-secondary education programs that are expanding from Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit to the Piqqusilirivvik program, such as paperwork for students who are trained at the university.</seg>
<seg id="608">I feel that Baker Lake would be a very good place to expand.</seg>
<seg id="609">Can the minister clarify whether or not his officials have been in contact with the board of governors of Nunavut Arctic College to come up with a vision of how to provide more opportunities for post-secondary education to be promoted to Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="610">Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="611">We’re looking forward to seeing more opportunities for Nunavummiut to take post-secondary education in their communities. We want to be able to promote that. We’re also paying more attention to the online learning opportunities that are available through that program.</seg>
<seg id="612">With respect to the member’s comment about the Piqqusilirivvik Cultural School, we are looking at how we can expand the programs.</seg>
<seg id="613">Yes, the college board will be involved, along with my officials, the president of Arctic College, and the vice-president of the college. They will be planning to move this forward.</seg>
<seg id="614">Your final supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="615">Mr. Mikkungwak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) I recognize that the previous government accepted the recommendation that Nunavut Arctic College should not be established at that time.</seg>
<seg id="616">Will the minister commit to getting back to the member and reporting back to the House on what he is aware of?</seg>
<seg id="617">Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="618">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thank Mr. Mikkungwak for the question.</seg>
<seg id="619">The option to build a university in Nunavut is a multi-faceted one.</seg>
<seg id="620">Agnico Eagle has been able to provide $5 million in funding for the construction of a new university.</seg>
<seg id="621">I believe there are ongoing discussions.</seg>
<seg id="622">At this time in the next four years, I don’t know if we’re going to want to go that route, but it’s going to be a feasibility study that will be done.</seg>
<seg id="623">Members, please note that the time for question period has expired.</seg>
<seg id="624">Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="625">Motion 015 – 5(1): Extension of Question Period (Main)</seg>
<seg id="626">Mr. Mike (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation ends) Pursuant to Rule 39(7), I move, seconded by the Hon. Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, that question period be extended. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="627">The motion is in order. To the principle of the bill.</seg>
<seg id="628">All those in favour of the motion, please raise your hand.</seg>
<seg id="629">All those opposed.</seg>
<seg id="630">As such, we have extended the time for oral questions for 30 minutes from now.</seg>
<seg id="631">Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Mike.</seg>
<seg id="632">Question 134 – 5(1): Grants and Contributions (Main)</seg>
<seg id="633">Mr. Main (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="634">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Environment.</seg>
<seg id="635">I rise today to ask about the Department of Environment’s harvester support programs and I would like to get clarification on how they benefit our hunters.</seg>
<seg id="636">Looking at the government’s main estimates for 2017-18, there are three main estimates.</seg>
<seg id="637">Let me say it in English so that I can be clear, there are three grants and contributions that the Department of Environment provides for disaster compensation, wildlife damage compensation, and sealskin assistance.</seg>
<seg id="638">The department has been allocated $150,000 for this fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="639">Mr. Speaker, I would first like to ask if the minister can clarify how the Department of Environment evaluates the effectiveness of these programs.</seg>
<seg id="640">Minister of Environment, Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="641">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="642">The auction was held three times a year and the auction was recently held in early March. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="643">Your first supplementary, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="644">I also thank the minister for his response on the sealskin issue.</seg>
<seg id="645">Mr. Speaker, information that has been brought to the House over the years is something that I really wanted to see and I think it’s something that the hunters have to look at.</seg>
<seg id="646">In 2011 the Department of Environment stated that the price of sealskins at auction was $800,000.</seg>
<seg id="647">In 2012 it was $1.1 million and in 2013 it was $1.04 million.</seg>
<seg id="648">Mr. Speaker, can the minister provide an update on the status of the sealskin program this year? I would like to hear the latest information from this current fiscal year or from last year on whether it still looks like a good economy.</seg>
<seg id="649">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="650">I can’t say where they are at right now because I don’t have the current bids in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="651">I can tell you that after the Aqsarniit Stock Exchange, the sales of sealskins will increase and I’m sure that will be the case at that time when we’re going to see the auction of sealskins. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="652">Your final supplementary, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="653">I also thank the minister.</seg>
<seg id="654">This will be my final question, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="655">The Department of Environment is considering whether or not it would be more beneficial for our hunters to receive more funding.</seg>
<seg id="656">With respect to fox pelts, we are well aware of them as Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="657">The funding that is used for one year is not enough, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="658">I think it’s too small.</seg>
<seg id="659">I would like to ask the minister if he agrees with me and if he can look into this further in the coming months.</seg>
<seg id="660">I agree with you and I look forward to bringing that forward to the House if you’re going to support the increase.</seg>
<seg id="661">Question 135 – 5(1): Compensation for Damage to Hunters and Trappers (Keyootak)</seg>
<seg id="662">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Environment.</seg>
<seg id="663">Mr. Speaker, as we all know in Nunavut, hunters are very damaged by polar bears and their cabins are damaged and their equipment is damaged by snowmobiles.</seg>
<seg id="664">Mr. Speaker, it is often compensated for damages, but it is very difficult to compensate those who have been damaged.</seg>
<seg id="665">Has the funding for damages or damages of property been expended this year?</seg>
<seg id="666">Minister of Environment, Ms. Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="667">I apologize. I didn’t hear all of them.</seg>
<seg id="668">Can he rephrase his question?</seg>
<seg id="669">Speaker (interpretation): Please repeat your first question, Mr. Keyootak.</seg>
<seg id="670">Our property, snowmobiles, and cabins are damaged by polar bears, especially when we are left behind.</seg>
<seg id="671">We all know that there are compensation programs for damages when we leave them behind.</seg>
<seg id="672">My question was: have these funds already been used for this year’s damages?</seg>
<seg id="673">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you for clarifying that.</seg>
<seg id="674">Minister of Environment, Ms. Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="675">Your first supplementary, Mr. Keyootak.</seg>
<seg id="676">The minister said that he would respond once he has that information.</seg>
<seg id="677">Can the minister indicate how much of that funding has been spent in the Kivalliq and Kitikmeot regions?</seg>
<seg id="678">Yes, I’ll give it to the regional offices.</seg>
<seg id="679">Question 136 – 5(1): Child and Early Childhood Services (Hickes)</seg>
<seg id="680">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Education.</seg>
<seg id="681">The Minister of Education stated this afternoon that all licensed child care facilities will be able to receive more licences depending on where they are located.</seg>
<seg id="682">How much of that is being considered for licensed child care?</seg>
<seg id="683">Minister responsible for the Nunavut Housing Corporation, Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="684">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="685">I thank Mr. Hickes for the question.</seg>
<seg id="686">The Department of Education’s executive committee approved a three-year agreement. Over the past three years it has broken down into four different categories.</seg>
<seg id="687">I would like you to clarify the amount, operations and maintenance total of $1.1 million per year, which is broken down by fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="688">That’s the number that I have.</seg>
<seg id="689">I thank the minister for clarifying that.</seg>
<seg id="690">Mr. Speaker, when I look at the Child Day Care Act in Nunavut, section 17 of the Early Childhood Education Act, it says that all staff who work on a day-to-day basis need adequate training. That’s one of the expectations.</seg>
<seg id="691">Mr. Speaker, I am aware that the Early Childhood Education Division is responsible for Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="692">How are they evaluating the effectiveness of their training?</seg>
<seg id="693">Hon. David Joanasie (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also thank Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="694">Training is part of the agreement that’s in place for a three-year period.</seg>
<seg id="695">It’s $1.1 million outside of operations and maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="696">We want to get more certified teachers for early childhood education.</seg>
<seg id="697">That’s one of the things that we’re looking at expanding on-the-job training, on-the-job training, and we’re looking forward to that in the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="698">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also thank the minister.</seg>
<seg id="699">I look forward to getting that information in the House.</seg>
<seg id="700">When I look at the staff at the daycare and the training that is provided, I always hear that when staff are trained, it seems like they’re more effective when they’re trained.</seg>
<seg id="701">I have also heard concerns that there are not enough salaries for daycare workers, but there are always fluctuations in the number of people working at the daycare.</seg>
<seg id="702">When we’re trying to create a standardized education system for our children, it’s very important that we keep our employees at the same level.</seg>
<seg id="703">This funding is to help daycare workers make better salaries so that they can work and stay in the community without having to work there.</seg>
<seg id="704">I agree with Mr. Hickes and I fully agree with him. We want to make sure that children are well prepared to go to school and to succeed in life before they enter the school system.</seg>
<seg id="705">That’s what we’re trying to do and we’re trying to support the daycare staff.</seg>
<seg id="706">One of the things that we have in the agreement is that if parents don’t increase their child care rates, I think we can work to make sure that the staff at the daycare are getting the appropriate level of care that they need.</seg>
<seg id="707">We’re still working on that right now and we’re looking at having daycare workers in all of Nunavut.</seg>

<seg id="709">Question 137 – 5(1): Inuit Employment in Government Contracts (Main)</seg>
<seg id="710">On Friday, March 16, I asked the Minister of Community and Government Services about the discussions that I had with the minister.</seg>
<seg id="711">There are a number of Inuit employees who are working within the government that will be working on the Inuit labour content.</seg>
<seg id="712">Mr. Speaker, both the minister and I seem to agree that he was in favour of increasing Inuit employment.</seg>
<seg id="713">This 20 percent is related to the construction of the (interpretation ends) Baffin Mamisarvik (interpretation) and the (interpretation ends) marine infrastructure (interpretation) in Iqaluit and Pond Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="714">If I understand correctly, the figures are 20 percent and 15 percent.</seg>
<seg id="715">Can the minister explain how the department will be able to revise its bid adjustments to increase the number of bid adjustments, and if so, I’m asking the minister if he has the authority to do that.</seg>
<seg id="716">Minister of Community and Government Services, Minister Kusugak.</seg>
<seg id="717">I think the member understands that when it’s done, Community and Government Services provides assistance to the departments that are going to be involved.</seg>
<seg id="718">If it’s going to be a marine facility, it’s under Economic Development and Transportation. If we’re talking about a correctional facility, it’s under the Department of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="719">We work with them to make sure that the contracts are being adhered to. We don’t operate them.</seg>
<seg id="720">We work with the departments and they try to figure out how many Inuit can be employed.</seg>
<seg id="721">We try to make sure that they don’t exceed the limit, but if they go over the limit, then they’re going to go down and they’re going to try to get the materials that they’re supposed to bring in and we’re working with the departments.</seg>
<seg id="722">I can’t say right now that after the tenders have been issued, I believe it’s impossible to change that at this time, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="723">That’s my question.</seg>
<seg id="724">If there are no changes to the NNI Policy, if there are no changes to the NNI Policy, then we would be able to provide more Inuit employment opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="725">Can the Department of Community and Government Services work on this?</seg>
<seg id="726">I hope I was understandable, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="727">Can the minister tell me, perhaps, to tell the House why employees from other communities wish to work during the construction season, employees from Nunavut can also receive the same benefits as employees from outside of Nunavut who receive the same benefits?</seg>
<seg id="728">Hon. Paul Quassa (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="729">I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="730">Mr. Speaker, the Nunavummi Nangminiqaqtunik Ikajuuti Policy provides that the contractor evaluates the factors and Inuit labour content of the NNI Policy:</seg>
<seg id="731">What they’re going to be doing;</seg>
<seg id="732">Inuit who are available to work according to their level of education;</seg>
<seg id="733">There are other community-based programs that can affect the availability of Inuit employment.</seg>
<seg id="734">Mr. Speaker, we encourage contractors in the communities to hire locally from the regional centres before they’re looking for staff from outside of the territory.</seg>
<seg id="735">That’s why we encourage people to come to Nunavut to look for employment.</seg>
<seg id="736">That’s what we encourage.</seg>
<seg id="737">Again, we work very closely with the client departments to make sure that we’re meeting those targets.</seg>
<seg id="738">Your first supplementary, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="739">Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. (interpretation) I also thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="740">This will be my last question. I would like to ask the minister if he would commit to working with his department on these major projects.</seg>
<seg id="741">Will the minister commit to working with his department to ensure that job opportunities are created and that Inuit are able to apply for jobs in construction projects from outside of the territory?</seg>
<seg id="742">Will the minister commit to ensuring that this opportunity will be taken into consideration for the benefit of Nunavummiut who have entered into the contract?</seg>
<seg id="743">I believe that the Government of Nunavut as a whole encourages the public to seek employment in Nunavut first.</seg>
<seg id="744">That’s how it’s always set up and we’re going to keep doing that.</seg>

<seg id="790">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) If I may, I would like to have officials join me at the witness table.</seg>
<seg id="791">Chairman (interpretation): Does the committee agree to let the minister’s staff go to the witness table?</seg>
<seg id="792">Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the witnesses in.</seg>
<seg id="793">Mr. Akeeagok, for the record, please introduce your officials. Please proceed with your opening comments.</seg>
<seg id="794">To my left is my Assistant Deputy Minister, Dawn Crowne.</seg>
<seg id="795">Mr. Chairman, thank you for appearing before the committee to present Bill 2, Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, 2018-19.</seg>
<seg id="796">This bill will become law. As a government, we are proposing to you to spend $491,804,000 between April 1, 2018 and June 30, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="797">Mr. Chairman, earlier this year the Minister of Finance has been here for the whole fiscal year, but we have just been sitting in the fifth Assembly and we’re still planning on what we’re going to be doing.</seg>
<seg id="798">With that being the case, for the 2018-19 fiscal year, we’re planning on doing all of the things that we’re going to do in the 2018-19 fiscal year. We’re going to be putting it in the eye for the spring sitting in May and June.</seg>
<seg id="799">To that end, Mr. Chairman, we have proposed interim appropriations to allow the department to fulfill its mandate to provide services to Nunavummiut in the coming months.</seg>
<seg id="800">It’s an issue of attendance and budgeting after this year’s general election.</seg>
<seg id="801">Mr. Chairman, all departments and territorial corporations have had the opportunity to review these interim appropriations. Our calculations are based on departmental spending and budget processes over the last four years.</seg>
<seg id="802">We are satisfied that this amount will be sufficient to administer the Legislative Assembly’s review and pass this year’s budget.</seg>
<seg id="803">The two main components of the bill are:</seg>
<seg id="804">$8.62 million for the Office of the Legislative Assembly;</seg>
<seg id="805">$11.66 million for the Department of Community and Government Services;</seg>
<seg id="806">$29.08 million for the Department of Finance;</seg>
<seg id="807">$49.1 million for the Department of Family Services;</seg>
<seg id="808">$32.44 million for the Department of Justice;</seg>
<seg id="809">$10.77 million for the Department of Culture and Heritage;</seg>
<seg id="810">$64.1 million for the Department of Education;</seg>
<seg id="811">$85.77 million for the Department of Health’s old office building;</seg>
<seg id="812">$8.32 million for the Department of Environment;</seg>
<seg id="813">$82.73 million for the Department of Community and Government Services’ old office building;</seg>
<seg id="814">$23.29 million for the Department of Economic Development and Transportation’s secretariat;</seg>
<seg id="815">$73.39 million for the Nunavut Housing Corporation; and</seg>
<seg id="816">$12.54 million for Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="817">Mr. Chairman, that concludes my opening comments.</seg>
<seg id="818">At this time if there are any questions or comments, the floor is now open.</seg>
<seg id="819">Do members have any general comments?</seg>
<seg id="820">Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="821">Ms. Towtongie: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="822">I was reading the Inuktitut copy. $32.44 million for the Department of Justice in Inuktitut is $32.44 million for the Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="823">There’s a difference between $8.62 million in Inuktitut and $8.62 million in Inuktitut for the Office of the Legislative Assembly or the Department of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="824">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Just for clarification, the Office of the Legislative Assembly is requesting $8.62 million and the Department of Justice is seeking $32.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="825">I’m sorry if it wasn’t translated properly. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="826">The English version is correct.</seg>
<seg id="827">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="828">That’s just a question. It’s not in the percentages, but it’s in the past and it’s in the past.</seg>
<seg id="829">I do know that there was a lot of negotiation on financial management, but the minister has indicated that there is a need for concrete changes to make sure that we’re providing the right programs and services to the people of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="830">It’s not going to have an impact, Mr. Chairman. It’s relevant to this bill because it’s having an impact.</seg>
<seg id="831">Have there been any changes to the way the funding is allocated for this upcoming fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="832">Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="833">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="834">To date there have been no significant changes to the operations and maintenance side of things, but I’m sure we will see the capital budget process in the fall. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="835">Are there any more general comments?</seg>
<seg id="836">I suggest to members that wherever possible you ask your detailed questions during the page-by-page review of the departmental estimates.</seg>
<seg id="837">If not, we will proceed with the clause-by-clause review.</seg>
<seg id="838">Go to Bill 2 in your white legislation binder.</seg>
<seg id="839">Bill 2, Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="840">Chairman (interpretation): Clause 2. Agreed?</seg>
<seg id="841">Chairman (interpretation): Go to Schedule on page 2. It’s on page 3. Schedule. Supplementary Amounts Appropriated for the Fiscal Year Ending April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="842">Vote 1: Operations and Maintenance. Total Operations and Maintenance, to be Voted. $491,804,000.</seg>
<seg id="843">Thank you, Mr. Main. Do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="844">Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="845">I think I should have brought this up earlier, but I have a question on departmental grants and contributions.</seg>
<seg id="846">It’s my understanding that the numbers are based on a percentage of the annual amount, but some of the grants and contributions that are provided are already in use. These are for the whole year, as soon as April 1.</seg>
<seg id="847">I just want to get a little bit more clarification on the grants and contributions programs or the Nunavut Housing Corporation. How is that handled when the funding is not for a whole year, but some of the programs are run on an annual basis?</seg>
<seg id="848">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="849">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): That’s a good question.</seg>
<seg id="850">In your opening comments, I’m looking at some of the first three months of grants and contributions, as I mentioned earlier.</seg>
<seg id="851">I can say that the Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation are one of the biggest projects that you see here. The grants and contributions are for operations and maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="852">If it’s a request, if it’s a request, then the departments have different processes and that’s what we’ve had over the last four years. All departments have their spending on a quarterly basis. The Department of Finance looks at that and they come to an agreement with the departments on how their grants and contributions are administered.</seg>
<seg id="853">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="854">I guess my next question would be: can the minister tell us if there are any suspensions or are they just going to go through the normal process?</seg>
<seg id="855">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="856">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="857">Hopefully, tomorrow, when we look at our future budget, we can put that in place in the Fifth Assembly. We have been given direction from the departments and the ministers. We’re going to be doing the same thing for the next three months. In May we’re going to be looking at those projects again.</seg>
<seg id="858">Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="859">I’m sorry. Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="860">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to welcome the minister and his officials.</seg>
<seg id="861">In the main estimates, it’s $491,804,000 above the breakdown.</seg>
<seg id="862">First of all, for example, in the bill there is $8,623,000. In your opening comments the minister mentioned $8.26 million.</seg>
<seg id="863">It’s not $3,000, but the total amount is $54,000.</seg>
<seg id="864">What is the reason for that?</seg>
<seg id="865">I would like clarification on that.</seg>
<seg id="866">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="867">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="868">We’re on page 3 of the bill. We’re trying to get the actual numbers approved.</seg>
<seg id="869">That’s the actual number.</seg>
<seg id="870">As I stated earlier, I have only decreased the numbers in English to try to get them closer to the main estimates. I have stated that I don’t want to repeat all the numbers, but we have reduced the numbers.</seg>
<seg id="871">The numbers that we’re looking at in the bill are very good, but they don’t necessarily call it all.</seg>
<seg id="872">Total Appropriation. $491,804,000. Agreed?</seg>
<seg id="873">Clause 5. Do you agree?</seg>
<seg id="874">Chairman (interpretation): Do members agree to Bill 2 as a whole?</seg>
<seg id="875">Do members agree, pursuant to Rule 62(2), that Bill 2 can immediately be placed on the orders of the day for third reading?</seg>
<seg id="876">Minister Akeeagok, do you have any closing comments?</seg>
<seg id="877">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would just like to thank my officials for being prepared to make this government operational until June.</seg>
<seg id="878">I thank you very much and all members for your support in approving this funding. I look forward to sitting in this House when we deal with all of our finances in May and June.</seg>
<seg id="879">I thank all of you.</seg>
<seg id="880">Bill 2 is concluded.</seg>
<seg id="881">I would now like to ask the minister if we can proceed with his opening comments on Bill 3.</seg>
<seg id="882">Bill 03 – Supplementary Appropriation (Operations &amp; Maintenance) Act, No. 3, 2017-2018 – Consideration in Committee</seg>
<seg id="883">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="884">My officials will remain at the witness table and I would like to make sure that as soon as we get to the other department, I will be able to provide an invitation to the witness table, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="885">Mr. Chairman, can I begin my opening comments?</seg>
<seg id="886">I am pleased to appear before you today to present Bill 3, Supplementary Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, 2017-2018, No. 3. Through this bill, the government is seeking an increase of $56,602,000 for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="887">$49 million to the Department of Health for overspending on medical travel, medical travel, psychiatric treatment, long-term care, elder care, hospital physician services, and tuberculosis screening;</seg>
<seg id="888">$6.2 million to the Department of Justice to cover the over-expenditures of the RCMP, Corrections and Justice; and</seg>
<seg id="889">$1.402 million in over-expenditures for child and family services and banking services.</seg>
<seg id="890">Mr. Chairman, that concludes my opening comments. I would be pleased to provide you with any questions or comments you may have.</seg>
<seg id="891">Are there any general comments?</seg>
<seg id="892">Supplementary Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) 2017-18, No. 3. Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="893">Total Children and Family Services. $1,402,000.</seg>
<seg id="894">When I saw that number, it’s not clear to me exactly where you’re focusing on.</seg>
<seg id="895">Mr. Savikataaq, if you can respond to that question, Hon. Joe Savikataaq: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="896">Hon. David Savikataaq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="897">I don’t have the breakdown of how many there are, but there are two of them. We send more people to residential care outside of the territory and we have increased the number of people visiting outside of the territory.</seg>
<seg id="898">For example, there is an elder from Igloolik and I’m not sure which community they’re in, but they’re in Ottawa so that they can visit.</seg>
<seg id="899">They’re not assisted by the Department of Family Services. They’re just some of the people that we visit.</seg>
<seg id="900">Most of the people that are sent out of the territory are not eligible for assistance in Nunavut. As I had mentioned earlier, there are more people visiting in the communities.</seg>
<seg id="901">When we were compiling all of the elders’ programs, did the Department of Family Services bring the elders’ care back to the Department of Health?</seg>
<seg id="902">Some of the things that the minister mentioned are not directly under the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="903">Some of the elders are in the care of the Department of Health, but when some of them want to visit, there is funding available through the Department of Family Services for medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="904">That’s one of the examples I used. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="905">I do understand that some of the clients have to be visited by the Department of Family Services because the money is in the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="906">My question is: are there still elders who are receiving social assistance that have not been transferred to the Department of Health?</seg>
<seg id="907">Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="908">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) According to the information that I have, the information that was transferred to the Department of Health has been transferred to the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="909">Those who are not transferred to the Department of Health are still under the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="910">I’m just wondering if there are any other non-transfer programs that the Department of Family Services is looking at. I’m just looking at the information and looking at our business plan, I think they’re all being transferred over. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="911">Maybe I’m a little confused, but if the Minister of Family Services can clarify that for me, I would appreciate it.</seg>
<seg id="912">It’s up to Minister Akeeagok to respond to another question.</seg>
<seg id="913">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="914">I thought the question was: are there still people in the Department of Health that still need to be in the Department of Family Services?</seg>
<seg id="915">The answer I gave was that the Department of Health is in there right now, but the seniors’ programs are in there.</seg>
<seg id="916">We’re still under Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="917">The main estimates are for the Department of Family Services. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="918">I thank the minister for clarifying that.</seg>
<seg id="919">I understand better now.</seg>
<seg id="920">Maybe I’ll ask a different question in a clearer way.</seg>
<seg id="921">Does the Department of Family Services still have elders to deal with?</seg>
<seg id="922">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) There are still programs available for seniors, but I would like the Minister of Family Services to clarify that.</seg>
<seg id="923">I am aware of the government’s programs for seniors’ fuel subsidy programs, the Senior Citizens’ Assistance Program, and the Department of Family Services that are over 60 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="924">If I skipped, Minister Savikataaq can help me answer that question. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="925">I thank both ministers for clarifying that.</seg>
<seg id="926">This will be my last question.</seg>
<seg id="927">When people are sent outside of Nunavut, are they still eligible for income support?</seg>
<seg id="928">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Through you, I would like Minister Savikataaq to respond to that question. (interpretation ends) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="929">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="930">It varies depending on the circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="931">Sometimes they’re eligible for income support, but I can’t say that all of them are the same.</seg>
<seg id="932">I have a detailed question for the department.</seg>
<seg id="933">They have indicated that they’re going to be donating money from other departments.</seg>
<seg id="934">As it stands right now, does the other departments here support all Nunavummiut?</seg>
<seg id="935">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="936">In addition to the Department of Family Services, almost all of these positions were transferred to the Department of Health’s Income Assistance Program.</seg>
<seg id="937">They’re not really subsidized. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="938">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="939">When do you identify when you’re going to be in a deficit situation and how do you deal with that deficit?</seg>
<seg id="940">I don’t know if this has an impact on our proceedings, but Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="941">The department reports on a monthly basis and at the end of the fiscal year it’s a little over budget. If we can’t do that, then we have to go through a supplementary appropriation.</seg>
<seg id="942">We’re on page 4.</seg>
<seg id="943">Mr. Man.</seg>
<seg id="944">The document before us indicates that the number of people in residential care is increasing. The number of people in residential care was 189 and 243.</seg>
<seg id="945">Do you anticipate that this number will increase?</seg>
<seg id="946">What is the reason for the increase in the number of people requiring care?</seg>
<seg id="947">Do you know what the reasons are for the increase in the number of people requiring care?</seg>
<seg id="948">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) The number of clients in 2013 was steadily increasing.</seg>
<seg id="949">The numbers are changing over the years, so I’m just wondering if that will be included in this budget right now. Starting from last year’s main estimates, I don’t want to be approving a supplementary appropriation to make sure that you have a correct budget.</seg>
<seg id="950">Will that be included in the growth plan?</seg>
<seg id="951">As we go through each of these pages, it’s going to be very noticeable that we’re going to be talking about some of the changes that we’re making when we’re not keeping up with our budget. We’re going to be looking at our budget.</seg>
<seg id="952">We’re going to have questions when we’re dealing with the main estimates. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="953">In the substantiation sheets that were provided by the department, there is a surplus.</seg>
<seg id="954">It also mentions the department’s recent reforms to the Income Assistance Program.</seg>
<seg id="955">Can the minister confirm if any of the surpluses that were left over by the Department of paperwork have been eliminated by income support staff or will more money be allocated to income support clients?</seg>
<seg id="956">Which increase did you increase?</seg>
<seg id="957">I’m trying to understand where the surplus was spent. Where was that spent?</seg>
<seg id="958">Is the paperwork being repaid or is the income support money being increased? Where did the surplus go?</seg>
<seg id="959">Chairman: Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="960">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) There are a number of reasons for the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="961">Some of these positions were hired to coordinate the transfer of responsibilities from one department to another, but some of them were hired to determine who they are, what they are, and how they work.</seg>
<seg id="962">The government’s response to the member’s question was that they send people out of the territory for residential care.</seg>
<seg id="963">There are a number of reasons why the Department of Family Services has reached a budget deficit this fiscal year. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="964">I’ll leave it at that.</seg>
<seg id="965">This information indicates that the department spends more money on income support than in its main estimates, which is a sign that more money is being spent on income support.</seg>
<seg id="966">Will the money be spent on staff housing or will it be spent on income support?</seg>
<seg id="967">My colleague, Minister Savikataaq, can respond to that question better.</seg>
<seg id="968">Mr. Savikataaq, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="969">The income assistance reforms have a significant impact on this funding. I can use this as an example.</seg>
<seg id="970">The Child Benefit Supplement is based on income and income support.</seg>
<seg id="971">That’s not going to be the case now. The income support clients will get more money because the income support clients are no longer deducted from their income support.</seg>
<seg id="972">We’re on Total Children and Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="973">Not Previously Authorized. $1,402,000.</seg>
<seg id="974">Justice. Operations and Maintenance. Not Previously Authorized.</seg>
<seg id="975">Total Justice. $2,600,000.</seg>
<seg id="976">Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="977">Mr. Netser (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="978">Welcome, minister.</seg>
<seg id="979">What I’m trying to get at here is: is there a plan for the purchase of new drugs? Is there a plan to change the legislation for marijuana from the federal government this coming summer?</seg>
<seg id="980">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Mr. Chairman, I would like to have my Deputy Minister of Justice go to the witness table and remove my deputy minister from the witness table, so I’ll first respond to the member’s question.</seg>
<seg id="981">Does the committee agree to bring in the witnesses?</seg>
<seg id="982">Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the witnesses out.</seg>
<seg id="983">For the record, Mr. Akeeagok, please introduce your witness.</seg>
<seg id="984">To my left is the Deputy Minister of Justice, Bill MacKay.</seg>
<seg id="985">If it’s okay with you, I would like to respond to the question.</seg>
<seg id="986">Mr. Chairman, that’s a very good question from the Department of Justice regarding the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="987">This is not for marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="988">We don’t want the drugs that are prescribed in Canada to come into Nunavut, but these are new drugs that we need to learn and implement.</seg>
<seg id="989">In December, during the finance ministers’ meeting, the funding that will be allocated to marijuana will be 25 percent of the funding from the federal government for the RCMP to conduct investigations into drug smuggling.</seg>
<seg id="990">That’s a two-part process.</seg>
<seg id="991">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="992">My next question is in regard to the high cost of housing in the communities.</seg>
<seg id="993">Can the minister explain why this funding is included in this budget?</seg>
<seg id="994">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="995">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) It’s related to the RCMP getting nine more RCMP officers in different communities and that’s why they provide staff housing.</seg>
<seg id="996">When we have more RCMP officers, we have to go through government contracts to get housing. The additional costs were $300,000. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="997">Mr. Main, did you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="998">Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="999">The minister talked about the $2.6 million breakdown of the $300,000 for housing.</seg>
<seg id="1000">Can you elaborate a little bit more on that?</seg>
<seg id="1001">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1002">I would like to direct my question to the minister and his officials.</seg>
<seg id="1003">Those are the numbers.</seg>
<seg id="1004">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1005">I also thank the minister.</seg>
<seg id="1006">I wonder why these vehicles were not expected to be sold.</seg>
<seg id="1007">I believe it should have been included in this budget, if I understood the question correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1008">What was the reason for the purchase of new vehicles?</seg>
<seg id="1009">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. That’s a good question.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The $1 million is for vehicle replacement.</seg>
<seg id="1011">We do have a contract with the RCMP to determine what they need to acquire and what they need to acquire.</seg>
<seg id="1012">Last year the vehicles were not replaced due to the lack of funding.</seg>
<seg id="1013">However, this year the vehicles were damaged due to the fact that they were getting what they needed.</seg>
<seg id="1014">That’s why it has gone up quite a bit this year.</seg>
<seg id="1015">However, the equipment is deteriorating and that’s how it is set up.</seg>
<seg id="1016">Under the contract with the RCMP, they’re buying the beer and wine store. We don’t always talk to each other about that.</seg>
<seg id="1017">However, when we talk to them about budgeting, they tend to come to an agreement and that’s why it has gone up.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Mr. Main (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1019">It also states here that my colleague is talking about that.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I’m referring to the new drugs. I believe they’re the most dangerous drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1021">Will this equipment be made available to all the communities or will it be made available to all the communities?</seg>
<seg id="1022">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Yes, all the RCMP officers will be receiving this for all the communities.</seg>
<seg id="1023">That’s the new equipment that’s being used to track police officers and people that may be in that situation. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1024">If there are any new drugs that are dangerous in the communities, has the RCMP found any tea in the communities to date?</seg>
<seg id="1025">Yes, it’s very sad to see people coming into our communities and I hope that we will stop there.</seg>
<seg id="1026">Nonetheless, two communities have been affected by the increase in the number of cases in Canada and the number of cases in the Northwest Territories has increased dramatically.</seg>
<seg id="1027">It’s very dangerous and I’m afraid that the people who are going to be trying to get drugs are going to be taking drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1028">If you don’t do that, it’s more fun to do that, but the results are dangerous and I applaud the RCMP for preparing for that.</seg>
<seg id="1029">Mr. Main: I thought I was done.</seg>
<seg id="1030">That’s my last question.</seg>
<seg id="1031">In regard to the lack of housing in the communities in Nunavut, I wonder if you can clarify that for me.</seg>
<seg id="1032">According to the documents that we have provided, there have been nine additional RCMP officers in nine or six communities across Nunavut that have been decentralized to various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1033">That was just a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1034">Moving on, Mr. Hickes, do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the $2.6 million that you’re requesting, it talks about interpreters going to court. You said that you had to get seven judges from the court.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Right now there are a number of interpretive services that are available when it comes to hiring.</seg>
<seg id="1037">I’ll just leave it at that. In his opening comments he talks about the need for new telephones to be installed and to continue with the old system.</seg>
<seg id="1038">When we know that they’re going to have to replace their current mobile devices, will they be allocating funding for new ones or will they be requesting additional funding once they know that number is coming from the RCMP?</seg>
<seg id="1039">Yes, it’s in the planning stages for the department. The funding that we will be requesting will be used for that purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1040">One of the things that my colleague has talked about is the marijuana testing program. It’s being planned, but nobody here is asking for additional funding for marijuana. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Within the other correctional facilities, it talks about overtime. It talks about having a full-time employee at the Baffin Correctional Centre. What is the maximum number of full-time staff at the Baffin Correctional Centre?</seg>
<seg id="1042">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) Item 8. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1043">Did he say that there were eight?</seg>
<seg id="1044">Mr. Hickes (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My next question is in regard to the information that was provided to me by the Overtime Division, it says here that when the Baffin Correctional Centre is in a blizzard, it’s $180 thousand. I’m just wondering if there are any positions that are wrong, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Can the minister clarify that for me?</seg>
<seg id="1046">Through you, I would like my Deputy Minister, Mr. MacKay, to respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1047">Mr. MacKay: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1048">There are a lot of security staff that work in the community. If it’s weather-related, they have to stay there. That’s part of the overtime costs.</seg>
<seg id="1049">When there’s a blizzard, they can’t go home. When the staff say that they’re going to work again, do they double the number of people that are working in the blizzard?</seg>
<seg id="1050">Mr. MacKay, can you clarify that?</seg>
<seg id="1051">There are a couple of different things that we do. If there’s a blizzard or a blizzard, they’re automatically brought in, but there are only two staff that are involved in the blizzard.</seg>
<seg id="1052">Mr. Lightstone.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Mr. Lightfoot: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1054">My questions are for the Minister of Justice. First of all, the RCMP has indicated that they will need housing for the next nine RCMP officers.</seg>
<seg id="1055">When you get the RCMP, do they have staff housing in each community?</seg>
<seg id="1056">I’m happy to say that one of my staff members, who was just a hockey player, was a surrogate to one of his staff. I’m sure he’s going to recover, but I’m sure my deputy minister can’t write a letter.</seg>
<seg id="1057">There will have to be a entrance.</seg>
<seg id="1058">My question is in regard to the nine RCMP officers, they get housing from the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="1059">As I stated earlier, we work with the RCMP on different contracts.</seg>
<seg id="1060">I want to make it very clear that 70 percent of the cost to the RCMP is paid by the Government of Nunavut and 30 percent is paid by the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="1061">The RCMP is contracted by the federal government. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1062">Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1063">I’m just wondering: will the RCMP provide housing for all RCMP officers?</seg>
<seg id="1064">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1065">That’s how they operate in a unique way because they don’t allow their RCMP officers to stay on the land.</seg>
<seg id="1066">They don’t think they’re going to get their own house all the time in the community, but depending on how many RCMP officers they’re going to need in the community, they’re given housing on their own.</seg>
<seg id="1067">That’s where the RCMP operates on a unique basis.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When they identify the need for new RCMP officers in each community, they try to include all 25 communities as soon as possible. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1069">It’s unfortunate that the RCMP does not try to integrate the communities into the communities.</seg>
<seg id="1070">When the RCMP gets their own home, how do they subsidize it?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Lightstone.</seg>
<seg id="1072">I don’t think anyone should be asking questions like that.</seg>
<seg id="1073">I don’t think we should expect them to get their own housing, but that’s why they’re provided housing.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Mr. Akeeagok, it’s up to you to speak.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1076">That was a very good comment, Mr. Chairman, and it’s a very good comment.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Yes, the RCMP, even though they have been in the community for three years, has been raising the community.</seg>
<seg id="1078">If the RCMP wanted to get housing, they would have to apply for housing from the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="1079">It’s not our department. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1080">This will be my last question in regard to the RCMP, how much of that contract was awarded to the RCMP?</seg>
<seg id="1081">It’s in the bill on page 5. (interpretation ends) Clause 40,071,000.</seg>
<seg id="1082">If approved, it will be $42,671,000 for this contract for 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1083">Thank you for that clarification.</seg>
<seg id="1084">Moving on to the third area, the Corrections Division is overtime and casuals.</seg>
<seg id="1085">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you very much. Mr. Lightstone, we’re just here for Law Enforcement. We haven’t got there yet. Can you wait a moment for your question?</seg>
<seg id="1086">At this time we’re asking questions about law enforcement, but if there are any further questions on that.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Mr. Lightfoot: Yes, the last one is for law enforcement.</seg>
<seg id="1088">According to the minister’s letter, the total amount of funding was $40 million, which is actually $30 million, and it’s projected to increase to $42 million.</seg>
<seg id="1089">How does the department anticipate spending $42 million towards the end of this fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="1090">If I can ask the member, I don’t know which numbers he is referring to.</seg>
<seg id="1091">If there’s a figure, I would like to get a little bit of help right now. The letter that I sent on Friday, I think I found the $30 million, but if you can elaborate a little bit more on that.</seg>
<seg id="1092">A letter dated March 16 to the Chair of the Regular Members’ Caucus addressed to the Minister of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="1093">The document that I’m referring to is on page 4. It’s five.</seg>
<seg id="1094">I would also like to thank the member for asking about the contents of the document that we tabled.</seg>
<seg id="1095">The $30 million for this fiscal year has been spent at $30 million and the planned budget is $42 million.</seg>
<seg id="1096">They have a report on how they’re going to be using the RCMP and how much they’re going to spend on that. We have requested $2.6 million for that. We’re following the RCMP numbers and that’s why I wrote that letter.</seg>
<seg id="1097">I’m looking at $2.6 million in the substantiation sheet for Action 1, which indicates that “The RCMP operates under the influence of radios that can no longer be used in the past.”</seg>
<seg id="1098">The standing committee notes that the Legislative Assembly is proposing to revise the management structure. However, due to its uniqueness of the system, it requires an additional $2.6 million to cover the costs of its employees’ training to hire additional staff and to address departmental circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The member talks about the $2.6 million for employee retirement and casual salaries. At the same time the $2.6 million is being announced and it’s being used as a reclassified radio.</seg>
<seg id="1100">Can you clarify that for me, Mr. Chairman?</seg>
<seg id="1101">I know one of my colleagues had already asked that question, but Mr. Akeeagok, if you want to elaborate further, it’s up to you to do so.</seg>
<seg id="1102">The breakdown that I mentioned earlier, if you look at it, there’s another breakdown. Project 3, $2.6 million, and then there’s another $2.6 million for corrections.</seg>
<seg id="1103">There are two separate projects. It’s $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1104">The RCMP’s need for radios, the need for housing, the need for vehicles, and the circumstances that led to the emergencies. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1105">I also thank Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="1106">If we’re talking about $2.6 million in total, how much of that is? I don’t understand that. Can you clarify that for me?</seg>
<seg id="1107">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="1108">On page 5 of our business plan, Legal Services, we’re dealing with $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1109">We’re not working on that right now. We’re on $2.6 million for law enforcement.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Do you have any questions?</seg>
<seg id="1111">Ms. Towtongie: Thank you for clarifying that.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When I read the Inuktitut version, it’s in the English version. It’s in the Inuktitut version. It’s in the main estimates, but it’s in the Inuktitut version.</seg>
<seg id="1113">Can the minister clearly explain what that means? Is it the main estimates or the main estimates for 2017-18?</seg>
<seg id="1114">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1115">To my right is not approved, but we’re still in the 2017-18 fiscal year and you’re anticipating that it will be able to go a little bit further than that. That’s why we’re seeking approval from the Legislative Assembly for supplementary appropriations to the Department of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1116">A total of $6.2 million, of which $2.6 million is for the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="1117">That’s what we’re requesting from you in the House. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1118">I was just confused because it sounds like there’s an estimate in the Inuktitut version, but it’s an estimate.</seg>
<seg id="1119">I almost understood my question, but I’m done.</seg>
<seg id="1120">We’re on Law Enforcement. $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Next name on the list. Total Registries and Court Services. $1 million.</seg>
<seg id="1122">Total Justice. Corrections. $2,600,000.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1124">My question is in regard to corrections, it’s an annual budget that goes over budget. If memory serves me correctly, it’s just overtime.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Am I correct?</seg>
<seg id="1126">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1127">The member is correct that the maximum amount is overtime and casual employees.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1129">If my memory serves me right now, the Corrections Division offers 12 hours of service. Is that correct?</seg>
<seg id="1130">Now that the correctional facilities are full and they’re overtime, has the department considered having three or eight hours of work, so that’s why it wouldn’t be possible to do that?</seg>
<seg id="1131">Perhaps through you, my Deputy Minister, Mr. MacKay, can respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The member is correct. They work 12 hours a day.</seg>
<seg id="1133">That’s how it’s set up. It’s a two-hour shift, 42-hour shift. It’s a two-hour shift and it’s going to take 42 hours a day to complete the shift.</seg>
<seg id="1134">As a result of the agreement, the overtime amount decreased to $4 million and now it’s $2.49 million.</seg>
<seg id="1135">As a result, the Corrections Division’s deficit was $4.5 million to $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1136">We are moving forward with the overtime and we will continue to do that.</seg>
<seg id="1137">I’m reminding you to have your cellphones micromanaged and quiet.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1139">They travel overtime and they work 42 hours a week.</seg>
<seg id="1140">Do employees work 50 or 60 hours a week?</seg>
<seg id="1141">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1142">It’s too detailed, so we have to provide it to the House and we will provide it to the member in writing.</seg>
<seg id="1143">My deputy minister can’t answer that question.</seg>
<seg id="1144">We don’t have that information with us.</seg>
<seg id="1145">I don’t know what level of information is required for the operations of the facility.</seg>
<seg id="1146">I would like to ask these questions.</seg>
<seg id="1147">What kind of training are they provided?</seg>
<seg id="1148">Through you, I would like my Deputy Minister, Mr. MacKay to respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1149">In response to that question, I believe I responded by saying that it’s for training and training. It’s for the supplementary appropriation under the Corrections Division.</seg>
<seg id="1150">At this time we don’t have any training programs.</seg>
<seg id="1151">We have a trainer that is contracted out and that’s one of the costs that we have to pay for overtime and other things that we have to replace them with other things that increase the cost of teaching.</seg>
<seg id="1152">We’re also looking at other ways to better prepare the budget so that we can have more staff in corrections and court staff trained so that we don’t have more contractors.</seg>
<seg id="1153">Ms. Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="1154">I was curious to find out about the $2.6 million that was talked about and the staff training.</seg>
<seg id="1155">What types of training will be provided to employees and casuals?</seg>
<seg id="1156">Both the Corrections Division and the Court of Justice provide training on casual and relief workers.</seg>
<seg id="1157">They’re trained for a number of weeks, for example, arbitration and dispute resolution. They’re trained by a contractor, but they’re trained for a number of weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1158">Can the minister tell us what kinds of programs and services are available at the correctional facilities? I don’t need to ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="1159">I don’t know if they have that level of detail with me, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="1160">Through you, Deputy Minister MacKay, I don’t know what they’re doing at the high level, but he can elaborate a little bit on that if you will allow.</seg>
<seg id="1161">Ms. MacKay.</seg>
<seg id="1162">I don’t have the numbers in front of me, but I can get back to the member on what kind of training is provided to inmates.</seg>
<seg id="1163">Depending on which of the safest offenders are in Iqaluit, there is a pre-trades training program that will allow them to work in the correctional facilities and to train people to work in the correctional facilities after they have completed their internship.</seg>
<seg id="1164">We also have Akausisarvik, which is a program for each inmate based on their needs. There are addictions counselling services that are provided at the facility, anger counselling, counselling, and counselling services that are provided to the inmate, depending on what the client needs, what the client needs, and what the inmate needs.</seg>
<seg id="1165">Even though they can’t leave the correctional facility, they’re trained to work in jail and then they’re able to graduate from high school and then they’re offered trades training in the jail.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The Rankin Inlet Correctional Centre offers a number of programs and services to inmates.</seg>
<seg id="1167">There are different programs that we provide.</seg>
<seg id="1168">Mr. Nakashuk: I’m done.</seg>
<seg id="1169">We’re on page 5.</seg>

<seg id="1174">Mr. Akeeagok, would you like to make a comment?</seg>
<seg id="1175">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): It’s not a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1176">If it’s okay with you, we’re going to go to a different department. He’s available to answer questions. I would like to have my officials at the witness table change before any questions are asked. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1177">I was going to give you an opportunity, but if you would like to take this opportunity, it’s okay with you.</seg>
<seg id="1178">Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the witnesses out.</seg>
<seg id="1179">Does the committee agree to bring in the witness?</seg>
<seg id="1180">Chairman (interpretation): Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the other official out.</seg>
<seg id="1181">For the record, Mr. Akeeagok, please introduce your new witness.</seg>
<seg id="1182">To my left is the Deputy Minister of Health, Colleen Inuujaq Stockley.</seg>
<seg id="1183">Health. Operations and Maintenance. Not Previously Authorized. Total Directorate. $5.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Mr. Netser (interpretation): I made a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1185">Once it’s dealt with, I’m going to ask a question on medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1187">Are there any questions on Directorate?</seg>
<seg id="1188">I don’t have too many questions, but when we’re talking about elders’ homes in Nunavut, there are three facilities that are going to be funded from different sources.</seg>
<seg id="1189">The other day when I was asking questions about the pre-feasibility study that was done in Igloolik and Gjoa Haven, they’re looking at expanding the elders’ facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1190">At that time the minister was unaware of the number of beds that would be inspected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Can the minister update us today on the status of increasing the number of elders’ homes in Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="1192">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you for the question.</seg>
<seg id="1193">That’s under the preplanning process. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1194">What is the status of this pre-planning process and what is the status of this work?</seg>
<seg id="1195">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) I would like the Deputy Minister of Health to answer that question because he is more familiar with the capital planning process.</seg>
<seg id="1196">The Department of Health has already planned for last year’s capital estimates for 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1197">I wonder if this project can proceed with the expansion of the Igloolik facility as the minister stated earlier.</seg>
<seg id="1198">Bearing in mind that after the election, the government was likely to have a new mandate to look at the options for the Igloolik expansion.</seg>
<seg id="1199">It hasn’t gone that far, but we expect that it will be initiated once we know what the government’s mandate is.</seg>
<seg id="1200">In conclusion, when we’re talking about the use of government resources, we have identified deficiencies in our infrastructure, so I would like to emphasize that the department is responsible for the outcomes of the government’s Seniors’ Advocate.</seg>
<seg id="1201">I look forward to the frequent progress that is being made to better use the existing infrastructure and identify opportunities within the territory for different types of new infrastructure that are currently on the waiting list.</seg>
<seg id="1202">That’s more of a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1203">With respect to my colleague’s question about the elders’ homes, I would like to ask a question about the elders’ homes.</seg>
<seg id="1204">I would be interested to hear what the breakdown is of the $900,000.</seg>
<seg id="1205">What kind of infrastructure will be divided up between the two communities?</seg>
<seg id="1206">The $900,000 is for the three regions and the total amount is $300,000 each for the three elders.</seg>
<seg id="1207">Mr. Men (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) I’m just wondering if the minister has indicated that these units are contracted out to non-profit organizations in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1208">What process does the Department of Health use to inform them if they’re going to spend too much money?</seg>
<seg id="1209">The three communities that are run by the government, not the government, have just issued new contracts.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Further, if there is a need to increase or decrease, the Department of Health and the Department of Health meet with each other.</seg>
<seg id="1211">When they have to come up with solutions, they work together.</seg>
<seg id="1212">It’s in accordance with the Canadian and Nunavut laws.</seg>
<seg id="1213">In the business plan it talks about the three facilities that have just opened for residential 2 and 3 high-level residential long-term care. A number of factors indicate that there is a significant increase in the number of residential long-term care and aging facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1214">Going back to the budget, are you anticipating that over the next year the operations and maintenance costs will continue to increase or will that be the end of the fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="1215">At the beginning of the contract, three of them were under the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="1216">The Department of Health only took over the contract in April 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1217">One of the things that we have brought to the attention of the Department of Health is that it’s a little bit different from the Department of Family Services. We looked at it from a clinical standpoint where we’re looking at what level of care they’re receiving and who they’re receiving.</seg>
<seg id="1218">They made recommendations on the food that they eat.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When we looked at the contract, the elders facilities were not able to provide the level of care that they needed.</seg>
<seg id="1220">We’re looking at $1.3 million and we’re looking at a deficit of $855,000 last year and we’re looking at a budget of almost $900,000 right now.</seg>
<seg id="1221">If I’m wrong, you’re going to stop me from looking at the funding that’s available for people with mental health issues across the territory.</seg>
<seg id="1222">We have to deal with trauma and trauma.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Is there any mention of setting aside funds for mental health and addictions treatment?</seg>
<seg id="1224">We’re just talking about additional funding for O &amp; M. We’re not talking about actual costs.</seg>
<seg id="1225">I don’t think it’s fair to say that it’s the Legislative Assembly or something else.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Do you have another question, Ms. Towtongie?</seg>
<seg id="1227">Thank you for clarifying that.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The mental health contract for 2017-18 is $16 million, I believe, $16.7 million, and I believe it’s $6.2 million. What is the status of that?</seg>
<seg id="1229">That’s my final question. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1230">Mr. Chairman, we’re on the $5.9 million that the member is asking about, which is part of the $43.1 million.</seg>
<seg id="1231">The main estimates are $16 million and $10 million.</seg>
<seg id="1232">If the deputy minister can elaborate further on the contents of the bill, I’ll ask my deputy minister, Mr. Stockley, to explain the contents of the $10 million. I’m not sure if he can respond to the question.</seg>
<seg id="1233">It’s very good to hear that Nunavummiut are asking for help and that’s the message that you’re going to go to your health centre and you’re going to be interviewing people on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1234">That’s why there’s an increase in the number of clients going to a treatment centre.</seg>
<seg id="1235">I know that they have mental health issues and addictions.</seg>
<seg id="1236">There are also costs that are outside of the Department of Health. The Department of Family Services is responsible for the Department of Justice. There are court orders that go through the treatment centre.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Before we proceed to the Directorate, we will take a five-minute break and we will take a break.</seg>
<seg id="1238">&gt;&gt;Committee recessed at 18:03 and resumed at 18:10</seg>
<seg id="1239">I would like to call the committee meeting back to order.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Total Health. $43,100,000.</seg>
<seg id="1241">In your business plan you talk about long-term care for elders.</seg>
<seg id="1242">I think that would increase because we don’t have a forgotten laboratory in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1243">That’s what I’m interested in.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Are they looking at having a forgetfulness laboratory in Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="1245">It’s part of the program right away, but it’s not at the highest level.</seg>
<seg id="1246">They’re working on mental health issues and they’re larger than they are at this time.</seg>
<seg id="1247">At the same time, outside of the territory, the last paragraph states that “Outside of the territory, funding is provided to the Department of Health.”</seg>
<seg id="1248">I was kind of surprised to note that the minister’s correspondence, broken down by department, did not include any provisions related to the over-expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Is the department going to spend all of their money in this area?</seg>
<seg id="1250">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On page 6 the first one is $5.9 million. Not Previously Authorized.</seg>
<seg id="1251">That’s what we’re asking for this year. We’re asking for $5.9 million for the seniors’ care facility to be able to provide that level of care. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1252">My question is more related to the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="1253">If I’m mistaken, I’ll have Deputy Minister Stockley correct me.</seg>
<seg id="1254">I believe the question was asked, but I can respond by saying that the over-expenditures are not deducted from the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="1255">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you for clarifying that.</seg>
<seg id="1256">That’s the money that’s not spent within the department. That’s the money that we’re carrying over.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The balance of the budget for the Department of Health is $49 million.</seg>
<seg id="1258">The letter that I just sent out today will be translated into Inuktitut today and it was sent out on Friday, but it’s an appendix that doesn’t have a number.</seg>
<seg id="1259">That’s a small amount, but looking at the over-expenditures that we’re proposing through this supplementary appropriation. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1260">I appreciate that you’re referring to the appendix, but I was trying to talk about the correspondence that we received from the minister on page 4. It’s a breakdown of programs and funding.</seg>
<seg id="1261">Under the Department of Family Services, they’re advertising their surplus funds for recycling.</seg>
<seg id="1262">I don’t know why the Department of Health has not done that.</seg>
<seg id="1263">The Department of Health’s main estimates did not indicate that there would be a surplus.</seg>
<seg id="1264">On page 5 it indicates that the Department of Health will need an additional $49 million. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1265">The Department of Health is not talking about regional programs.</seg>
<seg id="1266">In the Department of Health, as I know from the regions, there are surpluses in the recruitment, staffing, and computer systems. There has been over $1 million in surpluses over the years.</seg>
<seg id="1267">Can the minister provide us with a breakdown of all the Department of Health programs that have surpluses when there is a deficit?</seg>
<seg id="1268">You’re requesting a lot of detailed information that may not be available at this time.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Minister Akoak.</seg>
<seg id="1270">… Mr. Akeeagok, go ahead.</seg>
<seg id="1271">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for recognizing me.</seg>
<seg id="1272">We don’t have that level of detail in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="1273">We will be able to table it in the House later on. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1274">I’ll move on to the seniors’ homes.</seg>
<seg id="1275">In the second bullet, it indicates that “Currently elders facilities are operated through contracts with non-profit Nunavut organizations.”</seg>
<seg id="1276">I just want to say that this program is very accessible to any Nunavut organization.</seg>
<seg id="1277">I’m hoping that we can get as many contracts as possible.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Moving on to a different topic, just to go on to the next bullet, it says that 24-hour care for elders is 24-hour, 7-day week. The Department of Health provides housing according to the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The elders have to be governed according to this legislation.</seg>
<seg id="1280">I would like to ask the Department of Health if they have a minimum level of care for elders.</seg>
<seg id="1281">I responded to that earlier.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The contract has been awarded and the contract has been extended due to the Department of Health’s compliance and compliance requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1283">If there’s no compliance, the interpreters and the Department of Health meet with each other to make sure that they’re following the legislation properly.</seg>
<seg id="1284">Mr. Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="1285">Can you clarify if these elders’ facilities are up to a minimum level of care?</seg>
<seg id="1286">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1287">As it’s a new contract, we have increased it from $900,000 to $5.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="1288">It’s indicated that the three organizations that are going to be trying to keep up with the current level of care, but they haven’t really reached the level of care that elders need.</seg>
<seg id="1289">As the minister stated earlier, they’re trying to catch up. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Mr. Netser (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1291">I’m starting to get a little bit quiet now.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In regard to medical travel, they’re asking for $50 million and I have brought this up many times in the House about medical travel, but they don’t have an appointment, especially in my constituency, when they’re down in Winnipeg, they find out that they don’t have an appointment.</seg>
<seg id="1293">Does the Department of Health have a list of patients that have gone down to Winnipeg that have been cancelled out of their appointments, and I’m just wondering if the Department of Health has that list of what the costs are for patients that have had no appointments, travel, accommodation, and fees?</seg>
<seg id="1294">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="1295">The Minister of Health has committed to reviewing all medical travel patients, including patients who have not been seen or who have fluctuated their appointments.</seg>
<seg id="1296">That’s one of the things that the government wants to look at. We’re going to try to find out where the allegations were.</seg>
<seg id="1297">The member raises a number of questions that he has seen in the past and that’s something that we will want to include in the review.</seg>
<seg id="1298">I would like to thank the member for raising that issue and we can look into it collectively.</seg>
<seg id="1299">That will be part of the review, but there are people that have gone to the health centre without an appointment. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1300">Mr. Netser (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) I look forward to the results of the review.</seg>
<seg id="1301">At this time there was $5.5 million for tuberculosis in Qikiqtarjuaq and it was recently announced on February 26 that the federal government provided a significant amount of money to Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami. I believe it was $82 million to $80 million for tuberculosis research.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Has the government or the Department of Health requested or can ITK help us with this funding because we were given this funding? Has the government or the government had any discussions on whether they can be involved in compensating for tuberculosis?</seg>
<seg id="1303">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1304">That’s a very good question.</seg>
<seg id="1305">At this time the federal government’s announcement that the 2018-19 budget will be included in the funding to support Inuit-specific tuberculosis programs still indicates that “Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami will be allocated funding over a five-year period to support the development of Inuit-specific tuberculosis programs.”</seg>
<seg id="1306">At this time the standing committee has indicated that there is a committee comprised of representatives from Inuit-owned lands that the Department of Health is involved in.</seg>
<seg id="1307">At this time the additional funding will be provided by the federal government and as the Minister of Finance, I haven’t seen the details.</seg>
<seg id="1308">I look forward to seeing the details. If Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami are doing a good job and they understand us well, we are working with the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="1309">That’s how it is set up.</seg>
<seg id="1310">We will be informed as to what’s happening with the contents of the bill. We will be kept informed as to what’s happening with the contents of the bill.</seg>
<seg id="1311">I would like to ask another question regarding medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="1312">It says here that medical travel is out of control and there are interest rates and contracts that go up. That’s what I’m trying to get at.</seg>
<seg id="1313">With the $15 million deficit, does the Department of Health understand why it’s so high?</seg>
<seg id="1314">What are the main reasons for the increase?</seg>
<seg id="1315">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Through you, I’ll ask my Deputy Minister, Mr. Stockley, to answer that question.</seg>
<seg id="1317">Medical travel and medevacs are increasing every year.</seg>
<seg id="1318">There are more and more patients going through medical travel, but there’s also an increase in the number of people that can be diagnosed early.</seg>
<seg id="1319">With regard to tuberculosis, it has been a very challenging issue and it is one of the reasons for the spread of tuberculosis across Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1320">I’ll use an example.</seg>
<seg id="1321">I think there were about 60 medevacs that were scheduled to go to the health centre in December.</seg>
<seg id="1322">There’s always an increase in the number of medevacs that are sent out every week and we’re always looking at it, but in the spring of this year, people who are suffering from lung disease or oxygen or oxygen are in an emergency situation.</seg>
<seg id="1323">The combination of medical travel and medevacs has all increased.</seg>
<seg id="1324">Mr. Chairman, I’m not going to go into the details, but I’m trying to understand the reasons for the increase.</seg>
<seg id="1325">I’m just wondering if the population of Nunavut is going to be as good as they are. Are they getting sick?</seg>
<seg id="1326">Can I get a little bit more detail on whether or not my question is too broad, are we getting caught up or are we getting left behind?</seg>
<seg id="1327">I’ll ask Deputy Minister Stockley to answer that question.</seg>
<seg id="1328">It’s a sad fact that we’ve got the highest number of people in Canada, the Department of Health, and the food insecurity that we’ve got in a building that’s really causing some serious health issues, but we’ve got to make sure that we don’t have housing anymore.</seg>
<seg id="1329">We did add to the re-supply at the Qikiqtani General Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="1330">One of the things that we try to do is reduce the amount of medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="1331">We’re moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="1332">The second category, for example, is telehealth. It’s going to be used in three regions.</seg>
<seg id="1333">You’re going to hear more and more about the funding that we’re looking at for operations and maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="1334">I thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="1335">I’m very much looking forward to the main estimates when we’re dealing with this.</seg>
<seg id="1336">One of the things that you hear is that it’s a continuous process.</seg>
<seg id="1337">When I look at the substantiation sheet, it doesn’t say what the reason is for the increase of $10.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Have you been pushing the department to increase the number of people with mental health issues and what is the reason for that?</seg>
<seg id="1339">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) It’s both diagnostic and mental health.</seg>
<seg id="1340">During the Fourth Session of the Fourth Legislative Assembly, members of the Legislative Assembly declared that it was an urgent matter for the government to take action.</seg>
<seg id="1341">When we’re hiring people to provide services in our communities, we’re going to continue to do that. We don’t have any training programs in place to make sure that people are diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="1342">It’s going to be changing our people and making sure that the members keep tabling it in the House to the public.</seg>
<seg id="1343">My last question is in regard to the Mental Health First Aid Program, how many services are we providing outside of the territory for people with mental health issues?</seg>
<seg id="1344">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 64.</seg>
<seg id="1345">I’m just wondering: what’s the change in the past?</seg>
<seg id="1346">We don’t have that level of information in front of us, but it’s increasing and if the member wants that information, we will be able to provide it to him in the upcoming main estimates.</seg>
<seg id="1347">Moving on to a different topic, the Qikiqtarjuaq TB study, I’m sure all of us will agree that it’s very encouraging to hear that.</seg>
<seg id="1348">It states here that equipment and equipment will be kept by the Department of Health. Will it be inspected in other communities or if it’s too small, will it remain in the community?</seg>
<seg id="1349">Through you, I’ll have Deputy Minister Stockley respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Will the property assessment be done through the capital planning process?</seg>
<seg id="1351">I’m lost.</seg>
<seg id="1352">It’s under capital. Can you clarify that for me?</seg>
<seg id="1353">Through you, I’ll have Deputy Minister Stockley respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1354">The majority of these assets were from the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Those are the things that we received from the federal government, such as the refrigerators, the sprinkler system, the beds, and all those types of things that the Department of Health has been doing in practice.</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1357">That’s my last question. I’m sure that’s my last question.</seg>
<seg id="1358">In the Department of Health’s Public Service Recruitment and Retention Strategy, you say that you’re hiring agency nurses and you’ve got a contract in place. The department has been very successful in reducing the number of agency nurses.</seg>
<seg id="1359">I would like to ask, for this year’s expenditures in previous years, what has been the difference in the amount of money spent on this project?</seg>
<seg id="1360">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Instead of having a catalogue of nurses, we’re having more nurses here in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1362">From last year to now we’re using more of our indeterminate nurses.</seg>
<seg id="1363">That’s my final question.</seg>
<seg id="1364">If I get the breakdown of the $8.6 million, I would appreciate it.</seg>
<seg id="1365">Broken down by line, for the 2017-18 fiscal year the department’s casual staffing shortfall was $52.5 million, the casual staffing budget exceeded $45.3 million, the wait-list was $15.7 million, and the ordering of agency nurses exceeded $0.1 million, and the total budget exceeded $8.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1366">I just have one question and I’ll just go on to the breakdown of what you’re talking about, but I’ll just add to Mr. Mike’s question.</seg>
<seg id="1367">I don’t have the details in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="1368">If a nurse in Sanikiluaq is in an emergency overnight, they have to be overtime. I know that the employee has to be overtime.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1370">I know the minister was answering questions today about what the department is doing to recruit nurses.</seg>
<seg id="1371">I’ll leave it at that for now.</seg>
<seg id="1372">I just want to comment that when we’re looking at the main estimates for the Department of Health, there are staff, physicians, contractors, psychiatrists, and medical travel that are available on an annual basis.</seg>
<seg id="1373">The number for mental health and addictions is dramatically changing from last year’s budget of $6.8 million to $7.8 million last year’s supplementary appropriation.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Earlier when I was talking about the budgeting process, the Minister of Finance indicated that they haven’t made any changes at this time, but I believe that they need to make real changes because we’re always going back and forth and approving supplementary appropriations.</seg>
<seg id="1375">When you know that they’re over budget and they’re coming up with a realignment of the main estimates, they’re going to have to come up with what they’re supposed to be doing and not just what they’re supposed to be doing.</seg>
<seg id="1376">That’s just a comment, but I would like to hear from the minister about that comment.</seg>
<seg id="1377">I think that’s exactly what we’re looking at. We’re taking a realistic look at what the members of the Fifth Assembly are considering. We’ve had discussions with some departments, Health and Justice, and they’re constantly asking for supplementary appropriations.</seg>
<seg id="1378">I’m very happy that we’re talking about this in the main estimates and I’m working very closely with my cabinet colleagues on that.</seg>
<seg id="1379">I do respond to some of the health issues that I have been the Minister of Health ever since I became the Minister of Health. It’s something that’s very much felt by the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="1380">It’s something that we really need to do because we need to make sure that we’re budgeting properly and correcting errors, and then we’re going to make sure that we’re correcting those errors and not changing the budgeting process. We need to recognize that we’re going to have to make sure that we’re doing the right thing.</seg>
<seg id="1381">It’s only through this House that we will be able to make those changes.</seg>
<seg id="1382">One of our regular members’ statements made a lot of observations.</seg>
<seg id="1383">It’s something that we have to work very closely together as MLAs. We really need that.</seg>
<seg id="1384">The 2017-18 main estimates reflect some of the challenges that we face. I look forward to working with the Premier and the Premier on the processes that we’re going through. Even if we’re not supposed to be here, we don’t have to go back to the main estimates.</seg>
<seg id="1385">That’s all I wanted to say and thank you, Mr. Chairman, for giving me the opportunity to speak.</seg>
<seg id="1386">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1387">I applaud the minister for recognizing the need for improvement.</seg>
<seg id="1388">I just wanted to reiterate that as the member mentioned, it’s a legal continuum of attendance that we’re sitting with right now. It’s an overtime issue for nurses and other legislation. It’s a recurring budget for overtime. I have talked about that and I’ll be raising it for the next three and a half years.</seg>
<seg id="1389">I think it’s something that needs to be recognized, but I’m wondering if the Minister of Human Resources can give us an idea of how the government can do that.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If we’re going to fill the existing positions within our organizational structure, if we’re going to fill those positions where there are weaknesses, as Mr. Main talked about the challenges that the government faces, the challenges that it faces, the health problems of some of our employees, then we’re going to have to go back and look at how we can move forward with filling those positions where we have our strengths and our strengths and not just trying to keep up with the challenges that we have.</seg>
<seg id="1391">When we’re talking about overtime, I’m going to want to know more about moving forward where the priorities are and what the initiatives are so that we can look forward to what we can do.</seg>
<seg id="1392">That’s just a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Mr. Mikkungwak, did you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1394">Mr. Mikkungwak (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1395">I just have one question on mental health and the contract. On the fourth bullet it says, “… the Department of Justice will pay for medical travel.” Is that included in the $10.5 million?</seg>
<seg id="1396">I’ll make it brief. Yes, the members are.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Mr. Lightstone, do you have another question?</seg>
<seg id="1398">My final question is in regard to Mr. Main and Mr. Hickes’ questions.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last one is in regard to staffing at the hospital. There’s a $8.6 million deficit. Just to clarify, you’re indicating $143 million to $151 million to $8.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1400">Is that for salaries and benefits for the department?</seg>
<seg id="1401">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Yes, that’s the compensation and benefits.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1403">Is this $151 million 100 percent correct?</seg>
<seg id="1404">This is a $25 million increase in salaries.</seg>
<seg id="1405">I don’t think the funding has ever been 100 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1406">As I stated earlier, if I compile the number of hours that are ordered, I think what we’re trying to do is we’re requesting $8.6 million in our main estimates for salaries and benefits. I think that’s the closest we can get.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It’s not 100 percent accurate. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Now it’s just around the corner. There are a lot of things on the list.</seg>
<seg id="1409">Moving on to the minister’s opening comments on page 4, the department’s budget for medical travel is $63.8 million for the fiscal year 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1410">I’m just wondering why that money was set aside in the 2016-17 fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I don’t have that information in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1413">Mr. Lightstone, we’re dealing with 2016-17 and not 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1414">I’ll keep in mind that it’s 2016-17 and I’ll leave it at that.</seg>
<seg id="1415">I was asking about the medical travel budget last year. What is the department’s projected budget for 2018-19?</seg>
<seg id="1416">Mr. Akeeagok may not have that level of detail for 2017-18, but Minister Akeeagok may not have that level of detail.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. (interpretation ends) I believe it’s going to be ahead of schedule in May, where we’re going to be talking about the 2018-19 fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="1418">We’re voting on the interim appropriation for 2017-18. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Again, there are some deficiencies within the budget process that the minister has provided. There are a lot of variables that the department has been doing every year since it was amended, so I’m hoping that in the coming year I’ll be making a formal request to the Department of Health when the O &amp; M budget is being discussed.</seg>
<seg id="1420">I don’t want to see an increase in the budget every year.</seg>
<seg id="1421">It’s just the same process. I would like to get more details on the department’s operations and maintenance budget.</seg>
<seg id="1422">That’s just a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Chairman (interpretation): Mr. Qirngnuq, do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1424">Mr. Qirngnuq (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1425">I have one question on medical travel. I’ll ask it in English so that I can be clear on the third bullet for April. The number of medevacs has increased since last year.</seg>
<seg id="1426">The member is talking about medical travel. This has increased the number of people who are sick and the number of people going to the hospital has increased.</seg>
<seg id="1427">However, the cost of medical travel is increasing.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Mr. Mikkungwak, do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1429">I apologize. I thought you had your hand up.</seg>
<seg id="1430">We’re on Health. Operations and Maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="1431">We’re done with $43,100,000. If you go down to the bottom, the total department is $49 million.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Not Previously Authorized.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Go back to page 2. Supplementary Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) 2017-18, No. 3. Schedule 1. Operations and Maintenance Appropriation. $56,602,000.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Go to Bill 3 in your legislation binder.</seg>
<seg id="1435">I’m sorry, but I’ll go back.</seg>
<seg id="1436">Bill 3, Supplementary Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, No. 3, 2017-2018.</seg>
<seg id="1437">Chairman (interpretation): Go to the Schedule on page 2. Schedule. Supplementary Amounts Appropriated for 2017-18. Vote 1: Operations and Maintenance. Total Operations and Maintenance, to be Voted. $56,602,000. Agreed?</seg>

<seg id="1439">Chairman (interpretation): Clause 5. Agreed?</seg>
<seg id="1440">Chairman (interpretation): Does the committee agree to Bill 3 as a whole?</seg>
<seg id="1441">Chairman (interpretation): Do members agree that pursuant to Rule 62(2) that Bill 3 can immediately be placed on the orders of the day for third reading?</seg>
<seg id="1442">Minister Akeeagok, do you have any closing comments?</seg>
<seg id="1443">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1444">With that, we will be able to make some changes to the budget.</seg>
<seg id="1445">Before we go to the next bill, we will have the bill passed.</seg>
<seg id="1446">I also thank the member for his excellent work and I will now rise to report progress.</seg>
<seg id="1447">Chairman (interpretation): Thank you. Did you want someone else to come in?</seg>
<seg id="1448">Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the minister’s officials out.</seg>
<seg id="1449">Moving on to Bill 4.</seg>
<seg id="1450">Mr. Akeeagok, please proceed with your opening comments.</seg>
<seg id="1451">Bill 04 – Supplementary Appropriation (Capital) Act, No. 4, 2017-2018 – Consideration in Committee</seg>
<seg id="1452">Hon. David Akeeagok (interpretation): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1453">I appear before you today to present Bill 4, Supplementary Appropriation (Capital) Act, 2017-2018, No. 4.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Through this bill, the government is seeking an additional $96,000 in 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1455">This supplementary appropriation will provide the Department of Community and Government Services with a non-cash contribution of $96,000 in interest adjustments during the negotiations for the development of a lease to the Nunavut Construction Corporation’s Legislative Assembly building and nine GN offices across the territory.</seg>
<seg id="1456">I would be pleased to take questions and comments.</seg>
<seg id="1457">Are there any general comments on the minister’s opening comments?</seg>
<seg id="1458">This is the first time I have been involved in this. I would like to know why we should do this.</seg>
<seg id="1459">Can the Department of Community and Government Services not find their own capital projects?</seg>
<seg id="1460">We have to make sure that it’s reflected in the financial statements. We want to make sure that it’s transparent.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There wouldn’t be any money until they got paid. The interest rates were higher than expected. (interpretation) Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>

<seg id="1519">Speaker (interpretation): Thank you. Before we go to Item 22, I have an announcement to make.</seg>
<seg id="1520">As Speaker of the Legislative Assembly and Chair of the Order of Nunavut’s Order of Nunavut, I am very proud to be able to present this year’s Order of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1521">On January 1, 2010 the Order of Nunavut Act came into force.</seg>
<seg id="1522">It’s intended to make sense for people to be recognized for the hard work and dedication that they have given themselves to Nunavummiut and to our communities.</seg>
<seg id="1523">The Order of Nunavut is the highest honour of all Government of Nunavut awards, medals, or medals.</seg>
<seg id="1524">As of today, 15 people have received the Order of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1525">These individuals have been recognized for their hard work in contributing to a wide range of areas, including public service broadcasting, education, language advocacy, multi-party leadership, and growth.</seg>
<seg id="1526">Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to be able to introduce two individuals to the Order of Nunavut this year, Ms. Fadi Brewster, and Mr. Ludy Pudluk.</seg>
<seg id="1527">I am very pleased to have the opportunity to join Mr. Pudluk in the House today.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Welcome, Mr. Pudluk.</seg>
<seg id="1529">As members are aware, Betty Brewster is a well-known interpreter for many years.</seg>
<seg id="1530">In 2016 he was also recognized for his work and dedication in the work that the Inuit Uqausinginnik Taiguusiliuqtiit did to the Languages Commissioner.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Mr. Pudluk was a Member of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories from 1975 to 1995.</seg>
<seg id="1532">During his many years of service, Mr. Pudluk represented the High Arctic communities and was a key player in the process of establishing Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1533">I am pleased to announce that we will be working on the accreditation plan for Ms. Brewster and Mr. Pudluk during the spring 2018 sitting of the Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="1534">The award ceremony will be held in the Legislative Assembly and will be broadcast on Nunavut’s television channel.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Congratulations to Commissioner Nellie Kusugak, who will be the recipient of the Order of Nunavut, and I hope that all members of this House will be able to join me during this exciting day.</seg>

<seg id="2">“The whole of the Arctic now is linked to an event tonight”</seg>

<seg id="5">By Thomas Rohner Special to Nunatsiaq News</seg>
<seg id="6">"Religious bishop Yovanovitch is better known for his actions, convincing climate change and his economy that the world will eliminate any Christians who don’t believe he came to Iqaluit’s church on Aug. 27."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Rodney HuffPost-Brown, a former South African resident who moved to the United States, told attendees near the Tampa Bay area last year that the world’s most vulnerable people had spotted Lucia and drinked a person’s blood donation."</seg>
<seg id="8">He was stranded for more than an hour at the Iqaluit Cathedral for more than 100 people.</seg>
<seg id="9">But their message is not public.</seg>
<seg id="10">“The whole of the Arctic now is linked to an event tonight.</seg>
<seg id="11">"So if you want a light (exit), please stand at the church’s knee, or you can leave."</seg>
<seg id="12">"It’s up to you,” HuffPost-Brown said during the two-and-a-half hours."</seg>
<seg id="13">About 50 people attended.</seg>
<seg id="14">“I didn’t fly for thousands of miles to play.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I didn’t come here to be impressed, and I didn’t come here to ask for your permission… Remember: after Jesus died of a heart attack, he asked me to leave the room with Inuit.”"</seg>
<seg id="16">"Attendance among Inuit was higher among infants, youth and elders."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Inside the church’s Christian Flushing Cathedral near Iqaluit’s Rhode Novo, children sparked between seats."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Outside, the church and Musk are confronted with each other behind a car strike, with the couple facing Ted Doug Lake."</seg>
<seg id="19">"The Hollywood-Brown bishop was one of the organized events of the Belfast Association’s Arctic Hope Project, located in Ottawa."</seg>
<seg id="20">The organization did not respond to Nunatsiaq News in an organized hearing.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The event, which ranks 119 of its 300 guests in every community, started about an hour after the event."</seg>
<seg id="22">"First, Iqaluit’s Iqaluit church choir launched this evening in Iqaluit after the late Yvonslav Rev. Louis Arreak, who helped launch the Christian Velasquez church."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Eric Garneau, a fellow bishop of Howard-Brown Riverdale at the churches of England, gave 40 minutes to speak about the president."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Louie Arreak, Iqaluit’s Yvonneliste and singer, sang the song before Rodney Howard-Brown spoke."</seg>
<seg id="25">(Photo courtesy of Riverdale’s Ministry of Engineering)</seg>
<seg id="26">” God loves a donor”</seg>
<seg id="27">Garneau is asking attendees to submit email addresses through the registry and to follow the Hollywood-Brown Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="28">He handed out a purchase order for Howard-Brown’s spiritual sales.</seg>
<seg id="29">"And the release of Howard-Brown’s book, Killing of the Planet, says he’s talking about what he’s experienced in the controversial e-commerce sector over the last 200 years."</seg>
<seg id="30">"“This speaks to a disadvantaged Croatia, that’s what he’s talking about,” Garneau said."</seg>
<seg id="31">Gannon then filmed the 18-minute-long Howard-Brown sketch that he used to run a severe wreck.</seg>
<seg id="32">"At the end of the video, Howard-Brown prayed that donors will receive money for his church God’s safeguards."</seg>
<seg id="33">"“God loves a big donor”, Howard-Brown said in his video."</seg>
<seg id="34">Gania broke his head at the end of the video.</seg>
<seg id="35">"“One has a church and one has gathered and together we’re celebrating the vegetables, so if you put a church there, go to your church’s fund."</seg>
<seg id="36">That’s amazing.”</seg>
<seg id="37">"He then donates the bags to a place and tells these people that we can’t get the “best gift for the soul,” whether financially, or financially, going to RMI Canada, using a plastic or a smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="38">"“I’ve always told people, don’t put the biggest profits into the church or the new line… please use them to promote the church and promote spirits."</seg>
<seg id="39">That’s it?”</seg>
<seg id="40">Several people filled out the fill and voiced the bag and packaged it into a blue plastic bag.</seg>
<seg id="41">Some people just scratch the bag as they hold it.</seg>
<seg id="42">One female Inuk Emmerdale contains no content for her selection.</seg>
<seg id="43">The challenge of getting funding from countries is also extremely difficult for many: Nunavut requires about half of its population to receive income support despite food insecurity and housing shortages.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Howard-Brown did not respond to an interview with Nunatsiaq News, so it’s unclear how much she made."</seg>
<seg id="45">Their earnings are kept secret but their website says it provides training in 158 locations.</seg>
<seg id="46">It also said that Inuit who want to participate in the Aviation Program can also get rid of income tax.</seg>
<seg id="47">Garneau called on the attendees to raise their hands to hold their donations to Riverdale’s churches.</seg>
<seg id="48">"“Father, we thank you for this gift, and we thank you for being the ambassador of the spirit, please go to our bank accounts,” Garneau said."</seg>
<seg id="49">Three-quarters of Qatar’s total were collected.</seg>
<seg id="50">Rodney Howard-Brown instructs the roof of the woman’s neck.</seg>
<seg id="51">Rev. Patterk Netser calls him a friend</seg>
<seg id="52">"That bishop is already heavily dependent on Nunavut, based in most communities."</seg>
<seg id="53">"Egypt sits each year and, in the mid-2000s, continues to grow."</seg>
<seg id="54">"One participant in that type of conference, Roger Armbishop, told Nunatsiaq News in 2004 that the conferences are a big voice for those whose lives have been damaged by domestic violence and substance abuse."</seg>
<seg id="55">But Howard-Brown’s pledge to spend more money on acquisitions and artificial intelligence may be new to Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="56">"Patterk Netser, a longtime defender of reality religion and now Nunavut’s minister of housing and Nunavut Arctic College, has called Hughes-Brown’s call “Askimo’s girlfriend” which he has told him climate change is totally false."</seg>
<seg id="57">"Netser declined to be interviewed by Nunatsiaq News but said, “Ronnie is a friend of mine and we talk to each other.”"</seg>
<seg id="58">"When asked to respond to Howard-Brown’s numerous times in the media about his obstruction, having also alleged that the U.S. Supreme Court must shoot America’s constitution is unacceptable, Netanyahu said, “I don’t care what happens in America."</seg>
<seg id="59">My main concern is for my people and Nunavummiut.”</seg>

<seg id="62">"After an hour of events, Howard-Brown—a visionary—travelled to the bishop’s kingdom."</seg>
<seg id="63">"“Tonight it’s going to be light on the ice,” the missionary said of more than 100 people, mostly Inuit, at different ages."</seg>
<seg id="64">"“If you don’t want the power, let’s run on your door.”"</seg>
<seg id="65">"Within an hour, Howard-Brown’s voice sounds loud and quiet."</seg>
<seg id="66">He stopped short of calling for something to happen and called for something to happen.</seg>
<seg id="67">"“I know I don’t feel like I’m from Africa, I do that because my parents used to shake me, never let me out,” she said with a laugh."</seg>
<seg id="68">“Moses was the first person in the office (Dallas).</seg>
<seg id="69">The first broke down and he had to go back to switch.</seg>
<seg id="70">And Adamee and Evie were the first to make Apple products.”</seg>
<seg id="71">"Howard-Brown became a well-known, purposeful, laughing stock for the meeting where attendees laughed."</seg>
<seg id="72">"His grandson attended the exit at the age of two, he laughed after 12 minutes, HuffPost-Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="73">Hollywood-Brown has been multiple times criticized by other Yvonians in the springs of the planet.</seg>
<seg id="74">He’s been called a missionary by which religious priests become laughing at each other’s events. HuffPost-Brown has responded to those who complained that he’d just complain about leaving and going to the frightening room.</seg>
<seg id="75">"Arreak, a Iqaluit-based Yovanovitch and singer who helped him recover from the incident, laughed at family members during his prison sentence."</seg>
<seg id="76">"“This is not a funeral, why are Inuit sad?”"</seg>
<seg id="77">Hollywood-Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="78">Arreak laughs.</seg>
<seg id="79">“We’re serving Jesus and he’s alive.”</seg>
<seg id="80">Arreak laughs.</seg>
<seg id="81">"“I like this bishop,” said Arreak, who made his laugh more loud."</seg>
<seg id="82">Howard-Brown laughs with others just laughing.</seg>
<seg id="83">“We’re happy.</seg>
<seg id="84">"Happily you can get out of the water, from places where there are no limits.”"</seg>
<seg id="85">Arreak’s laugh suddenly fell at the top of the house.</seg>
<seg id="86">“This is a reality.</seg>
<seg id="87">No one will be arrested this evening.”</seg>
<seg id="88">"Arreak, who Nunatsiaq News says he doesn’t want to tell reporters, laughs."</seg>
<seg id="89">"Howard-Brown also spoke in plain language, saying the language was understood in the Indigenous language of Papua New Gini’s missionary."</seg>
<seg id="90">I ‘t’s Mon-a-La-Pa.</seg>
<seg id="91">"Ron-Pam-Goo,” she said."</seg>
<seg id="92">Rodney Howard-Brown invites guests to the church’s side to get a light exit.</seg>
<seg id="93">Some laughs</seg>
<seg id="94">But many of Howard-Brown’s instructions aren’t funny or funny.</seg>
<seg id="95">They were suddenly kicked out of the exit door before he was given a prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="96">"Before touching the non-compliant audience, Howard-Brown had two people complaining about it before they left."</seg>
<seg id="97">“Where are you going with Brada?</seg>
<seg id="98">Hi.</seg>
<seg id="99">Hey!</seg>
<seg id="100">You’re out?”</seg>
<seg id="101">Howard-Brown says one man is quiet when he leaves the church.</seg>
<seg id="102">"“After you come in, do you take pictures on the phone and leave?"</seg>
<seg id="103">You’re a reporter for the day-to-day news here?”</seg>
<seg id="104">Attendees laughed.</seg>
<seg id="105">"“I don’t know how to say goodbye to him and take him back… find out who he is and why he’s taking a photo and why he’s out,” said one of his staff members."</seg>
<seg id="106">"After asking for the bishop’s place, Howard-Brown suddenly grabbed two women in the next few seats because they don’t like their eyes."</seg>
<seg id="107">“Have you been alive again?</seg>
<seg id="108">"What are you, Zhova Whitney?”"</seg>
<seg id="109">Attendees laugh.</seg>
<seg id="110">“I’ve never seen people sitting on the boundary that can’t change.</seg>
<seg id="111">"So you can crack through others, or maybe you’re better than others.”"</seg>
<seg id="112">When the two women stood up and walked out.</seg>
<seg id="113">“I’m just trying to ask.</seg>
<seg id="114">"I say that, it’s my job."</seg>
<seg id="115">I know the circumstances of Inner’s body.</seg>
<seg id="116">You don’t hate me.</seg>
<seg id="117">It’s not funny.</seg>
<seg id="118">The whole of the Arctic now is linked to an event tonight.”</seg>
<seg id="119">Disciplinary staff members in attendance are telling them not to take pictures and recording.</seg>
<seg id="120">"However, they photographed the entire system."</seg>
<seg id="121">It’s even for the Inuit rangers when Howard-Brown touches them and they’re pictured nearby.</seg>
<seg id="122">"Photos posted by the Riverdale Cathedral of Engineers on my website show multiple attendees at a time of decline—their faces are visible, without ice, their mouth shut, or standing on the floor."</seg>
<seg id="123">A woman in Hawaii-Brown’s hand sits on the floor below Saturday’s wall.</seg>
<seg id="124">"In front of him, Howard-Brown and his staff attend the event to connect Inuit couples."</seg>
<seg id="125">This event was originally directed to St. Jude</seg>
<seg id="126">"The event was originally intended to be at St. Jude’s Anglican Cathedral in Iqaluit, but it was changed."</seg>
<seg id="127">"That change was shifted to guests Howard-Brown, secretary of state St. Joamie said."</seg>
<seg id="128">"David Parsons, the Anglican bishop of the Arctic, said he didn’t know if Howard-Brown was going to prison in St. Jude."</seg>
<seg id="129">"If he had known it, he said he would have stopped because Howard-Brown is a big fan of it."</seg>
<seg id="130">"As a result, the community of Anglicans did not meet the terms of approval for the bishop’s event, Parsons said."</seg>
<seg id="131">"The Anglican church’s role is largely sympathetic, and works with other churches, Parsons said."</seg>
<seg id="132">"“But there is a good deal of trust, and it doesn’t deal with the unacceptable beliefs and churches that go there.”"</seg>
<seg id="133">Howard-Brown’s case appears to be a different one.</seg>
<seg id="134">“I’m not here to tell any religious people what they want.</seg>
<seg id="135">"If religion in the Arctic were to be a strategy, something would have happened in the Arctic,” she said to attendees."</seg>
<seg id="136">“I don’t come for an invitation.</seg>
<seg id="137">"In need… if you have a good light, you have to have a foundation.”"</seg>

<seg id="1">"In poor attendance, Canada launches new Arctic policy document"</seg>
<seg id="2">Liberal Democrats say the new policy represents a “big change in direction”</seg>
<seg id="3">"Many of the fugitives grew up in Cape Dorset, Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="4">"With the federal government the next day to say goodbye, the Liberal government released a long-awaited Arctic policy framework."</seg>
<seg id="5">(File photo)</seg>
<seg id="6">By Jim Bell</seg>
<seg id="7">"Earlier in the day of the national election campaign’s nomination contest, the Liberal government, largely absent, launched a long-awaited northern and northern policy framework on Sept. 10."</seg>
<seg id="8">"This letter, which marks the first step in the success of the initiative, will replace former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s 2009 Northern Strategy and Harper’s government’s 2010 Statement on Canada’s Arctic policy."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is intended to guide federal policy in the Arctic up to 2030—but there are no implementation plans or political guidelines for future activities.</seg>
<seg id="10">"These will take place in the second phase, the strategy said."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Meanwhile, this move comes from Carolyn Bennett, the minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs, who said the policy document represents “a big shift in the direction of the federal government.”"</seg>
<seg id="12">The policy’s introduction is expected to be late than expected.</seg>
<seg id="13">"This year, Bennett said that policy will be released in June."</seg>
<seg id="14">CBC reported earlier this month that a news conference in Yellowknife would be held in August.</seg>
<seg id="15">"In Liberal’s policy eight “objectives,” which include a strategy, and 10(10) “principles.”"</seg>
<seg id="16">"It covers a wide range of policy areas, including community and regional economic development, infrastructure, Indigenous rights, environmental protection, national security and foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="17">"When Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, on Dec. 20, 2016, announced that his government would like to develop new policies, he promised a “co-ordinated” approach to northern governments and Indigenous organizations."</seg>
<seg id="18">"As a result, more than 25 Indigenous organizations, including the Government of Nunavut, the Northwest Territories, Yukon, Manitoba, Quebec and Newfoundland-Labrador, took part in the conciliation."</seg>
<seg id="19">"“Through the co-ordination of Canada’s Arctic and Arctic policy strategy, our partners have helped us understand and raise awareness of the non-binding rights and practices of different regions, responsibilities and sovereignty rights across the circumpolar Arctic,” Bennett said in a news release."</seg>
<seg id="20">"And some colleagues wrote their editorial, which is published in separate policy documents."</seg>
<seg id="21">Some commenters don’t talk about federal policy</seg>
<seg id="22">"For example, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the Government of Nunavut, the Government of the Northwest Territories and the three regional governments have shared their own personal statements."</seg>
<seg id="23">But there’s something going on.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those articles submitted by organizers may not be able to represent federal policy.</seg>
<seg id="25">That’s a sign that the federal government may face a number of problems that would argue in favour of more than 31 partners.</seg>
<seg id="26">"“As part of the process, they are not entirely clear from the point of view of either the federal government or any other party,” the progress document said."</seg>
<seg id="27">The authors say their approval rating was a tough one.</seg>
<seg id="28">"“The opinions, aspirations and objectives and demands of the hearing are shared by many opinions and opinions."</seg>
<seg id="29">This means we have reached an agreement with the federal government and Indigenous parties involved in the process of getting approval.”</seg>
<seg id="30">You can find connections to the Arctic policy in the display here.</seg>
<seg id="31">8 Goals</seg>
<seg id="32">"These are the eight goals of the strategy, reflecting the federal government’s commitment."</seg>
<seg id="33">"• A strong, sustainable, diverse and sustainable community and regional economy."</seg>
<seg id="34">• Canada’s Arctic and Arctic Indigenous peoples can continue to apply and stay healthy.</seg>
<seg id="35">• In northern Canada and the Arctic Inuit are safe and secure.</seg>
<seg id="36">• A stronger industrial area where differences can be remedied elsewhere in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="37">• The rules are based in the Arctic as an effective tool for new opportunities and opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="38">• Knowledge and understanding directions for decision making.</seg>
<seg id="39">• Canada’s Arctic and Arctic livelihoods are healthy and persistent.</seg>
<seg id="40">• The partnership helps to maintain and restore trust among Indigenous and non-Indigenous people.</seg>
<seg id="41">These targets start with a wide range of “aspirations” that have been redefined.</seg>
<seg id="42">Ten foundations</seg>
<seg id="43">"Among those objectives and objectives, the policy document describes principles underneath them, which were created as “a permanent guiding principle for the implementation of the program”:"</seg>
<seg id="44">"• Decisions about the Arctic will be made in a spirit of partnership and northern engagement, in a spirit of rights, needs and northern interests."</seg>
<seg id="45">"• The rights and sanctions of the Canadian government, regional, provincial, Indigenous and local governments will be respected."</seg>
<seg id="46">"• Development must be viable and credible, from a social, cultural, economic and environmental point of view."</seg>
<seg id="47">"• Continuing the gathering of Indigenous peoples, using the results of the truth and reconciliation commission as a milestone, will be a success."</seg>
<seg id="48">"• As climate change is a reality on this planet, the strategy will focus on a wide range of areas affected, including the impact on Indigenous peoples, who depend on land and wildlife for their cultural, economic and food security."</seg>
<seg id="49">"• A policy and a program that will identify disparities and inequality, and facilitate access to resources such as a gender-specific study (Gender-based Analytica Plant) that may affect a wide range of people."</seg>
<seg id="50">"• This will be a tool for respecting multiple constitutional principles that ensure that the rights, interests and circumstances of Inuit, northern Indigenous First Nations and Métis are respected, clarified and implemented."</seg>
<seg id="51">"• The Government of Canada recognizes that Inuit, Indigenous First Nations and Métis are Indigenous peoples of Canada, in the sense of diversity, the right to know communities, which have their own history, including the federal government."</seg>
<seg id="52">"• Work to build relationships based on their right to self-determination, respect, co-operation must reflect the needs, priorities and circumstances of each person."</seg>
<seg id="53">"• All organizations, from private individuals to universities and colleges, which include non-profit organizations, community organizations and individuals across Canada, have a key role in building a stronger Canadian Arctic."</seg>

<seg id="6">"A Nunavut Conservative candidate says that if the Conservative government were to become a government, they would eliminate a carbon tax because it “raises prices for everything.”"</seg>
<seg id="7">Leona Aglukkaq started the campaign Nunavut’s trip to communities.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Nunavut’s parliamentarian, he launched his campaign in Iqaluit during a ceremony held on Sept. 12 at the Frobisher Hotel.</seg>
<seg id="9">He later flew to Rankin Inlet the next day to Iqaluit for another week.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nunatsiaq News had the opportunity to talk to Aglukkaq while she was in Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The carbon tax “raises the cost of air, shopping, shipping, hunting and homeownership,” says Aglukkaq’s campaign poster."</seg>
<seg id="12">Ms. Aglukkaq also told Nunatsiaq News that the tax has a negative impact on daycares and elders’ homes due to increased heating.</seg>
<seg id="13">“Every piece of art is affected by this carbon tax.”</seg>
<seg id="14">Ms. Aglukkaq said.</seg>
<seg id="15">“The carbon tax when we can’t afford to pay is like a carbon house.”</seg>
<seg id="16">"But George Hickes, Nunavut’s finance minister, announced in May that under a bilateral agreement in Ottawa, electricity and aviation fuels in Nunavut have been exempted from the tax."</seg>
<seg id="17">The Government of Nunavut and its subsidiaries pay half of the carbon tax in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Aglukkaq’s campaign for Nunavut has four priorities: affordable housing, mental health and infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="19">“How can we as a government and the private sector and the Government of Nunavut work together to address this massive housing needs across the North?”</seg>
<seg id="20">"Housing Aglukkaq’s campaign priorities say she would create a strategy that would include housing needs, elders’ housing and disability housing."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Federal and territorial governments must also consider introducing homeownership, Mr. Okalik."</seg>
<seg id="22">Ms. Aglukkaq also said the creation of Arctic infrastructure and mental health education for Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="23">"“Nunavut is a vast coastline in Canada and we are still left with the necessary marine resources in our communities, so we have to consider big initiatives like this in the Arctic,” she said."</seg>
<seg id="24">"“We must address the need for housing, training Nunavummiut to provide mental health services in order to support our communities.”"</seg>
<seg id="25">"When asked if he would push for a federal northern Nutrition Program, Aglukkaq said the carbon tax has increased food prices through increased airfares."</seg>
<seg id="26">"When asked if he thinks the program would pave the way, and if not, what he would do other than the carbon tax, he said he would talk to the Arctic Council."</seg>
<seg id="27">"He said that when the Conservative government becomes a government, the council would remain in existence."</seg>
<seg id="28">“It’s very important to have an Inuk in the Arctic who can tell the government how to improve the program.</seg>
<seg id="29">This is not a good program.</seg>
<seg id="30">Not everything is perfect in the world.</seg>
<seg id="31">But there has to be a subsidy for Arctic food.”</seg>
<seg id="32">"Ms. Aglukkaq declined to specify what advice she would give to northern Nutrition North, but said funding was needed for food and that “elimination” would not help."</seg>
<seg id="33">"Recently, a study published in the Canadian Health Association’s Journal of Paediatrics found that food is becoming more difficult in Nunavut than in the Arctic under Nutrition North, according to data from the Canadian Community Health Survey."</seg>
<seg id="34">"Ms. Aglukkaq said her previous work as the minister of the environment would help tackle climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but she did not give any details on how to do it."</seg>
<seg id="35">He said he would support the Kivalliq connection (hybrid) and Greece Bay route and the Kitikmeot port for ships.</seg>
<seg id="36">“Will we be able to stop using fossil fuels as soon as possible?</seg>
<seg id="37">"No,” she said."</seg>
<seg id="38">"When Conservative Prime Minister Andrew Scheer came to Iqaluit last June, he insisted Nunavut needs to develop a recycling system, saying there is “a lot of difficulty” with the current Liberal government."</seg>
<seg id="39">Ms. Aglukkaq said she believes the policies have already been put in place to talk to Inuit about renewable resources development and it’s unclear if they will be put in place now.</seg>
<seg id="40">"“The Nunavut land claims agreement provides information on how businesses should be treated in the Arctic. The land claims agreement, in my view, is the most important environmental plan."</seg>
<seg id="41">"It protects our land, protects our waters, protects our wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="42">“It’s already been set up to meet the needs of how projects should be performed.</seg>
<seg id="43">And it has made it a political issue and we have to be proud of it.</seg>
<seg id="44">"And decisions about the Arctic must come from Inuit in the Arctic, not from Ottawa.”"</seg>
<seg id="45">"Aglukkaq’s head office left Pond Inlet and Arctic Bay on Sept. 19, her office said."</seg>
<seg id="46">"He also plans to travel to Pangnirtung, Qikiqtarjuaq and Clyde River before heading to the Kivalliq and Kitikmeot regions."</seg>

<seg id="5">By Nunatsiaq News</seg>
<seg id="6">"Nunavut MLAs will soon seek the new Languages Commissioner, following the resignation of Helen Klengenberg from the position."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Klengenberg, who has served as Nunavut’s Languages Commissioner since June 2017, stepped down in the recent days of health care."</seg>
<seg id="8">"This is the Languages Commissioner’s official role in the legislative assembly of Nunavut and she is required to report back to the board, as is the current MLA for Klengenberg’s successor."</seg>
<seg id="9">"That would happen through the Management and Services Board, which is the committee of MLAs responsible for the legislative assembly’s operations, Speaker Simeon Mikkungwak said in a statement issued this past Sept. 17."</seg>
<seg id="10">"“I think that the Management and Services Board will begin the process of recruiting staff soon and we will make an announcement if necessary to fill a temporary vacancy,” Mikkungwak said in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="11">"The Languages Commissioner’s job, according to a program outlined in the Official Languages Act, is to monitor language rights in Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Klengenberg was appointed in 2017 after a long search for nearly a year, following the sudden resignation of Sandra Inutiq in June 2016."</seg>

<seg id="2">"ITK’s election campaign priorities include reducing inequality, building infrastructure, Inuit self-determination"</seg>
<seg id="3">The National Inuit Representation Association wants a broader investment strategy for Inuit Nunangat “that matches the creation of a national railway or a railway network in eastern Canada.”</seg>
<seg id="4">The Canadian Inuit Association has sent a message to anyone who will become the Canadian federation’s executive director: launching a massive national network in Inuit Nunangat that “matches the development of a national railway or railway network in eastern Canada.”</seg>
<seg id="5">"In support of that, ITK released a list of nine topics that prioritized candidates who are being considered during the current federal election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="6">“Inuit Nunangat is the least developed country in the country.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Inuit are using discrimination against other Canadians, as well as other Canadians living in Inuit Nunangat,” the ITK news release said."</seg>
<seg id="8">"In addition to that, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami also revealed the type of commitments the next federal government will make in the 2020 budget, which will likely be released in February or March."</seg>

<seg id="13">• eliminate technical problems in Inuit Nunangat by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="14">• Delay of housing delays to expire in all four Inuit Nunangat communities within two years.</seg>

<seg id="19">1.</seg>
<seg id="20">Work on social activities and suicide prevention.</seg>
<seg id="21">2.</seg>
<seg id="22">Work on housing to ensure that all refugees are allowed to live in Inuit Nunangat for two years after they were elected.</seg>
<seg id="23">3.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Work on energy as well as climate change, to ensure Canadians no longer receive greenhouse gases into the atmosphere before 2050."</seg>
<seg id="25">4.</seg>
<seg id="26">Work to strengthen Inuit-Crown partnerships.</seg>
<seg id="27">5.</seg>

<seg id="17">"In all northern regions of the world in their nineteen-seventies polar bears, there are 12 times more likely to be in Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="18">Polar bear quotas have been put in place by region (e.g. only male) of these polar bears—and the killing of polar bears in conservation areas are included in the annual polar bear quotas set by the community.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Although the new plan won’t increase the total allowable harvest at this time, new total allowable harvest may consider new data collected."</seg>
<seg id="20">"According to the previous plan, Nunavut communities were allowed to harvest one female female polar bear by means of an annual community polar bear tag."</seg>
<seg id="21">"This was only allowed in the Baffin Bay polar bear population, where there is equal access to sex and male caribou. Under the new plan, it will not matter if the polar bear population in Nunavut is male or female but must be treated equally."</seg>
<seg id="22">The next names would be given a half-legged tag.</seg>
<seg id="23">The new equivalent male-female polar bear quotas for community polar bear protection can be passed where necessary.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The deterioration of polar bears in communities has been a cause of concern in Nunavut following the deaths of two polar bears in the Kivalliq region last year—but, under the current management plan, a protective kill of a polar bear that, if it is female, could lead to the use of two tags."</seg>
<seg id="25">That’s why some communities no longer have tags available for protection against polar bears.</seg>
<seg id="26">"The new plan could encourage more communities to ban polar bears, Sussex told Nunatsiaq News."</seg>
<seg id="27">"But he earlier admitted that polar bears in attendance were harmful to Inuit culture and way of life, because they destroyed cabins, birds and seals."</seg>
<seg id="28">Attendees at the meeting in Cambridge Bay welcomed the changes to the polar bear management plan.</seg>
<seg id="29">They were also pleased that Qimirmiut will now have five more tags for the grizzly bears.</seg>
<seg id="30">There’s a large Aklak and a shot that’s too close to the cabin here in Mount Pelly.</seg>
<seg id="31">"For someone else, this new polar bear management plan may look elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Polar bears’ futures are unclear as a result of climate change, according to a 2018 study by the committee on the condition of species at risk of disappearing in Canada (COSEWIC). This committee, the type of species that may disappear in Canada (COSEWIC), re-examined polar bears as “serious concerns.”"</seg>
<seg id="33">It means that polar bears are at risk or risk of disappearing as a result of a combination of their livelihoods and identified risks.</seg>

<seg id="2">The committee will receive rumours until 5 p.m. on Oct. 11</seg>
<seg id="3">"John Main, the chair of the Standing Committee on Legislation, said the committee would extend the scope of public interest to Bill 25 and that the committee would review the bill."</seg>
<seg id="4">By Emma Tranter</seg>
<seg id="5">"Nunavut’s legislative committee on legislative assembly will continue to receive comments from the public on Bill 25, an Act to Amend the Education Act and the Inuit Language Protection Act, until Oct. 11."</seg>
<seg id="6">They were supposed to have had their final say in the attack on Sept. 13.</seg>
<seg id="7">"“I and my colleagues wish to express our appreciation to Nunavummiut for their views on this important piece of legislation,” committee chairman John Main said on Thursday, Sept. 26 in a news release."</seg>
<seg id="8">Anyone was invited to submit documents to the committee after Bill 25 was tabled in the House of Commons this spring in June.</seg>
<seg id="9">A second reading was passed and referred to a committee for review.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The committee met in mid-September to review the legislation, and made public submissions to it."</seg>
<seg id="11">The committee also announced that it would extend its review of Bill 25 to the fall sitting to allow television to be broadcast in two weeks by the end of November.</seg>
<seg id="12">"“The education minister and guests will attend the standing committee’s inquiry, which will allow Nunavummiut to observe our actions,” Main said in a news release."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Bill 25 would like to be phased in, for 20 years, with Inuktut teaching in schools from kindergarten to Grade 12."</seg>
<seg id="14">"At the same time, the legislation would introduce the Inuit Language Protection Act as part of the Education Act, and extend the deadline for the implementation of bilingual education to Grade 4-12 within the framework of a strategy that expires on July 1, 2039."</seg>
<seg id="15">"A detailed review and strategy for the committee’s inquiry will be made available in the near future, the release said."</seg>

<seg id="1">Inuktut Qajaq – Released and Progress and Appeal</seg>
<seg id="2">Our contribution today to our children and future generations</seg>
<seg id="3">The Inuktut Roman writing system—applies to all Inuit languages in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="4">Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami says it won’t replace Qanujjuaq and the Inuit Nunangat region’s traditional Qanujaq and other materials will only be used.</seg>
<seg id="5">Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami also says Inuit don’t have to change old writing systems.</seg>
<seg id="6">By Ombudsman</seg>
<seg id="7">"I was very impressed to hear that the group of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami unanimously approved the new Inuktut magazine, named after the Inuktut magazine that was released earlier this month."</seg>
<seg id="8">Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami means “the unity of Canada’s ordinary people” and a small number of good examples of what our people have long shared with them about their survival and our language.</seg>
<seg id="9">That’s encouraging to me at this time.</seg>
<seg id="10">"In June 2011, as Obama’s senior advisor to Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, we unveiled a plan to upgrade our education system."</seg>
<seg id="11">"We created a nationwide campaign for an Inuktut education in Oakland, making a 10-point trial in Oakland that showed our intelligence to our children in order to be able to stay in school, skilled, and skilled in Inuktitut and language."</seg>
<seg id="12">We’ve made our recommendations to Oliver, who has included the creation of a unified Inuit registry.</seg>
<seg id="13">They’ve been here for many years and we’ve been trying to get to the point where we’re going to have a new territory.</seg>
<seg id="14">Originally, Original language people from all the communities in the Inuit homeland shot out Inuktut in Original.</seg>
<seg id="15">That means that we will have one system in which all people learn to use their own language effectively.</seg>
<seg id="16">It’s a new system that’s going to evolve slowly.</seg>
<seg id="17">"My tusk is not going to replace the Inuktut words and change the community’s traditional writing system, as it is a tool that will be used to engage my souvenirs in improvements to Inuktut communications."</seg>
<seg id="18">Our contribution today is to our children and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="19">I can now imagine that Canadians will soon be better off communicating with and sharing the lesson and teaching materials that are going to be of great concern to us and our children who graduate from high school so that they can use both languages and speak them.</seg>
<seg id="20">"In the developing world, we are faced with an intellectual divide that has led to our attempts to cultivate our way of life, our family shape, and our language."</seg>
<seg id="21">But we’re here today.</seg>
<seg id="22">Over the past few years we have had to look at things that we want to understand today who we are and why we are here today.</seg>
<seg id="23">I believe my toothbrush is like a kingdom wearing a kingdom that we now have to look back and stay in Oakland or will we be able to use it in the future instead.</seg>
<seg id="24">The creation of an Inuktut-based Roman orthography in Canada is a testament to the fact that we all want to move forward as a single entity.</seg>
<seg id="25">"From here and eight years ago when we started to develop a national contest for Inuit education, we were able to succeed in making the word “Inuktut” mean for every single person, regardless of where they come from."</seg>
<seg id="26">It leads me to see this as an opportunity for those who live in an Inuktut-based society. Otherwise, we can see it as an opportunity for all those who live in a system that is false.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Our language and identity is sparked, and our language is healthy."</seg>
<seg id="28">I’m hopeful that we can use all of our Inuktut language and move forward in Oakland, where we’re trying to fill those geographical areas together as Inuit.</seg>

<seg id="2">“This is a big commitment”</seg>
<seg id="3">Students walk away from four foxes in Iqaluit on Sept. 27, including calls for global climate change.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three legislative candidates for the federal government said they would ban Nunavut’s reliance on fossil fuels by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="5">(Photo by Dustin Potter)</seg>
<seg id="6">By Dustin Potter</seg>
<seg id="7">"In this federal election, the three political parties said Nunavut’s use of Tesla’s fuel for electricity will be halted by 2030."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Right now all 25 communities in Nunavut have electricity generated by tea-free power plants operated by the Qulliq Energy Corporation, the only power corporation in Canada that does not have revised power grids in their communities."</seg>
<seg id="9">Changing that would be a big and costly project.</seg>
<seg id="10">"“It’s a big commitment,” said Martha Lehner, a northern renewable energy specialist for the World Wildlife Fund."</seg>
<seg id="11">"“It’s possible, just a little bit of a skill.”"</seg>
<seg id="12">The Green Party’s election campaign promises to “implement renewable energy.</seg>
<seg id="13">"By 2030, all of Canada’s electricity will go through a renewable energy system."</seg>
<seg id="14">This includes outpost camps in Arctic communities where tea is banned from fossil fuels.”</seg>
<seg id="15">"The Liberal Party said it would “move forward financially to ensure that Inuit communities in Tesla are not decommissioned from fossil fuels but have the power to use clean, renewable energy—such as water, wind and solar power—by 2030.”"</seg>
<seg id="16">As the New Democratic Party (NDP) said “to target Canada’s ability to generate non-carbon energy by 2030… this reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by emissions from communities and job creation would be a good thing.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We would assist in applying for funding through community-owned and operated clean energy projects to secure jobs for residents and authorities, as well as working with Indigenous and northern communities to eradicate the use of Tesla’s oil.”"</seg>
<seg id="18">"According to the Department of Environment and Climate Change Canada report released earlier this year, air pollution in Nunavut is less than 1 per cent of the population."</seg>
<seg id="19">"In 2017, Nunavut produced 0.6 megawatts of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide), amounting to about 18,000 carbon dioxide emissions."</seg>
<seg id="20">"That year, Alberta, which has been the country’s most polluted carbon emissions, produced about 84 million cars per capita."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Despite that, Nunavut has seen carbon emissions from vehicles more than 30 per cent since 2005, the biggest achievement in Canada and Alberta almost double, which is the second increase in the same period."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Even if the energy changes that the three legislators are trying to make to reduce their deterioration, the impact on Canada’s carbon emissions will still be small."</seg>
<seg id="23">The community has had something to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Nunavummiut pay for the largest share of electricity in all other parts of Canada, and funding for energy would reduce that gap."</seg>
<seg id="25">"However, the outcome of the renewable energy projects may be a balance sheet of payments made to existing investors in the energy sector."</seg>
<seg id="26">"Last month, the World Wildlife Fund released a report that talks about how renewable energy would be able to generate electricity in each of the 25 communities in Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="27">"They found a cut of 8 per cent—largely due to the potential danger of a business or other potential bankruptcy—Baker Lake, Coral Harbour, Iqaluit and Rankin Inlet would be saved by moving to a 20 per cent renewable energy system, including a direct payment period of about 15 years."</seg>
<seg id="28">The study also confirmed that 16 other communities with a 4 per cent discount—roughly what the Qulliq Energy Corporation would be able to rent—and roughly $2 million in compensation and 20 per cent in transfers.</seg>
<seg id="29">"But the report only talks about the feasibility of these projects, suggesting relocating a renewable energy source would cost less than the current energy cost."</seg>
<seg id="30">But relocating communities to a skilled workforce in renewable energy would be a big step.</seg>
<seg id="31">"“There would be a lot of conversations, and they would have to start next year in order to reach the energy they want to reach in every community,” said Lionel."</seg>
<seg id="32">"“They would have to go to the communities, work with them on what they want to do, and how communities envisioned in the energy sector, to see what their priorities are and communities in the most critical areas of departure and harvesting.”"</seg>
<seg id="33">"That doesn’t include the creation of a combination of solar energy or wind, which could take up to two years to fully integrate, or projects with the Qulliq Energy Corporation to ensure that renewable energy is reliable for its equipment."</seg>
<seg id="34">"Transferring every community to a 100 per cent renewable energy source, the three of which are trying to become MP, would not only take a long time but would also cost a lot of money."</seg>
<seg id="35">"The New Democratic Party (NDP) and the Liberal Party have not yet announced how much money they would give to the move, the Green Party (Green Party) said last week."</seg>
<seg id="36">"As part of his campaign’s spending report, the Green Party said it would contribute $150 million over five years to relocate all outpost camps and northern communities—not just in Nunavut—to eliminate diesel."</seg>
<seg id="37">It’s not good enough however.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Lehner explained that if a community like Arctic Bay were to relocate at least 60 per cent of its energy system, they would have to spend about $27.8 million."</seg>
<seg id="39">"According to the same report, for other communities to take 60 per cent of renewable energy, they would have to use it at a higher rate."</seg>
<seg id="40">"In Iqaluit, it’s estimated to cost about $148 million."</seg>
<seg id="41">"That’s despite the fact that it’s obviously smaller than the $250-500-million energy bill that was originally proposed in the city, that would apply to one community that the Green Party wants to subsidize."</seg>
<seg id="42">"Lennon is not expecting the federal government to pay for all of those projects, but he also said they would work and how they would be done and complicated."</seg>
<seg id="43">"Looking at the 2030 deadline, there will be no time limit."</seg>
<seg id="44">"“As for solar energy, I think it could take two to five years."</seg>
<seg id="45">"In terms of wind power, it’s likely that it will take five to seven years,” said Lionel when asked how much energy they would take."</seg>
<seg id="46">"When you look at those deadlines and divide them into 25 communities and if they’re going to be done simultaneously in remote communities and the land is not always available, Lennier thinks about how to complete them."</seg>
<seg id="47">"“I think for those who want to get there, it’s going to make a big difference."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Even if we don’t get 100 per cent, there’s a good demand.”"</seg>
<seg id="49">"Keep in mind: This book covers the federal election campaigns of the Green Party, the Liberal Party and the New Democratic Party (NDP)."</seg>
<seg id="50">"As the magazine prepared, the Conservative Party has not yet announced its nomination, so they’re excluded from this report."</seg>

<seg id="2">We must recognize the value of early childhood and child care workers in Nunavut is extremely valuable to employees</seg>
<seg id="3">"Laakuluk Williamson Patrick, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, is looking for more support from the GN for quality early learning and child care based on Inuit language and culture."</seg>
<seg id="4">By Nunatsiaq News</seg>
<seg id="5">Correspondence to Nunavut Premier Joe Savikataaq and Education from David Joanasie and Minister Joanasie</seg>
<seg id="6">I am one of those Inuit who are black people who are very passionate about our language and culture.</seg>
<seg id="7">"As the chair of the committee’s Democratic Society, Inuktut-language learning centre is the only school for children in early childhood education in Iqaluit and the only one in Iqaluit in Nunavut that delivers child care to children who are already speaking Inuktitut."</seg>
<seg id="8">"The Footprints website closed on Aug. 21 to Sept. 12, 2019 due to a shortage of staff and, furthermore, it has operated in a state of staff shortages for nearly a year."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Only a handful of people apply for jobs in the Footprints website due to low pay (Iqaluit’s most expensive day care), workers who do not have social assistance, are not provided with housing because they’re seen as a drop in women’s work in a day care centre as they see it."</seg>
<seg id="10">"The day care centre is now open again, but it’s an emergency operation that’s making it difficult: we lost a good staff member and he retired."</seg>
<seg id="11">"We now have a part-time office worker, a full-time daycare manager, two day care workers and each child with a quiet job at the day care centre (all of which are criminally inspected and safe), who works full-time, while we’re searching for a staff member, who has a skilled job."</seg>
<seg id="12">"This operation is not common, but for those of us with children, we believe that our children should be safe and speak Inuktitut so that the question can be opened."</seg>
<seg id="13">It’s still a danger to remain closed.</seg>
<seg id="14">"The operations of Nunavut’s day care workers are expected to provide one of the most important child-related services for a good education, based on Inuit culture and language, though it is priced at a low cost and not supported."</seg>
<seg id="15">The non-profit organisation relies on numerous shortfalls in annual funding and the number of children who volunteer to manage the daycare centre.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Daycare workers suffer from poverty due to lack of pay and benefits, poorly trained work and housing for staff."</seg>
<seg id="17">Daycare staff are now being asked to work below the needs of their self-sufficiency or family maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="18">The crisis that our daycares are experiencing is due to the need for unique staff to have the necessary skills to promote and preserve the Inuit language and culture of our young children; a wake-up call that hires only Inuktut-speaking people.</seg>
<seg id="19">We’re 100 per cent Inuit employees.</seg>
<seg id="20">But as we struggle with our staff turnover, we suffer from a shortage of staff due to a lack of competition and compensation for our employees.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Consequently, it has an impact on early childhood and early childhood education."</seg>
<seg id="22">Inuit deserve our full support and are valued so that our language and culture can be taught to our children.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Government of Nunavut must consider how to better support quality early learning and childcare based on Inuit language and culture.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Effective early childhood education and child care workers are paid to compete with the public and receive benefits, including housing throughout their careers, vacation, training in the workplace and in the school."</seg>
<seg id="25">The behind-the-scenes vision of childcare is to expand into the public domain and the resources to accommodate more Inuit children.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We’ve now been looking for a larger, daycare centre to succeed our vision. That’s why we’ve raised nearly $80,000 for the new site."</seg>
<seg id="27">It proposes the following amendments to the Government of Nunavut:</seg>
<seg id="28">"• a combination of early childhood and childcare staff as part of the Government of Nunavut’s staff to ensure that they have a competitive wage in the GN’s salaries, consistent with the GN’s eight-step inflation rate, applied to employees throughout the territory’s school system;"</seg>
<seg id="29">• the inclusion of the operations and maintenance of daycares in Nunavut within the framework of the education system;</seg>
<seg id="30">"• access to benefits for early childhood and day care workers but not limited to short-term spending that includes long-term medical leave, vacation, two-speech pay, maternity leave and housing"</seg>
<seg id="31">• the creation of a body to support all daycares in Nunavut;</seg>
<seg id="32">• Work with daycares to respond to the urgent challenges together so that we can work together to create a long-term plan to change the operation of the day care system.</seg>
<seg id="33">We must recognize the value of early childhood education and childcare workers in Nunavut are extremely valuable to employees.</seg>
<seg id="34">Our day care centres ensure that staff are filled with full-time jobs and that all staff are compensated.</seg>
<seg id="35">Since we have to keep our daycares open.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Changing the operation of the day care system, so that Nunavut’s early childhood and day care workers will be able to skip their careers so that they can take a significant step forward in the early learning and childcare system that changes the best way for the lives of children to begin, including learning Inuktut, growing up in solidarity with Inuit culture, and participation by Canadians."</seg>

<seg id="8">"In Montreal’s hotel room was quiet on Thursday, Oct. 3, Inuit who attended the 21st Inuit Cultural School conference as they walked in to hear two Inuit leaders speak out about why Inuktut-speaking is a fundamental right to Nunavut’s birth and that right seems to have been rejected."</seg>
<seg id="9">"NTI President Aluki Kotierk and Louis Tapardjuk, a former GN minister and member of the Inuit Uqausinginnik Taiguusiliuqtiit, the Nunavut Uqausinginnik Taiguusiliuqtiit, attended on time and sat in front of the chair of the Inuit Language Authority."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Photographers are organising a demonstration on NTI’s Facebook page, featuring video-connecting multiple internet access to English-language speakers, and attendees in nearly all Innuinaqtut were listening."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Kotierk welcomed the attendees and began speaking Inuktitut, where Inuktitut-speaking people sometimes approve of their heads and applaud them."</seg>
<seg id="12">"All those who can’t speak Inuktitut, including this writer, sat idly by and kept an eye on it."</seg>
<seg id="13">Some people just walked out.</seg>
<seg id="14">Some are just listening to their phones while they’re waiting for English.</seg>
<seg id="15">There were no English people.</seg>
<seg id="16">Welcome to an amazing landscape for many people in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="17">"“It’s called Inuit culture education so it was interesting, especially when we were talking about Inuit language, that we wanted to use the Inuit language,” Kotierk said at the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="18">“We spoke about it and we know there won’t be an interpreter but we decided it’s important to use our language when we talk about the need to support and promote our language development.”</seg>
<seg id="19">"The World Summit, which brings together Arctic experts from the Arctic and the south, in recent years, started by involving more Inuktut speakers and activists, making the conference more focused on Inuit needs and creating a better working relationship between Inuit and non-Inuit who are educated."</seg>
<seg id="20">"This Inuktitut hearing, about language as a human right, seemed to mean that it was in the process of developing it."</seg>
<seg id="21">Kotierk’s testimony spells out the many pieces of legislation that require the creation and preservation of Inuktut in Nunavut where there are a greater number of Inuit and a greater number of speakers in Inuktut.</seg>
<seg id="22">"These laws require the United Nations (United Nations) to uphold the rights of Indigenous people (and First Nations) to call for action and legal action by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the National Inquiry on Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls, and Nunavut’s language legislation."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Kotierk described hundreds of other recent Inuit deaths, in part, to language and cultural docks, such as Annie Kotierk, who died of the bluetongue epidemic in 2017, and 15-year-old Eileen Kooneeloosie, who died of tuberculosis in the same year."</seg>
<seg id="24">“Inuit want to have the right to life and have the right to life.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Canadian Inuit should not die from access to and services that are comparable to other Canadians,” Kotierk wrote in her statement."</seg>
<seg id="26">"In his opening statement, Tapardjuk referred to a recent incident in Iqaluit where officers went to an elder to say their adopted son was vaccinated against the death of a youth centre."</seg>
<seg id="27">The woman is single and cannot speak English.</seg>
<seg id="28">Tapardjuk said the police had to stop the car for help when they were going to make a bad announcement.</seg>
<seg id="29">"“There are a number of ways in which this report could have been done to counter this. Does an Inuk have an assistant to assist us in the endeavour to change his life, or did not have an interpreter,” Kotierk told Nunatsiaq News."</seg>
<seg id="30">“Many of us Inuit who speak English and Inuktitut are invited to do the work.</seg>
<seg id="31">"We are considered to be interpreters at any time, even if we don’t know the Inuit."</seg>
<seg id="32">Sometimes it’s for confidential information.</seg>
<seg id="33">"So, in that sense, I can say that violation of human rights.”"</seg>
<seg id="34">"Kotierk said that at least Inuktut speakers in Nunavut should have access to services in their mother tongue in the areas of health, justice and education."</seg>
<seg id="35">They’re not even available.</seg>
<seg id="36">That and other leaders continue to call on the federal government to protect their language and Inuit in their homes.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ottawa passed the new Indigenous Languages Act in June which has been criticized by NTI and Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami for saying its decisions have not been respected.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Kotierk said he wants people to know, “We are the ones who have the authority."</seg>
<seg id="39">Let’s talk in Inuktut when we go to the store.</seg>
<seg id="40">Let’s talk in Inuktut when we go to a bank.</seg>
<seg id="41">Let’s speak Inuktut when we go to school.</seg>
<seg id="42">"If we speak Inuktut more often and ignore those who do not understand it, then they can be given a larger share of the requirement.”"</seg>

<seg id="1">QIA announces payouts to tourism operators for Inuit self-determination</seg>
<seg id="2">Tickets automatically applied</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tourism operators who visit island communities in Nunavut will now have to pay for tourism bills if they want to have access to Inuit Nunangat, the QIA announced at the annual conference in Iqaluit on Oct. 8 to 10."</seg>
<seg id="4">"Investment in tourism operators must pay for if they want to go to Inuit communities in the Qikiqtani region, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association announced at its annual general meeting in Iqaluit on Wednesday, Oct. 9."</seg>
<seg id="5">The Qikiqtani region attracts the largest number of passengers across the territory.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Pond Inlet received 17 passengers this summer, with Iqaluit attracted four."</seg>
<seg id="7">"“The people in the Qikiqtani region have expressed concern that this is due to the increasing number of tourism activities in the region, especially in the area of humanitarian ships."</seg>
<seg id="8">"The QIA has decided to set up a tourism management fund to help Inuit in communities affected by ships,” P.J. Akeeagok, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association’s president, said in a news release."</seg>
<seg id="9">After a press release the Qikiqtani Inuit Association’s land and natural resources department issued a statement announcing the proposed new payments.</seg>
<seg id="10">New costs related to the following:</seg>
<seg id="11">• Airplane landing in Inuit Nunangat: $150 per landing</seg>
<seg id="12">• Helicopters landing in Inuit Nunangat: $100 per landing</seg>
<seg id="13">• Commercial Tammaativvik Inuit Nunangat: $50 a day</seg>
<seg id="14">• Commercial access to visitors in less than six hours of Inuit Nunangat: $25.00 a day</seg>
<seg id="15">"The merged payments would go to the Hunters and Trappers Organization closest to the tourism business that is available, the release said."</seg>
<seg id="16">Half of that would go to the Qikiqtani Inuit Association.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Ships carrying Inuit to Nunavut have a population of between 150 and 400, Roseanne Teixeira, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association’s director of land use and recycling, said at the QIA’s meeting."</seg>
<seg id="18">The $25 per day fee will apply to all passengers who fly passengers if they’re going to Inuit self-determination—or IOL (Inuit self-determination).</seg>
<seg id="19">"“Regardless of how many people on board the vessel will stay in Inuit Nunangat, they will be charged based on the number of Inuit on the vessel,” Dirijian told the board."</seg>
<seg id="20">Digvir said cruise ships that fly Inuit to the Qikiqtani region will have to submit to the Qikiqtani Inuit Association the number of Inuit passengers per month or before they start boating.</seg>
<seg id="21">"“So if a ship carrying 350 people, we’ll charge $25 per day per person."</seg>
<seg id="22">"So the larger Inuit-run cruise ships would have to pay between $10,000 and $20,000 to land in Inuit Nunangat,” Dershowitz said."</seg>
<seg id="23">"In communities where many Inuit cruise ships are attended in the summer, like Pond Inlet, their Hunters and Trappers Organization will receive between $50,000 and $70,000 in compensation payments, he added."</seg>
<seg id="24">The new payments will also benefit the QIA’s land use registration system.</seg>
<seg id="25">"In that way, tourism operators will be notified when applying for new rates to access Inuit in their own communities."</seg>
<seg id="26">Digereau said the QIA has set up a fee based on other organizations that pay for tourism.</seg>
<seg id="27">"For example, Parks Canada pays $25 per person if they’re going to Canada’s national park."</seg>
<seg id="28">"The hamlet also charges passengers for cruise ships and tourism operators to travel to their communities, Derek said."</seg>
<seg id="29">"“Ships that Inuit who have been able to travel to their own communities are penalized for that unless Inuit really come to our own communities,” she said."</seg>
<seg id="30">"Joe Atagutaluk, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association secretary/accountant, asked if it’s possible that those payments could be increased in the future."</seg>
<seg id="31">"Derbyshire said it would be a potential change, but it would have to be discussed and resolved by the QIA’s board of directors."</seg>
<seg id="32">“This is an exciting strategy.</seg>
<seg id="33">"We are once again leading the way that Inuit can benefit their communities,” Akeeagok told the council."</seg>
<seg id="34">"The payments will come into effect immediately, the QIA said."</seg>

<seg id="1">Baffinland’s massive railway passenger has raised concerns in Pond Inlet</seg>
<seg id="2">“Is Baffinland assuming that we don’t know if the NIRB or the government will pre-approve the project?”</seg>
<seg id="3">"A cruise ship from Belgium’s Brazil sits on the Bremer in Hawaiian, Germany this summer."</seg>
<seg id="4">"At the warehouse you can see two potential construction units, 33 and 34 metres high, that Baffinland Iron Mines Corp. received from Tyson Fury and shipped to the Mary River mine this summer."</seg>
<seg id="5">Two smaller houses are transported in the front yard.</seg>
<seg id="6">"These will be used to fund the railway expansion, which has not yet been approved by law."</seg>
<seg id="7">(Photo courtesy of Tyson Fury)</seg>
<seg id="8">Local leaders in Pond Inlet have complained about a massive ship carrying railway parts that Baffinland Iron Mines Corp. sent to the Mary River iron mine this summer.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Concerns about this, Baffinland proposed a railway expansion in its phase-two plan, to which authorities haven’t yet approved it, as Baffinland imported two of the 10-year-old’s ready-to-build units in Puerto Rico, Germany, to the company’s dock at the Mary River Port in north Baffin this summer."</seg>
<seg id="10">"They also ordered two of their smaller units that might be built and big railways that would be used to build them, such as their railways and land plug-in iron ore."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Baffinland, in November 2018, promised rights groups and partners at the Qikiqtani Inuit Association that it would bring in, through a list of public signatures to the NIRB and the Nunavut Water Board."</seg>
<seg id="12">But the people of Pond Inlet have finally found it.</seg>
<seg id="13">When the ship Philpott Burns arrived at Baffinland’s harbour in Mary River this past August they were carrying out regular repairs to houses that will be used in the railway expansion.</seg>
<seg id="14">When people in Pond Inlet saw a vessel near their home community they first heard of a cargo ship. Two more ships carrying railway parts shortly after arrival in the summer of 2020 and more ships are expected to arrive in the summer of 2020.</seg>
<seg id="15">“We only found out about three or four weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We see cargo loading near Pond Inlet,” Joshua Arreak, the executive director of Pond Inlet’s Hunters and Trappers Association told Nunatsiaq News."</seg>
<seg id="17">“We used to wonder why and who they were and how they were doing that.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We haven’t received any information from the NIRB, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association or the public."</seg>
<seg id="19">"We didn’t expect that,” Arreak said."</seg>
<seg id="20">“We haven’t received any information from the Qikiqtani Inuit Association or the NIRB.</seg>
<seg id="21">I don’t know.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have a problem with Inuit organizations.</seg>
<seg id="23">"They’re not keeping us informed,” Okalik said."</seg>
<seg id="24">NIRB knew about shipping this winter</seg>
<seg id="25">"Any Nunavut authority and any federal minister have rejected Baffinland’s expansion plans, which would lead to a 110-kilometre railway between Mary River and Mary River, producing another 12 million tonnes a year, and transporting up to 200 times a year of shipping iron ore."</seg>
<seg id="26">The program can’t be fully approved by the federal government until the final public announcement that the NIRB has made on Nov. 2 in Iqaluit and finishes Nov. 8 and 9 in Pond Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="27">"The NIRB, which did not seek comment on the matter with stakeholders, said it will ship a railway package in a letter sent to Baffinland this past July 25."</seg>
<seg id="28">"The NIRB told the company that if phase two is rejected, Baffinland would have to look after the shipping of goods, likely costing multiple million dollars, from the mine."</seg>
<seg id="29">They also said shipping would have no impact on the NIRB’s decision.</seg>
<seg id="30">"In an email dated Oct. 17, the NIRB’s executive director, Ryan Barry, confirmed by law that the NIRB can’t approve or approve the vessel’s activities."</seg>
<seg id="31">"“The NIRB was ready to admit that these actions would be accompanied by an investigation and that all materials for construction would have to be moved if the proposal was rejected after the committee’s inquiry,” Barry wrote."</seg>
<seg id="32">This past summer a vessel loaded with ready-to-build units for Mary River expansion to Baffinland’s railway.</seg>
<seg id="33">"One of the units, referred to as “demolition building,” is 33-metre high, with 23.5-metre weight and weight of 1,470 tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="34">"Another, referred to as “a polluted building,” is 34 metres high."</seg>
<seg id="35">"So each building, which is part of a pre-built demolition and pollution centre, is roughly equivalent to a 10-storey building—possibly higher than any other building in the eastern Arctic."</seg>
<seg id="36">But Baffinland has not yet authorised them to use them.</seg>
<seg id="37">"“Baffinland will verify these products to ‘phase two’ unless—not use this phase-two proposal until it is fully completed,” the company wrote in a July 19 report to the NIRB."</seg>
<seg id="38">Materials housed in Inuit Nunangat</seg>
<seg id="39">"In a joint submission to the authority, the QIA and Baffinland listed the assets to be housed in Inuit Nunangat, based on the QIA’s commercial leases agreement with the company."</seg>
<seg id="40">"As for Arreak and others, a process such as this one seems likely that Baffinland has already approved the project."</seg>
<seg id="41">“The people of Pond Inlet are not happy.</seg>
<seg id="42">Baffinland “s assumption is that when we don’t know the NIRB or the government will get ahead of approval of the project?</seg>
<seg id="43">"I don’t know,” she said."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Rank Tester, a technical advisor with the Pond Inlet hamlet, was approved by the mayor of Pond Inlet, Joshua Sadak, to speak to Nunatsiaq News on behalf of the hamlet."</seg>
<seg id="45">"“Baffinland has been working with a view to getting approval for phase two,” Tester said in an email."</seg>
<seg id="46">"“If the NIRB did or did not have the authority to do that, the last thing that could affect the decision would be to put more pressure on the NIRB to act as a guardian and then have to approve the proposal."</seg>
<seg id="47">"That’s an issue,” Tester said on behalf of the hamlet."</seg>
<seg id="48">"“Besides the actions, the hamlet is deciding that they should not have done so."</seg>
<seg id="49">"That’s what’s happened in the financial perspective and in the assumption that Baffinland will get approval for phase two,” he wrote."</seg>
<seg id="50">"“Our main concern is animals, marine animals and their attendance."</seg>
<seg id="51">We would be the ones most affected by it in our community.</seg>
<seg id="52">That’s our concern.</seg>
<seg id="53">"The money is not going to bring back the animals,” Joshua Arreak said on behalf of the Hunters and Trappers Organization, saying in a repeated statement in Pond Inlet over the years because of water transportation to Baffinland’s plans."</seg>
<seg id="54">"As for non-governmental organizations such as the Marine Corps of the Arctic, who have sought input into the hearing on Baffinland’s expansion plans, they said they support “responsible development” of the Mary River mine."</seg>
<seg id="55">"But they also said Baffinland’s export of large quantities of iron ore has not been able to take into account environmental impacts, and criticized Baffinland’s decision to export large quantities of iron ore from Arctic Bay in the south, which had been allowed to happen in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="56">"“It’s no surprise that residents are frustrated by the large number of imported railway parts for Mary River prior to the legislative approval of this expansion,” said Chris Tibicki, vice-president of policy and legislative affairs at the Marine Corps in the Arctic."</seg>
<seg id="57">Prepared equipment acquired by Tyson</seg>
<seg id="58">These goods that are being shipped to Mary River are part of an already built-in railway infrastructure that Baffinland has acquired at Tyson’s multi-faceted facility in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="59">"The two big houses, which were first to arrive, were designed in Birmingham, where the third manufacturer, which will be loading railways, had been built in Stirling, Berlin, the Taiwanese newspaper said."</seg>
<seg id="60">"Baffinland also ordered a loading vessel, a black transport system and multiple materials to be used for railway transport."</seg>
<seg id="61">"Equipment details of Baffinland’s submissions to the NIRB and the Nunavut Water Board included railway connections and road links, as well as plastic bags and sanitation."</seg>
<seg id="62">"Tyson’s first trip to Baffinland, a ship called the Biggins, weighed more than 5,500 tonnes of cargo, and left Birmingham in early August."</seg>
<seg id="63">"Two other shipping vessels have also shipped more materials this summer, and more will arrive in the summer of 2020, Thackeray said."</seg>
<seg id="64">"In a joint agreement with the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, Baffinland agreed to put an additional $18 million in remediation costs into the Mary River mine if the project stopped, the water board’s letter said."</seg>

<seg id="2">Inuit women make 15 per cent of attendance at the women’s centre</seg>
<seg id="3">"Mariana Buller-Wimbledon, the executive director of the Women’s Centre at the Chez Doris, Women’s Centre and Cathy Wong, a city councillor representing Peter-McGill Nunangi and spokeswoman for the Montreal city council, gave a statement on the plan for a 22-bed women’s shelter in Montreal’s downtown on Oct. 16 at a press conference for women’s shelters."</seg>
<seg id="4">(Photo courtesy of Montreal’s city)</seg>
<seg id="5">"The Montreal town of Phil-Murray has the chance to begin the expansion of a project started by women’s centre, a day-to-day centre for women who are homeless, that has been designed to change the landscape that they acquired last year."</seg>
<seg id="6">"The landlord’s decision, announced Wednesday, Oct. 16, will allow for the construction of a new home in a remote area, which will lead to an emergency evening for women."</seg>
<seg id="7">"The Women’s Centre, a women’s day centre at 1430 centimetres on the streets of Montreal, is open every day of the week for women who need help."</seg>
<seg id="8">Many of them are Inuit.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The Women’s Centre is currently located on Sammie Street, not far away from Ottawa and Copper Ice, a gathering centre for Inuit in downtown."</seg>
<seg id="10">"The women’s centre is well-known to many Inuit women, who make up 15 per cent of the centre’s population."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Set to open in the 2021 fiscal year, the building’s emergency evening destination was purchased with a compensation package of $1 million from Montreal’s entrepreneur Andrew Harper through the Joyce Community Foundation in Montreal."</seg>
<seg id="12">"“Thankfully we now have a new home, we’ll be able to accommodate 22 beds for women who are homeless,” said Maurina Buller-Wimbledon, executive director of Siege Chris, said in a news release after the incident at the women’s shelter."</seg>
<seg id="13">"“Right now, women make up 25 per cent of the homeless population in Montreal, but the resources available to women are often inadequate."</seg>
<seg id="14">This project is a positive step.”</seg>
<seg id="15">"The good news is that the centre’s expansion came to light less than a week after the person who stayed at the centre, Clara Uksuarjuak, a former Nunatsiavut resident, died on Oct. 11 at the hospital."</seg>
<seg id="16">Buller-Wimbledon told Nunatsiaq News that after Oxford’s daughter was incarcerated she was constantly ill.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Most of the people who go to the centre come to the city due to housing and legal problems, Buller-Wimbledon said."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Many of them head to the women’s shelter during the day as there are six beds, where they spend a few hours sleeping and evening outdoors."</seg>
<seg id="19">That’s changed in the hope of getting a new night’s sleep.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Right now, the women’s centre, where about 100 women are attended every day, provides services and programs for women to meet their needs for homelessness, food insecurity, mental illness and substance abuse."</seg>
<seg id="21">Buller-Wimbledon said the Inuit women’s numbers in the area have not changed much since 2018.</seg>
<seg id="22">"“Until then, we’ve been full of women who need more support than they need in clothes and shirts,” she said."</seg>
<seg id="23">"As the only women’s day centre in Montreal, Schwarz’s women’s centre opens seven days a week from 8:30 a.m. to 3:00 a.m."</seg>
<seg id="24">"To fund its operations, the women’s centre was on strike over the weekend after failing to provide services for six months in 2014 due to a lack of funding."</seg>
<seg id="25">"“We’re hoping to get financial support from Makivik, but we don’t know if we’ll get it this time,” said Buller-Wimbledon."</seg>
<seg id="26">"The Women’s Centre also runs the Inuit funding program—but the Women’s Centre does fundraising to enable it to do so, as it accounts for more than 70 per cent of its operations from $1.7 million a year."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Cathy Wong, a city councillor representing Peter-McGill’s community and spokesperson for the Montreal City Council, said in announcing the new evening destination and providing more women with “services that are offered to people who want them to be healthy and safe.”"</seg>

<seg id="1">Nunavut Liberals do not use</seg>
<seg id="2">"On fundamental questions, the Liberal did not have a good offer."</seg>
<seg id="3">Mamala Qaqqaq’s defeat on Oct. 21 has resulted in a refusal to accept Liberal policy for Nunavut and the North.</seg>
<seg id="4">Do you recall the Liberal release?</seg>
<seg id="5">Media captionThe latter.</seg>
<seg id="6">There are more than we can remember.</seg>
<seg id="7">"That doesn’t matter, because a majority of Nunavut voters released on Oct. 21, they didn’t deliver anything."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Beginning in 2015, Justin Trudeau and other Liberal governments for Nunavut have made numerous announcements."</seg>
<seg id="9">Even some of the announcements offered new details.</seg>
<seg id="10">"But in the end, the Inuit of Nunavut simply said “here.”"</seg>
<seg id="11">"But in the end, they were the loser to the party system, which, since 1961, has been the loser for Canada to make those changes: the New Democratic Party."</seg>
<seg id="12">"This isn’t too old to apologise for the mountain’s defeat that reflects his rejection of Trudeau’s efforts in the north and northwestern Canada, which includes a rejection of the repeated Inuit-Crown partnership."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Since 2015, Trudeau has worked with management organizations such as Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, Nunavut Tunngavik Inc., the Qikiqtani Inuit Association and others."</seg>
<seg id="14">But this week’s election has revealed to Nunavummiut that the Inuit-Crown relationship is not working effectively.</seg>
<seg id="15">"And that’s not surprising, because in the end Nunavut’s main questions were not liberal enough to answer."</seg>
<seg id="16">"It is well known to the vast majority of people in Nunavut that the biggest issues are economic and social issues: the ongoing housing crisis, food shortages, store-bought food and airfares, and the persistent tuberculosis and suicides that are common every day."</seg>
<seg id="17">"But during his last visit to Nunavut on Oct. 8, Trudeau had little news for those concerned."</seg>
<seg id="18">He spoke to the South Baffin about climate change and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="19">"These are matters for all Canadians, but in the run-up to this election, Nunavummiut want to hear their concerns about housing and the high cost of living."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Instead, what he said was the Sylvia Grinnell River landscape, not for Nunavut voters, but for southern Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="21">"In doing so, he did not respond to the pressing needs of Nunavummiut and the Nunavut Liberal candidate Megan Pizzo-Lyall, though he did not even help that much more than the support of the president of the Liberal party."</seg>
<seg id="22">"As for food prices and poor eating habits, the Liberals took the initiative, setting up a higher subsidy for the Nutrition North Canada Program, and providing an additional, $12.5 million a year for Indigenous harvesters in Nunavut and other parts of the northwestern Arctic."</seg>
<seg id="23">But the Harvester Support Program has to come forward and no one can say why it is.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Last Aug. 1, Trudeau played a crucial role in Iqaluit and Arctic Bay, when he signed an agreement to launch the Tallurutiup Imanga National Marine Conservation Area and promised to launch a new protected area called Tuvaijuittuq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"That’s because he’s donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to communities in north Baffin, for small harbours and for conservation jobs."</seg>
<seg id="26">He also talked a lot about conservation as an example of trying to reconnect with Indigenous people.</seg>
<seg id="27">"The problem with that approach is this: when you’re constantly shooting for tuberculosis in a overcrowded house, this “merger” doesn’t make sense."</seg>
<seg id="28">"Still, do you remember the Liberal government’s big announcement about tuberculosis?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"That’s what they did in early 2018, when Jane Philpott, then the Canadian health minister, said she would eradicate the tuberculosis epidemic in Inuit Nunangat by 2030."</seg>
<seg id="30">But Philpott. The federal minister promised responsibility for it no longer exists.</seg>
<seg id="31">"For Trudeau’s role in Jody Wilson’s Raybould and his controversial handling of SNC-Lavalin, Philpott stepped down as the chamber."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Since then, the Liberal government has rarely heard of tuberculosis in its efforts to eradicate tuberculosis."</seg>
<seg id="33">"Unlike the previous Harvesters Support Program, it’s just getting stuck in the Inuit-Crown Partnership, so it’s likely that the discussions that he’s made about the ban have put the Tuberculosis epidemic at risk."</seg>
<seg id="34">"And everyone knows that tuberculosis is at risk of poverty, poor eating and poor housing."</seg>
<seg id="35">"But in housing, Trudeau also offered an already warm and remarkable speech this summer."</seg>
<seg id="36">"And the government of Canada’s Inuit housing program, “structured” by Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, has not taken any unexpected action."</seg>
<seg id="37">We would also like to congratulate Mamala Qaqqaq on her win.</seg>
<seg id="38">"As a member of the fourth regional legislative assembly, he will need help to be heard."</seg>
<seg id="39">Let the people of Nunavut just give it a chance and support.</seg>
<seg id="40">"The Qaqqaq won two successive titles, Leona Aglukkaq and Megan Pizzo-Lyall."</seg>
<seg id="41">I hope that they don’t lose sight of the fact that they continue to serve the people of Nunavut and the North.</seg>

<seg id="1">MP questioned ministers about the $80-million expansion of the Webber Armstrong road project</seg>
<seg id="2">“Seeing my colleagues we can make a good decision on a $80-million option”</seg>
<seg id="3">"Jolie Qiniq, the MLA for Amittuq, was one of the MLAs of the Nunavut legislature who questioned the government about the $80-million expansion into Iqaluit-Nuuk’s Beyond Meat Program."</seg>
<seg id="4">Some Nunavut lawmakers have questioned the unspecified funding for the expansion of the Nuuk-and-Iqaluit Webber Centre.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Last August, the federal government committed $151 million to the project, aimed at 1,700 square kilometres of Webber Abbey Nuuk, Greenland, to fly from Baffin Island to Iqaluit."</seg>
<seg id="6">From there, that would eventually bring it to Kimmirut.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The Government of Nunavut will finalize the design and launch of the project, which will be completed in 2023."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Last year, MLAs approved the project, which was supposed to cost $126 million."</seg>
<seg id="9">"“Later this year, we were informed that the project’s cost had increased due to inflation and is now estimated to be at $209 million,” John Main, the MLA for Arviat North-Whale Cove, said in a membership statement Wednesday, Oct. 23."</seg>
<seg id="10">"That’s a $80 million difference, Main said."</seg>
<seg id="11">"“Look at my colleagues we can make a good decision on the value of $80 million,” Main said."</seg>
<seg id="12">Federal funds come from outpost camps and northern communities for the Investing Canada Plan (Canada Funding Plan).</seg>
<seg id="13">The project is now on the parliamentary committee to review the spending plans for 2020-21.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Later in the day of question period, Jolie Qiniq, the MLA for Amittuq asked Quassa Kusugak, the Minister of Community and Government Services, about the $80-million expansion that the government is planning to do if it works."</seg>
<seg id="15">"That process, as defined in the GN’s capital planning contribution, “aims to ensure that the program has clear interpretations, and access to information about its development, timelines and timelines, prior to the start of cost planning.”"</seg>
<seg id="16">"“Has the pre-planning work been done, whether or not?”"</seg>
<seg id="17">The invitation asks Kushner.</seg>
<seg id="18">“The planning has been completed and the cost is still being looked at.</seg>
<seg id="19">"When we were informed, we found it was going to cost a lot more,” Kusugak said."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Main, a neighbouring seat in the legislature, is standing up to ask another question from Kusugak."</seg>
<seg id="21">“Can the minister tell us how this massive project costs inflation over the course of the year?”</seg>
<seg id="22">"Ms. Kusugak adds that after the proposed budget was approved last year, the department reviewed the project and increased its cost after reviewing it."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Kushner added that, in May 2019, his department estimated that its funding request would need to increase to $201.6 million “to maximize federal funding to make available if the program is needed.”"</seg>
<seg id="24">"The next day, on Oct. 24, Main stood up again in an interview with Finance Minister George Hickes on the same issue."</seg>
<seg id="25">"“According to the Financial Management Board, what specific actions and actions were taken when they were notified of the department’s $80-million cost increase in the cost of the project?”"</seg>
<seg id="26">Main asked.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Hickes said due to the federal funding expansion of the project, and including a successful marine research facility, the GN also increased its funding."</seg>
<seg id="28">“The Department of Community and Government Services gave it back to the Financial Management Board for this reason when they found the funding shortfall.”</seg>
<seg id="29">"Hicks also said the GN’s half-term (25 per cent) contribution to the project, while the federal government has a 75 per cent contribution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"“As a Nunavut government, we don’t have a $80 million bill, we’ll have to pay that 25 per cent."</seg>
<seg id="31">"So we’re going to try to find… in the next few years… something that would benefit from the completion of this project,” he added."</seg>

<seg id="1">"Nunavik must have its own federal regulator, says Makivik President"</seg>
<seg id="2">Charlie Watt’s election calls for federal government to change</seg>
<seg id="3">"Charlie Watt, the president of Makivik Corp., issued a news release on Oct. 22 following a federal election, saying Nunavik should have its own federal regulator."</seg>
<seg id="4">By Elaine Anselmi</seg>
<seg id="5">"Makivik Corp. President Charlie Watt’s comments did not reflect Nunavik’s political location in the celebration when he announced the creation of the new MLA, Silvie Barroso."</seg>
<seg id="6">"“We’re going to look to the Electoral Boundaries Commission to better understand that, in fact, Nunavik now has its own political party that focuses on our territory, it’s preferable to do so in the light of our own self-determination project,” she said."</seg>
<seg id="7">“We need this as a provincial government.”</seg>
<seg id="8">"Abbey-James Bay-Nunavik is Nunavik’s largest federal government political party in Quebec, starting from Nunavik to the south of Paula Valley-De-Ore to the Nunavik community, where there are four of the six 2019 federal candidates living in the region, including Barbari to the Quebec region."</seg>
<seg id="9">Nunavik’s leaders have sought to form their own government for their homeland since 1972.</seg>
<seg id="10">"In 2002, the Kativik Regional Government, along with Makivik, went to the federal electoral district commission for that reason and attended it again in 2011."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Since the division was expanded in 2013, adding two communities in the south."</seg>
<seg id="12">"The regions were re-engineered, according to the commission, to try to balance the Inuit population."</seg>
<seg id="13">"In Quebec, it stands at 100,000 people in the region, while Abbey-James-Nunavik-Eye is less than 85,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="14">"With Nunavik’s population at about 13,000, Nunavik’s population is far below that, but its leaders have responded to that challenge in Nunavik’s self-determination."</seg>
<seg id="15">"The smallest federal jurisdiction is Labrador, with a population of about 26,000, while Newfoundland has a population of about 80,000."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Pomeroy won the north of Quebec, with a vote of more than 11,000, or 40 per cent, followed by the Liberal and Conservative candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Watt celebrated Green Party candidate Kara Kapana-Whitley, an Inuk from Kuujjuaq, who won the fifth vote with more than 1,000 votes."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Speaking to Watt, he welcomed Pomeroy to visit Nunavik as soon as possible."</seg>
<seg id="19">"“I look forward to the gathering, and his support for self-determination is something that I’m very pleased about, as well as raising issues like the implementation of the United Nations Act on the rights of Indigenous people,” Watt said."</seg>
<seg id="20">"There was much news for Blacklead Corp. president Eilish-François Blanchett, whose split Party won 32 seats for Quebec."</seg>
<seg id="21">"“We look forward to supporting us in our development work in Nunavik—through our legislative and economic processes—and to being able to establish a legitimate partnership,” said Watt."</seg>
<seg id="22">"“However, in Quebec’s desire for independence, Inuit have long advocated for a unified Canada.”"</seg>
<seg id="23">"Watt organized the previous election, with those Liberal seats largely unseated in the current government, a chance to bring the different parties together and bring Canada together."</seg>
<seg id="24">"“Justin Trudeau has a strong government that does not have any seats, and he can work with other Party (political parties)—NDP, BlackCorp., Green, Conservative and Independent candidates—to pass legislation and bring it to Parliament, and in the process of consolidating it,” he said."</seg>
<seg id="25">"For Nunavut’s newly elected NDP MLA, Mamala Qaqqaq of Baker Lake, made some surprising comments."</seg>
<seg id="26">"“I remember the NTI meeting in Baker Lake in 1871 with Tagak Curley,” Watt said."</seg>
<seg id="27">“At that time we were young.</seg>
<seg id="28">"They will do a good job, I apologise, and I look forward to seeing you and working with you about Inuit self-determination at the same time, for the next generation.”"</seg>

<seg id="1">"Reinforcing anti-Semitism in RSV in Nunavut, thousands say"</seg>
<seg id="2">"“For Inuit, you should save money on the number of people living with lung cancer”"</seg>
<seg id="3">This flight of emergency services to Nunavut’s Lightine is on hold at the Iqaluit International Airport this summer while performing flights.</seg>
<seg id="4">"In some years, when infants with lung disease (RSV, which he just quoted), have to be flown out of the lung and hospital for a considerable amount of money."</seg>
<seg id="5">"These are Dr. Anna Panerjee and her fellow teachers at Toronto University’s health school who attended a workshop in 1989 for the first time under the change.org at the end of September, and for about 1,000 signatures to be agreed."</seg>
<seg id="6">"But when the release was finally recorded, 23,322 names had gathered—and now they’d like to reach 25,000 signatures."</seg>
<seg id="7">His introduction suggests that the Government of Nunavut would prevent many deaths and reduce the need to go to the hospital for a baby reinforcing a health-care system called the palizumab for all infants under six months.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The Paliuzzo virus is a non-vaccination program, though it’s not vaccinated, and it’s on the market under the name Synonymous."</seg>
<seg id="9">"It is officially defined in infants with lung cancer that begins with RSV, a summary of which is “a sparrows,” which he quoted from the bottom of the lungs, and becomes a disease that poses a serious threat to what is called a psychiatric network."</seg>
<seg id="10">"But Dr. Michael Patterson, the president of health care in Nunavut, told Nunatsiaq News in an interview that the Government of Nunavut contributes 11 per cent to 12 per cent of babies under the age of 2."</seg>
<seg id="11">"“We use it more often for infants at risk of serious RSV, as well as for those who support the planet’s submission of the palivizumab,” she said."</seg>
<seg id="12">"These include infants born to Inuit, who are under 35 weeks of pregnancy, or babies with lung cancer or heart disease."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Benoji, a professor of pediatrics at the Toronto University of Philadelphia, has published curriculum over the last 15 years about the ongoing presence and cost of RSV in the Arctic."</seg>
<seg id="14">"According to the study, he has strongly criticized the current Nunavut policy and said all Nunavut babies need this health-care system."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Dr. Anna Pannoye, one of the professors of pediatrics at the Toronto University of Pharmacy, said after studying the Inuit infant vaccination program called the palivic lab would benefit lives and financially."</seg>
<seg id="16">Nunavut’s cost of living makes it worthwhile</seg>
<seg id="17">He said in his research that the RSV epidemic is permanent and has resulted in the creation of a large number of air transport and medical facilities for the Nunavut Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The cost of prevention is high: about $5,600 per medicine."</seg>
<seg id="19">"But despite that cost, Benjamin and many believe that’s a cut."</seg>
<seg id="20">"That’s because Nunavut often suffers from illness and is the best medivac service, they answer."</seg>
<seg id="21">"“We’ve done a lot of cost-benefit analysis that shows that in the Arctic if we give the majority of palivic navigation, it’s going to save money,” he said in an interview."</seg>
<seg id="22">"The cost-benefit analysis, published in 2013, found hundreds of cases of lung cancer in the Kitikmeot’s infants: it was set at 389 out of 1,000."</seg>
<seg id="23">"In its inspection, which took place from Jan. 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010, it found that the cost of living in the hospital for that illness reached $57,535."</seg>
<seg id="24">"In the Qikiqtani region, lung cancer among infants came in 2002 from 1,000 newborns and in the Kivalliq region, from 230 out of 1,000 newborns."</seg>
<seg id="25">That means the GN has spent $5.9 million on sicknesses in the Qikiqtani region and roughly $5.7 million on the Kivalliq Infant Patient Disease that was the case in its study.</seg>
<seg id="26">"However, it was, Kivalliq had the highest proportion of lung cancer patients in hospital: $63,686."</seg>
<seg id="27">"“For Inuit, it’s saving money, because of the high rates of lung cancer in Nunavut,” she said."</seg>
<seg id="28">Superintendent of Ontario nurses supports registration</seg>
<seg id="29">“Inuit infants are 10 times more likely to receive hospital treatment for lung cancer than the “vulnerable” infants and the disease is even more serious in its effect.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Despite the devastating consequences, Inuit infants in Nunavut do not receive any health prevention programs,” Gandhi wrote in his donation."</seg>
<seg id="31">"It’s also the position of experts identified at the University of Winnipeg School of Health, the National Health Organization and the National Health Research Institute for Indigenous people."</seg>
<seg id="32">But the wealthy babies in Nunavut who graduate with the birth certificate do not receive—even if they come from vulnerable communities other than Iqaluit and suffer most from lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="33">Benjamin says that’s why they’re doing the wrong thing.</seg>
<seg id="34">“I’ve worked really hard.</seg>
<seg id="35">I’ve also shown my description to the public.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Carolyn Bennett, Jane Philpott, has seen my list and said they’re spiritual,” she said."</seg>
<seg id="37">Nunavik vaccinates all infants</seg>
<seg id="38">"He also warned that, unlike Nunavut, health workers in Nunavik have handed the palizumab to all babies over the past three years."</seg>
<seg id="39">"In the Nunavut legislature on Oct. 18, Health Minister George Hickes said in response to questions from Iqaluit-Apex MLA Pat Angnakak, that the GN should review Nunavik’s practices."</seg>
<seg id="40">"“We’re trying to track that program,” said Hickes."</seg>
<seg id="41">Arnakaq said the RSV (tuberculosis) has a devastating effect on families.</seg>
<seg id="42">"“Recently, I know the baby had to be sent to the RSV and it had a big impact on the family, especially when it was a baby."</seg>
<seg id="43">But Hickenlooper defended the GN’s current approach and said it’s not the government that saves Inuit money until they provide it.</seg>
<seg id="44">“This is not a legal or policy decision at all.</seg>
<seg id="45">"It depends on the best health care experience,” Hickes said."</seg>
<seg id="46">Patterson adds that Nunavik went ahead three years ago with a start-up for infants under six months.</seg>
<seg id="47">"“We’re still waiting for that number, and if we’re fully aware of the fact that there’s no savings to be made by using the palivic navigator, then we’ll have to implement it quickly,” Patterson said."</seg>
<seg id="48">"But in his view, there is still a lack of concrete indicators for enforcement in Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="49">"“There are two things I don’t agree with in the plebiscite and the other one that reveals that it’s already been completed, or that there’s any scientific evidence to that effect."</seg>
<seg id="50">"There were a lot of people still asking questions,” she said."</seg>
<seg id="51">The legacy of the use of the palivic navigation system in Nunavut has come from a long time ago.</seg>
<seg id="52">"In 2008, the Government of Nunavut rejected or participated in the Benjamin’s assessment of RSV, even though officials from Greenland, Nunavik and the Northwest Territories chose to participate."</seg>

<seg id="9">“Buildings in the Arctic are too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="10">It started from there.”</seg>
<seg id="11">Out of that they’ve developed the design of small units that take into account Arctic climate conditions.</seg>
<seg id="12">The houses contain metal and 10-inch winds that are unhealthy and can last longer than they normally use.</seg>
<seg id="13">"They’ve been built with fibre optic fixtures, roofs and roofs and three-storey windows to prevent the heat from outside."</seg>
<seg id="14">"They have floor-to-ceiling furnaces, not least a wall-to-wall furnace, to match the average temperature in the entire building."</seg>
<seg id="15">"“I think that’s the only way in the Arctic,” Godfrey said."</seg>
<seg id="16">“There’s a lot of problems with heat and heat that go into certain areas.</seg>

<seg id="22">"Nunavik builders have multiple conditions for small units, four bedrooms, and locations listed for them."</seg>
<seg id="23">"They can add an additional bedroom and can be expanded, for example, if they are larger than their children."</seg>
<seg id="24">"The building featured in Kuujjuaq is a one-bedroom, size five metres by garage and 10 metres by Tokyo."</seg>
<seg id="25">It sits at the end of the building’s kitchen and living area.</seg>
<seg id="26">The bedroom is just behind and beyond the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="27">Their power plant is located behind another building.</seg>
<seg id="28">It took more than two hours for the building to be completed by placing it in the walls and fixing the walls and pipes.</seg>
<seg id="29">"The building can be bought for $228,000, connected and all inside, said Gatba."</seg>
<seg id="30">"Nunavik’s house is priced between $500,000 and $600,000, he said."</seg>
<seg id="31">"“We’re trying to build affordable housing that’s safe to house and has problems with their water routes,” said Godfrey."</seg>
<seg id="32">"“I’m a plumber, a kingfisher and a lot of repairs have been done over the last year and a lot of repairs have been done, the plumbing is inadequate, the heating system is inadequate."</seg>
<seg id="33">I’ve built that many years and we’ve now got something that would be better suited to the Arctic.”</seg>
<seg id="34">"The houses are built in Sherrock, Quebec, and during the month of construction, Godfrey said, and they were delivered by cargo by sealift."</seg>
<seg id="35">"After we receive the order and if the booking is done on time for shipping, the building can stay in its location for the next summer."</seg>
<seg id="36">"“In the future, if this works, we’re hoping to build facilities in the Arctic,” she said."</seg>
<seg id="37">“But this requires a lot of money.”</seg>
<seg id="38">He added that housing in the circumpolar Arctic would be ideal and would be very happy to receive any order from Nunavut or Greenland.</seg>

<seg id="11">"“This is the first time I’ve seen this freeze in my lifetime,” said Willie Aglukkaq, a resident of Gjoa Haven for nearly 40 years."</seg>
<seg id="12">It’s true.</seg>
<seg id="13">"This past Oct. 15 the sea ice’s glaciers were at 5.118 million square kilometres, having been the lowest since the start of the writing system in 1968."</seg>

<seg id="30">"“As a result of global warming from Inuit-driven vehicles, we’ve seen a decline in the sea ice thick since 1979,” said Pascal Patuji, director of the GRID-Geneva, in a news release released by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"Unlike the current trend this year in the Arctic, the declining sea ice has contributed to Arctic warming over the years."</seg>
<seg id="32">"According to the release, “Temperatures have risen to 0.5 degrees Celsius in the last 10 years between 1982 and 2017, largely due to the effects of the sun shrinking in 1979."</seg>

<seg id="14">"In his 10-year career as an emergency medicine officer for the Canadian Rangers, Arviat close to him has lived in a tent in the wintertime."</seg>
<seg id="15">"“So I understand the snow, I understand the cold, but they have also had to be activated."</seg>
<seg id="16">It seems like it can be in another world and that’s why I’ve brought it here.</seg>
<seg id="17">"And the department is in a state of chaos,” said Howard, referring to Iqaluit’s firefighters’ collection—some of whom are firefighters and some who just provide assistance."</seg>
<seg id="18">That’s all Howard didn’t make it to Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="19">Adding to their experience as a former firefighter and ambulance—something that rarely happens in other areas—was also the cause of the Iqaluit fire.</seg>
<seg id="20">"“The history of this department is overwhelming,” said Howard."</seg>
<seg id="21">"“It’s a lot of work here, and I see their equipment stay in place.”"</seg>
<seg id="22">"The trends in the department’s approach to the area, and now Howard, a new area in the region, from water shortages and a lack of volunteers, to the area’s fires and the fire hall is too small."</seg>
<seg id="23">“We can’t change that overnight and it seems like there’s not a lot of change that’s happening overnight.</seg>
<seg id="24">"If we continue to move forward and do not go backwards, I’d be happy,” said Howard."</seg>
<seg id="25">"“For me, it’s a exciting project."</seg>
<seg id="26">"It’s disappointing, it’s about how we’re going and what we know can do now.”"</seg>
<seg id="27">"As for the first question about the city’s appointment as director of emergency services, “I’m Toronto’s assistant,” said Howard with a smile."</seg>
<seg id="28">“It’s good to see some of the fire hall’s supporters in Toronto.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I brought a flag, so we’ll be able to show you through our car if the Stanley Cup wins in 20-30 years.”"</seg>

<seg id="9">"Kuduka sees Egli Kumar as he tells the patients of Nunavik’s guardian at the Olympic Hotel, where they live in multiple rooms, 39 in total, on the first floor of the building when it’s full."</seg>
<seg id="10">Kuduka called her mother and told her she would never be there again.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The hotel’s president, Seattle Abdullah Noor, told Nunatsiaq News last week that he’s surprised by the sightings."</seg>

<seg id="2">“Inuit have to be involved in the process.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It has impact on all people’s lives,” said NTI president"</seg>
<seg id="4">"Representatives from Igloolik and Pond Inlet are listening to Aluki Kotierk, NTI’s president, on a motion to suspend the NIRB’s final hearing on Baffinland’s phase-two expansion on Wednesday, Nov. 6 in Iqaluit."</seg>

<seg id="7">"The NIRB’s hearing on Baffinland Iron Mines Corp.’s proposal to expand the Mary River iron mine suddenly ended, with two more days of hearings held in Pond Inlet."</seg>
<seg id="8">"On Wednesday, Nov. 6, NTI President Aluki Kotierk issued a motion calling for an immediate moratorium on the final public hearing and for the hearing to continue for eight months next year."</seg>
<seg id="9">A series of silent testimony from witnesses appeared to pave the way for his colleagues. Members looked at Baffinland’s decision to take action on the situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Baffinland officials pulled their faces, sometimes pulling their fingers and turning their backs on Kotierk’s motion."</seg>
<seg id="11">“We are concerned that this public hearing will be completed without the schedule being completed.</seg>
<seg id="12">Inuit need to be heard and engaged in constructive discussions.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Everyone here wants to understand all the outcomes and how they affect NTI and the unions,” Kotierk said while the chamber is full of witnesses and Inuit."</seg>
<seg id="14">"It has impact on all people’s lives,” she said"</seg>
<seg id="15">"The resolution was released on the day of the fifth hearing in Iqaluit, about an hour later."</seg>
<seg id="16">The NIRB’s first order was designed to continue the hearing in Pond Inlet to allow communities to participate on Nov. 8 and 9.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The NIRB approved NTI’s motion, which suspended the hearing and suspended the Pond Inlet gathering."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Throughout the week, Baffinland’s representatives for those who wanted to have an opportunity to say they plan to build a railway north of Mary River to dock."</seg>
<seg id="19">"With the railway and other parts of the dock, it would be easier for the company to produce a larger amount than it currently produces six million tonnes of iron ore a year to 12 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="20">"But it’s worth noting this week that Baffinland’s proposal to modify its program to remove its production limit and possibly create a cap on shipping, 20 times the length of the railway back and 176 shipping a year."</seg>
<seg id="21">"The resolution’s dismissal was supported by all those who wished to have the opportunity to speak, many of whom expressed concerns about the uncertainty surrounding the project."</seg>
<seg id="22">"P.J. Akeeagok, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association president, told Nunatsiaq News that he believes the NIRB process works to ensure “people have the opportunity to ask questions about these values” and “it’s an opportunity for residents to voice their concerns that remain.”"</seg>
<seg id="23">"Akeeagok also said the motion was not expected, but it was fully in place on the final day of the hearing."</seg>
<seg id="24">Baffinland’s employees look at Kotierk’s motion to dismiss the ban.</seg>
<seg id="25">“What I think is that there are too many questions that haven’t been solved.</seg>
<seg id="26">"In my view, if you’re going to make a decision in the future, then you have to be well informed to make a decision."</seg>
<seg id="27">There was no shortage here.”</seg>
<seg id="28">Representatives from north Baffin communities also voted in favour of the motion.</seg>
<seg id="29">"“There is a need for information and research,” said Amanda Hanson Main, a research officer at Pond Inlet’s Hunters and Trappers Organization."</seg>
<seg id="30">He said the project “may have serious implications for our values and for our people and for the world we live in.”</seg>
<seg id="31">"Some participants in Kippur said they were opposed to the Mary River project, and encouraged Baffinland to continue its work in Nunavut, but there were too many questions and concerns about the proposed expansion."</seg>
<seg id="32">"“What we’ve heard is too personal and inappropriate,” said Peter Ivalu, a hamlet representative from Igloolik."</seg>
<seg id="33">“Every message has to be interpreted.</seg>
<seg id="34">Everything must be transparent.”</seg>
<seg id="35">"The GN also agreed with the resolution, which noted that there is too much disagreement among those who have asked to have the opportunity to speak and a supplier that only stops."</seg>
<seg id="36">"The Government of Canada also supported the motion, but said the NIRB can make decisions on how long the ban will take."</seg>
<seg id="37">"Through its legal team, Baffinland said it opposes the resolution’s suspension for eight months and opposes the resolution before being announced."</seg>
<seg id="38">"“All those who came to the announcement of the hearing were likely to continue until Nov. 2,” said Brad Armstrong, a lawyer for Baffinland."</seg>
<seg id="39">“None of them said no plans to start this day.</seg>
<seg id="40">No one of those comments was there to stop them from getting there.”</seg>
<seg id="41">"Megan Lord-Hoyle, the vice-president of recycling for Baffinland, said the delay would affect “immediate problems” with the project."</seg>
<seg id="42">"“But we’ll do all we can to ensure the continued provision and protection of 3,000 Canadians in the labour market, 476 of whom are Inuit."</seg>
<seg id="43">We have to know that Inuit will work with us.</seg>
<seg id="44">"We need time to figure out how much of a negative impact the project will have,” Lord-Hoyle said."</seg>
<seg id="45">"Although the QIA says it can’t help in phase two, Akeeagok said it will continue to work on the Inuit communications program and that the project’s economic potential will be limited."</seg>
<seg id="46">“We’re opposed to Mary River.</seg>
<seg id="47">We’re working with them.</seg>
<seg id="48">We own the Inuit Nunangat centre.</seg>
<seg id="49">"We support Inuit employment,” she said."</seg>
<seg id="50">“We’ve spent a lot of money and a lot of work to ensure that the project is economically viable for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="51">"So with that in mind, we have to find the right balance."</seg>
<seg id="52">But there are none at this time.”</seg>
<seg id="53">Akeeagok also said the community’s uncertainty about the railways’ impact on our caribou is crucial.</seg>
<seg id="54">"“As an Inuk, they have a direct impact on our cultural rights."</seg>
<seg id="55">"And it was very clear to elders that while they’re here they don’t think of themselves alone, it’s another matter for the future."</seg>
<seg id="56">That’s what I’m focusing on.</seg>
<seg id="57">"My decisions now are not just for now, but for the next generation."</seg>
<seg id="58">Do I leave them with a better foundation than they used to be?</seg>
<seg id="59">"That’s more based on decision-making, no matter how you behave,” she said."</seg>
<seg id="60">"In a motion, the NIRB allowed those who wished to speak to it to write a letter until Nov. 15."</seg>
<seg id="61">"From there, the NIRB will provide a written submission to the motion and the length of its wait times."</seg>

<seg id="1">Nunavut MLAs agree to amendments to the Income Tax Act</seg>
<seg id="2">“Our government is working hard to bring carbon pricing back to our economy instead”</seg>
<seg id="3">"MLA Adam Mitchison interviewed Finance Minister George Hickes about Bill 26, An Act to Amend the Income Tax Act, at the legislative assembly’s hearing on Wednesday, Nov. 6."</seg>
<seg id="4">Nunavut MLAs have renewed the Nunavut Income Tax Act to amend the carbon tax bill.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The changes, which were read for the third time on Wednesday, Nov. 6, included an increase in the personal liability from $13,325 to $16,000."</seg>
<seg id="6">"That’s because taxpayers would earn nearly $3,000 a year before they had to pay Nunavut’s income tax."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Another change is the increase in the cost of living from $1,200 to $1,500."</seg>
<seg id="8">"That means that if taxpayers earn more than $60,000 to do their job they will receive an additional $300 in income tax."</seg>
<seg id="9">And Nunavut’s business tax rates for small businesses dropped from 4 per cent to 3 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="10">"“Our government is working hard to ensure that carbon pricing is reinvested in our economy,” said Finance Minister George Hickes."</seg>
<seg id="11">"The federal government’s fixed carbon tax rates applied in Nunavut on July 1, in a bid to make fuel prices more stable—would have increased by 5 cents per litre—the Government of Nunavut introduced a carbon-based rebate program."</seg>
<seg id="12">"In a debate on the proposed income tax reform, Nunavut MLAs agreed that carbon tax revenues should be returned to Nunavummiut."</seg>
<seg id="13">But they could not agree on how best to do so.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Adam Lightstone, the MLA for Iqaluit-Manirajak, was concerned that, with a reduction in income tax rates, the government would have to use carbon tax rates for government operations."</seg>
<seg id="15">“It’s my understanding that we’re very much in need of federal funding and that our own economy only gets 10 per cent to 15 per cent of our contributions.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We really have to use our own investments to run our operations,” said Lightstone."</seg>
<seg id="17">“Why is the government attempting to use carbon tax rates to benefit government operations?”</seg>
<seg id="18">"“The carbon tax rates that we’ve developed will only be a small part of the Government of Nunavut and have tried to fit our own carbon footprint,” replied Hicks, adding, “I don’t think we’d be very comfortable if we just put these carbon rates in place for other revenues and don’t put that money back into the payers’ pockets.”"</seg>
<seg id="19">Lightstone also said that amending the Income Tax Act would be the most appropriate way to reimburse Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="20">"They also said that the carbon tax subsidy will go to the Government of Nunavut to ensure it was used as a tool, reducing Nunavut’s carbon emissions."</seg>
<seg id="21">“Climate change is a big issue for me and a lot of work needs to be done for now and for our future.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Having said that, I have presented any suggestions to our government on how to develop or take action to reduce Nunavut’s energy consumption,” said Lightstone."</seg>
<seg id="23">“Why have these ideas not been considered and demanded to be used to curb carbon taxation costs?”</seg>
<seg id="24">Hicks responded by saying that each department—responsible for specific projects—is listening.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Some departments have begun work with the department, including the Qulliq Energy Corporation, which has a mandate to install energy-efficient LED street lights in Nunavut which was approved at its recent meeting."</seg>
<seg id="26">"In 2019-20, the GN expects to generate 12 million carbon tax dollars."</seg>
<seg id="27">That would be broken down:</seg>
<seg id="28">• Two million dollars in government spending on more expensive heating systems for social housing and government housing for schools and health centres.</seg>
<seg id="29">• 3.6 million dollars for a new Nunavut carbon recovery.</seg>
<seg id="30">• 6.2 million dollars in return for Nunavummiut and Nunavut jobs this year through the introduction of amendments to the Income Tax Act.</seg>
<seg id="31">But for Lightstone it’s not a good math combination.</seg>
<seg id="32">"“Given the 50 per cent reimbursement of a petrol station and the 50 per cent reimbursement of carbon taxation payments, why is it so small to have an energy efficiency strategy?”"</seg>
<seg id="33">"Hicks responded that while the federal government’s fixed carbon tax increases every year over the next five years, and even if the 50 per cent reduction in refineries will go ahead, next year’s increase in taxpayer revenues will generate additional revenue for other projects."</seg>
<seg id="34">The law received second reading on Nov. 6 and received third reading this evening.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Despite that, Lightstone, who gave birth yesterday, said she was only sleeping with the legislative assembly for three hours and left."</seg>
<seg id="36">"In a subsequent email to Nunatsiaq News, Lightstone said he opposes the vote on the act."</seg>
<seg id="37">"“I don’t agree with the conditions of Bill 26, I don’t think it’s a good format for next year’s policy,” wrote Lightstone, who would have liked to call the legislative assembly."</seg>
<seg id="38">“The purpose of the carbon tax is to reduce emissions from fossil fuels and dust from industries and to address climate change.</seg>
<seg id="39">"If the legislation includes an energy-related tax rebate for individuals and businesses who want to reduce energy consumption, or if the Government of Nunavut had developed a strategy that would help people buy and shape energy efficiency then I would have been very happy to agree to the act.”"</seg>
<seg id="40">Even Lightstone’s opposition to the legislation was passed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Hickenlooper said he can easily hear opinions on how to use carbon dioxide revenues to reduce Nunavut’s carbon footprint.</seg>
<seg id="42">“I encourage everyone to write to their MLAs or the government that respects the options available to them.”</seg>

<seg id="6">"This is the case for Nunavut’s annual tourism report for 2018-19 from the Department of Economic Development and Transportation, which was tabled in Parliament earlier this month."</seg>
<seg id="7">"The same people who came here spent a total of $271,383,000 on participation and travel costs."</seg>
<seg id="8">The report does not give details of how much they have spent elsewhere in the journey.</seg>
<seg id="9">"On balance, there were roughly 16,750 visitors from Nunavut who did not live in the territory from May to October 2015, according to the then-annual Nunavut visitor exit survey."</seg>
<seg id="10">"The Baffin and Kivalliq regions are best visited from July to September, 2018."</seg>
<seg id="11">"The island was visited by 95,600, of which more than half (53.2 per cent) came to Iqaluit with a budget of $75.1 million."</seg>
<seg id="12">Pond Inlet and Pangnirtung are the second and third communities visited here in the Baffin region.</seg>
<seg id="13">"In the Kivalliq, Rankin Inlet received 33,600 visits and spent $68 million, followed by Baker Lake and Arviat."</seg>
<seg id="14">Cambridge Bay was the Kitikmeot’s most visited region.</seg>
<seg id="15">Drinking water from Owen Olson’s research vessel flew from Yukon to Kimmirut in August 2019.</seg>
<seg id="16">"And in 2018, 3,404 cruise ships travelled to Nunavut within two and a half months."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Shipping Inuit vessels operators spent $388,351 on community service, the report said."</seg>
<seg id="18">But climate and sea ice had about 50 per cent of the ships that wanted to visit Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The agency received the status of eight passengers who operated in 23 modes of transport in Nunavut from July to September, 2018."</seg>
<seg id="20">"The ships carrying 3,404 passengers combined."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Less than half, even 59 per cent of the cargo people took to Pond Inlet in Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Iqaluit is the second most populated area in terms of visitor numbers at 8.3 per cent, followed by Qikiqtarjuaq, which received 6.1 per cent of visas and Grise Fiord by 5.9 per cent."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sealift visitors to Pond Inlet not only spent a total of $245,565, but the visitors most visited within 100 hours of the 189.5-hour cruise ship’s visit in Nunavut, according to the report."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Cambridge Bay, Gjoa Haven, Kimmirut and Kugluktuk were not visited by sealift in 2018."</seg>
<seg id="25">"According to the report, both Cambridge Bay and Gjoa Haven were expected to receive seven visits, but all were cancelled due to weather."</seg>
<seg id="26">"The report listed Cambridge Bay and Gjoa Haven as affected by the cancellation of cruise ships’ visits by a total loss of about $25,000."</seg>
<seg id="27">"The feedback from the report comes from visitors leaving the research area in 2018, which surveyed vessels operators and other visitors to Nunavut last year."</seg>
<seg id="28">"In 2018, the GN had to respond to community concerns from Pond Inlet and Clyde River about the shipping season."</seg>
<seg id="29">"According to the report, the GN has contacted the organization’s Arctic surveillance vessel operators and all cruise ship operators to ensure that they do not go through the same route."</seg>
<seg id="30">"He also said that while tourism is a private development, they need the government’s support for development."</seg>
<seg id="31">"In Nunavut, that means training and employment for Nunavummiut in the tourism sector."</seg>
<seg id="32">“There is always a lack of a dedicated workforce and trained people to work in different areas of the tourism industry.</seg>
<seg id="33">"In the absence of a skilled workforce, tourism is not yet fully realized in its potential."</seg>
<seg id="34">"Training has been known to play a key role in tourism in Nunavut,” the report said."</seg>
<seg id="35">"The firm, Nunavut’s Inuit cruise ship training program, provides training to 12 people a year to work for Inuit cruise ships as part of the inspection process, the report said."</seg>
<seg id="36">"According to the report, all of the GN’s tourism inspectors are Inuit."</seg>
<seg id="37">"“Historically, tourism data is rarely available, which leads to uncertainty about the size of the economy and its capacity to support the territory’s economy,” the report said."</seg>

<seg id="1">"Mary River: If it’s a matter of profitability, let’s go ahead with it"</seg>
<seg id="2">Parliamentarians desperate for Baffinland to raise money</seg>
<seg id="3">Participants sat in Iqaluit at Cadet Hall on the fourth day of the NIRB’s public hearing on Baffinland Iron Mines Corp.’s railway expansion proposal for Mary River.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Nunavut’s system of enforcing rules for industrial development, which started in the 1993 Nunavut land claims agreement, has not been performing until such time as a wide-ranging, diverse environmental and socio-economic assessment of the Mary River iron mine over a decade."</seg>
<seg id="5">"This was featured in Iqaluit earlier this month, when the NIRB held its final public hearing on the $900-million railway expansion proposal by Baffinland Iron Mines Corp. in a sudden resignation of fuss and misinformation."</seg>
<seg id="6">The last day of the seven-day hearing scheduled for Pond Inlet was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="7">"At the same time, Baffinland’s multi-billion-dollar, multiple iron ore mine is in crisis."</seg>
<seg id="8">"With this draft, the NIRB has yet to make a decision on a motion from NTI that, if approved, would delay it from eight to 12 months."</seg>
<seg id="9">"And Baffinland’s Nunatsiaq News Corp., the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, said they can’t support or approve a railway expansion."</seg>
<seg id="10">"But the QIA’s business community, QC says it fully supports it."</seg>
<seg id="11">They’re also Arctic Co-operatives.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is a complex process.</seg>
<seg id="13">"As for Baffinland, the vice-president of recycling, Megan Lord-Hoyle, on the issue, said the company is now only concerned about whether the project will be able to go ahead, saying, “We’re going to do what we can to maintain and protect Canada’s 3,000 jobs, 476 of which are Inuit.”"</seg>
<seg id="14">"Last week, Baffinland told Nunatsiaq News it terminated 490 southern contracts that it contracts with and 96 contract Inuit employees."</seg>
<seg id="15">That’s why we’re reaching the biggest unanswered questions about the project: Mary River’s money.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Baffinland says the mine’s economic potential is uncertain unless regulators allow the construction of a 110-kilometre railway between Mary River and its production to go up to 12 million tonnes a year, which could happen 176 times more frequently in the wake of a warning by Eclipse Sound."</seg>
<seg id="17">"The problem is, they did not produce a public report on that funding."</seg>
<seg id="18">"And in the past, more and more officials were no longer asking questions about it."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Late last year, although they had no children, that didn’t stop what stakeholders said they believed."</seg>
<seg id="20">"For example, in the summer and fall of 2018, the QIA had buttons with Baffinland, protected by the NIRB."</seg>
<seg id="21">"On Aug. 31 of that year, the NIRB recommended that the federal government refuse to approve the previous and smaller year’s production—from 4.2 million tonnes of iron ore to 6 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="22">"So Baffinland and his partner, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, started to work hard."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Over the next few weeks, they have written to senior decision makers on the floor, Dominic LeBlanc, then the former federal minister of the Arctic, urging the board’s recommendations to be revised downwards."</seg>
<seg id="24">Why?</seg>
<seg id="25">Money.</seg>
<seg id="26">"The Inuit organisation said it fears that the Mary River mine’s capacity, due to donations of hundreds of dollars and funds, will cost more than $20 million to the parties in the new Inuit impact and benefit agreement."</seg>
<seg id="27">Ottawa agreed.</seg>
<seg id="28">"With focus on the QIA’s concerns about the potential for funding for the mine, the federal government approved Baffinland’s proposal last year."</seg>
<seg id="29">"“We are also concerned about the long-term viability of the Mary River iron mine and are aware of the QIA’s concerns about the economic development of the project,” LeBlanc wrote in a September 30, 2018 letter signed by Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett."</seg>
<seg id="30">"Instead, the most important legislator in the public sector—the federal government—has agreed that economic stability is crucial and essential to that."</seg>
<seg id="31">And they did so even though there was no financial transparency there.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Because if the truth is that the program is not profitable, a member of the club must be willing to see what he says is true."</seg>
<seg id="34">"In all areas of the Mary River project, Baffinland’s employees—as required—must produce a significant number of contributions to the project’s environmental impact statement."</seg>
<seg id="35">"But with the project’s financial successes, the NIRB seems reluctant to release its public details."</seg>
<seg id="36">"For example, the NIRB has recommended that a lengthy financial document obtained by the European Union in the Arctic is “not valid” and should not be revealed to the board’s public register."</seg>
<seg id="37">(Signs on our website still appear).</seg>
<seg id="38">The Nunavut Impact Review Board recommended that the document be tabled—and repealed Baffinland’s request.</seg>
<seg id="39">"For its part, Baffinland wanted to submit, individually, a shorter financial report explaining why Mary River could generate more revenue through a larger production process."</seg>
<seg id="40">That willingness to be independent may be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="41">At least Baffinland has corrected that.</seg>
<seg id="42">"In response to that, the NIRB made a different decision, which makes no sense."</seg>
<seg id="43">"If the federal government is going to invest in economic development, then this federal subsidy board must do the same."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Indeed, the Nunavut Impact Review Board and other regulators should try to get another piece of evidence like that."</seg>
<seg id="45">They have to be committed.</seg>
<seg id="46">"As well as Baffinland’s Atuqtuarvik Corp., the Qikiqtani Inuit Association."</seg>
<seg id="47">"And given that such concerns may have arisen further, the federal government is amending federal legislation that governs the Nunavut Impact Review Board’s system, the Nunavut Planning Commission and the Program Review Act, to clarify how financial information should be handled in the future."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Despite their willingness to comment, there are still hundreds of questions that remain unanswered about Baffinland’s final expansion proposal, related to the railway’s impact on caribou, the impact of ships on whales, the project’s lack of Inuit employment, and much more."</seg>
<seg id="49">"Many of the questions are from Arctic Bay to the south about the railway proposal, which Baffinland approved in 2013 to build, and 18 million tonnes of production a year. It’s still not clear why Baffinland was asked to build it in 2013 when it was allowed to produce 18 million tonnes a year."</seg>
<seg id="50">It’s still not clear why Baffinland has not succeeded in this plan.</seg>
<seg id="51">But the biggest question is how to ensure that program is sustainable.</seg>

<seg id="2">Surface-to-earth economy suffers from Quebec’s earlier promises</seg>
<seg id="3">Children and teachers were at the Aqivik Children’s Centre in Hudson Bay in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="4">"That year the Quebec government added a subsidy to families living in a child care facility, based on their family income."</seg>
<seg id="5">"On Nov. 7, 2019 those contributions were eliminated, with child care costs set at $8.25 a day."</seg>
<seg id="6">(Photo courtesy of nunavigator)</seg>
<seg id="7">By Elaine Anselmi</seg>
<seg id="8">"Investments in restructuring in Quebec have led to more money for family and child services in Quebec, including Nunavik."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Quebec’s economy was flagged at about 2.4 per cent in 2018-19, which is 0.6 per cent larger than previously thought."</seg>
<seg id="10">"On that occasion, Quebec’s finance minister, Eric Jarrett, announced on Nov. 7 that the $857 million reported will fall short of the previous year’s estimate."</seg>
<seg id="11">Two of that will come from a reality that has already been envied by the Child Benefit and Child Benefit.</seg>
<seg id="12">"“Renovations to Quebec’s economy and prosperity have shown that Quebec has succeeded in this area,” Garrett said in a press release."</seg>
<seg id="13">“Economic growth in Quebec provides us with the opportunity to reduce the deficit and to meet the government’s commitments.”</seg>
<seg id="14">"For that fund, Quebec is eliminating the additional funding for family child care that was implemented by Philip Quillett’s Liberal government in 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Through this program, they’re adding a subsidy to child care that’s on top of the cost of a day’s income."</seg>
<seg id="16">That subsidy was added to $15 a day for higher-income people.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Families who make more than $50,000 were not added to the fund."</seg>
<seg id="18">"The Nov. 7 release will reimburse Quebec day care costs $8.25, no longer subject to additional costs for all those who make money."</seg>
<seg id="19">The new fee will be used in Nunavik through the Kativik Regional Government program in Nunavik for child services.</seg>
<seg id="20">"According to Quebec’s release, the new fee will be for this year, and news agency Montreal Gazette reported that it would be set to start on Jan. 1, 2019."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Last week, the head of childcare services at the Kativik Regional Government, Julie-Ann Petty, received no information on how or when those payments would start in Nunavik."</seg>
<seg id="22">Premier François Lopez’s government first put forward a slow phasing-out of more funding and pledged to abolish it by 2022.</seg>
<seg id="23">The profitable and recent budget surplus of $4 billion in the 2019-20 fiscal year has slowed the process.</seg>
<seg id="24">"As well as removing the cost of childcare, the Quebec government is moving forward with a child care increase that it promised to install in 2021."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Beginning in January 2020, the Quebec government said the family will receive about $779 a year."</seg>
<seg id="26">"This allowance is tied to basic income, with a minimum wage of $1,000 to a maximum of $2,515 a year."</seg>
<seg id="27">"The new rules apply to child equality, not least the fact that Liberals can’t afford to pay a higher child allowance than the parent’s child."</seg>
<seg id="28">"“Today, we will complete the implementation of a multilateral strategy to support Quebec residents,” Jarrett said."</seg>
<seg id="29">“We’re bringing more money back to Quebec faster.”</seg>

<seg id="2">“Peter was respected for his commitment to service and the environment”</seg>
<seg id="3">"Sanikiluaq’s operation has been rolled out in front of the Nunavut legislative assembly on Wednesday, Nov. 20, this evening, in the eyes of the former MLA and minister Peter Kattuk, who died early in the morning after a long illness."</seg>
<seg id="4">"The Sanikiluaq community’s operation unveiled on Wednesday, Nov. 20 at the Nunavut Justice Centre in front of Iqaluit, in the eyes of Peter Kattuk of Sanikiluaq, who died on the morning of a long illness."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Kattak, 69, a respected MLA, Major and community leader, joined Nunavut on Feb. 15, 1999, when voters in Hudson Bay voted in the first place in Nunavut’s legislature and held their first meeting on April 1 of the same year."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Peter Kattuk (left) accompanied Nunavut’s former commissioner Peter Irniq on April 12, 2000, when Katsuq was sworn in as Nunavut’s minister."</seg>
<seg id="7">"At the beginning of the legislative assembly, Katsuq was appointed culture, language, elders and youth minister on April 12, 2000 to replace MLA Donald Havioyak, who resigned from his role."</seg>
<seg id="8">"On Dec. 17, 2001, Katok was relocated to her role as the Minister of Community and Government Services, where she served as minister until 2004."</seg>
<seg id="9">"And in 2004, Sanikiluaq’s voters won re-election in Katuqatigiit Hudson Bay, as an MLA until 2008."</seg>
<seg id="10">"“Peter was the ambassador of Hudson Bay for eight years in double digits and my thoughts are with his family,” Nunavut Speaker Simeon Mikkungwak said in a news release."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Born on June 2, 1950, Kattak spent many years in Sanikiluaq working on the environment, as mayor and community leader."</seg>
<seg id="12">"In the early 1990s, he was a member of the Sanikiluaq Impact Review Board, whose community gathered knowledge of the impacts of a massive energy water system built near Quebec that affected sea ice and marine ecosystems in the Belcher Islands."</seg>
<seg id="13">That’s what led to a report titled “Hudson Bay Neighbourhood: a culture known by Inuit and First Nations in Hudson Bay.”</seg>
<seg id="14">"As mayor of Sanikiluaq, Katok also spoke out against the now-depleted Kuujjuarapik power plant’s hydroelectric proposal."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Then Katsuq was a member of the Nunavut Hudson Bay Neighbourhood Working Group, also named the Nunavut Hudson Bay Neighbourhood Association."</seg>
<seg id="16">"The organization, set up by the Government of Nunavut, Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. and the Hamlet of Sanikiluaq, is monitoring developments in Sanikiluaq’s neighbourhood for the second energy water ban proposal, which has been banned since then, following rivers from Eastmain and Rupert River."</seg>
<seg id="17">"And in 1996, Katsuk was a member of the Nunavut Family Services Board, a body that was created in 1993 under the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Peter Kattuk speaks in the Nunavut legislature on Feb. 19, 2008, in his second term as MLA for Hudson Bay."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Koonoo Tattuinee, the president of the Arctic Co-operatives Ltd., recalls Katsuk’s “history,” which made him the first marine mammal in Sanikiluaq to feed."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Dr Paul Okalik, then Nunavut’s premier, appointed Katsuq as minister of culture, languages, elders and youth in April 2000, saying Katsuq had introduced Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit before the announcement was made."</seg>
<seg id="21">"“Peter was involved in the testing of Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit long before this was unknown,” Okalik said in a news release in April 2000."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Prior to his career as minister in 2001, Katsuq had to deal with a “toxic” laugh."</seg>
<seg id="23">That was the case with the Northern Transport Corp. cruise ships transporting gasoline to Nunavut and destroying snowmobile engines in the Baffin and Kivalliq regions.</seg>
<seg id="24">"During his tenure, Katok also faced another challenge: the GN’s decision not to use NTCL and to switch suppliers to the Woodward Group in Labrador."</seg>
<seg id="25">"He ran for re-election in October 2017, but he was third after Alan Rambert."</seg>
<seg id="26">"“Peter was respected for his commitment to career services and his environmental efforts,” Mikkungwak said in a statement."</seg>

<seg id="5">The newly elected MLA for Nunavik wants to hear about Inuit leaders’ concerns.</seg>
<seg id="6">MP Silvie Bruby won the Saint Justin of Papineau-Jim Bay-Nunavik election in the fall federal election by a vote of 37.7 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="7">"While BlackCorpa is one of the MLAs who have spoken French in the past, he said he’s looking for an Inuktitut interpreter to work with him."</seg>
<seg id="8">"“I want to make a clear statement to the needs of Indigenous communities,” she said."</seg>
<seg id="9">"To this end, Barrobi said he knows two very important issues that are urgent in Nunavik in terms of health and housing."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Even though the health care system is provincial, it does receive federal funding, says Bruby."</seg>
<seg id="11">"In order to maximize its health benefits, the federal government must consider how it splits its its contributions."</seg>
<seg id="12">Barbie has been working on the health care system for more than 30 years.</seg>
<seg id="13">"During Blake Quebec’s campaign, they said provinces need 10,000 units over the next 10 years."</seg>
<seg id="14">"That’s what Barbie has been talking about, asking for multiple architectural designs."</seg>
<seg id="15">"“If we want this government to move our Liberal government forward, then it’s up to us to find a solution,” Baropi said."</seg>
<seg id="16">"The new MLA is unusual in Nunavik, but he hopes to attend the next annual general meeting of Makivik, which will take place in March."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Following the election of Pruby, Makivik Corp. president Charlie Watt made the news by inviting Pomeroy to visit Nunavik as soon as possible."</seg>
<seg id="18">"“I look forward to meeting with him, and we welcome his support in our endeavours to build a self-determination program that supports and emphasizes the implementation of the U.N. Charter of Rights for Indigenous peoples,” Watt said."</seg>
<seg id="19">Discussions with Inuit leaders would benefit from his program to assist Makivik in his efforts to build self-determination.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Pomeroy fully supports Bill C-262, which would bring Canada’s constitution into line with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples."</seg>
<seg id="21">"There are two different pieces of legislation that his successor, NDP MLA Romelu Saganas."</seg>
<seg id="22">"That introduced in 2018, Bill C-262 was suspended by Conservative senators this spring but the Liberal government’s representative in the Senate, Senator Peter Harter, said if re-elected the Liberal government would have to implement the law."</seg>
<seg id="23">"“It is important for me to continue working on Bill C-262 in compliance with the Canadian Charter of Fundamental Rights for Indigenous peoples and the work of my successor Romelu Kaganas,” Barbie said."</seg>

<seg id="1">Trudeau government 2.0: Don’t expect too much</seg>
<seg id="2">“If you can think carefully please don’t expect”</seg>
<seg id="3">"Jane Webb then served as Indigenous services minister on March 23, 2018, with ITK president Nathan Obed, when he said the federal government would eradicate Inuit Nunangat by 2030."</seg>
<seg id="4">Less than a year he resigned as a federal councillor.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don’t know whether or not the federal election campaign or any of its premiers did much to address Nunavut’s principles and interests in the circumpolar region.</seg>
<seg id="6">No surprise there.</seg>
<seg id="7">"More important politicians seem to be concerned that the majority of Canadians, due to the southern population, are not very many who would vote for it even if they were talking about the Arctic that most Canadians in the majority of the country have never heard of."</seg>
<seg id="8">"The Liberal government acknowledged that, for example, when they knocked down and left the party they introduced a devastating delay to the Arctic and Arctic policy framework within the day prior to the election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="9">"During the election campaign, Indigenous issues, many of which sparked northern concerns, were also overlooked."</seg>
<seg id="10">"So for the new shrink in Justin Trudeau’s government, and the panel that was sworn in to its mandate this past Nov. 20, it’s likely that they’ll move on without much fuss."</seg>
<seg id="11">Here are some of the indicators.</seg>
<seg id="12">That’s because of the notorious promises made to the North since Trudeau’s government became president in 2015: eliminate at least 50 per cent (50 per cent) of tuberculosis in Inuit Nunangat by 2025 and completely eliminate it by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="13">"That included an initial contribution of $27.5 million over five years, during which it will be “set up” by four members of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami."</seg>
<seg id="14">"But what was said sounds like a broken promise. Starting with that, the former tuberculosis genocide specialist for the federal government, Jane Philpott, the former Indigenous services minister, said that."</seg>
<seg id="15">He resigned from Trudeau’s legal team this past March 4 to criticize Trudeau’s incompetence in Jody Wilson-Raybould.</seg>
<seg id="16">He did so less than four days before Trudeau travelled to Iqaluit to apologise for Canada’s inappropriate treatment of people with tuberculosis in the 1950s and 1960s.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Since then, they have remained silent on the Arctic’s tuberculosis epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Despite their early election campaigns, it wasn’t overlooked."</seg>
<seg id="19">"And so far, tuberculosis has stopped."</seg>
<seg id="20">"For example, in Nunatsiavut, where tuberculosis occurred between 2006 and 2016 and recorded 248.5 people per 100,000, health officials have conducted only one community survey."</seg>
<seg id="21">"That’s what happened in Nine, in 2018, when a tuberculosis epidemic broke out and a boy of a 14-year-old boy died while the patient was in the hospital with Jane Johns."</seg>
<seg id="22">"In Nunavik, 313 people were diagnosed with tuberculosis between 2006 and 2016, which is accompanied by tuberculosis in Inuit Nunangat, 234 of which were found at 100,000."</seg>
<seg id="23">"But there hasn’t been any community-wide inspection done in Nunavik since 2018, after Philpott’s release."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Inevitably in Nunavut’s most recent population survey conducted after tuberculosis, during Stephen Harper’s Conservative presidency, long before Trudeau’s Liberals were elected."</seg>
<seg id="25">"For Nunavut, which has had 670 people with tuberculosis between 2006 and 2016, it’s at 171.8 out of 100.000 and there have been cases of measles."</seg>
<seg id="26">(One unaffected person is Inuvialuit in the Northwest Territories.</seg>
<seg id="27">"There, there were no confirmed cases of tuberculosis between 2007 and 2016.)"</seg>
<seg id="28">Tuberculosis is a disease that is lacking.</seg>
<seg id="29">That’s why it’s so often said.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it’s true.</seg>
<seg id="31">"If people do not have adequate food and housing, tuberculosis can develop."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Also on rt.com, poverty in Cape Dorset, where their 12-week tuberculosis inspection ended in May."</seg>
<seg id="33">In 2016 the unemployment rate was 27.3 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="34">"In 2015, the 15-year-old’s net income was just over $18,933."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Of the 370 units, 120 units were desperately needed to be rebuilt."</seg>
<seg id="36">"According to Canada’s overcrowded housing, 140 units of 370 units were “non-housing” by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. regulations."</seg>
<seg id="37">That means there is a shortage of bedrooms per capita among the population living in social housing.</seg>
<seg id="38">There are also a small number of Canadian Inuit living in less-favoured housing.</seg>
<seg id="39">"It’s no surprise that over the last 20 years, tuberculosis has been rushed to Nunavut and other parts of the Arctic."</seg>
<seg id="40">And it’s unthinkable that tuberculosis can be eradicated in those communities unless they make dramatic changes to boost housing stocks and improve quality.</seg>
<seg id="41">"But during the last election campaign, Trudeau’s lawyers did not offer any details on Inuit housing, but only reinstated their 2016 and 2017 budgets that they had promised."</seg>
<seg id="42">"At the same time, they could not even be scapegoated for their violations of their statements."</seg>
<seg id="43">"That also reflects the background to the national epidemiological emergency, where tuberculosis in Inuit Nunangat is 300 times higher than the number of non-Indigenous people born in Canada."</seg>
<seg id="44">"In Nunavut, it may be worse."</seg>
<seg id="45">Last year’s report found that one in 100 babies born in Nunavut may suffer from this disease.</seg>
<seg id="46">"So while they don’t have much to do with those urgent needs for the disease, what are the concerns of Trudeau’s Liberal government about other things like mental illness, community housing, education and more?"</seg>
<seg id="47">"If you can be thoughtful, don’t expect much."</seg>
<seg id="48">"If you don’t, be prepared for a downward spiral."</seg>
<seg id="49">"Keep in mind: The number of cases of tuberculosis continues to progress from Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami’s ‘Inuit Tuberculosis Elimination Program’, released in November 2018."</seg>

<seg id="6">Police Chief Jean-Pierre Larros gave the council an update on the Kativik Regional Government meeting Nov. 26 on its progress so far.</seg>
<seg id="7">That included the passing of 10 new Kativik Regional Police Officers from Ontario Police College this week.</seg>
<seg id="8">The hiring process also included former employees who retired to speak to about their employment at the centre.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Due to poor hiring practices, the Kativik Regional Police Service has contacted the Quebec Police, Ore., for an example, to assist them in developing a quantity."</seg>
<seg id="10">"In September, there were 20 Quebec police officers in Nunavik."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Quebec police forces have been declining slowly until the Kativik Regional Police, and Larros said by early 2020 they may no longer use Quebec police forces."</seg>
<seg id="12">Cultural awareness training begins</seg>
<seg id="13">An Inuit cultural awareness training program for the Kativik Regional Police was also posted online on Nov. 18.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Training was developed by the Kativik Regional Police and Laval University and included information about Nunavik’s Missouri, Inuit, culture, and police history in Nunavik."</seg>
<seg id="15">"This is a three-hour training course and after it’s completed it’s inspected by newly trained people, which is defined as when applying for a job."</seg>
<seg id="16">"“This training is intended to help the Kativik Regional Police Officers select a culture for their input,” Larros said."</seg>
<seg id="17">"The second training program is nine hours long and requires all officers to be trained, said Larros."</seg>
<seg id="18">That’s expected to be completed by the start of the new fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="19">The cameras will have to be used by police</seg>
<seg id="20">Another added by the RCMP and praised by the board was the need to keep cameras in place for officers’ work.</seg>
<seg id="21">It’s a pilot project and is using six cameras right now.</seg>
<seg id="22">"“This work has been driven by Nunavimmiut’s desire to ensure that the Kativik Regional Police Officers can be more visible in their work,” Larros said."</seg>
<seg id="23">“The Kativik Regional Police Officers are targeting Inuit for their work to be attractive and socially motivated.”</seg>
<seg id="24">Kuujjuaq Councillor Jobie Duckapik hoped that the cameras could help people who have experienced problems with the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="25">“We hear from the RCMP about unfair practices and those who say they don’t want to make any comments.</seg>
<seg id="26">"They’ve been shocked by the RCMP,” Takapik said."</seg>
<seg id="27">“These inter-body cameras must be used.”</seg>
<seg id="28">"He added that if only one or two police officers did something wrong with Inuit, it has a big impact, and it raises concerns across the RCMP."</seg>
<seg id="29">"So he thinks that the camera, which takes photographs of the officer, can be used in the near future."</seg>
<seg id="30">Larros said he’ll start using those cameras in January.</seg>
<seg id="31">He added that violent and inappropriate actions would not only offer the police.</seg>
<seg id="32">"“I’ve just shut down a police officer this week because of our mission in Nunavik,” she said."</seg>

<seg id="14">“So we were able to build 80 communities that have been able to use renewable energy on top of oil in tea.</seg>
<seg id="15">"So we think what we know now is how beneficial it is,” Roos said."</seg>
<seg id="16">"This subsidy, which is designed to promote renewable energy development projects, and is helping Alaska to lower its energy costs."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Roos said in southern Russia, five communities are working together to install wind turbines and use them to generate energy."</seg>
<seg id="18">"“So there is now an integrated knowledge of how to manage and manage wind farms and they can help each other to develop,” Roos said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"In Alaska, like Nunavut, home energy bills are high."</seg>
<seg id="20">Roos said communities are using wind power not only for lighting but also for heating.</seg>
<seg id="21">“What they’ve done is put small boilers into Inuit housing which are covered in diamonds that appear to be carpeting.</seg>
<seg id="22">"When the wind is warmer, they go into the energy heat, and they have developed a small way of detecting heat and power plants,” Roos said."</seg>
<seg id="23">"“These are environments that cause hot air pollution, which can keep warm."</seg>
<seg id="24">"They can be shut off or burned in homes that fit them, and if they are stuck they can heat elsewhere.”"</seg>
<seg id="25">"But in Greenland, the installation of wind turbines has been difficult, according to News Corp’s Eric Higgins, a technical expert on recycling in Nuuk."</seg>
<seg id="26">"The high temperatures and long darkness make it difficult for wind gusts south to build in the Arctic, said Huggins."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Higgins also said two wind transport installations were originally planned elsewhere in the north of Greenland, but they failed."</seg>
<seg id="28">“And we can say that in Greenland we chose to release the resources they can use.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Even the two wind gusts were created in 200 different locations to be inspected and a friend of 150 locations to be inspected,” she said."</seg>
<seg id="30">"One of the wind blows fell, while on the other, the refuelling was too thick for the cold and damaged the engine, Huggins said."</seg>
<seg id="31">"During the 2019 federal election campaign, three politicians said a vote on Nunavut’s fossil fuels would be phased out by 2030."</seg>
<seg id="32">"While it may take some time to develop a renewable energy program that can be used in the Arctic, Hagibis said elimination of fossil fuels is an urgent matter."</seg>
<seg id="33">"“We must do what we can to eliminate fossil fuels, climate change, because there is now a problem."</seg>
<seg id="34">This is a legal issue because no fuel-efficient equipment is needed but there is no money.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Financing a good job, she said."</seg>
<seg id="36">Parra said it’s an interesting finding in conversation with Nunavut’s neighbouring communities in the Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="37">"“I think that’s something else that he has to consider, in terms of how to start moving towards recycling."</seg>
<seg id="38">Some people have used the equipment and have suffered from southern Canada’s incompetence but are unable to do so in the Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="39">"So if we are financially capable we will be able to track down the problems that have arisen,” Parra said."</seg>

<seg id="1">The Government of Nunavut must involve Inuit in the creation of the Education Act: NTI</seg>
<seg id="2">“This is an important policy change that will affect hundreds of Inuit parents and Inuit children in Nunavut”</seg>
<seg id="3">"Aluki Kotierk, the president of Nunavut Tunngavik Inc., speaks during the committee’s legislative hearing on Bill 25, an Act to Amend the Education Act and the Inuit Language Protection Act."</seg>
<seg id="4">"By Aluki Kotierk, Nunavut Tunngavik Inc."</seg>
<seg id="5">Subject: Minister Joanasie’s letter to Nunatsiaq News on Bill 25</seg>
<seg id="6">"Minister Joanasie wrote in a letter released by Nunatsiaq News on Nov. 25, 2019 referring to discussions between the Department of Education and Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. on Bill 25, pointing out that these discussions were conducted in a spirit of mutual trust and offered NTI sufficient time to voice their concerns."</seg>
<seg id="7">In the minister’s view, he invited NTI to the public hearings and NTI’s hearings, which the GN envisages working with him on previous hearings.</seg>
<seg id="8">That’s not the case.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Inuit have the right to Article 32 of the Nunavut Agreement as part of the development of social and cultural policies, as well as the development of social and cultural programs and services, including governance."</seg>
<seg id="10">It’s a different foundation.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bill 25 calls for amendments to the Education Act and the Inuit Language Protection Act to lay down policies and the administration of Inuit language teaching.</seg>
<seg id="12">That fundamental policy change will affect many people with children and Inuit children in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Meanwhile, Inuit have the right to participate in the development and development of it."</seg>
<seg id="14">NTI was not given the opportunity to participate in the development of policy proposals detailed in the proposed Bill 25.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Not only does it violate the government’s mandate described in the Nunavut Agreement, it has in the past shown that efforts have been made to achieve a goal that better incorporates Inuit objectives and objectives."</seg>
<seg id="16">"NTI has been working to develop legislation with the GN, such as the Inuit Language Protection Act, the Official Languages Act and the Wildlife Act."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Knowing how to proceed, NTI contacted the premier and the newly elected government to manage the co-operation and co-operation of Inuit priorities, including education, language and culture."</seg>
<seg id="18">"The Department of Education did not submit a legislative proposal to NTI until August 31, 2018, when the department submitted a list of planned community consultations."</seg>
<seg id="19">NTI was given less than a week to review Bill 25 and prepare for a Nunavut-wide consultation tour.</seg>
<seg id="20">That’s not a working relationship.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The department did manage to get input from a very far-sighted perspective, and neither did the solution nor the space issues raised by Inuit, NTI and other organizations such as the DEA (DEA) and the Coalition of Nunavut District Education Authorities (CNDEA) were also present."</seg>
<seg id="22">"I further urge the Minister of Education to keep the Nunavut Agreement’s clear mandate going to Article 32, and the department must manage it properly with due respect, effort and commitment and adoption of the honour of the Queen when it comes to partnering with Inuit."</seg>
<seg id="23">"NTI’s belief that the redrafting of the Education Act to be carried out by Inuit is a key element in the project’s governance, as well as in the overall recognition of Inuit rights."</seg>
