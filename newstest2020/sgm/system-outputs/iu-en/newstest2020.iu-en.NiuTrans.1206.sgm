<seg id="66">&gt; &gt; Orders of the Day at 13: 33</seg>
<seg id="67">Speaker (Hon. Joe Enook): Mr. Quassa, can you say the opening prayer, please.</seg>
<seg id="68">Speaker: Good afternoon, Premier, members, Nunavummiut who are listening to the radio broadcast and watching the televised proceedings. Welcome to your committee.</seg>
<seg id="69">We will proceed with the orders of the day.</seg>
<seg id="70">Premier of Nunavut, Premier Quassa.</seg>
<seg id="71">Minister's Statement 046 - 5 (1): Nunavut 2018 Youth Award Recipients (Quassa)</seg>
<seg id="72">Hon. Paul Quassa: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="73">Good day to my fellow residents of Igloolik, my colleagues, and all Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="74">I would like to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Dr. Donna Main-Kimmaliardjuk, who will be receiving the 2018 Youth Award in Winnipeg.</seg>
<seg id="75">She is the first Inuk nurse to be recognized for her work.</seg>
<seg id="76">Dr. Kimmaliardjuk was born in Chesterfield Inlet and was the first Inuk to have a heart attack and was the first Inuk to have a heart attack...</seg>
<seg id="77">This year is the fourth year of a six-year program at the University of Ottawa's Heart Institute.</seg>
<seg id="78">Mr. Speaker, [Dr.] Kimmaliardjuk was able to be admitted in 2014, the only person to be named as a heart specialist in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="79">In 2016 she became a member of the Indigenous Committee on HIV / AIDS on behalf of Inuit.</seg>
<seg id="80">During his term as a member of the Inuit Health Committee, he also promotes Inuit culture.</seg>
<seg id="81">Mr. Speaker, the recipients of the Order of Nunavut represent the highest honour of Indigenous peoples to their people.</seg>
<seg id="82">The Pediatrics celebrate their 25th anniversary in 2018 and congratulate 350 Indigenous, Inuit, and MÃ©tis people who demonstrate their success.</seg>
<seg id="83">These awards celebrate a culture that reflects the diversity of Indigenous peoples in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="84">This year the awards ceremony will take place on March 23 in Winnipeg.</seg>
<seg id="85">I would like to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Dr. Kimmaliardjuk, who will be recognized at the ceremony.</seg>
<seg id="86">She has worked very hard on her own and she is very proud of her accomplishments. Inuit and the Department of Health are very capable and she is very visible to our youth in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="87">I know that when I talk about this issue, I would like to express my pride in Dr. Kimmaliardjuk. It's obvious that he will be working on this issue and it will be very important to us.</seg>
<seg id="88">Minister of Justice, Ms. Ehaloak.</seg>
<seg id="89">Minister's Statement 047 - 5 (1): Rankin Inlet Healing Facility Sewing Program (Ehaloak)</seg>
<seg id="90">Hon. Jeannie Ugyuk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the cultural sewing program for the men's healing centre in Rankin Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="91">These prisoners are involved in the sealing industry, sealing and other activities, including roofing, mitts, sealskin pants, sealskin hats, and knuckles.</seg>
<seg id="92">Rosemary is a well-respected elder and her sewing skills are widely known around the world.</seg>
<seg id="93">She recently travelled to Norway to teach the seal pelts.</seg>
<seg id="94">She was a student of Nunavut Arctic College's Fur Production and Design Program and started the Fur Production and Design Program with the Literacy Council of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="95">Rosemary's support for inmates in a culturally appropriate, physically safe, Inuit language and cultural healing program.</seg>
<seg id="96">The sewing program will work with and support the on-the-land program, which provides inmates with the opportunity to learn how to hunt and how to properly prepare skins and food.</seg>
<seg id="97">These furs and sealskins will be used for the Fur Production and Design Program.</seg>
<seg id="98">Programs such as this help inmates to reintegrate into the community. When their sentences are up, they are encouraged to move towards a more holistic approach to crime.</seg>
<seg id="99">I recently visited the Rankin Inlet Healing Facility and I was very pleased to see the impact that it has had on the cultural programs, especially in the communities where elders like Ms. Rosemary Sanchez.</seg>
<seg id="100">Minister of Family Services, Minister Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="101">Minister's Statement 048 - 5 (1): Red Seal Program (Savikataaq)</seg>
<seg id="102">Hon. Joe Savikataaq: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I say "good day" to the people of Arviat and I hope you don't miss school.</seg>
<seg id="103">Mr. Speaker, there are certified heavy equipment operators, heavy equipment operators, and heavy equipment operators.</seg>
<seg id="104">In September of 2016 the Heavy Equipment Operators Training Program was offered to three participants in the Nunavut Trades Training Program.</seg>
<seg id="105">This means that Nunavummiut in Nunavut are able to receive on-the-job training and receive a certificate that is known as a certificate.</seg>
<seg id="106">In November of 2017 Nunavut was given the authority to issue a red seal certificate for heavy equipment, loaders, and welders.</seg>
<seg id="107">As part of the Heavy Equipment Operators Program, Rankin Inlet's graduates have demonstrated their provincial and territorial skills and are now able to work anywhere in Canada.</seg>
<seg id="108">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to announce that we have been able to offer the Order of Nunavut to Nunavummiut at a national ceremony to honour the recipients of the Order of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="109">Minister of Education, Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="110">Minister's Statement 049 - 5 (1): New Funding for Early Childhood Programs (Joanasie)</seg>
<seg id="111">Hon. David Joanasie: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Good afternoon, my colleagues, the people of Cape Dorset and Kimmirut, Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="112">Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to announce today that the Department of Education will be providing O &amp; M funding to eligible daycare facilities.</seg>
<seg id="113">Mr. Speaker, the increase is the result of a three-year program plan that my officials have put in place for early childhood education and daycare, which was two separate agreements signed in September 2017 with the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="114">Mr. Speaker, in the current fiscal year we will see eligible daycares receive an increase of $1,918.80, at a cost of $45,494.80, depending on the number, condition, and location of the daycare.</seg>
<seg id="115">As long as the daycare does not increase the cost of childcare and additional costs, it will not be eligible for similar funding in the next fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="116">Mr. Speaker, this money will not only help daycares manage their costs, but it will also help families with childcare costs without increasing their costs.</seg>
<seg id="117">Mr. Speaker, we are proud to be able to provide this funding to daycares and families.</seg>
<seg id="118">I also believe, and it is clear that we also believe that this funding will have a positive impact on the sustainability of both the funding and the cost of daycares.</seg>
<seg id="119">Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="120">Minister's Statement 050 - 5 (1): Nunavut Mining Symposium (Sheutiapik)</seg>
<seg id="121">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik: Good day, Nunavummiut and my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="122">Mr. Speaker, the mining industry is the foundation of Nunavut's economic development.</seg>
<seg id="123">Our department is committed to supporting the mining industry to ensure that Nunavummiut benefit from these activities.</seg>
<seg id="124">Mr. Speaker, the next national event will be held in Iqaluit at the 21st Annual Nunavut Mining Symposium held April 9-12, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="125">This conference provides an opportunity for Inuit to explore new opportunities for Nunavut's mineral exploration and mining industry to ensure that our communities are aware and involved in mining and exploration in the territory.</seg>
<seg id="126">We expect that this year's mining symposium will continue to be attended by all participants in the territory and we expect more than 400 participants.</seg>
<seg id="127">Mr. Speaker, I look forward to welcoming the mine, Inuit organizations, search and rescue teams, community members, and other participants to this important meeting.</seg>
<seg id="128">Finally, Mr. Speaker, I encourage all members and the public to participate in the public hearing on April 11.</seg>
<seg id="129">It's not just an opportunity to get good results, but it's an impact on the search and rescue. I look forward to responding to the member's question.</seg>
<seg id="130">Members Statements. Member for Hudson Bay, Mr. Rumbolt.</seg>
<seg id="131">Member's Statement 096 - 5 (1): Happy Fifth Birthday to Granddaughter (Rumbolt)</seg>
<seg id="132">Mr. Speaker, five years ago to today, the former Speaker rose in the House when I first got a grandchild. I now have five years of experience with my first granddaughter.</seg>
<seg id="133">Happy birthday, Jayden.</seg>
<seg id="134">Member for Netsilik, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="135">Member's Statement 097 - 5 (1): Kitikmeot Youth Empowerment (Qirngnuq)</seg>
<seg id="136">Mr. Qirngnuq: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="137">This is a good suggestion for youth and a good plan for the future for their future careers.</seg>
<seg id="138">I rise today to share good news with my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="139">Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to announce that the centre will be holding an Inuit youth gathering in the Kitikmeot region in Cambridge Bay next week to promote the 2018 Kitikmeot youth gathering.</seg>
<seg id="140">Mr. Speaker, this gathering provides an opportunity for Kitikmeot youth to get together and discuss their priorities and concerns with youth.</seg>
<seg id="141">It includes the following:</seg>
<seg id="142">Mental health;</seg>
<seg id="143">Youth facilities;</seg>
<seg id="144">Preferential abuse;</seg>
<seg id="145">The importance of Inuit knowledge, residential school solutions, and reconciliation; and</seg>
<seg id="146">The protection of the Inuit language and culture continues.</seg>

<seg id="148">Jody Karl;</seg>
<seg id="149">David Tungilik;</seg>

<seg id="159">Mr. Speaker, I ask all members to join me in wishing them the best of success in their gathering.</seg>
<seg id="160">Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, Mr. Lightstone.</seg>
<seg id="161">Member's Statement 098 - 5 (1): Tobacco Control Act (Lightstone)</seg>
<seg id="162">Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="163">I rise today to address concerns that have been brought to my attention by my constituents regarding the legalization of marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="164">I just recently received a letter that said, and I quote, "My family and I live in Iqaluit live in a public housing unit next year.</seg>
<seg id="165">Over the last couple of years, we have had to move out of the smoke and the smell, the smoke that goes into my house is very strong. "</seg>
<seg id="166">The letter goes on to state, and I quote, "I am deeply concerned about the effects of smoking on my children, my children, and others in this situation."</seg>
<seg id="167">Mr. Speaker, as residents of Iqaluit and my family, we also live in a multiplex unit.</seg>
<seg id="168">Mr. Speaker, dust suppressants in other parts of the country affect non-smokers.</seg>
<seg id="169">Even if you don't smoke it for a long time, it has been known by the government that it has been a non-smoker for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="170">As a father and toddler, I don't want them to be affected by these kinds of illnesses that include tobacco and marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="171">As my colleague from Pangnirtung noted, the member asked the Minister of Health about the legalization of marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="172">In my discussions with my constituents, many of my constituents share the same concerns.</seg>
<seg id="173">Mr. Speaker, I recognize that when you're dealing with this issue, you have to try to be flexible and balanced.</seg>
<seg id="174">The federal government's proposed ban on smoking is expected to come into force within a few months.</seg>
<seg id="175">I would like to ask for unanimous consent to conclude my statement.</seg>
<seg id="176">The member is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statement. Are there any nays?</seg>
<seg id="177">Mr. Lightstone, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="178">Thank you, my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="179">Under this legislation, elders will be able to retain and smoke marijuana. However, the government will have to determine what regulations will be in place to regulate the use of marijuana within the community.</seg>
<seg id="180">Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet also said last week that the government's own consultations and results have already indicated that there are concerns about agricultural production and the acquisition of public housing units and condominiums.</seg>
<seg id="181">Mr. Speaker, I believe that when this legislation is introduced in the Legislative Assembly, it will be necessary to clearly identify these issues and I look forward to the appropriate resolution of these issues with my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="182">Before we proceed, you will note that our colleague, Mr. Akoak, is not here today due to illness.</seg>
<seg id="183">Mr. Akoak, please feel free to conclude your statement.</seg>
<seg id="184">Member for Baker Lake, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="185">Member's Statement 099 - 5 (1): Expansion of Training Opportunities in Baker Lake (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="186">Mr. Mikkungwak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="187">I say hello to the people of Baker Lake and all Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="188">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage our government to increase its training program in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="189">Mr. Speaker, Baker Lake is a growing community. It's going to be very important to provide more training and employment opportunities for the people of Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="190">Mr. Speaker, Piqqusilirivvik administers the program in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="191">This can be expanded so that the public will have a better understanding and a better understanding of Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit.</seg>
<seg id="192">Mr. Speaker, the idea of establishing a university in Nunavut has been expressed, and Agnico Eagle Mines has said it would support such a project if it were to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="193">I think it would be best to put it in the middle of Nunavut because Canada is also in the middle of it.</seg>
<seg id="194">Mr. Speaker, one of my colleagues said it's very important that we take these things out before they pass.</seg>
<seg id="195">Government tires are a slow process, but at the same time we must encourage and push for results that are readily available in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="196">Mr. Speaker, this is the beginning of our term as the fifth Legislative Assembly. I, too, would like to see us take a step forward.</seg>
<seg id="197">Expanding training opportunities in communities such as Baker Lake would be a good step forward.</seg>
<seg id="198">Member for Kugluktuk, Ms. Kamingoak.</seg>
<seg id="199">Member's Statement 100 - 5 (1): Issues with Larga Boarding Home (Kamingoak)</seg>
<seg id="200">Ms. Kamingoak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="201">Good afternoon, colleagues, Kuglukturmiut, and Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="202">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage the government to take a closer look at the day-to-day operations of medical boarding homes.</seg>
<seg id="203">Mr. Speaker, my constituents have brought me a number of concerns that have been brought to my attention for a long time now.</seg>
<seg id="204">It's a food problem and it's a waste of time and it's broken down for a number of months.</seg>
<seg id="205">Mr. Speaker, it is important for the government to ensure that the services that are paid to Nunavummiut are actually delivered.</seg>
<seg id="206">I understand that hotels require a lot of accommodation on a daily basis, but it is also important that they are comfortable and well looked after.</seg>
<seg id="207">Mr. Speaker, it is not clear whether or not the boarding home will be included in the review of medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="208">I look forward to seeing the results of the review and recommendations that will be made to improve the services and conditions of medical boarding homes.</seg>
<seg id="209">Member for Aivilik, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="210">Member's Statement 101 - 5 (1): Congratulations to Rosemary Ejangiaq (Netser)</seg>
<seg id="211">Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today to congratulate Rosemary Ejangiaq from Naujaat.</seg>
<seg id="212">She is a young graduate, but she has worked hard and has been recognized for her contributions to the Hurricane Elder's National School Award.</seg>
<seg id="213">Mr. Speaker, the Rachel Arngnammaktiq Elementary School of Canada's Outstanding Principals Award is a scholarship that is awarded to high school students despite the difficulties they face in achieving success.</seg>
<seg id="214">Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize Ms. Ejangiaq for her persistence and commitment to continue her education.</seg>
<seg id="215">Our youth, many of whom are struggling, face difficulties and challenges in graduating from Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="216">I would like to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating him on his achievements. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="217">Member for Pangnirtung, Ms. Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="218">Member's Statement 102 - 5 (1): Tribute to Canada under 150 (Nakashuk)</seg>
<seg id="219">Mr. Nakashuk: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="220">Good afternoon, my colleagues, my family, and the people of Pangnirtung.</seg>
<seg id="221">I rise this afternoon to congratulate a constituent of mine from Pangnirtung who was recognized by Dennis Patterson.</seg>
<seg id="222">I would also like to congratulate an 18-year volunteer for search and rescue in Pangnirtung, Poasie Mike, who has worked for the search and rescue organization for 18 years. I would like to express my pride in him.</seg>
<seg id="223">The last name on my list is the Hon. Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Main.</seg>

<seg id="225">Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="226">I say good day to the people who are watching the video.</seg>
<seg id="227">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer some observations and recommendations on the government's financial management system.</seg>
<seg id="228">Mr. Speaker, as the new members of this House, we have learned a lot over the past two weeks and we have learned a lot.</seg>
<seg id="229">Mr. Speaker, as Chair of the Regular Members Caucus of the Legislative Assembly, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of my colleagues for the opportunity to work together since the creation of the new Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="230">Mr. Speaker, I am very proud of the strong message that we made on Friday that the Legislative Assembly will no longer accept and that the government must respect its own procurement rules.</seg>
<seg id="231">Mr. Main: Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Iqaluit-Tasiluk tabled a very important motion on Friday, which we will be moving forward with when the House reconvenes for its spring sitting.</seg>
<seg id="232">Mr. Speaker, although we are a territorial government, it is not always a functioning government.</seg>
<seg id="233">For example, as I noted last week in my opening comments during the review of the college's capital estimates, the government listened to our concerns and even made significant changes to the budget.</seg>
<seg id="234">I look forward to seeing more of that in the weeks and years to come, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="235">Mr. Speaker, over the past few weeks, MLAs have asked a lot of questions on a daily basis.</seg>
<seg id="236">I think we can say very clearly that we're achieving our goal and it's very obvious that we need to do more research on government spending.</seg>
<seg id="237">It's not enough if we just count the amount of money that goes out.</seg>
<seg id="238">I would like to ask for unanimous consent to conclude my statement, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="239">The member is seeking unanimous consent to conclude his statement. Are there any nays?</seg>
<seg id="240">Mr. Main, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="241">Mr. Main: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="242">Mr. Speaker, I'm talking about the use of examples of what is happening.</seg>
<seg id="243">Mr. Speaker, this information is required to be made public in the Legislative Assembly so that we, as elected MLAs, can make informed decisions on whether or not any funding needs to be increased, decreased, altered, or removed from the budget because of our limited resources.</seg>
<seg id="244">Mr. Speaker, I'll use these as an example.</seg>
<seg id="245">I think it's fair to say that we can agree that the government's administration of the tax credit for harvesters is lacking in the form of a subsidy for harvesters.</seg>
<seg id="246">The Department of Environment, which administers the government's Harvester Support Program, must carefully review its programs and determine how to improve its targeting of harvesters to subsidize the cost of fuel.</seg>
<seg id="247">Mr. Speaker, I will also take another example of the government's grants and contributions program.</seg>
<seg id="248">We know that the government has spent a lot of money to promote economic development.</seg>
<seg id="249">We know the amount of money that has been borrowed from the commercial sector.</seg>
<seg id="250">We know who received the money.</seg>
<seg id="251">We don't know what that money was used for.</seg>
<seg id="252">We don't know how many Inuit were hired from Nunavut and we don't even know what the money was spent on.</seg>
<seg id="253">Mr. Speaker, as you will be aware, although I have been able to speak to these issues for a long time, it won't work, but I'll stop there.</seg>
<seg id="254">I would like to add that I look forward to reviewing the main estimates of the Legislative Assembly and I look forward to working closely with all members to strengthen our budget in support of all communities and constituents.</seg>
<seg id="255">Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="256">Member's Statement 104 - 5 (1): Two More Elders Travelling for Care (Towtongie)</seg>
<seg id="257">Mr. Towtongie: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="258">From Rankin Inlet North and Chesterfield Inlet, I rise today to pay tribute to one of our elders, Annie Tatty, who is flying to Ottawa today.</seg>
<seg id="259">Also one of our elders, Amaruq, who I rise today in the House, has also been sent to Gjoa Haven because there is no elder in Rankin Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="260">I would like to be heard by the Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="261">When I was elected in November, when I was looking at the budget, I asked the Minister of Health and Social Services, Where are the plans for the establishment of an elders facility in Rankin Inlet or in Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="262">I was told by the Minister of Health that all of us, as MLAs, feel very strongly about our elders.</seg>
<seg id="263">When we meet in Pond Inlet, we will be able to bring this up.</seg>
<seg id="264">I'm waiting.</seg>
<seg id="265">The other day I rose in the House during the capital estimates and I don't see it in the capital estimates for the elders facility.</seg>
<seg id="266">I was told that I don't have to talk about it, so I have to stop.</seg>
<seg id="267">However, I was very thankful to our Chair, Allan Rumbolt, that I was able to continue to express my feelings towards the elders facility.</seg>
<seg id="268">I rise today as an elected member to express my dissatisfaction with me.</seg>
<seg id="269">The issue of sending elders to the south is not acceptable.</seg>
<seg id="270">We want to be a good MLA, we want to be a good government, we have told our elders to be proud of them, and we send them outside of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="271">Member for Amittuq, Mr. Irniq.</seg>
<seg id="272">Member's Statement 105 - 5 (1): Recognition of Hall Beach and Igloolik Volunteers and Search and Rescue (Qiniq)</seg>
<seg id="273">Mr. Irniq: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thought I was forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="274">Mr. Speaker, I rise today to again express my pride in my fellow residents.</seg>
<seg id="275">The search and rescue teams work very hard to search and rescue when there is a search.</seg>
<seg id="276">They only use their own transportation.</seg>
<seg id="277">I rise today to congratulate the community of Hall Beach's search and rescue team. Kyle Issigaitok is the chair of the search and rescue team, George Innuksuk is the executive director of Martha Gibbons Tupik, and Daniel Qaunaq.</seg>
<seg id="278">Further, our elder, Abraham this morning, is an elder.</seg>
<seg id="279">This is the first time I have stated that this is the first time I have ever travelled to search and rescue. This is the first time I have ever travelled to search and rescue.</seg>
<seg id="280">As youth, we have to do more to help them out because our elders tell the truth.</seg>
<seg id="281">We don't think we're going to build a future.</seg>
<seg id="282">I'm here now and I'm very disappointed, but if I had listened to it again, I would be very disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="283">I hope you don't do that for the youth. When you go out on the land, please be safe.</seg>
<seg id="284">Mr. Speaker, I would also like to recognize the Igloolik search and rescue team. They had a meeting this week in Hall Beach and it's now springtime and it's nice to be out on the land.</seg>
<seg id="285">With that being the case, Mr. Speaker, if you're going to be travelling to SPOT devices, please ask the elders if I'm going anywhere, so I'll catch up quickly.</seg>
<seg id="286">Things like that.</seg>
<seg id="287">I rise today to reiterate the fact that the search and rescue organization has one snowmobile and they have tried to apply to the Department of Community and Government Services and they have never received a response.</seg>
<seg id="288">I would like the search and rescue organizations to be given more support.</seg>
<seg id="289">That's it.</seg>
<seg id="290">The last name on the list, Member for South Baffin, Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="291">Member's Statement 106 - 5 (1): Cape Dorset Athletes (Joanasie)</seg>
<seg id="292">Hon. David Joanasie: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="293">We hear good news from the Kinngait School at Sam Pudlat School and anyone will be invited to participate in the music or song contest.</seg>
<seg id="294">I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the choir for their wonderful songs, and I would like to thank them for being able to travel to Cape Dorset with the help of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the Hamlet of Cape Dorset.</seg>
<seg id="295">There are none.</seg>
<seg id="296">Member for Quttiktuq, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="297">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="298">I would like to recognize visitors in the gallery. There are four people I would like to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="299">First of all, I would like to recognize the national park manager for Nunavut. I would like to recognize Jenna Boun and her staff. She's always looking after me and our children. My wife, Carole Akeeagok, is my wife.</seg>
<seg id="300">I would like to thank my cousin, Naiomi Kotierk, for being able to make it here.</seg>
<seg id="301">I would also like to recognize our new employee who is here to attend school. He is our daughter and he is always sending our daughter to school. I am very proud of him and I would like to welcome Jayden Natanine.</seg>
<seg id="302">I would like to explain a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="303">When I was a child, I was still a child....</seg>
<seg id="304">... I was expecting a seal for the first time in the lake.</seg>
<seg id="305">I don't think there are too many caribou that were caught in the lake because we were in the sand on the Belcher Islands.</seg>
<seg id="306">They were very helpful and they were my mother and father.</seg>
<seg id="307">I would like to thank them for being able to come here.</seg>
<seg id="308">Mr. Uttak and your officials, welcome to your Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="309">Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="310">Mr. Towtongie: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="311">My parents in Wager Bay, although my mother is now a national park, were given pictures of all of us. I recognize you all and we appreciate our oldest and youngest children.</seg>
<seg id="312">I used to stay at the hotel in Igloolik and when I was there, Theresa Otak gave me a cup of tea and Louie Uttak, I thank you for your good food and I look forward to staying with you again.</seg>
<seg id="313">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="314">Welcome to the Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="315">Member for Kugluktuk, Ms. Kamingoak.</seg>
<seg id="316">Ms. Kamingoak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="317">I would like to recognize Naiomi Kotierk from Kugluktuk and Carol Akeeagok, who are my relatives.</seg>
<seg id="318">Naiomi is from Grise Fiord. I don't have any relatives every day, as you can see.</seg>
<seg id="319">Welcome to your Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="320">Member for Pangnirtung, Ms. Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="321">Mr. Nakashuk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would like to recognize and congratulate my husband, Andrew Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="322">Please welcome him.</seg>
<seg id="323">Mr. Nakashuk, welcome to our Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="324">Recognition of Visitors in the Gallery. I have no more names on my list.</seg>
<seg id="325">We will proceed with the orders of the day.</seg>
<seg id="326">We will begin with the Hon. Member for Iqaluit-Tasiluk, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="327">Question 123 - 5 (1): Business Protection Act (Hickes)</seg>
<seg id="328">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="329">My questions are for the Minister of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="330">I would like to ask my colleagues to join me in the last couple of weeks and in the last couple of weeks to ensure that the training of supervisors is consistent and that the training is ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="331">I would like to ask the minister if this government will be bringing forward legislation on waste management.</seg>
<seg id="332">Minister of Justice, Minister Ell-Kanayuk.</seg>
<seg id="333">Hon. Jeannie Ugyuk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thank Mr. Hickes for the question.</seg>
<seg id="334">As of today, the Government of Nunavut does not have a Code of Values and Ethics.</seg>
<seg id="335">Our department is aware that companies have been hiring security guards in our communities, such as health centres.</seg>
<seg id="336">We are currently reviewing the policy for the establishment of the Nunavut Business Credit Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="337">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="338">As the minister is saying, one of the last jurisdictions in Canada that don't have a business case, we want to make sure that businesses have the right to be accountable and that they have the expertise to provide the services that they need.</seg>
<seg id="339">We have been bringing forward legislation in all regions.</seg>
<seg id="340">My next question is: when they're reviewing the policy, will there be a legislative proposal that will be tabled in the House?</seg>
<seg id="341">Minister of Education, Minister Ell-Kanayuk.</seg>
<seg id="342">Hon. Jeannie Ugyuk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Hickes, yes, we can work on the policy or regulations of the NNI Policy.</seg>
<seg id="343">Your final supplementary, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="344">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="345">I thank the minister for that commitment.</seg>
<seg id="346">Mr. Speaker, I would just like to take this opportunity to note that the Department of Justice is being monitored by the RCMP. Does the Department of Community and Government Services work with the Department of Community and Government Services to coordinate the contracting, procurement, and contracting activities of the Government of Nunavut in the event of a contract?</seg>
<seg id="347">Hon. Jeannie Ugyuk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The rules or policies are prepared by the Department of Justice or other departments. When it comes to drafting the policy, our department tries to get involved from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="348">I don't have that information in front of me, but I can look into it and get back to the member.</seg>
<seg id="349">Question 124 - 5 (1): Status of Site Remediation in Baker Lake (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="350">Mr. Mikkungwak: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="351">My questions are for the Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="352">I would like to follow up on some of the questions that I asked the minister last week regarding the remediation of the contaminated site in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="353">In one of his responses to me, the minister indicated that the "final report" would be prepared and submitted to the Qulliq Energy Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="354">Will the minister commit to providing a copy of this report to both the Hamlet Council of Baker Lake and me as the MLA for the community?</seg>
<seg id="355">Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation, Minister Ell-Kanayuk.</seg>
<seg id="356">Hon. Jeannie Ugyuk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Yes, Mr. Mikkungwak, I can commit to doing that.</seg>
<seg id="357">Your first supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="358">I thank the minister for that commitment.</seg>
<seg id="359">One of the things that the minister has stood up to say is that the Qulliq Energy Corporation can work with the Municipality of Baker Lake to clean up the rubble. Mr. Speaker, I would be very pleased to hear that when I get back to the community next week, I will encourage the hamlet staff to meet with the Qulliq Energy Corporation officials.</seg>
<seg id="360">Mr. Speaker, it would be very difficult to do that because the Qulliq Energy Corporation's headquarters is located in Baker Lake.</seg>
<seg id="361">The minister indicated that the Qulliq Energy Corporation has already spent $1.68 million to date on remediation.</seg>
<seg id="362">Can the minister clarify how much it would cost to clean up the surplus?</seg>
<seg id="363">Minister of Environment, Minister Ell-Kanayuk.</seg>
<seg id="364">Hon. Jeannie Ugyuk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The total cost of the cleanup would be about $10 million. The energy corporation would be responsible for that kind of money, as I mentioned earlier, since the creation of Nunavut and the federal government is responsible for the cleanup.</seg>
<seg id="365">We're committed to working with the Municipality of Baker Lake to clean up the existing contaminated site.</seg>
<seg id="366">Your final supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="367">As I noted last week in my question, the federal government or the Government of Nunavut have not finalized the cost estimates yet.</seg>
<seg id="368">Mr. Speaker, I am in support of the Qulliq Energy Corporation's broken record that was used when the project was under federal jurisdiction.</seg>
<seg id="369">Will the Minister responsible for the Qulliq Energy Corporation commit to working with the Minister of Justice to review and clarify the legal options that may be open to this issue?</seg>
<seg id="370">Hon. Jeannie Ugyuk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Yes, as the Minister of Energy and Justice, we will work together to resolve this issue.</seg>
<seg id="371">Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, Mr. Lightstone.</seg>
<seg id="372">Question 125 - 5 (1): School Leave Policy (Lightstone)</seg>
<seg id="373">My questions are for the Minister responsible for the Public Service Act.</seg>
<seg id="374">In previous years, the most recent annual reports of the government's public service indicate how much was spent on attendance leave.</seg>
<seg id="375">Unfortunately the 2016-17 annual report did not include these items.</seg>
<seg id="376">Will the minister commit to providing this information to the Legislative Assembly?</seg>
<seg id="377">Minister of Finance, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="378">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="379">It seems like the annual report that the member wants us to go through, but I'm sure it's going to be tabled within a year because the books are tabled.</seg>
<seg id="380">I can look into it and see if it's going to be there.</seg>
<seg id="381">Your first supplementary, Mr. Lightstone.</seg>
<seg id="382">I would just like to ask the minister if he can also provide the House with information on how many employees took advantage of this program in 2016-17.</seg>
<seg id="383">Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="384">Speaker: The question has been taken as notice.</seg>
<seg id="385">Member for Pangnirtung, Ms. Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="386">Question 126 - 5 (1): Status of Old Pangnirtung Health Centre (Nakashuk)</seg>
<seg id="387">Mr. Nakasuk: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="388">My questions today are for the Minister of Community and Government Services.</seg>
<seg id="389">I have also asked the minister about the old health centre in Pangnirtung that is no longer in use after the new health centre was opened.</seg>
<seg id="390">The old health centre is no longer in use for a long time, but it remains closed.</seg>
<seg id="391">My question is: what is the plan? Does the minister know what the status of the old health centre is?</seg>
<seg id="392">Minister of Community and Government Services, Minister Kusugak.</seg>
<seg id="393">Hon. Lorne Kusugak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="394">I also thank my colleague for that question.</seg>
<seg id="395">When the old buildings that are no longer being used by the government are no longer being used, it becomes a question to the executive director of the government if they would like to use them.</seg>
<seg id="396">The old health centre was built in 1975 in Pangnirtung and it went through that process.</seg>
<seg id="397">The Department of Health doesn't want to use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="398">There was a request for proposals from different governments and we haven't heard of any proposals from them.</seg>
<seg id="399">According to the process that the government uses, we are now making plans to see if the hamlet would like to take on that responsibility. That's where we're at right now.</seg>
<seg id="400">If they don't want to, then we would go to the non-profit community to see if they would like to get it.</seg>
<seg id="401">There is a process that goes through the disposal process.</seg>
<seg id="402">That's where we're at right now.</seg>
<seg id="403">Your first supplementary, Ms. Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="404">If I understand correctly, the communities have been asked if they would like to start devolution or what is the status of it?</seg>
<seg id="405">Hon. Lorne Kusugak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="406">We haven't heard of any requests from the government.</seg>
<seg id="407">At this time we are planning to see if the hamlet would like to get that funding.</seg>
<seg id="408">That's where we're at right now.</seg>
<seg id="409">Your final supplementary, Ms. Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="410">I also thank the minister for her response.</seg>
<seg id="411">I don't know if the hamlet would like it, but if it can't proceed from there, what happens when the old government buildings are no longer going to be used?</seg>
<seg id="412">I also thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="413">There are more than four barriers that we face.</seg>
<seg id="414">For example, when the old Pangnirtung health centre was no longer wanted by the Department of Health, we asked if it was a request from other government departments.</seg>
<seg id="415">We will look into it to see if it's a wish list for the hamlet.</seg>
<seg id="416">Those are the types of things that we use when we go through that process.</seg>
<seg id="417">Member for Aivilik, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="418">Question 127 - 5 (1): Family Services Client Travel Policy (Netser)</seg>
<seg id="419">Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="420">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="421">I would first like to say good afternoon to them. Since I have been here, I haven't had a good afternoon. I say good afternoon to them.</seg>
<seg id="422">We would like to go home very soon.</seg>
<seg id="423">Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that some of Nunavut's most vulnerable people have to travel south to receive care, even though they are far away from their families.</seg>
<seg id="424">I agree with the member that when you visit a family, it makes a lot of difference.</seg>
<seg id="425">The Department of Family Services Client Travel Policy was tabled on the government's website in June of 2013 and came into effect on March 31, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="426">It has been brought to my attention that the former Minister of Family Services has committed to making changes to the Family Services Client Travel Policy.</seg>
<seg id="427">Can the minister indicate if any changes to the Department of Family Services Client Travel Policy have been made since 2013 and, if not, will be made after March 31 of this year?</seg>
<seg id="428">Minister of Family Services, Minister Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="429">Hon. Joe Savikataaq: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="430">Mr. Speaker, I can't speak for the former minister first of all, but I can say that the policy will be in place until the end of March 2018 and it will remain in place until the new policy is changed.</seg>
<seg id="431">I have not heard of any other Department of Family Services officials making any changes to this policy.</seg>
<seg id="432">If there needs to be a change, we can look at it and we can't make any changes until we have a full review of it.</seg>
<seg id="433">If there is a need to change something that seems to be beneficial to the clients and to the government, we can look into it.</seg>
<seg id="434">Your first supplementary, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="435">Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="436">The Department of Family Services Family Services Client Travel Policy states that an elder who is under the care of the Department of Family Services can be visited by two family members or chaperones each year.</seg>
<seg id="437">Can the minister confirm if this policy has been amended to allow for two family members to visit twice a year on a regular basis?</seg>
<seg id="438">Two return tickets. Two can travel at the same time or one can visit twice.</seg>
<seg id="439">To be clear, there are two returns per ticket, two return tickets per year for each person in care.</seg>
<seg id="440">Your final supplementary, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="441">Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Will the minister commit to considering changes to the family travel policy for elders in care?</seg>
<seg id="442">The policy will be expiring very shortly and we will have to review it and I can't commit to it right now until we have a review of the whole policy.</seg>
<seg id="443">I'm sure that there will be a review of all the medical travel costs that the Department of Family Services pays for medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="444">We will have to work with the Department of Health to make sure that the policies are being followed, but I can't commit to anything other than that because the Client Travel Policy is coming to an end and I'm sure the details will be looked at.</seg>
<seg id="445">Member for Netsilik, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="446">Question 128 - 5 (1): Update on the Office of Patient Relations (Qirngnuq)</seg>
<seg id="447">Mr. Qirngnuq: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="448">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Health.</seg>
<seg id="449">Mr. Speaker, from time to time, my constituents come to my office to ask for help with their medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="450">As the minister has often told us, and even earlier this week, he issued a phone call that Nunavummiut can call the Office of Patient Relations if they have concerns.</seg>
<seg id="451">Mr. Speaker, language and where you live is a language, it becomes a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="452">Can the minister tell us what other options are available to the Office of the Patient Relations Office?</seg>
<seg id="453">Minister of Health, Ms. Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="454">Hon. Patterk Angnakak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="455">I understand your concern, but we try to encourage people to call a toll-free number so that you can get an answer right away.</seg>
<seg id="456">I don't have the information in front of me right now. There is an email address and there is a fax number.</seg>
<seg id="457">Your first supplementary, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="458">Mr. Qirngnuq: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I don't know if he answered my question or not, so I'll rephrase my question.</seg>
<seg id="459">Mr. Speaker, the Information and Privacy Commissioner has raised concerns about privacy issues, and I understand that there is an urgent need to address the issue of access to information in the event of a breach of confidentiality.</seg>
<seg id="460">The Office of Patient Relations has a form that outlines complaints or concerns.</seg>
<seg id="461">However, if you don't have a fax machine, you can't send it on your own, and you don't have a whole bunch of computers, so you can't take pictures of what is going to be put on the website.</seg>
<seg id="462">Can the minister clarify why the Office of Patient Relations does not have a fax machine?</seg>
<seg id="463">An Hon. Member: Good question.</seg>
<seg id="464">Minister Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="465">That's a very good question.</seg>
<seg id="466">I think it's because of the declining number of fax machines that are out there. As we move forward with the technology, as a government, we're using more software than paper.</seg>
<seg id="467">According to my briefing note, the government has a website that can be seen on www.ampnbsp @ gov.nu.ca. All the communities have health centres.</seg>
<seg id="468">If you want to send out applications by fax, you can send them out. There are government liaison officers in every community.</seg>
<seg id="469">They can be sent by fax to our headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="470">If the patient relations office didn't have a fax machine, then I can look into it.</seg>
<seg id="471">Member for Rankin Inlet North-Chesterfield Inlet, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="472">Question 129 - 5 (1): Income Assistance Policies (Towtongie)</seg>
<seg id="473">Mr. Towtongie: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="474">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="475">Mr. Speaker, I would like to follow up on some of the questions that were asked by the Member for Kugluktuk regarding income assistance.</seg>
<seg id="476">The minister indicated that those who receive income assistance from the department to sign off on the program are part of the program's productive choices.</seg>
<seg id="477">Can the minister clarify how the search for a successful candidate would be conducted without a clear mandate?</seg>
<seg id="478">Minister of Family Services, Minister Savikataaq.</seg>
<seg id="479">With respect to the member's statement about the benefits of choosing a successful candidate, it would be up to me if there is no job available, but there are times when they can get a job or a short term job.</seg>
<seg id="480">If it was appropriate to look for a suitable candidate, then they would have to go to the appropriate department. There is too much work to be done.</seg>
<seg id="481">Your first supplementary, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="482">The Income Assistance Program is a policy not a Government of Nunavut policy.</seg>
<seg id="483">If it was a policy, then we wouldn't be able to make changes as MLAs.</seg>
<seg id="484">What I see is that when there is no job for a young person, a young person in Taloyoak, who wants to sign a blank cheque on a monthly basis, that's what they're doing every month, and how they're going to make a good choice, it's just embarrassing and touching, and then the person who is on income support has pulled themselves out on top of that because they don't have a job, and then they go back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="485">Can the minister clearly describe what specific Nunavut specific policies can be developed for outpost camps?</seg>
<seg id="486">Right now it's a model that doesn't apply to Nunavut in the North.</seg>
<seg id="487">The policy is for Nunavut and it's just for Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="488">It's only for Nunavut outside of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="489">There was a review of income assistance and there was a change to the policy.</seg>
<seg id="490">At this time, there are still funds available for income assistance and there are still children who are not eligible for income assistance in Nunavut. There was a review done on that and there was a change.</seg>
<seg id="491">They have signed a contract and they will be able to see it again.</seg>
<seg id="492">If they don't have a job, then they can't get a job. However, the benefits have to be carefully chosen. However, this will be looked into further.</seg>
<seg id="493">Question 130 - 5 (1): Mine Training (Invitational)</seg>
<seg id="494">Mr. Irniq: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="495">I rise today to direct my question to the Minister of Economic Development and Transportation.</seg>
<seg id="496">Mr. Speaker, I strongly believe that when mining companies are trying to create jobs and manage the environment, the benefits are realized.</seg>
<seg id="497">Perhaps my question today will be in regard to the construction of residential schools.</seg>
<seg id="498">Last year you tabled your 2017-18 main estimates for the Department of Economic Development and Transportation, which included $200,000 in funding for the Nunavut Mine Training Program.</seg>
<seg id="499">Can the minister provide an update on how much money has been spent to date in 2017-18?</seg>
<seg id="500">Mr. Speaker, I hope I was understandable.</seg>
<seg id="501">Minister of Economic Development and Transportation, Ms. Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="502">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="503">I also thank the member for his question.</seg>
<seg id="504">What I can say about the mine training program is that it doesn't have a list of how it was spent.</seg>
<seg id="505">The department is working with Family Services, Nunavut Arctic College, the Government of Canada, our mining industry, and Inuit organizations to develop a number of projects to prepare Nunavummiut for opportunities in the mining industry. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="506">Your first supplementary, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="507">Mr. Irniq: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="508">I thank the minister for that response.</seg>
<seg id="509">Will the Department of Finance be increasing its budget or reducing its budget for the 2018-19 fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="510">Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="511">I can't respond to that question at this time, but I'm sorry if I can get back to the member's question on how the $200,000 has been spent.</seg>
<seg id="512">The Kitikmeot Corporation received $61,000 for this program, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association's Literacy Program for the Qikiqtaaluk region, $60,000, and the Hamlet of Arviat's Employment Plan Program, which received $78,000 for heavy equipment operator training.</seg>
<seg id="513">Thank you for clarifying that question.</seg>
<seg id="514">As you will recall, last week I tabled a copy of the Nunavut Impact Review Board's submission to the Nunavut Impact Review Board.</seg>
<seg id="515">They will be drilling near Hall Beach this spring.</seg>
<seg id="516">I would like to ask the minister and the Department of Economic Development and Transportation to work with not only the Arctic Air but all the mining companies to see how they can benefit from this training program in my community or in the High Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="517">To add to that, Hall Beach is a small community and they will be spending a lot of money, but they do work through the mining industry.</seg>
<seg id="518">You also stated that you will be supporting the mining industry.</seg>
<seg id="519">My question, Mr. Speaker, is: will you be able to manage the funds that you have identified, for example, the Mary River project?</seg>
<seg id="520">There is the Mary River project in the Baffin region and in the Kivalliq region, there is a gold project. In the Kitikmeot region, there is a gold project.</seg>
<seg id="521">Will they be able to be looked after properly?</seg>
<seg id="522">For example, if I was an Inuk who wanted to pursue a higher education, how would I be able to receive training and how would the Department of Economic Development and Transportation help me out?</seg>
<seg id="523">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also thank the member for that very good question because the Department of Economic Development and Transportation is not responsible for that.</seg>
<seg id="524">The Department of Education also has a mine training centre and it's also important to recognize that mining projects vary from year to year. There are different projects that have to be taken into consideration.</seg>
<seg id="525">It's tied to different departments. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="526">Oral Questions.</seg>
<seg id="527">Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="528">Question 131 - 5 (1): Support for Health Centre Staff (Main)</seg>
<seg id="529">Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="530">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Health.</seg>
<seg id="531">Let me start by saying that my question is related to many communities, not just my community.</seg>
<seg id="532">I believe it's a territory-wide issue with our nurses and our health care providers.</seg>
<seg id="533">Mr. Speaker, I believe that this is one of the reasons why there is so much work being done in English, such as the nurses being held at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="534">This is due to a lack of staff and due to the lack of staff, the number of positions is increasing due to the lack of staff.</seg>
<seg id="535">It's obvious that this causes a lot of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="536">I hope I was understandable in Inuktitut. I hope you understood me now.</seg>
<seg id="537">Let me say it in English. Mr. Speaker, the number of positions is increasing due to a lack of staff and the number of positions being filled is increasing.</seg>
<seg id="538">My question for the minister is this: can the minister tell us what actions her department has taken to provide additional support to health centre staff in communities with high levels of workload?</seg>
<seg id="539">Minister of Health, Ms. Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="540">I thank the member for that very important question.</seg>
<seg id="541">The issue of staffing the health centre is a serious one and that's one of the things that we have been working very hard as a department to make sure that we don't have a shortage of staff at the health centre.</seg>
<seg id="542">We're hoping that's the case, but we're always short of money.</seg>
<seg id="543">I know that the nurses are very tired.</seg>
<seg id="544">Our department tries to do what they can.</seg>
<seg id="545">We just recently did that in the community. We've got a tired nurse and we've sent more nurses to support them.</seg>
<seg id="546">If that's the case, then they send a nurse to the health centre when there is a high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="547">When a nurse is in a situation where there is a need for a holiday or a sick nurse in a situation like that, we look at where we can get an escort from the community.</seg>
<seg id="548">We don't want to reduce the number of nurses in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="549">Your first supplementary, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="550">Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="551">I thank the minister for her response.</seg>
<seg id="552">I think we're all concerned about the department's staffing numbers. To use my community as an example, it's clear that there are still too many vacant positions at the health centre.</seg>
<seg id="553">According to the article, 70 per cent of the positions are vacant, while Arviat is at 44 per cent vacant.</seg>
<seg id="554">I recognize that it's a difficult issue and it's a complex issue.</seg>
<seg id="555">I would now like to ask the minister if he can describe the challenges that his department faces in providing additional staff to community health centres that are always busy.</seg>
<seg id="556">Minister Angnakak.</seg>
<seg id="557">I don't know if it's after 30 months that we can't retain them when they're trained. I don't know if it's new or not, but it's very hard to be a nurse in the community.</seg>
<seg id="558">I think you have to take a good look at it. We have been working very hard to try to get the community support centre in place.</seg>
<seg id="559">Your final supplementary, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="560">I thank the minister for her response.</seg>
<seg id="561">Maybe to put it another way, Mr. Speaker, we know that there are a lot of problems in the communities. There's a lot of work being done and there's always a shortage of staff at the health centre.</seg>
<seg id="562">I would like to understand clearly what specific actions are being taken to address these problems in the communities. What is being done and what is being done to address these problems in the communities?</seg>
<seg id="563">What is being done and what is being done to ensure that our nurses and other health care professionals are being supported by the department?</seg>
<seg id="564">Hon. Patterk Angnakak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="565">Just for clarification, I don't have the substantiation sheet for the O &amp; M.</seg>
<seg id="566">For example, if we're only open for emergencies, they can't make appointments when their workload is too high or if there are too many nurses who have left the community for whatever reason.</seg>
<seg id="567">Our department, as I said, is trying to fill all the positions. It's a challenge that we're competing with across Canada.</seg>
<seg id="568">That's what we're trying to do. I know that they work with people who have experience in the north, not just in the north, but in northern Manitoba.</seg>
<seg id="569">I know that the Department of Health is very aware of the use of our nurses.</seg>
<seg id="570">As much as we can to help them out as much as we can, it's not easy to fix it right away, but we have to work on it all the time. If you have any ideas, let me know.</seg>
<seg id="571">Question 132 - 5 (1): Insurance Policy on Government Facilities (Hickes)</seg>
<seg id="572">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="573">My questions are for the Minister of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="574">Mr. Speaker, as we are all aware, all Nunavut communities have different infrastructure, such as air terminal buildings, health centres, schools, and office buildings.</seg>
<seg id="575">My question for the minister is: when it comes to the insurance program, is that infrastructure a single project or is it a separate project based on need?</seg>
<seg id="576">Minister of Finance, Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="577">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Our insurance premiums are broken down into different categories depending on what the infrastructure is.</seg>
<seg id="578">Each of our infrastructure has different policies and some don't even have policies. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="579">I recently saw on the news that one of our communities was trying to get another school burned down.</seg>
<seg id="580">The Department of Finance is trying to come up with a solution to ensure that the infrastructure is adequately insured. We also learned that the cost of our own infrastructure in Arctic Bay is $10 million.</seg>
<seg id="581">How will it affect the WCB in the event of another school fire? Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="582">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today there is an increase of $10 million to $20 million for schools that have been exposed to fires.</seg>
<seg id="583">We continue to lobby the Department of Education and all of us to lobby the federal government to address the high cost of living and unfortunately the high cost of arson.</seg>
<seg id="584">I think one of the things that we should try and do is show that we can continue to work on safety issues. We're doing a better job. We have to show that our own costs are increasing and we're getting our own insurance. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="585">I understand that it scares me, but when you look at the municipal insurance program, it was half of the cost.</seg>
<seg id="586">That was my question.</seg>
<seg id="587">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Hopefully we will continue to have insurance.</seg>
<seg id="588">The new $20 million is for school fires.</seg>
<seg id="589">Schools and other buildings have to pay $1 million on their own.</seg>
<seg id="590">There are different things.</seg>
<seg id="591">I can't say how many schools would have to be burned down, they don't have insurance anymore.</seg>
<seg id="592">I hope that we don't have this kind of fire in our government and I appreciate the fact that we have to continue to lobby all MLAs because this is a school for our children and for the public...</seg>
<seg id="593">It's not just schools and health centres that are vital to our service delivery.</seg>
<seg id="594">Any damage is a challenge to our customers and I would like to continue to push for these buildings.</seg>
<seg id="595">That's a reminder, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="596">This is a public housing unit where all students and the public, such as schools, health centres, and garages, all belong to the public service.</seg>
<seg id="597">I applaud you for tabling this document in the House. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="598">Question 133 - 5 (1): Expansion of Training Opportunities in Baker Lake (Mikkungwak)</seg>
<seg id="599">My questions are for the Minister responsible for Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="600">Mr. Speaker, in my member's statement, I noted that as the fifth Legislative Assembly of Nunavut, we have a new opportunity to push Nunavut towards a brighter future.</seg>
<seg id="601">Can the minister tell the House if he would be willing to reopen the idea of establishing a university in your community in partnership with the private sector and others?</seg>
<seg id="602">Minister responsible for Nunavut Arctic College, Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="603">I also thank the Member for Baker Lake for that question.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Nunavut Arctic College offered a proposal to various universities outside of the territory to look at how we can work together.</seg>
<seg id="605">We have also heard that various organizations, such as Agnico Eagle, have expressed their interest in establishing a university for Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="606">We would like to move forward on that, but to date we have been working on an agreement with other jurisdictions to work with Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="607">I strongly believe that we need to provide funding for the expansion of education from Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit to the Piqqusilirivvik program, such as the administration of students at the university.</seg>
<seg id="608">I feel that Baker Lake would be a very good location for such an expansion.</seg>
<seg id="609">Can the minister clarify if he and his officials have had any discussions with the board of governors of Nunavut Arctic College to look at ways to increase opportunities for post-secondary education in Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="610">Minister Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="611">We would like to see more opportunities for Nunavummiut to pursue post-secondary education in their communities. We have also noticed that there are opportunities for online learning.</seg>
<seg id="612">Further, with respect to the member's question about the Piqqusilirivvik Cultural School, we are looking at how we can expand the programs that are available at that time.</seg>
<seg id="613">Yes, they will be part of the Arctic College board of governors, along with my officials, the president of Nunavut Arctic College, and the vice-president, and they will be preparing to move forward on that.</seg>
<seg id="614">Your final supplementary, Mr. Mikkungwak.</seg>
<seg id="615">Mr. Mikkungwak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I recognize that the previous government agreed to a recommendation that Nunavut Arctic College would not be tabled at that time.</seg>
<seg id="616">Will the minister commit to getting back to me on this issue and reporting back to the House on what he knows about it?</seg>
<seg id="617">Minister Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="618">Hon. David Joanasie: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thank Mr. Mikkungwak for the question.</seg>
<seg id="619">The option of establishing a university in Nunavut is shared by a wide range of people.</seg>
<seg id="620">Agnico Eagle has also been able to come up with $5 million to build a new university if there is a demand for it.</seg>
<seg id="621">I believe the discussions are ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="622">Right now in the next four years I don't know if we want to go through that process, but it's going to be a feasibility study.</seg>
<seg id="623">Members, please note that the time for question period has expired.</seg>
<seg id="624">Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="625">Motion 015 - 5 (1): Extension of Question Period (Main)</seg>
<seg id="626">Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Pursuant to Rule 39 (7), I move, seconded by the Member for Iqaluit-Manirajak, that question period be extended. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="627">The motion is in order and is not debatable.</seg>
<seg id="628">All those in favour, raise your hand.</seg>
<seg id="629">All those opposed.</seg>
<seg id="630">As such, we have extended the time for oral questions by 30 minutes, starting now.</seg>
<seg id="631">Member for Arviat North-Whale Cove, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="632">Question 134 - 5 (1): Grants and Contributions (Main)</seg>
<seg id="633">Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="634">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Environment.</seg>
<seg id="635">I rise today to ask questions about the Department of Environment's Harvester Support Program and how it benefits our harvesters.</seg>
<seg id="636">In looking at the government's main estimates for 2017-18, there are three main estimates.</seg>
<seg id="637">Let me speak in English so that I can be clear. There are three grants that the Department of Environment administers under the Disaster Compensation Program, the Wildlife Damage Compensation Program, and the Fur Pricing Program.</seg>
<seg id="638">There has been $150,000 set aside for this year.</seg>
<seg id="639">Mr. Speaker, I would first like to ask if the minister can describe how the Department of Environment evaluates the effectiveness of its programs and services.</seg>
<seg id="640">Minister of Environment, Minister Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="641">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="642">The auction was held three times a year and they just recently held a auction in early March. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="643">Your first supplementary, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="644">I also thank the minister for his response on the sealing issue.</seg>
<seg id="645">Mr. Speaker, the information that has been provided to this House over the past few years is something that I really wanted to see and I think it's something that the hunters and trappers have to look at.</seg>
<seg id="646">In 2011 the Department of Environment reported that the fur auction price for sealskins was $800,000.</seg>
<seg id="647">In 2012 it was $1.1 million and in 2013 it was $1.04 million.</seg>
<seg id="648">Mr. Speaker, can the minister provide us with an update on the status of the Fur Pricing Program this year? I would like to get the latest information from the minister on whether or not this past year's Fur Pricing Program still looks like a good investment.</seg>
<seg id="649">Hon. Elisapee Sheutiapik: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I have a copy of what you read.</seg>
<seg id="650">I can't tell you where they're at right now because I don't have the latest tenders in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="651">I can tell you that after the Northern Lights Trade Show, the prices of sealskins will increase and we will be able to find out at that time when the fur auction will be held. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="652">Your final supplementary, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="653">I also thank the minister.</seg>
<seg id="654">This will be my final question, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="655">The Department of Environment is considering whether or not the hunters should be given more funding to help them out.</seg>
<seg id="656">With respect to fox pelts, we are very much aware of them as Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="657">I believe that the funding that is allocated for one year is too small, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="658">I think it's too small.</seg>
<seg id="659">I would like to ask the minister if he agrees with me and if he can look into this further in the next few months.</seg>
<seg id="660">I agree with you, and I look forward to tabling the proposed increases in the House if you support them.</seg>
<seg id="661">Question 135 - 5 (1): Compensation for Damage to Hunters and Trappers (Keyootak)</seg>
<seg id="662">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Environment.</seg>
<seg id="663">Mr. Speaker, as we are all aware in Nunavut, hunters are severely damaged by polar bears. Their cabins are destroyed and their equipment is no longer usable and their snowmobiles are destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="664">Mr. Speaker, there is a compensation program for damages, but it's very hard to get compensation for damages and damages.</seg>
<seg id="665">I'm just wondering if the funding for damaged equipment has been depleted this year.</seg>
<seg id="666">Minister of Environment, Ms. Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="667">I'm sorry I didn't hear all the details.</seg>
<seg id="668">Can he repeat the question?</seg>
<seg id="669">Speaker: Please repeat your first question, Mr. Keyootak.</seg>
<seg id="670">Our equipment, snowmobiles, and cabins are destroyed by polar bears, especially when we are away from them.</seg>
<seg id="671">We know that there are compensation programs for damages that have been done while we are away from them.</seg>
<seg id="672">My question was: have these funds already been used for this year's capital estimates?</seg>
<seg id="673">Speaker: Thank you for that clarification.</seg>
<seg id="674">Minister of Environment, Ms. Sheutiapik.</seg>
<seg id="675">Your first supplementary, Mr. Keyootak.</seg>
<seg id="676">The minister indicated that she would respond to that once she has the information.</seg>
<seg id="677">Can the minister indicate which communities in the Baffin region have been used for the Kivalliq and Kitikmeot regions?</seg>
<seg id="678">Yes, I will provide it to the member by region.</seg>
<seg id="679">Question 136 - 5 (1): Early Learning and Childcare (Hickes)</seg>
<seg id="680">I would like to direct my question to the Minister of Education.</seg>
<seg id="681">The Minister of Education stated this afternoon that all eligible daycares will be able to receive more licences based on their location and location.</seg>
<seg id="682">How much is being considered to be given to licensed daycare facilities?</seg>
<seg id="683">Minister responsible for the Nunavut Housing Corporation, Mr. Joanasie.</seg>
<seg id="684">Hon. David Joanasie: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="685">I thank Mr. Hickes for the question.</seg>
<seg id="686">The Department of Education's executive committee approved a 10-year collective agreement for a three-year term. Over the next three years, it has been broken down into four categories.</seg>
<seg id="687">If I can get you a breakdown of how much it is, the O &amp; M total of $1.1 million a year, is broken down by that year.</seg>
<seg id="688">That's the numbers that I have.</seg>
<seg id="689">I thank the minister for that clarification.</seg>
<seg id="690">Mr. Speaker, when I look at the Child Day Care Act in Nunavut, section 17 of the Public Service Act states that all employees who deal with children on a daily basis must be properly trained. That's one of the things that I expect.</seg>
<seg id="691">Mr. Speaker, I recognize that the Early Childhood Education Program is administered by Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="692">Are they evaluated on how well they're doing? Are they evaluated on the training needs that they're supposed to promote?</seg>
<seg id="693">Hon. David Joanasie: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also thank Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="694">Training is part of the collective agreement for a three-year term.</seg>
<seg id="695">The $1.1 million is outside the O &amp; M budget.</seg>
<seg id="696">We would like to get more certified teachers for early childhood education.</seg>
<seg id="697">That's one of the things that we're hoping to expand and train more on the job training and we're looking forward to the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="698">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I thank the minister.</seg>
<seg id="699">I look forward to continuing to provide that information to the House.</seg>
<seg id="700">When I look at the staff at the daycare and the curriculum that is available, I have always heard that when the staff is trained, it seems like it's more effective to train them.</seg>
<seg id="701">Mr. Speaker, I have also heard concerns about the lack of income for daycare workers and the high turnover of full-time daycare workers.</seg>
<seg id="702">When it comes to standardizing the education system for our children in the early childhood education system, it's very important to stay in the workforce.</seg>
<seg id="703">Is this funding to support the daycare workers so that they can get a better wage so that they can continue to work there and not work there on a casual basis?</seg>
<seg id="704">I agree with Mr. Hickes and I fully understand and agree that we want to make sure that children are ready to learn and succeed in life before they enter the school system.</seg>
<seg id="705">That's what we're trying to do and we're trying to support the daycare staff.</seg>
<seg id="706">As long as part of the collective agreement does not increase the cost of providing daycare services, I believe that we can work to ensure that staff at the daycare are able to effectively meet their basic needs.</seg>
<seg id="707">We're still working on it and we want to make sure that we have daycare workers across the territory.</seg>

<seg id="709">Question 137 - 5 (1): Inuit Employment Requirements for Government Contracts (Main)</seg>
<seg id="710">On Friday, March 16, I asked the Minister of Community and Government Services questions on this issue. I spoke with the minister and asked for more information on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="711">The increase in the number of Inuit working within the department is based on the number of Inuit who will be working on these projects.</seg>
<seg id="712">Mr. Speaker, the minister and I seem to agree that they're in support of increasing the number of Inuit employed.</seg>
<seg id="713">About 20 per cent of that is related to the construction of the Baffin Correctional Centre and the marine infrastructure in Iqaluit and Pond Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="714">If I understood correctly, Mr. Speaker, it was at 20 per cent and 15 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="715">Can the minister describe what options are currently being considered to change the number of tenders that have been issued and if the department has the authority to do so?</seg>
<seg id="716">Minister of Community and Government Services, Minister Kusugak.</seg>
<seg id="717">I believe the member understands that when it comes to tendering, the Department of Community and Government Services helps the departments that will have the equipment.</seg>
<seg id="718">If it's going to be a marine facility, then the Department of Economic Development and Transportation, if we're talking about a correctional facility, is the Department of Justice?</seg>
<seg id="719">We work with them to make sure that the contracts are being followed. We help them out because we don't have control over them.</seg>
<seg id="720">We work with our client departments and they try to figure out how many Inuit can be employed.</seg>
<seg id="721">We try to make sure that we don't go over budget and if they're going to go over budget, they're going to go down and get what they can get, but we work with the departments to make sure that they don't go over budget.</seg>
<seg id="722">I can't say right now that after the tender has been issued, it's going to be tendered out and I don't think it's possible to change that, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="723">I would like to ask about that.</seg>
<seg id="724">If there are no changes to the tender process, then what other options would be available for Inuit employment?</seg>
<seg id="725">Can the Department of Community and Government Services work on this?</seg>
<seg id="726">I hope I was clear, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="727">Can the minister tell me, and perhaps tell the House, what is the status of employees from other communities who wish to work during the construction season, and can employees from Nunavut receive the same benefits that employees from outside of Nunavut receive?</seg>
<seg id="728">Hon. Lorne Kusugak: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="729">I thank the member for that question.</seg>
<seg id="730">Mr. Speaker, the Nunavummi Nangminiqaqtunik Ikajuuti Policy provides that contractors conduct inspections on issues related to Inuit labour content and sets out the terms and conditions of the contract:</seg>
<seg id="731">Detail of Expenditures;</seg>
<seg id="732">Inuit who are available to work in the labour force based on their education;</seg>
<seg id="733">Other community projects could affect the availability of Inuit employment.</seg>
<seg id="734">Mr. Speaker, we encourage contractors in the communities to hire local representatives from the regions before they can recruit from outside the territory.</seg>
<seg id="735">That's why we encourage people who come to Nunavut to look for employment.</seg>
<seg id="736">We encourage them to do that.</seg>
<seg id="737">We work very closely with the client departments to make sure that they're meeting their targets.</seg>
<seg id="738">Your first supplementary, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="739">Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also thank the minister for his response.</seg>
<seg id="740">For my final question, I would like to ask the minister if he can commit to working with his department to address the major infrastructure needs in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="741">Will the minister commit to working with the Department of Community and Government Services to ensure that job opportunities are created and that Inuit can apply for jobs during construction projects in communities outside of the territory?</seg>
<seg id="742">Will the minister commit to ensuring that this option is taken into consideration to ensure that Nunavummiut are included in the contracting process?</seg>
<seg id="743">I believe the Government of Nunavut as a whole encourages the public to look for employment opportunities for Nunavummiut first.</seg>
<seg id="744">That's the way we're always set up and we will continue to do that.</seg>

<seg id="787">Bill 02 - Interim Appropriation (Operations &amp; Maintenance) Act, April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018 - Consideration in Committee</seg>
<seg id="788">Go to Bill 2 in your legislation binder.</seg>
<seg id="789">We will proceed. Mr. Akeeagok, do you have witnesses that you would like to bring to the witness table?</seg>
<seg id="790">Hon. David Akeeagok: Yes, Mr. Chairman, if I may, I would like to have officials join me at the witness table.</seg>
<seg id="791">Chairman: Does the committee agree to bring in the witnesses?</seg>
<seg id="792">Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the witnesses in.</seg>
<seg id="793">Mr. Akeeagok, for the record, please introduce your officials and proceed with your opening comments.</seg>
<seg id="794">To my left is my Assistant Deputy Minister, Dan Carr.</seg>
<seg id="795">Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to be here today to present Bill 2, Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, 2018-2019.</seg>
<seg id="796">With this bill coming into force, the government is requesting you to spend $491,804,000 between April 1, 2018 and June 30, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="797">Mr. Chairman, over the course of this year the Minister of Finance has been here for the whole fiscal year, but we have just sat in the Fifth Assembly and we're still planning what we're going to do.</seg>
<seg id="798">With that being the case, the 2018-19 budget for the 2018-19 fiscal year will be in the capital estimates for the upcoming spring sitting in May and June.</seg>
<seg id="799">To that end, Mr. Chairman, in the interim appropriation, the department will be able to fulfill its mandate to provide services to Nunavummiut within the next few months.</seg>
<seg id="800">This is a critical step in setting aside money for this year's general election.</seg>
<seg id="801">Mr. Chairman, all departments and territorial corporations have had an opportunity to review these interim appropriations. Our calculations are based on departmental spending and cash flow over the last four years.</seg>
<seg id="802">We are satisfied that this amount will be sufficient to cover the operations of the Legislative Assembly after the review of the bill and the passage of the annual budget.</seg>
<seg id="803">These are the details of the two pieces of legislation that we will be requesting funding for:</seg>
<seg id="804">$8.62 million for the Office of the Legislative Assembly;</seg>
<seg id="805">$11.66 million to the Department of Community and Government Services;</seg>
<seg id="806">$29.08 million to the Department of Finance;</seg>
<seg id="807">$49.1 million for the Department of Family Services;</seg>
<seg id="808">$32.44 million for the Department of Justice;</seg>
<seg id="809">$10.77 million for the Department of Culture and Heritage;</seg>
<seg id="810">$64.1 million for the Department of Education;</seg>
<seg id="811">$85.77 million for the Department of Health's old office buildings;</seg>
<seg id="812">$8.32 million for the Department of Environment office;</seg>
<seg id="813">$82.73 million, for the Department of Community and Government Services old office buildings;</seg>
<seg id="814">$23.29 million to the Department of Economic Development and Transportation for office space;</seg>
<seg id="815">$73.39 million for the Nunavut Housing Corporation; and</seg>
<seg id="816">$12.54 million, Nunavut Arctic College.</seg>
<seg id="817">Mr. Chairman, that concludes my opening comments.</seg>
<seg id="818">I would now be pleased to answer any questions or comments that members may have.</seg>
<seg id="819">I would now like to ask if members have general comments.</seg>
<seg id="820">Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="821">Mr. Towtongie: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="822">I was reading the Inuktitut copy. $32.44 million for the Department of Justice in Inuktitut is $32.44 for the Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="823">Is there a difference in Inuktitut of $8.62 million for the Office of the Legislative Assembly or the Department of Justice?</seg>
<seg id="824">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. For clarification, the Office of the Legislative Assembly is requesting $8.62 million and the Department of Justice is seeking $32.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="825">I'm sorry if it wasn't translated properly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="826">The English version is correct.</seg>
<seg id="827">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="828">I just have a question on the interim appropriation and we're not at a percentage of the budget, so I would like to ask the minister if he can indicate what the expenditures are and how they're going to spend the money and how they're going to spend the money that they're going to spend on elections.</seg>
<seg id="829">I recognize that there has been a lot of debate on financial management, and the minister has indicated that there needs to be real changes to ensure that we have the right departments to provide the services that they're supposed to provide to Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="830">It's not directly related to that, Mr. Chairman. It's related to the bill. It's related to that.</seg>
<seg id="831">Have there been any changes to the allocation of funds in the upcoming fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="832">Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="833">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="834">As of now, there haven't been any real changes to the operations and maintenance budget, but I'm sure we will see the capital budget this fall. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="835">Are there any more general comments?</seg>
<seg id="836">If members have any questions on the opening comments, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="837">If there are none, we will proceed to the clause-by-clause review of the bill.</seg>
<seg id="838">Go to Bill 2 in your white legislation binder.</seg>
<seg id="839">Bill 2, Interim Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="840">Chairman: Clause 2. Do you agree?</seg>
<seg id="841">Chairman: Go to Schedule on page 2. Page 3. Schedule. Interim Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, April 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018.</seg>
<seg id="842">Vote 1: Operations and Maintenance. Interim Appropriation. $491,804,000.</seg>
<seg id="843">Thank you, Mr. Main. Do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="844">Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="845">I'm sure I should have tabled this earlier, but I have a question on the department's grants and contributions.</seg>
<seg id="846">It's my understanding that the figures are based on a percentage of the annual amount, but some of the grants and contributions are already spent and the funds for the entire fiscal year will be spent as soon as April 1.</seg>
<seg id="847">I just want to clarify a little bit more in terms of the grants and contributions that are provided through the Department of Economic Development and Transportation or the Nunavut Housing Corporation. How does that work when the funding is not for a whole year, but some of the programs are run on an annual basis?</seg>
<seg id="848">Chairman: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="849">Hon. David Akeeagok: That's a good question.</seg>
<seg id="850">With respect to the allocation of funds, as I stated in my opening comments, the last four years, when I look at the departments, some of them are for the first three months of the grants and contributions, as I mentioned earlier.</seg>
<seg id="851">I can say that the Department of Community and Government Services and the Nunavut Housing Corporation are one of the biggest departments. As you can see, their grants and contributions are for operations and maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="852">When it comes to a request for proposals, there are a number of different departments that have different systems in place, but over the last four years all the departments have been spending their budgets on a quarterly basis. The Department of Finance is looked at and the departments agree on how their grants and contributions work.</seg>
<seg id="853">Chairman: Thank you, Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="854">My next question is: can the minister confirm whether or not there are any projects that have been put on hold or are they just going to go through the normal process?</seg>
<seg id="855">Chairman: Thank you, Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="856">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We are operating the same department and those are the numbers that have been given to us.</seg>
<seg id="857">Hopefully by tomorrow, we will be able to look at our business plan for the future. We have been able to come up with a plan for the Fifth Assembly. We have been given direction from the departments and cabinet. It's going to be the same for the next three months. In May, we will be reviewing those projects again.</seg>
<seg id="858">Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="859">I'm sorry. Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="860">Mr. Qirngnuq: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I also thank the minister and his officials.</seg>
<seg id="861">In the main estimates, there is $491,804,000. The figures are broken down by region.</seg>
<seg id="862">For example, in the bill, $8,623,000 will be used. In the minister's opening comments, it states $8.26 million.</seg>
<seg id="863">It's not $3,000 and it seems like the total amount is $54,000.</seg>
<seg id="864">What is the reason for that?</seg>
<seg id="865">That's my question.</seg>
<seg id="866">Chairman: Thank you, Mr. Qirngnuq.</seg>
<seg id="867">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="868">The bill is on page 3 in Inuktitut, so we're trying to get the exact numbers approved.</seg>
<seg id="869">Those are the actual figures.</seg>
<seg id="870">As I stated in my opening comments, I have just reduced the numbers in English to keep them close to the main estimates. I don't want to say all of the figures, but we have reduced them by number.</seg>
<seg id="871">The numbers that we're looking at in the bill are accurate, but he doesn't say all of them.</seg>
<seg id="872">Total Supplementary Appropriation. $491,804,000. Do you agree?</seg>
<seg id="873">Clause 5. Do you agree?</seg>
<seg id="874">Chairman: Do you agree to Bill 2 as a whole?</seg>
<seg id="875">Do members agree, pursuant to Rule 62 (2), that Bill 2 can immediately be placed on the orders of the day for third reading?</seg>
<seg id="876">Minister Akeeagok, do you have any closing comments?</seg>
<seg id="877">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would just like to thank my officials for being prepared to allow our government to operate until June.</seg>
<seg id="878">I thank all members for their support in approving this budget. I look forward to sitting in the House during our budget session in May and June.</seg>
<seg id="879">I thank you all.</seg>
<seg id="880">Bill 2 is done.</seg>
<seg id="881">I would now like to ask the minister if he can proceed with his opening comments on Bill 3.</seg>
<seg id="882">Bill 03 - Supplementary Appropriation (Operations &amp; Maintenance) Act, No. 3, 2017-2018 - Consideration in Committee</seg>
<seg id="883">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="884">I will keep my officials at the witness table and I would like you to know that as soon as we get to the witness table, I will be able to bring in another witness, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="885">Mr. Chairman, can I begin with my opening comments?</seg>
<seg id="886">I am pleased to present Bill 3, Supplementary Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) Act, 2017-2018, No. 3. This bill proposes to increase the government's budget by $56,602,000 for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="887">$49 million will be required by the Department of Health to cover over-expenditures on medical travel, mental health, addictions treatment, elders care, medical care, and tuberculosis research;</seg>
<seg id="888">$6.2 million will be required by the Department of Justice to cover the over-expenditures of the RCMP, Corrections and Justice; and</seg>
<seg id="889">$1.402 million has been spent on child care, family services, and banking services.</seg>
<seg id="890">Mr. Chairman, that concludes my opening comments. I would be pleased to respond to any questions or comments that members may have.</seg>
<seg id="891">Are there any general comments?</seg>
<seg id="892">Supplementary Appropriation (Operations and Maintenance) 2017-18 No. 3. Family Services. Not Previously Authorized.</seg>
<seg id="893">Total Children and Family Services. $1,402,000.</seg>
<seg id="894">Yes, the number that I just saw in the substantiation sheets still doesn't give me any detail as to what areas you're focusing on.</seg>
<seg id="895">Hon. Joe Savikataaq: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="896">Hon. David Savikataaq: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="897">I don't have the breakdown in front of me, but there are two main cases where we send more people out of the territory to receive care. There has been an increase in the number of people that we send out of the territory.</seg>
<seg id="898">For example, there is an elder from Igloolik, Gjoa Haven, and I don't know which community, who is in Ottawa, who has been given a ticket to visit, so that they can get a visit.</seg>
<seg id="899">They don't get any help from the Department of Family Services, but they do visit their families.</seg>
<seg id="900">The majority of our elders who are sent out of the territory are not eligible for support in Nunavut. As per my earlier statement, there are more visits to the communities.</seg>
<seg id="901">In the collection of all the elders programs that the Department of Family Services is responsible for, I would like to ask if the Department of Family Services has ever returned to the Department of Health, but are you still dealing with elders through Family Services?</seg>
<seg id="902">Some of the things the minister mentioned are not directly related to the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="903">Some of them are in the care of the Department of Health and some of them are in the care of the Department of Health and Social Services and there is funding available through the Department of Family Services for travel.</seg>
<seg id="904">That's one of the examples I used. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="905">I understand that some of the clients have to be visited because the money is in the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="906">My question is: are there still elders who are receiving income assistance that haven't been transferred to the Department of Health?</seg>
<seg id="907">Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="908">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. According to what I have right now, the information that I have is that the transfer has been transferred to the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="909">The ones that haven't been transferred to the Department of Health are still managed by the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="910">I'm just wondering if there are any other programs that haven't been transferred over to Family Services. I'm just looking at the information and looking at our business plan, I believe they're all transferred over. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="911">Maybe I'm confused, but if the minister can ask the Minister of Family Services to clarify that, I would appreciate it.</seg>
<seg id="912">It's up to Minister Akeeagok to respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="913">Hon. David Akeeagok: I'll try to clarify it.</seg>
<seg id="914">I thought the question was: are there still people in the Department of Health that still have to be with Family Services?</seg>
<seg id="915">My response was that the Department of Health is there right now and the elders care is there.</seg>
<seg id="916">The Department of Family Services is still under Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="917">The supplementary appropriation is for what the Department of Family Services spent. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="918">I thank the minister for that clarification.</seg>
<seg id="919">I understand a lot better now.</seg>
<seg id="920">Maybe I'll rephrase my question a little bit more clearly.</seg>
<seg id="921">Is the Department of Family Services still responsible for elders? Does the Department of Family Services still have programs for elders?</seg>
<seg id="922">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yes, there is still funding available for elders and I would like the Minister of Family Services to clarify that.</seg>
<seg id="923">I recognize that the government's programs, such as the Senior Fuel Subsidy Program, the Income Assistance Program for Seniors, and the Department of Family Services, I'm sure, are responsible for over 60 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="924">If I skip, Minister Savikataaq can assist me in responding to that question. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="925">I thank both ministers for that clarification.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my final question.</seg>
<seg id="927">When Nunavut residents are sent outside of the territory, do they still receive income assistance from Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="928">Hon. David Akeeagok: Through you, Mr. Chairman, I would like Minister Savikataaq to respond to that question. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="929">Chairman: Thank you, Mr. Hickes.</seg>
<seg id="930">It varies depending on the situation.</seg>
<seg id="931">There are times when people are eligible for income assistance, but I can't say that all of them are the same.</seg>
<seg id="932">I have a very detailed question under the department.</seg>
<seg id="933">They have indicated that they will be submitting surplus funds from other departments.</seg>
<seg id="934">As it stands, do the other departments that are here support the whole of Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="935">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It doesn't affect all regions.</seg>
<seg id="936">In addition to the Department of Family Services, most of the money was transferred to the Department of Health's Income Assistance Program.</seg>
<seg id="937">They don't get a lot of income support. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="938">I thank the minister for her response.</seg>
<seg id="939">When you're going to be submitting submissions from different departments, when do you identify potential deficits and how do you deal with them?</seg>
<seg id="940">I don't know if that has anything to do with our meeting, but Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="941">Our department reports on a monthly basis and at the end of the fiscal year, it's a little over budget. If we can't do that, then we have to go through a supplementary appropriation.</seg>
<seg id="942">We're on page 4.</seg>
<seg id="943">Mr. Main.</seg>
<seg id="944">The document that we have in front of us indicates that the number of people living in residential care is increasing. The number of people living in residential care was 189. The number of people in residential care was 243.</seg>
<seg id="945">Do you anticipate that this number will continue to increase?</seg>
<seg id="946">What is the reason for the increase in the number of people requiring care?</seg>
<seg id="947">Do you know what the reason is for the increase in the number of people requiring care?</seg>
<seg id="948">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The number of clients was increasing in 2013 and that's why we're following the increase.</seg>
<seg id="949">As things have been changing for a number of years, will that be included in the budget as of now, starting with last year's budget, I don't want to commit to approving a supplementary appropriation so that you can have the correct budget in place?</seg>
<seg id="950">Will that be included in the increase?</seg>
<seg id="951">As we go through each page, it will be obvious that we will be able to talk about the changes that are happening and if we don't keep up with the budget, then we will be able to review our budgets.</seg>
<seg id="952">We will be asking questions during the review of the main estimates. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="953">In your substantiation sheet, it states that there is a surplus within the department.</seg>
<seg id="954">It also indicates that the department has recently revised its Income Assistance Program.</seg>
<seg id="955">I'm just wondering if the minister can indicate if any of the surplus funds have been depleted by the administration of the Income Assistance Program or will the majority of the money be allocated to income assistance clients.</seg>
<seg id="956">Which one of those increases was it?</seg>
<seg id="957">I'm trying to understand where the surplus went, where was it spent?</seg>
<seg id="958">Is the income assistance amount being paid more or has the income assistance amount been increased? Where did the surplus go?</seg>
<seg id="959">Chairman: Thank you. Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="960">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. There are a number of issues with the Department of Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="961">They have been hired to manage the transfer from one department to another and some of them have started to work on who they are and how they work.</seg>
<seg id="962">The government's response to the member's question was that they send people to residential care in a number of areas.</seg>
<seg id="963">There are a number of factors in how the Department of Family Services has reached its budget shortfall during the current fiscal year. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="964">I'll leave it there.</seg>
<seg id="965">The information indicates that the department spends more money on income assistance than it does on income assistance, which indicates that it spends more money on income assistance.</seg>
<seg id="966">Will the money that is being requested be used for staff or will it be used for income assistance?</seg>
<seg id="967">My colleague, Savikataaq, is better able to respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="968">Mr. Savikataaq, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="969">The income assistance adjustments have a significant impact on the funding. I can use this as an example.</seg>
<seg id="970">The National Child Benefit Supplement was deducted from the income and income assistance calculations.</seg>
<seg id="971">The income assistance recipients will no longer be able to receive more money, but the income assistance families will no longer be able to deduct their income assistance from their income assistance payments.</seg>
<seg id="972">We're on Total Children and Family Services.</seg>
<seg id="973">Not Previously Authorized. $1,402,000.</seg>
<seg id="974">Justice. Operations and Maintenance. Not Previously Authorized.</seg>
<seg id="975">Total Department. $2,600,000.</seg>
<seg id="976">Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="977">Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="978">Minister, welcome.</seg>
<seg id="979">It states here that the purchase of new drugs will be part of the legislative changes to marijuana by the federal government this summer. Is that the plan?</seg>
<seg id="980">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to ask the Deputy Minister of Justice to go to the witness table and get the Deputy Minister of Justice to respond to the member's question.</seg>
<seg id="981">Do you agree to bring in the witness?</seg>
<seg id="982">Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the other witness out.</seg>
<seg id="983">For the record, Mr. Akeeagok, please introduce your witness.</seg>
<seg id="984">To my left is the Deputy Minister of Justice, Bill MacKay.</seg>
<seg id="985">If it's okay with you, I would like to respond to the question.</seg>
<seg id="986">Mr. Chairman, that's a very good question regarding the Department of Justice and the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="987">That doesn't apply to marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="988">We don't want the prescription drugs in Canada to come to Nunavut, but these are new drugs that we need to learn and implement.</seg>
<seg id="989">In December, at the finance ministers meeting, the money that will be allocated for marijuana will be 25 per cent of the money from the federal government that will go to the RCMP to do inspections on marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="990">That's two parts.</seg>
<seg id="991">I thank the minister for her response.</seg>
<seg id="992">My next question is in regard to the high cost of housing in the communities.</seg>
<seg id="993">I'm just wondering if the minister can explain why this is in there.</seg>
<seg id="994">Chairman: Thank you, Mr. Netser.</seg>
<seg id="995">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This relates to the fact that the RCMP received nine additional RCMP officers in various communities and that's why they provide staff housing.</seg>
<seg id="996">When there are additional RCMP officers, we have to go through the government contract to get housing. The additional costs were around $300,000. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="997">Mr. Main, did you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="998">Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="999">The minister mentioned that there's $2,600,000 divided by $300,000 for housing.</seg>
<seg id="1000">Can you break it down in a little bit more detail?</seg>
<seg id="1001">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1002">I'll ask our officials.</seg>
<seg id="1003">Those are the numbers that are there.</seg>
<seg id="1004">Thank you Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1005">I also thank the minister for her response. $1 million will be used for vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1006">Why was it that these vehicles were not expected to be purchased?</seg>
<seg id="1007">I believe it was supposed to be included in the budget, if I understood correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Can the minister indicate if this was the reason for the purchase of new vehicles?</seg>
<seg id="1009">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. That's a good question.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The $1 million is for the replacement of vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1011">We have a contract with the RCMP and there are different things that they have to do.</seg>
<seg id="1012">He stated last year that his vehicles were not changed due to a lack of funding.</seg>
<seg id="1013">However, earlier this year, the vehicles that were damaged were purchased to meet their basic needs.</seg>
<seg id="1014">That's why it has gone up so much this year.</seg>
<seg id="1015">They have tried to save a lot of money, but their equipment is breaking down and that's how it is.</seg>
<seg id="1016">Under the contract with the RCMP, we don't go through the procurement process. We don't go through that process.</seg>
<seg id="1017">However, in our discussions with the federal government, we have to come to an agreement with them and it seems like it has gone up too much.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1019">It also states here that my colleague is referring to this issue.</seg>
<seg id="1020">These new drugs, I believe, are the most dangerous drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1021">Will the equipment that will be used for the study be made available to all the communities or will it be just some of them?</seg>
<seg id="1022">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yes, all the RCMP officers will be getting that information for all the communities.</seg>
<seg id="1023">Those are the new equipment that will be used to monitor the RCMP and the general public. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1024">If the drugs are dangerous or if they're new drugs, they're starting to find drugs in our communities. Have there been any plans or, if not, which communities have been found by the RCMP to date?</seg>
<seg id="1025">Yes, the people who are coming to our communities are very happy and I hope that they will stop there.</seg>
<seg id="1026">However, there have been two communities that have been affected by this and the things that are happening in Canada are going to be coming to the territory.</seg>
<seg id="1027">It's very dangerous and I'm very afraid that the people who are going to be trying to get drugs are going to be involved.</seg>
<seg id="1028">If you don't get those things, it's a lot easier, but the things that are happening are dangerous and I'm very glad that the RCMP is preparing for them.</seg>
<seg id="1029">Mr. Main: I thought I was done.</seg>
<seg id="1030">That's my final question.</seg>
<seg id="1031">In regard to the lack of housing in the communities in Nunavut, if you can clarify that for me.</seg>
<seg id="1032">According to the documents that we have provided, there have been nine additional RCMP officers. There have been nine or six communities in Nunavut that have been decentralized to various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1033">That's just a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1034">Moving on, Mr. Hickes, do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the $2.6 million that you're requesting, it talks about the interpreter / translators going to court. You stated that there were seven judges who had to get an interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. At this time no, there are a number of additional interpreters that are required to fill the positions. At this time, it was very important that we have trained interpreter / translators in the Department of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1037">I'll leave it at that. In his statement he also talks about the need for new telephone systems to be maintained and maintained.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Now that we know that they're going to have to replace their existing telephone systems, will they be putting money aside for new equipment or will they be asking for additional funding once they know the number of RCMP members?</seg>
<seg id="1039">Yes, this is currently being planned by the department and we will be requesting the funding. That's what we're planning.</seg>
<seg id="1040">The finance ministers are going to be there for the public service and if the RCMP plans to pass the marijuana legislation, as my colleague has indicated, they're going to do some pilot projects, but there's nothing in the budget for marijuana. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the other correctional facilities that the member is referring to, there is a full complement of staff at the Baffin Correctional Centre. How many staff do they have at the Baffin Correctional Centre?</seg>
<seg id="1042">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Item 8.</seg>
<seg id="1043">Is that what he said eight?</seg>
<seg id="1044">Mr. Hickes: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Now I would like to ask the question. The information that I have on the overtime is that it states that when the Baffin Correctional Centre is removed, it costs $180,000. Is that correct, Mr. Chairman?</seg>
<seg id="1045">Can the minister clarify that for me?</seg>
<seg id="1046">Through you, I would like Deputy Minister MacKay to respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1047">Mr. MacKay: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1048">The chief medical officer of health is a nurse. There are a lot of other staff that work there. If there is a bad weather, they have to stay there, so it's added to the overtime costs.</seg>
<seg id="1049">When there is a blizzard, they can't go home, so they have to go to work again. Is it twice the number of staff that are there when there is a blizzard?</seg>
<seg id="1050">Mr. MacKay, can you clarify that, please?</seg>
<seg id="1051">Yes, there are two cases where there is a blizzard. If there is a blizzard, then they are given to us right away, but there are two cases where the staff is there.</seg>
<seg id="1052">Mr. Lightstone.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1054">My questions are for the Minister of Justice. The first one is that the RCMP has identified a need for housing for the next nine RCMP members.</seg>
<seg id="1055">When you get an RCMP officer, do they get housing on a case by case basis?</seg>
<seg id="1056">I am pleased to say that one of my staff, who was just playing a hockey game with one of the staff members, may be fine, but my deputy minister can't write a letter.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You have to have a whiskey.</seg>
<seg id="1058">My question is in regard to the nine RCMP officers who receive federal government housing.</seg>
<seg id="1059">As I stated earlier, we work with the RCMP on a contract basis.</seg>
<seg id="1060">I would like to clarify for the committee that 70 per cent of the RCMP costs are paid by the Government of Nunavut and 30 per cent is paid by the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="1061">The RCMP does receive a contract with the federal government. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1062">Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1063">I'm just wondering if the RCMP will be providing housing for all RCMP officers.</seg>
<seg id="1064">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. When the RCMP sends their staff to the community, they have a specified number of years.</seg>
<seg id="1065">That's how they operate in a unique way and they don't keep their RCMP officers out on the land because they send them out.</seg>
<seg id="1066">They don't expect to get their own housing in most communities at all times, but they don't know how many RCMP officers they will need based on the availability of housing in the communities.</seg>
<seg id="1067">The RCMP has a unique system that they operate independently.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When they identify a need for an RCMP officer, they try to include all 25 communities as soon as possible. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1069">It's unfortunate that the RCMP don't try to make the communities a part of it.</seg>
<seg id="1070">When the RCMP buys their own home, what kind of assistance do they provide?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Chairman: Thank you, Mr. Lightstone.</seg>
<seg id="1072">I don't think anyone should be asking that question here.</seg>
<seg id="1073">I don't think we have to expect them to get their own housing, so that's why they're provided with housing.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Mr. Akeeagok, if you want to comment on that, it's up to you.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1076">Those are very good comments, Mr. Chairman, and they are very good comments.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Yes, although the RCMP has only been in the community for three years, they do fundraising in the community.</seg>
<seg id="1078">If the RCMP wants to get a house, they have to apply to the federal government for housing.</seg>
<seg id="1079">It's not through our department. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1080">My last question is in regard to the RCMP. What is the total value of the contract that you have with the RCMP?</seg>
<seg id="1081">Schedule 1. Page 5. $40,071,000.</seg>
<seg id="1082">If approved, it will be $42,671,000 for the contract. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</seg>
<seg id="1083">I thank the minister for that clarification.</seg>
<seg id="1084">For the third time, the Corrections Division is responsible for overtime and casual staffing.</seg>
<seg id="1085">Chairman: Mr. Lightstone, we're finally here. We haven't got there yet. Can you wait for your questions?</seg>
<seg id="1086">At this time we're asking questions on law enforcement. Are there any more questions on that?</seg>
<seg id="1087">Mr. Lightstone: Yes, the last one is for law enforcement.</seg>
<seg id="1088">In the minister's letter, he explained that the total amount of money was $40 million and the total amount of money spent by MLAs was $30 million, which is expected to increase to $42 million for escorts.</seg>
<seg id="1089">How is the $42 million expected to be spent by the end of the fiscal year?</seg>
<seg id="1090">Maybe I can ask the member if he can indicate which figures he's looking at.</seg>
<seg id="1091">If there is a figure, I would like to get some assistance. I believe I sent the letter on Friday and I believe it was $30 million, but if you can elaborate a little bit more.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The letter dated March 16 was addressed to the Chair of the Regular Members Caucus, which was provided to the Minister of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="1093">The letter that I'm referring to is on page 4 and it's on page 4 of 5 in total.</seg>
<seg id="1094">I would like to thank the member for his question. I see it in the document that we tabled.</seg>
<seg id="1095">The $30 million that has been budgeted for this year is $30 million and the plan is $42 million.</seg>
<seg id="1096">They have explained how they're going to spend the money and how much they're going to spend. The $2.6 million that we have requested is based on the RCMP numbers. That's what I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1097">I'm looking at $2.6 million in Project 1 in the Legislative Assembly's substantiation sheet, which indicates that the RCMP is travelling with more sophisticated radio equipment that can't be used, and on top of that, it also says something about the history of the request.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The Legislative Assembly wants to improve the administration of the program. However, due to the unique circumstances of its operations, an additional $2.6 million is required to cover the cost of staff training for staff, training for staff, and departmental capacity issues.</seg>
<seg id="1099">It talks about $2.6 million for additional staff and casual employees salaries. At the same time, $2.6 million is mentioned that they now have more efficient radio stations.</seg>
<seg id="1100">Can you clarify that for me, Mr. Chairman?</seg>
<seg id="1101">Mr. Akeeagok, if you would like to clarify your question, it's up to you.</seg>
<seg id="1102">If you look at the breakdown that I mentioned earlier, there's another breakdown. Project 3, $2.6 million, has been added to the Corrections Division.</seg>
<seg id="1103">There are two separate items. It's $2.6 million, but it's separate.</seg>
<seg id="1104">The need for RCMP radio stations, the need for housing, the need for vehicles, and the number of incidents that have occurred in emergency situations. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1105">I also thank Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="1106">If we're talking about $2.6 million, what is the total amount of that? I don't understand it. Can you clarify that for me?</seg>
<seg id="1107">Chairman: Thank you, Ms. Towtongie.</seg>
<seg id="1108">On page 5 of our documents, we're dealing with law enforcement. $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1109">Just below that, there's $2.6 million for corrections. We're not dealing with the total amount of inmates at this time. We're at $2.6 million for law enforcement.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1111">Mr. Towtongie: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for clarifying that.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When I read the Inuktitut version, the English version of the budget is, in the Inuktitut version, it seems to be an estimate, but it seems to be an estimate in Inuktitut.</seg>
<seg id="1113">Can the minister clearly describe what this means in the main estimates or the main estimates for 2017-18?</seg>
<seg id="1114">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The person on my left is talking about the budget of $40 million for law enforcement and $11 million for office buildings that have already been approved.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Right now we're still in 2017-18 and your estimates are expected to go a little over that amount. That's why we're trying to get legislative approval for supplementary appropriations for the Department of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1116">A total of $6.2 million, of which $2.6 million will be allocated to the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="1117">That's what we're requesting from the House. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1118">I was just confused because it seems like they're estimating in Inuktitut, although they're estimates.</seg>
<seg id="1119">I understand my question a little bit now, but I'm done.</seg>
<seg id="1120">We're on Law Enforcement. $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Next is the Total Registries and Court Services, $1 million.</seg>
<seg id="1122">Total Corrections. $2,600,000.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1124">My question is in regard to corrections because every year they go over their budget, if memory serves me correct, they go over their budget and they go over their budget.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Is that correct?</seg>
<seg id="1126">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1127">The member is correct that the majority of the overtime will be paid out as well as casual employees.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1129">If my memory serves me right now, the Corrections Division employs 12 hours a day. Is that correct?</seg>
<seg id="1130">Given that the current facility is full of staff and overtime, has the department considered three to eight hours of work, and would it not be possible to rectify that situation?</seg>
<seg id="1131">Through you, I would like Deputy Minister MacKay to respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The member is correct that they work 12 hours a day.</seg>
<seg id="1133">Those are the types of things that are put in place for two hours, 42 hours a week, and they're going to be overtime after 42 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1134">That was the result of the collective agreement. The overtime decreased from $4 million to $2.49 million now.</seg>
<seg id="1135">As a result, the Corrections Division's deficit was $4.5 million, at a rate of $2.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1136">We're moving forward with the overtime and we will continue to do that.</seg>
<seg id="1137">I would like to remind you to turn your cellphones off and muzzle them.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Medical travel is only overtime and works 42 hours a week.</seg>
<seg id="1140">Do employees work 50 or 60 hours a week?</seg>
<seg id="1141">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1142">It's too detailed. We have to provide it to the House and we will provide it in a written form.</seg>
<seg id="1143">Our deputy minister can't respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1144">We don't have that information.</seg>
<seg id="1145">I don't think I know the level of detail that is required for the operation of the facility.</seg>
<seg id="1146">I would like to ask these questions.</seg>
<seg id="1147">And what kind of training do they receive?</seg>
<seg id="1148">Through you, I would like Deputy Minister MacKay to respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1149">In response to the member's question, I believe the member is referring to the training and training component of the supplementary appropriation under the Corrections Division.</seg>
<seg id="1150">At this time we don't have any training programs.</seg>
<seg id="1151">We have a trainer who is a contractor and it's very expensive to pay for their overtime and they have to be replaced by someone else, so that's why there's an increase in their training costs.</seg>
<seg id="1152">We're also looking at other options to try to better plan the budget so that the staff at the correctional and court services can get better training so that we don't have more contractors.</seg>
<seg id="1153">Ms. Nakashuk.</seg>
<seg id="1154">I was curious to find out when the $2.6 million was announced and the staff training.</seg>
<seg id="1155">What kind of training will be provided to employees and casuals?</seg>
<seg id="1156">Both the Corrections Division and the Court Services Division provide training to casuals and staff.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The casual employees are hired on a contract basis, but they will be given a few weeks of training, but they do receive training for corrections officers, for example, on disputes with employees, on what to do.</seg>
<seg id="1158">Can the minister clarify what programs are currently being offered at the correctional centre or can I ask questions on this issue?</seg>
<seg id="1159">I don't know if they have that level of detail, Mr. Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="1160">Through you, Deputy Minister MacKay, I don't know what they do in the High Arctic. If you will allow him, I would like him to respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1161">Ms. MacKay.</seg>
<seg id="1162">I don't have the figures in front of me, but I can get back to the member on what kind of training is provided to inmates.</seg>
<seg id="1163">Depending on which of those low-risk inmates, including those at the Iqaluit International Airport, there are pre-vocational training courses that will allow them to work in the corrections system and to train them to work in the corrections system when they leave the facility.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Akausisarvik also has programs in place for each prisoner based on their needs, addictions counselling, and anger management, based on what inmates need and what they have been incarcerated for.</seg>
<seg id="1165">Even though they can't leave the correctional system, they do receive training so that they can get out of the correctional system so that they can get a job, but they usually graduate from high school and get a trade program in the corrections system.</seg>
<seg id="1166">In Rankin Inlet, they do provide support to inmates.</seg>
<seg id="1167">There are different programs that we offer.</seg>
<seg id="1168">Nakashuk: I'm done.</seg>

<seg id="1174">Mr. Akeeagok, do you want to make a comment?</seg>
<seg id="1175">Hon. David Akeeagok: That was not a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1176">If it's okay with you, we will move on to another department. The witness is available to respond to questions. I would like to have the witnesses at the witness table before any questions are asked. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1177">I was going to give you an opportunity, but if you would like to take this opportunity, it's okay.</seg>
<seg id="1178">Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the witnesses out.</seg>
<seg id="1179">Do you agree to bring in the witness?</seg>
<seg id="1180">Chairman: Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the other witness out.</seg>
<seg id="1181">For the record, Mr. Akeeagok, please introduce your new witness.</seg>
<seg id="1182">The new witness to my left is the Deputy Minister of the Department of Health, Colleen Inuujaq Stockley.</seg>
<seg id="1183">Operations and Maintenance. Not Previously Authorized. Total Directorate. $5.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Mr. Netser: My mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1185">When it comes to medical travel, that's my next question.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Chairman: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1187">Are there any questions on the directorate?</seg>
<seg id="1188">I don't have too many questions, but when we're talking about elders homes in Nunavut, there are three facilities that will be funded by different elders.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Yesterday when I was asking questions about the feasibility of a preplanning study in Igloolik and Gjoa Haven, they're looking at expansion of their elders facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1190">At that time the minister wasn't aware of the number of beds that were going to be used for the study.</seg>
<seg id="1191">I'm just wondering if we can get an update on where we're at with the increase in the number of elders homes.</seg>
<seg id="1192">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you for that question.</seg>
<seg id="1193">For this year, it's in the preplanning stage. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1194">What is the current status of this preplanning exercise?</seg>
<seg id="1195">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Through you, Mr. Chairman, I would like the Deputy Minister of Health to respond to that because he is more knowledgeable about the capital estimates.</seg>
<seg id="1196">The Department of Health has already planned for last year's capital estimates for 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1197">I would like to ask the minister if this project can proceed with the expansion of the Igloolik facility.</seg>
<seg id="1198">Just to keep that in mind, after the general election, the government was likely going to have a new mandate to look at options for expanding the community of Igloolik.</seg>
<seg id="1199">That's not a long way off, but we're hopeful that we will be able to move forward once we know what the government's mandate is.</seg>
<seg id="1200">Just to conclude, when we talk about the use of government programs, which we identify as flawed in our infrastructure, I would like to emphasize that the department is responsible for the delivery of the government's Elders Care Program.</seg>
<seg id="1201">I look forward to the progress that is being made on the existing infrastructure and identifying opportunities within the territory for new infrastructure that is currently on the waiting list.</seg>
<seg id="1202">That's more of a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1203">I would like to follow up on my colleague's question regarding the operations of elders homes.</seg>
<seg id="1204">I would be interested to find out what the breakdown is of the $900,000.</seg>
<seg id="1205">Can the minister indicate which infrastructure will be allocated to each of these shelters?</seg>
<seg id="1206">The $900,000 is divided into three regions and the total amount is $300,000 each for the three elders.</seg>
<seg id="1207">Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm just wondering if the minister has indicated that these units are under contract with a non-profit Nunavut organization.</seg>
<seg id="1208">How does the Department of Health communicate with the Department of Health if it's going to cost too much money?</seg>
<seg id="1209">The three communities that are operated by the government are not the government and they just recently issued new contracts and that's one of them.</seg>
<seg id="1210">If there is a need to increase or decrease, then the Department of Health and Social Services and the organizations meet with them.</seg>
<seg id="1211">When they have to come up with a solution, they work with each other.</seg>
<seg id="1212">They follow the rules of Canada and Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1213">It states in here that the three new homes that have just opened are in need of two and three higher-level residential care. A number of factors indicate that the majority of these homes are in need of care and aging.</seg>
<seg id="1214">Going back to the funding, do you anticipate that in the next few years, the costs will continue to increase or will there be a cap on the amount of money that we have now?</seg>
<seg id="1215">At the beginning of the contract, there were three cases where the Department of Family Services took care of them.</seg>
<seg id="1216">The Department of Health just took over the contract in April 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1217">What we did notice was that the Department of Health was not the same as the Department of Family Services. We looked at it from a clinical perspective, how many people are being looked after, and who is being looked after.</seg>
<seg id="1218">That was one of the recommendations that were made on the food basket.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When we looked at the contract, the elders facilities were not able to meet the needs.</seg>
<seg id="1220">That's why we had a deficit of $855,000 last year and we're requesting a budget of almost $900,000 right now.</seg>
<seg id="1221">If I'm wrong, please stop me from looking at the funding for mental health and addictions treatment across the territory.</seg>
<seg id="1222">At this time, we have people who have gone through trauma.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Is there any talk of putting money aside for mental health treatment?</seg>
<seg id="1224">We're here. We're just talking about additional funding for operations and maintenance. We're not talking about actual costs.</seg>
<seg id="1225">I don't think it's appropriate for this to be in the House or in any other way.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Do you have any more questions, Ms. Towtongie?</seg>
<seg id="1227">I thank the minister for that clarification.</seg>
<seg id="1228">With respect to the mental health contract for 2017-18, I believe it was $16 million, $16.7 million, and $6.2 million, what is the status of that contract?</seg>
<seg id="1229">That's my final question. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1230">Mr. Chairman, we're at $5.9 million and that's part of the $43.1 million that the member is asking about.</seg>
<seg id="1231">The details of the $16 million and $10 million are there.</seg>
<seg id="1232">I would like to ask Deputy Minister Stockley to explain the details of the additional $10 million, if you can allow him to respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1233">It's very good to hear that Nunavummiut are asking for help and that's when you call your health centre and ask questions online.</seg>
<seg id="1234">The number of people seeking help is increasing and that's why there's an increase in the number of people going to the treatment centre.</seg>
<seg id="1235">I know they have mental health issues and addictions.</seg>
<seg id="1236">There are other costs that are outside the Department of Health. The Department of Family Services is responsible for the Department of Justice. There are a number of court appointments that go through the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Before we proceed to the directorate, we will take a five-minute break.</seg>
<seg id="1238">&gt; &gt; Committee recessed at 18: 03 and resumed at 18: 10</seg>
<seg id="1239">I would like to call the committee meeting back to order.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Total Department. $43,100,000.</seg>
<seg id="1241">Within the territory's long-term care for elders, you have identified the current level of dementia care.</seg>
<seg id="1242">I think that's going to increase because we don't have a facility for dementia screening in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1243">That's what I'm interested in.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Are they looking at the possibility of having a dementia screening facility in Nunavut?</seg>
<seg id="1245">That's one of the things that are happening right now, but it's not at the top level.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Those are the types of things that they're working on and they're larger than they are right now.</seg>
<seg id="1247">At the same time, outside of the territory, the last paragraph speaks to the out-of-territory hospital budget for the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="1248">I was kind of surprised to learn that the minister's letter, broken down by department, did not include anything within the budget to cover the over-expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Is the department going to be spending all of its money in this area?</seg>
<seg id="1250">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On page 6, the first one is $5.9 million that is not previously authorized for out-of-territory long-term care for elders within the Department of Health.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The Department of Health is requesting $5.9 million for the provision of care for elders. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1252">My question was more related to the Department of Health and Social Services deficit from other sources of funding.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Perhaps through you, if I make a mistake, Deputy Minister Stockley can correct me.</seg>
<seg id="1254">However, with respect to what items are not being used, I believe that was the question that I can respond to at this time with respect to the over-expenditures that have been incurred by the Department of Health and Social Services.</seg>
<seg id="1255">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you for that clarification.</seg>
<seg id="1256">The money that is not spent within the department, then we transfer the money that is not spent within the department.</seg>
<seg id="1257">Right now we're trying to balance the budget. The surplus for the Department of Health is $49 million.</seg>
<seg id="1258">The letter that I just sent today will be translated today in English. It was sent on Friday and there is no substantiation sheet for the over-expenditures and over-expenditures. If you look at which ones are being planned.</seg>
<seg id="1259">That's a small amount and looking at the deficit that we're requesting through the supplementary appropriation. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1260">I appreciate that you mentioned the Schedule, but what I was trying to get at was in the letter that I received from the minister on page 4. It's broken down into different programs and funding.</seg>
<seg id="1261">Under the Department of Family Services, do they have any surplus funds that they can use?</seg>
<seg id="1262">Why is it that the Department of Health has not done that?</seg>
<seg id="1263">The Department of Health and Social Services did not have any indication of any surplus.</seg>
<seg id="1264">On page 5, it indicates that the Department of Health requires an additional $49 million. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1265">The Department of Health does not provide a breakdown of its programs.</seg>
<seg id="1266">I know the Department of Health has a surplus of over $1 million over the last few years.</seg>
<seg id="1267">Can the minister provide us with a breakdown of all of the Department of Health's programs that are surplus when it comes to over-expenditures?</seg>
<seg id="1268">You're asking for a lot of detailed information that may not be available at this time.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Minister Akoak.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Mr. Akeeagok, please proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1271">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for recognizing me.</seg>
<seg id="1272">We don't have that level of detail in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="1273">We will be able to table it at a later date. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1274">I'll move on to the elders centre, elders centre operations.</seg>
<seg id="1275">In the second bullet, it indicates that the current elders facilities are operated under a contract with a non-profit Nunavut organization.</seg>
<seg id="1276">I would just like to say that this is a very good program that is available to all Nunavummiut organizations.</seg>
<seg id="1277">I'm hoping that the contract will be awarded to as many people as possible.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Moving on to the next bullet on the next page, under the 24-hour care program, it states that the Department of Health provides 24-hour care, seven days a week, under the Department of Health's Extended Health Benefits Policy.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The elders have to be governed by this legislation, which is the lowest set of rules.</seg>
<seg id="1280">I would like to ask the Department of Health if they have reached the minimum standards for elders facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1281">I responded to that earlier.</seg>
<seg id="1282">There has been a new contract with the Department of Health and Social Services. This increase is due to the Department of Health's terms and conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1283">If there is a non-compliance issue, the interpreters and the Department of Health meet with each other to make sure that they're following the proper procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1284">Mr. Lightstone.</seg>
<seg id="1285">Can you clarify if these elders facilities have reached the minimum level of care that they need?</seg>
<seg id="1286">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1287">As it is a new contract, we have increased it by $900,000 to $5.9 million.</seg>
<seg id="1288">It has been explained to the three organizations that they're going to try to keep up with the level of care that they're supposed to provide, but they're not really up to the level of care that they need for elders.</seg>
<seg id="1289">As the minister indicated, they're trying to catch up on it. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Mr. Netser: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1291">I'm getting a bit quiet now.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In regard to medical travel, they're asking for $50 million and I have brought this up many times in the House about medical travel patients who don't have an appointment, especially in my constituency, who have to go to Winnipeg, and then they find out that they don't have an appointment.</seg>
<seg id="1293">Does the Department of Health have a list of patients who were sent out of Winnipeg before they arrived and are not informed of their appointments, and does the Department of Health have a list of what the costs were for those patients who were denied an appointment, including travel, accommodation, and accommodation costs? Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1294">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1295">The Minister of Health has committed to reviewing all medical travel clients, including those who have not been seen or who have changed their appointments.</seg>
<seg id="1296">That's one of the things that the government is looking at seriously. We're going to be looking at ways to find out who is doing the wrong thing.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Our MLAs have been asking questions about it and they have seen it. We would like to include that in our review.</seg>
<seg id="1298">I would like to thank the member for raising that issue and we can look into it together.</seg>
<seg id="1299">That will be part of the review and there are patients who don't have an appointment. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1300">Mr. Netser: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I look forward to the review report.</seg>
<seg id="1301">At this time, there was $5.5 million for tuberculosis in Qikiqtarjuaq and I believe it was on February 26 that the federal government made a significant amount of money for Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami. I believe it was $82 million and $80 million was set aside for tuberculosis research.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Has the government or the Department of Health made a proposal or has ITK been able to help us out with the funding that was given to us? Has the government discussed this issue with the federal government to see if they can take part in the funding for tuberculosis?</seg>
<seg id="1303">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1304">That's a very good question.</seg>
<seg id="1305">At this time the federal government has announced that the 2018-19 budget will be included in the funding for Inuit specific initiatives related to tuberculosis, yet it states that ITK will be allocated funding over the next five years to engage Inuit Nunangat.</seg>
<seg id="1306">At this time, it states that the working group is a committee comprised of representatives from Inuit Nunangat and the Department of Health is a member of that committee.</seg>
<seg id="1307">As the Minister of Finance, I haven't seen the details yet.</seg>
<seg id="1308">I look forward to seeing the details. If Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami is doing a good job and they understand us, the Department of Health and Social Services is working very hard.</seg>
<seg id="1309">That's how it is.</seg>
<seg id="1310">We will be hearing more about the details and we will be kept informed by the ministers. That's a very good question.</seg>
<seg id="1311">I would like to ask again about the issue of medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="1312">It states here that medical travel is out of control, such as interest rates and contract increases.</seg>
<seg id="1313">Does the Department of Health understand why the cost of living is increasing?</seg>
<seg id="1314">5.6 per cent is expected to increase each year, so what accounts for the increase in costs?</seg>
<seg id="1315">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Through you, I would like my Deputy Minister, Mr. Stockley, to respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1317">Medical travel and emergency medical travel are on the rise each year.</seg>
<seg id="1318">There are more and more people going on medical travel as well, so that's a good thing that they're getting diagnosed very quickly and then they're sent out.</seg>
<seg id="1319">Tuberculosis is one of the highest rates in Canada and it's one of the lowest vaccination rates in Canada. That's one of the reasons why it's so hot.</seg>
<seg id="1320">I'll use an example.</seg>
<seg id="1321">About 60 medevacs were required to go to the health centre in December.</seg>
<seg id="1322">The number of medevacs is increasing every week, but at this time of the year in the spring, there are people who suffer from lung and respiratory problems.</seg>
<seg id="1323">The combined costs of medical travel and emergency medical travel have all increased.</seg>
<seg id="1324">Mr. Chairman, I'm not going to get into the details, but I'm just trying to find out what the reasons are for the increase.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Is the health of our population in Nunavut going to be a good thing?</seg>
<seg id="1326">Can I get a little bit of an explanation or is my question too broad, are we catching up or are we getting away with the number of sick people?</seg>
<seg id="1327">I would like Deputy Minister Stockley to respond to that.</seg>
<seg id="1328">It's unfortunate that the national health care system in Nunavut has the highest proportion of people living in overcrowded homes. It's a serious health issue and we have made progress, but we're hopeful that we will be able to alleviate the housing shortage in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1329">We have also added an addition to the marshalling room at the Qikiqtani General Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="1330">We try to reduce the amount of medical travel.</seg>
<seg id="1331">We're moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="1332">The other regions, such as telehealth, will now be used in the three regions.</seg>
<seg id="1333">You will hear more and more about the proposed budget.</seg>
<seg id="1334">I thank the minister for that response.</seg>
<seg id="1335">I look forward to the review of the main estimates for this department.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Based on the mental health over-expenditures of $10.5 million, the other one heard that it's ongoing, but it's very important.</seg>
<seg id="1337">When I look at the substantiation sheet, it doesn't say what the reason is for the increase of $10.5 million.</seg>
<seg id="1338">What is the reason for the increase in mental health?</seg>
<seg id="1339">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Both assessment and mental health.</seg>
<seg id="1340">During the Fourth Legislative Assembly, the issue of suicide was raised as an urgent matter for the government to take action.</seg>
<seg id="1341">We're going to continue to promote that. We don't have the training to make sure that the diagnoses are done by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1342">It's going to change our population and I encourage all members to continue to table this information in the Legislative Assembly to the public.</seg>
<seg id="1343">My last question is in regard to mental health and addictions, how many services do we provide to people who are in care outside of the territory for mental health?</seg>
<seg id="1344">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 64.</seg>
<seg id="1345">How is 64 more, or less, how does that change in the past?</seg>
<seg id="1346">We don't have that level of detail in front of us, but it's increasing and if the member wants that information, we will be able to provide it to him, perhaps during the main estimates process.</seg>
<seg id="1347">Moving on to another topic, Qikiqtarjuaq's tuberculosis research project, which I'm sure all of us agree is very encouraging to hear.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Will the equipment and equipment remain in the hands of the Department of Health? Will it be used to do inspections in other communities or is it too small and will the equipment remain in the community?</seg>
<seg id="1349">Through you, I'll have Deputy Minister Stockley respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Will the property assessments be covered under the capital estimates?</seg>
<seg id="1351">I'm lost.</seg>
<seg id="1352">It's under the capital estimates. Can you clarify that for me?</seg>
<seg id="1353">Through you, I would like Deputy Minister Stockley to respond to that question.</seg>
<seg id="1354">The bulk of the assets came from the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="1355">The funding that we received from the federal government, such as washrooms, towels, bandages, beds, and all the other things that the Department of Health does is go through the normal process.</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Main: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1357">My last question, and I'm sure it's my last one.</seg>
<seg id="1358">In regard to the Department of Health and Social Services recruitment and retention of agency nurses, the department has been very successful in reducing the number of agency nurses.</seg>
<seg id="1359">I would like to ask, for the record, what changes have been made to the amount of money that has been spent in previous years?</seg>
<seg id="1360">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Instead of using agency nurses, we have been able to recruit more nurses from Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1362">From last year to today, we have been using more indeterminate nurses.</seg>
<seg id="1363">That's my final question.</seg>
<seg id="1364">If I could get the breakdown of the $8.6 million, I would appreciate it.</seg>
<seg id="1365">Broken down, for the 2017-18 fiscal year, indeterminate employees were short of $52.5 million, casual employees budgets exceeded $45.3 million in overtime, waiting lists were $15.7 million, and agency nurses exceeded $0.1 million, a total of more than $8.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1366">I just have one question to add to the breakdown of what you're talking about, but I'm going to add to Mr. Main's question.</seg>
<seg id="1367">I'm not going to get into the details.</seg>
<seg id="1368">If there is a nurse in Sanikiluaq who is in a state of emergency at night, when there is a medical evacuation, it has to be overtime. I know the staff have to be overtime.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. All the nurses are over budget.</seg>
<seg id="1370">I know the minister has responded today to what the department is doing to recruit nurses.</seg>
<seg id="1371">I'll leave that alone for now.</seg>
<seg id="1372">I would just like to say that when we look at the budgets of the Department of Health, the staff, the doctors, the contracts for mental health, medical travel, and medical travel, it's always shown in the supplementary appropriations that are put forward every year.</seg>
<seg id="1373">The figure for mental health and addictions is a significant change from last year's $6.8 million to $7.8 million increase last year.</seg>
<seg id="1374">In my earlier statement about the budget process, the Minister of Finance indicated that there haven't been any changes at this time, but I believe that there needs to be real changes because we're always going back and forth and getting approval for supplementary appropriations.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Let's make sure that you're aware that you're going to have to go over budget and that the main estimates are put in place so that you don't have to come up with the amount that you need to spend and not just add to the budget.</seg>
<seg id="1376">That's just a comment, but I would like to hear from the minister on that comment.</seg>
<seg id="1377">That's exactly what I'm thinking. That's one of the things that we're looking at seriously. The Fifth Assembly has been considering these issues and we've had discussions with some departments, the Department of Health and Social Services, and the Department of Justice, and they're always coming back for supplementary appropriations.</seg>
<seg id="1378">I'm very pleased to be here today to discuss this in the main estimates and I'm working very closely with my cabinet colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="1379">I'm responding to some of the health issues. Since I have been the minister, the Department of Health has always been referred to as the Department of Health. It's a very sensitive department.</seg>
<seg id="1380">That's one of the things that we really need to do to make sure that the main estimates are accurate and correct, and it's clear that we need to restructure them and not change the budget process. We need to recognize that we need to move forward on these issues.</seg>
<seg id="1381">We will have to go through the legislative assembly to make those changes.</seg>
<seg id="1382">One of our colleagues in the Regular Members Caucus made a very perceptive statement.</seg>
<seg id="1383">I also believe that we have to work very closely together as MLAs because we really need it.</seg>
<seg id="1384">For 2017-18 we're going over budget and some of the challenges that we're facing, I would like to work very closely with the Premier and our elected officials. Although we're not supposed to be here, if we know how much money the departments have spent, we shouldn't be coming back to the House because we should know what our budget is.</seg>
<seg id="1385">I just wanted to make that comment and I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to make that comment.</seg>
<seg id="1386">Chairman: Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1387">I appreciate the minister recognizing that there needs to be an amendment.</seg>
<seg id="1388">I just wanted to reiterate, as he stated, that the Department of Justice is always coming to the witness table. The overtime for nurses and other MLAs is going back and forth. The additional funding for overtime is something that I have talked about and I will be bringing it up over the next three and a half years.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Again, I think it's important to recognize that the Minister of Human Resources is responsible for ensuring that the government is able to fulfill its mandate.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If we're going to move forward with the development of our existing positions within our organization, and if we're going to fill those positions where there are weaknesses, Mr. Main talked about how difficult it is to fill positions within the government that are tired and sick of some of our employees, then we have to take a step back and look at how we can move forward with our government to fill those positions where our strengths and weaknesses are, and where we're not just trying to catch up.</seg>
<seg id="1391">With respect to overtime, I would like to find out more and move forward on where the priorities are and what initiatives we're going to be looking forward to.</seg>
<seg id="1392">It's just a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Mr. Mikkungwak, did you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1394">Mr. Mikkungwak: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1395">I just have one question. With respect to mental health and addictions contracts, in the fourth bullet, it states that the Department of Justice is responsible for paying for medical travel. Is that included in the $10.5 million?</seg>
<seg id="1396">I'll try to make it short. Yes, they are part of it.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Mr. Lightstone, do you have any more questions?</seg>
<seg id="1398">My final question is in regard to Mr. Main and Mr. Hickes questions.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last part of that is the health centre staff deficit of $8.6 million. Just to clarify, you're talking about $143 million to $151 million to $8.6 million.</seg>
<seg id="1400">Is that for all the compensation and benefits for the department?</seg>
<seg id="1401">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yes, those are compensation and benefits.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Mr. Lightstone: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1403">Is the $151 million 100 per cent accurate?</seg>
<seg id="1404">That's a $25 million increase in salaries.</seg>
<seg id="1405">I don't think any money has ever been at 100 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="1406">As I stated earlier, we're requesting $8.6 million in our estimates for compensation and benefits. I believe that's the closest we can get.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It's not 100 per cent accurate in our financial statements. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1408">It's a long time coming and there's a lot of documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1409">Moving on to the minister's opening comments on page 4, there is $63.8 million for medical travel starting in 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1410">I'm just wondering why the money was allocated in the 2016-17 fiscal year.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I don't have the information in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="1412">If you want, I can get it. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1413">Mr. Lightstone, we're trying to deal with 2016-17, not 2017-18.</seg>
<seg id="1414">I'll keep in mind that I'll leave it at that for 2016-17.</seg>
<seg id="1415">I was asking about the medical travel budget last year. I would like to know what the department's budget will be for 2018-19.</seg>
<seg id="1416">For 2017-18 he doesn't expect it to be next year. Mr. Akeeagok may not have the figures in front of him, but Minister Akeeagok.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I believe it's too early in May for the main estimates for 2018-19.</seg>
<seg id="1418">We have a vote on the interim appropriation for 2017-18. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1419">I would like to reiterate that there are some issues within our budget framework that the minister has provided. There are a lot of different issues with the actual expenditures that have been done every year, but I would expect that it will be in place in the next fiscal year, so I will be making a formal request for the Department of Health's O &amp; M budget.</seg>
<seg id="1420">I don't want to see the supplementary appropriation every year in the House.</seg>
<seg id="1421">I would like to get into the details of the department's operations and maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="1422">That's more of a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Chairman: Mr. Qirngnuq, do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1424">Mr. Qirngnuq: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>
<seg id="1425">I would like to ask a question in regard to medical travel. For clarity in English, the third bullet for medical travel for April has increased from last year. Can the minister clarify what the status of this issue is?</seg>
<seg id="1426">The member is referring to the fact that medical travel has been increased by the number of people who have been sick and the number of pregnant women who have been pregnant has increased.</seg>
<seg id="1427">However, the medical travel costs are increasing.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Mr. Mikkungwak, do you have a question?</seg>
<seg id="1429">I'm sorry, I thought you had your hand up.</seg>
<seg id="1430">We're on Health. Operations and Maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="1431">We're done with $43,100,000. If you go to the bottom of the page, the total department is $49 million.</seg>

<seg id="1442">Minister Akeeagok, do you have any closing comments?</seg>
<seg id="1443">Hon. David Akeeagok: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the questions that were asked during the budget process for the upcoming fiscal year and the hard work that our staff put into putting together the best estimates that are available to us.</seg>
<seg id="1444">With that, we will be able to make some changes to the budget.</seg>
<seg id="1445">Before we go to the next bill, I would like to ask the minister to release the bill.</seg>
<seg id="1446">I also thank the member for his good work and he will now be able to stand up.</seg>
<seg id="1447">Chairman: Thank you. Did you want another witness in?</seg>
<seg id="1448">Sergeant-at-Arms, please escort the witness out.</seg>
<seg id="1449">We will proceed to Bill 4.</seg>

<seg id="1459">Is the Department of Community and Government Services unable to find its own capital budget?</seg>
<seg id="1460">We have to make sure that the financial statements are made in order to make sure that they are transparent to the public.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There wouldn't be any money until the interest rate has been paid out. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</seg>

<seg id="1517">Tomorrow is June 20 and we expect that it will be a good day and it will be a good day.</seg>
<seg id="1518">As such, I hereby prorogue the First Session of the Fifth Legislative Assembly and summon all members to meet again tomorrow at 1: 30 p.m. for the opening of the Second Session.</seg>
<seg id="1519">Speaker: Before we go to Item 22, I have a statement to make.</seg>
<seg id="1520">As the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly and Chair of the Order of Nunavut Advisory Council, I am very proud to take this opportunity to announce this year's recipients of the Order of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1521">On January 1, 2010, the Order of Nunavut Act came into force.</seg>
<seg id="1522">The intent of the bill is to recognize individuals who have made outstanding contributions to Nunavut and our communities.</seg>
<seg id="1523">The Order of Nunavut is the highest honour of all recipients, medals or medals conferred by the Government of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1524">To date, there have been 15 recipients of the Order of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1525">They have been recognized for their hard work and dedication to a wide range of areas, including public service announcements, education, language promotion, various leadership roles, and economic development.</seg>
<seg id="1526">I am very proud to announce two recipients of this year's recipients of the Order of Nunavut, Ms. Vardy Brewster and Mr. Ludy Pudluk.</seg>
<seg id="1527">I am very pleased that we are able to join Pudluk in the House today.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Welcome, Mr. Pudluk.</seg>
<seg id="1529">As you and my colleagues are aware, Vardy Brewster is no stranger to being an interpreter for many years.</seg>
<seg id="1530">In 2016 she was recognized for her hard work and dedication in her work with the Inuit Uqausinginnik Taiguusiliuqtiit to receive a language award.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Mr. Pudluk served as a member of the legislative assembly of the Northwest Territories from 1975 to 1995.</seg>
<seg id="1532">During his many years of service, Mr. Pudluk represented the High Arctic communities and played a key role in the creation of Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="1533">I am pleased to announce that we will be working on the investiture ceremony for Ms. Brewster and Mr. Pudluk during the spring 2018 sitting of the Legislative Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="1534">The investiture ceremony will be held here in the Legislative Assembly and will be broadcast across the territory on television.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Congratulations to Commissioner Nellie Kusugak, who will be the recipient of the Order of Nunavut, and I look forward to inviting all members of the Legislative Assembly to join me on this exciting day.</seg>

<seg id="6">"The spiritual leader of Evangelical Christianity is better known for its actions, climate change, and its economy that the world will eradicate from the Crusaders who do not believe in Christianity came to Iqaluit's church on Aug. 27."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Ratti How-Brown, a South Africa resident who moved to the United States, told attendees in the Tampa Bay area last year that the world's poorest people were honouring the doctor and drinking the blood of the individual."</seg>
<seg id="8">It took more than an hour at the Iqaluit church to reach more than 100 people.</seg>
<seg id="9">But their information is not for the public.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The whole of the Arctic right now is tied to what is happening tonight.</seg>
<seg id="11">"If you want the light (in the air), please stand here (in the church's table), or you can get out."</seg>
<seg id="12">"It's up to you," How-Brown said after two and a half hours of hard work. "</seg>
<seg id="13">About 50 people attended the event.</seg>
<seg id="14">"I didn't fly thousands of miles to play.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I didn't come here to enjoy it, and I didn't come here to ask for consent from you... please remember: when Jesus was alive and died, he asked me to leave the room with people." "</seg>
<seg id="16">"The turnout was higher among Inuit and infants, youth and elders."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Within the church's Christian Bowler church near Iqaluit's Ruth Nov., children marched between chairs."</seg>
<seg id="18">"On the outside, the church and the Massachusetts face each other on both sides of the parking lot, while they face each other in the face of Ted Doug Lake."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Huge Brown's teachings were part of an organized event organized by the Bill Franklin Evangelical Association's Arctic Hope Project, based in Ottawa."</seg>
<seg id="20">The organization did not respond to Nunatsiaq News during its initial hearing on the issue.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The Evangelical experience, which is 119 for 300 people to attend a community event, began after an hour of events."</seg>
<seg id="22">"First of all, the Iqaluit church choir started the evening in Iqaluit after Evangelical Reverend Louie Arreak, who helped create the Christian Bowler church."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Erik Gonzalez, a fellow priest at the Howard Brown Ribbon Church in Indonesia, spoke for 40 minutes about the president."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Louie Arreak, Iqaluit's Evangelical and singer, sang a song by Ernie How-Brown before he spoke."</seg>
<seg id="25">(Photo courtesy of Ribbard Minister International)</seg>
<seg id="26">"God loves the people who give him so much"</seg>
<seg id="27">Ryan asks attendees to submit their email address to the registries and to follow the Hub Brownback Instagram.</seg>
<seg id="28">He handed out the purchase permits for the How-Brown Okpik sale.</seg>
<seg id="29">"And he released How-Brown's book, the Klengenberg Plan, which he said refers to the experiences of troubled economies over the past 200 years."</seg>
<seg id="30">"" This refers to a dislike of Christ, which is exactly what he is referring to, "Ryan said."</seg>
<seg id="31">Ryan is now filming an 18-foot documentary about the evangelical nature of the past.</seg>
<seg id="32">"At the end of the video, How-Brown prayed that those who donate money to the church would receive God's help for the soul of the church's protection."</seg>
<seg id="33">"" God loves a generous man, "How-Brown said in his video."</seg>
<seg id="34">Gonna honour her parents at the end of the video.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" One is a closet and one is a collection and we are together to celebrate the fruits, so if you put a cloth in there, it goes to your church's account. "</seg>
<seg id="36">That's amazing. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"He then handed out the bags to be installed and told these people that they can do what they can" to get the best gift for the soul, "either financially, or financially for RMI Canada, using a credit card or a cell phone."</seg>
<seg id="38">"" I keep telling people, don't let the biggest wage go to Sony or the new phone... let them use the church for promotion and spiritual reconciliation. "</seg>
<seg id="39">Is that correct? "</seg>
<seg id="40">Many people filled out and picked up the bag and poured it into a blue plastic bag.</seg>
<seg id="41">Some people just look at other people and hold the bag.</seg>
<seg id="42">One woman is an Inuk who has no milk and put it in her food basket.</seg>
<seg id="43">This is to help poor countries in many ways: more than half of Nunavut's population is on income assistance, despite food security and housing shortages.</seg>
<seg id="44">"How-Brown did not respond to an interview with Nunatsiaq News, so it's hard to know how much he made."</seg>
<seg id="45">Their income is not kept secret by anyone but their website says it trains 158 communities.</seg>
<seg id="46">It also says that people who want to participate in the airline subsidy program can get an income tax deduction.</seg>
<seg id="47">Ryan told attendees to put their hands up and hold their donations to the Ribbon Church.</seg>
<seg id="48">"" Father, we thank you for this gift, and we thank you for being the representative of your soul, let's go to our bank account, "Ryan said."</seg>
<seg id="49">Three to one Wood Cree was filled with food.</seg>
<seg id="50">Ratti Howard Brown tells the woman that they would touch her hand above her.</seg>
<seg id="51">Rev. Patterk Netser calls him a friend</seg>
<seg id="52">"The Reverend Evangelical is already based in Nunavut, with escorts in most communities."</seg>
<seg id="53">"The round-table meetings are held each year and, between the 21st century, they have been increasing each year."</seg>
<seg id="54">"One of the participants in these conferences, Roger Armstrong, told Nunatsiaq News in 2004 that these conferences are a big voice for people whose lives have been damaged by violence and abuse."</seg>
<seg id="55">But How-Brown's vision of spending more and more drama may be new to Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="56">"Patterk Netser, a long-time defender of Christianity and now Nunavut's minister of housing and Nunavut Arctic College, has called Huw-Brown what he calls" Askimo's friend "and has told him that climate change is completely untrue."</seg>
<seg id="57">"Netser didn't want to be interviewed by Nunatsiaq News but he said," Rynie is my friend and we talk to each other. ""</seg>
<seg id="58">"When asked to respond to How-Brown on numerous occasions in the face of media controversy, I have also suggested that the U.S. Supreme Court should be shot in the face of the U.S. Constitution as unacceptable, Netser said," I don't care about the history of the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="59">My main concern is for my people and Nunavummiut. "</seg>

<seg id="62">"After an hour of action, How-Brown - a dreamer - turned to the priest's table."</seg>
<seg id="63">"" Tonight is a light on the sea ice, "the priest said of more than 100 people, most of whom are Inuit, at different ages."</seg>
<seg id="64">"" If you don't want the light, just run to the door while you can. ""</seg>
<seg id="65">"In an hour, How-Brown's voice becomes loud and quiet."</seg>
<seg id="66">He stops talking about what is going to happen and he calls for action, and he makes funny statements.</seg>
<seg id="67">"" I know I don't feel like I'm from Africa, so my parents kept me in the door, never let me out, "she said of the laughter."</seg>
<seg id="68">"Moses was the first person in the office (Dallas).</seg>
<seg id="69">The first one broke down and he had to go back and pick up another one.</seg>
<seg id="70">And Adamie and Evi were the first ones in the snow sculpin. "</seg>
<seg id="71">"How-Brown became well known, for the most part, for mourning meetings where attendees would laugh at each other."</seg>
<seg id="72">"His granddaughter was admitted to an insurrection at the age of two, laughing for 12 minutes," Huff-Brown said. "</seg>
<seg id="73">How-Brown has complained many times about other Evangelicals who believe in the world.</seg>
<seg id="74">Huge Brown has responded to those who say he's not satisfied with the brethren and that he's going to put them in a dangerous situation.</seg>
<seg id="75">"Arreak, a Iqaluit Evangelical and a singer who helped out with this situation, laughed at members of the family when he was ordained."</seg>
<seg id="76">"" This is not a funeral, why are people so sad? ""</seg>
<seg id="77">How-Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="78">Arreak is laughing.</seg>
<seg id="79">"We are serving Jesus and he is alive."</seg>
<seg id="80">Arreak is laughing out loud.</seg>
<seg id="81">"" I like this priest, "said Arreak, whose laughter is getting louder."</seg>
<seg id="82">How-Brown is laughing while others are laughing a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="83">"I'm very happy.</seg>
<seg id="84">"Be happy to get in the water, out of the water forever." "</seg>
<seg id="85">Arreak laughed at him when he fell off the roof of the house.</seg>
<seg id="86">"This is real.</seg>
<seg id="87">No one will be arrested this evening. "</seg>
<seg id="88">"Arreak, who told Nunatsiaq News that he didn't want to speak to the media, laughed again."</seg>
<seg id="89">"How-Brown also spoke in plain language, saying the language was understood in the Indigenous language of the Barbara New Guardian diocese."</seg>
<seg id="90">Mam-Gar-R-P-B-T.</seg>
<seg id="91">"Ranne-Pan-Gotta," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="92">Ratti How-Brown is inviting guests to the church's table to take the light out of the building.</seg>
<seg id="93">Some people are not laughing</seg>
<seg id="94">But many of How-Brown's teachings are not funny or funny.</seg>
<seg id="95">There were corpses of people who had gone out before he was ordained.</seg>
<seg id="96">"Without touching the audience, How-Brown complained to two people before they left."</seg>
<seg id="97">"Where do you go to Porter?</seg>
<seg id="98">Is that correct?</seg>
<seg id="99">Ha!</seg>
<seg id="100">Are you leaving? "</seg>
<seg id="101">How-Brown says one man has no voice when he leaves the church.</seg>
<seg id="102">"" After they come in, they take pictures and get out on the phone? "</seg>
<seg id="103">Are you a reporter for the daily news here? "</seg>
<seg id="104">The audience is laughing.</seg>
<seg id="105">"" I don't know what it would be like to go and take it and get it back... find out if it's money and why it's taking pictures and why it's going out, "she said to one of her staff."</seg>
<seg id="106">"After he asked the diocese to take over the role of the diocese, How-Brown suddenly grabbed the two women in the chair because he didn't like their vision."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Have you been alive again?</seg>
<seg id="108">"What are you, Jehova Bychok?" "</seg>
<seg id="109">The audience is laughing.</seg>
<seg id="110">"I have never seen people sitting across the border that can't change.</seg>
<seg id="111">"So you can jump through the hoops with someone else, or maybe you're better off than someone else." "</seg>
<seg id="112">The two women stood up and went out.</seg>
<seg id="113">"I'm just trying to ask.</seg>
<seg id="114">"I do that, it's my job."</seg>
<seg id="115">I know what the individual's physical condition is.</seg>
<seg id="116">You don't always get anything for me.</seg>
<seg id="117">It's not a laughing matter.</seg>
<seg id="118">The whole of the Arctic right now is tied to what is happening tonight. "</seg>
<seg id="119">The event staff are telling attendees not to take pictures and not to record them.</seg>
<seg id="120">"However, they took pictures of the whole event."</seg>
<seg id="121">Even for people who run to tears when How-Brown touches them and they take pictures close to them.</seg>
<seg id="122">"The pictures from the Ribbon Church's website show a number of people who attended the event at a time when they were no longer alive - their faces are visible, not frozen, their mouths are closed, or they are just on the floor."</seg>
<seg id="123">A woman who touched her hand on the floor is crying under the thin layer of the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="124">"In front of them, Howard Brown and his staff are going to have an impact on Inuit couples."</seg>
<seg id="125">This event was intended for St. Jude's Cathedral</seg>
<seg id="126">"This event was originally intended to be held at St. Jude's Anglican Cathedral in Iqaluit, but it was changed."</seg>
<seg id="127">"This change was made by the guests of How-Brown, the secretary of the St. Jude's Council said."</seg>
<seg id="128">"David Parsons, the Anglican bishop of the Arctic, said he didn't know that How-Brown would be ordained in St. Jude's Cathedral."</seg>
<seg id="129">"If he had known, he said he would have stopped it because How-Brown was too much."</seg>
<seg id="130">"As a result, the community's Anglican diocese did not meet its requirements for consent to the Bishop's event, Parsons said."</seg>
<seg id="131">"The Anglican Church's role is to show respect, and to deal with other faiths, Parsons said."</seg>
<seg id="132">"" But there is good faith in each other, and there is no way to deal with issues that would not fit the religion and the people who go to church there. ""</seg>
<seg id="133">How-Brown's mandate calls for a different approach.</seg>
<seg id="134">"I'm not here to fight for their religious beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="135">"If Christianity were to do something in the Arctic, it would have been done in the Arctic," she said to attendees. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"Without a good turnout, Canada is quietly launching a new Arctic policy document"</seg>
<seg id="2">Liberals say the new policy represents a "huge change in direction"</seg>
<seg id="3">"A lot of Rawls grow in Bathurst Inlet, Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="4">"On the eve of the federal election announcement, the Liberal government released a long-awaited northern policy framework."</seg>
<seg id="5">(File photo)</seg>
<seg id="6">By Jim Bell</seg>
<seg id="7">"A day before the national election campaign began, the Liberal government, with little or no presence, launched a long-awaited northern and northern policy framework on September 10."</seg>
<seg id="8">"This letter, which marks the first step in the continuation of the event, will replace Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper's 2009 Arctic Strategy and Harper's government's 2010 statement on Canada's Arctic foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is intended to guide federal policy in the Arctic up to 2030 - but there is no implementation plan or political strategy for future action.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Those are the things that will be done in the second phase, the strategy said."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Despite all this, the initiative by Carolyn Bennett, the minister of Crown-Indigenous Affairs and Northern Development, said the policy document represents" a significant change in the direction of the federal government. ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The introduction of this policy is lagging behind what was expected.</seg>
<seg id="13">"This winter, Bennett said the policy will be released in June."</seg>
<seg id="14">CBC reported earlier this month that a news conference in Yellowknife in August was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="15">"In the Liberal Party there are eight" targets, "which include targets, and 10" principles. ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"They discuss a wide range of policy issues, including community and regional economic development, infrastructure, Indigenous rights, environmental protection, national security and foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="17">"When Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, on December 20, 2016, announced that his government wants to develop new policies, he promised" a cooperative approach "to Arctic governments and Indigenous organizations."</seg>
<seg id="18">"As a result, more than 25 Indigenous organizations, including the Government of Nunavut, the Northwest Territories, Yukon, Manitoba, Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador, became involved in the reconciliation process."</seg>
<seg id="19">"" In partnership with Canada's Arctic and Arctic policy framework, our partners helped us understand and raise awareness of the unique rights and opportunities of different regions, responsibilities and land rights across the Arctic, "Bennett said in a release."</seg>
<seg id="20">"And some of the partners wrote their actions, which are published in a separate policy document."</seg>
<seg id="21">Some comments don't mention federal policy</seg>
<seg id="22">"For example, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the Government of Nunavut, the Government of the Northwest Territories and the three territorial governments have shared their own personal language."</seg>
<seg id="23">But there is something going on.</seg>
<seg id="24">These documents submitted to the tribunal may not represent federal policy.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is a sign that the federal government may run into roadblocks that would be accepted by more than 31 parties.</seg>
<seg id="26">"" While the terms of reference are part of the process, they are not clear on the views of the federal government or other partners, "the transition document said."</seg>
<seg id="27">The letter also states that the approval process was difficult.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" The ideas, goals and objectives and objectives of the meeting reflect a wide range of ideas and ideas. "</seg>
<seg id="29">This means that there are periodic agreements with the federal government and Indigenous parties to get approval. "</seg>
<seg id="30">You can find a link to the Arctic policy that I'm showing here.</seg>
<seg id="31">8 goals</seg>
<seg id="32">"These are the eight goals of the strategy, which show the federal government's commitment."</seg>
<seg id="33">"â¢ a strong, sustainable, diversified and sustainable community and regional economy."</seg>
<seg id="34">â¢ Make Canada's Arctic and Arctic Indigenous peoples sustainable and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="35">â¢ Canada's Arctic and Arctic regions ensure that Inuit are safe and protected.</seg>
<seg id="36">â¢ A stronger business environment that can be adapted to other parts of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="37">â¢ Legislation based in the Arctic provides a useful tool for new technologies and opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="38">â¢ Knowledge and understanding of the guiding principles of decision-making.</seg>
<seg id="39">â¢ Canada's Arctic and Arctic survival is healthy and sustainable.</seg>
<seg id="40">â¢ Piliriqatigiinniq is a way to encourage and rebuild trust among Indigenous and non-Indigenous Inuit.</seg>
<seg id="41">These goals begin with a wide range of "initiatives" that have been redefined.</seg>
<seg id="42">Ten principles</seg>
<seg id="43">"In addition to fulfilling these goals and objectives, the policy document outlines principles under which, and I quote," will continue to guide the implementation of the program ": "</seg>
<seg id="44">"â¢ Decisions on the Arctic will be made through cooperation and engagement with the Arctic, on the basis of rights, needs and interests of the Arctic."</seg>
<seg id="45">"â¢ The rights and positions of the federal government, provincial, Indigenous and municipal governments will be respected."</seg>
<seg id="46">"â¢ Development must be sustainable and spiritual, social, cultural, economic and environmental considerations."</seg>
<seg id="47">"â¢ The integration of Indigenous peoples on an ongoing basis, using the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission as a starting point, would be a success."</seg>
<seg id="48">"While climate change is a serious issue in this land, action will be taken on a wide range of stakeholders, including the impact on Indigenous peoples, who depend on the land and wildlife for their cultural, economic and food security."</seg>
<seg id="49">"â¢ Policy and programming will identify diversity and equality, and use resources such as the Gender / Transgender Survey (G.W.T.) to address the potential impacts of multiple groups."</seg>
<seg id="50">"â¢ This will be a framework that takes into account a wide range of principles such as rights, interests and circumstances for Inuit, Arctic Indigenous peoples and MÃ©tis peoples to be respected, explained and implemented."</seg>
<seg id="51">"â¢ The Government of Canada recognizes the Inuit, Indigenous and MÃ©tis Indigenous peoples of Canada, in a way that, in many respects, recognizes the rights of communities, with their own history, including the federal government."</seg>
<seg id="52">"â¢ Working together based on rights, respect, collaboration that must reflect the needs, priorities and circumstances of each individual person."</seg>
<seg id="53">"â¢ All organizations, from individuals to universities and colleges, as well as non-profit organizations, community organizations and individuals across Canada, have a big role to play in building a stronger Canadian Arctic."</seg>

<seg id="6">"A Nunavut Conservative candidate says that if the Conservative party were to become a government, they would eliminate the carbon tax because it" raises costs for everything. ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Leona Aglukkaq began her campaign in Nunavut's communities.</seg>
<seg id="8">Nunavut's legislative assembly began its campaign in Iqaluit at a special event held on September 12 at the Frobisher Inn.</seg>
<seg id="9">He later flew to Rankin Inlet the next day before returning to Iqaluit next week.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nunatsiaq News had an opportunity to speak with Aglukkaq while she was in Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The carbon tax" raises air prices, goods, transport, hunting and home ownership, "says Aglukkaq's campaign poster."</seg>
<seg id="12">Aglukkaq also told Nunatsiaq News that the lake has a negative impact on daycares and elders homes by raising the heating system.</seg>
<seg id="13">"All products are affected by this carbon tax."</seg>
<seg id="14">Ms. Aglukkaq said.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The carbon tax when we can't afford to pay it is like the brain's house can't tell you the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="16">"But George Hickes, Nunavut's finance minister, announced in May that under an agreement in Ottawa, electricity and aviation fuel in Nunavut now belong to the tax system was exempt."</seg>
<seg id="17">The Government of Nunavut and the Government of Nunavut contribute half of the carbon tax to Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Aglukkaq's campaign for Nunavut has four priorities: affordable housing, mental health and job creation."</seg>
<seg id="19">"How can we as a government and the private sector and the Government of Nunavut work together to address the enormous need for housing across the Arctic?"</seg>
<seg id="20">"The priority of Aglukkaq's campaign is to develop a strategy that will include housing needs, elders" housing and disability housing. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"The federal and territorial governments must also consider ways to promote homeownership, she said."</seg>
<seg id="22">Aglukkaq also said the creation of a northern facility and mental health education for Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" Nunavut is a vast area with a great coastline in Canada and we are still left with the necessary marine infrastructure in our communities, so we have to take into account big projects like this in the Arctic, "she said."</seg>
<seg id="24">"" We must address the need for housing, training Nunavummiut for mental health services so that we can help our communities. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"When asked if it would affect the federal government's Nutrition North program, Aglukkaq said the carbon tax has raised food prices through increased airfares."</seg>
<seg id="26">"When asked if he thought this process would work, and if not, what he would do other than the carbon tax, he said he would talk to the Nutrition North Advisory Board."</seg>
<seg id="27">"He said that if the TI became a government, the board would always be there."</seg>
<seg id="28">"It's very important to have people in the Arctic who can tell the government how to improve the program.</seg>
<seg id="29">This is not a good program.</seg>
<seg id="30">Not everything is perfect in the world.</seg>
<seg id="31">But there needs to be a subsidy for Arctic food. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"Aglukkaq didn't want to be specific about what to say about Nutrition North, but she said there needs to be a subsidy for food and that" elimination "would not help."</seg>
<seg id="33">"Most recently, research published in the Canadian Medical Association's Journal found that food is far more difficult in Nunavut under the Nutrition North Canada Program, under the terms of the Canadian Community Health Survey."</seg>
<seg id="34">"Aglukkaq said her experience as minister of the environment would help reduce climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but she didn't say much about how she would do it."</seg>
<seg id="35">He said he will support the Kivalliq Regional Access Road and the Grays Bay Road and the Kitikmeot Regional Marine Facility.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Will we be able to eliminate the use of fossil fuels in the near future?</seg>
<seg id="37">"No," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="38">"When Conservative leader Andrew Chu came to Iqaluit last June, he said Nunavut needs to develop a renewable energy system, saying it is" impossible "under the current Liberal government."</seg>
<seg id="39">Aglukkaq said she believes the policy has already been put in place to consult with Inuit on renewable resource development and it is unclear if it will be developed now.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" The Nunavut Land Claims Agreement provides information on how business must be done in the Arctic. The land claims agreement, in my view, is the most important part of the environmental plan. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"It protects our land, protects our waters, protects our wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="42">"It's already set up to meet the needs of how the projects should be done.</seg>
<seg id="43">And it has made it a legal priority and we have to be very proud of it.</seg>
<seg id="44">"And the decisions about the Arctic must come from Inuit in the Arctic, not from Ottawa." "</seg>
<seg id="45">"Aglukkaq left her headquarters in Pond Inlet and Arctic Bay on September 19, her office said."</seg>
<seg id="46">"She also plans to travel to Pangnirtung, Qikiqtarjuaq and Clyde River before she can travel to the Kivalliq and Kitikmeot regions."</seg>

<seg id="12">"This plan has been under consideration for almost five years, with the announcement of a plan to be developed this past March in Iqaluit at the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board's meeting."</seg>

<seg id="17">"For all the circumpolar regions of the world's 19 polar bears, 12 of them are in Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="18">Polar bear quotas have been established by region (e.g. only male) of the polar bear population - and the killing of polar bear protection is included in the annual polar bear quota set by the community.</seg>
<seg id="19">"While the new plan will not increase the total allowable harvest at this time, a new total allowable harvest may be considered when it comes to new data."</seg>
<seg id="20">"As previously planned, Nunavut communities were allowed to harvest a single female polar bear quota with two male polar bear tags each year for each community's polar bear quota."</seg>
<seg id="21">"This was done only in the Baffin Bay polar bear subpopulation, where there is a balanced quota for female and male polar bears. Under the new plan, it won't matter if the polar bear quota in Nunavut is male or female but it has to be balanced."</seg>
<seg id="22">The name would be put on a tag.</seg>
<seg id="23">The new equal male / female polar bear quota for community polar bear protection can be maintained if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The increased frequency of polar bear visits to communities has been a concern in Nunavut since the death of two polar bear hides in the Kivalliq region last year - however, under the current management plan, the protection of the kill of a polar bear by a female, would result in two tags being used."</seg>
<seg id="25">As a result, some communities will no longer have tags for defence kills.</seg>
<seg id="26">"This new plan could reduce the importation of polar bear hides into communities, Shewchuk told Nunatsiaq News."</seg>
<seg id="27">"But he previously said the polar bear attacks are a danger to Inuit culture and society, because they damage cabins, birds and seals."</seg>
<seg id="28">Participants at the meeting in Cambridge Bay welcomed changes to the polar bear management plan.</seg>
<seg id="29">They were also pleased to note that the community of Kimmirut will now have five more tags for grizzly bears.</seg>
<seg id="30">There was a large grizzly bear that was spotted and shot because it was too close to a number of buildings in the Mount Palmer area.</seg>
<seg id="31">"On the other hand, the new polar bear management plan may be looking at something else."</seg>
<seg id="32">"The polar bear future is uncertain because of climate change, according to a 2018 study by the Special Committee on the Species at Risk in Canada (COSEWIC). This committee, the species at risk in Canada (COSEWIC), reassessed the polar bear population as a" major concern. ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Our contributions today to our children and future generations</seg>
<seg id="3">The Inuktut Roman writing system - which can be used in all Inuit languages across Canada.</seg>
<seg id="4">Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami says it will not replace syllabics and Inuit Nunangat regions that use traditional syllabics and others.</seg>
<seg id="5">ITK has also said the Inuit writing system will not require any changes to its traditional writing system.</seg>
<seg id="6">By Mailee Gladue</seg>
<seg id="7">"I was very proud to hear that the team of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami unanimously approved the new Inuktut writing system, named after the Inuktut Roman orthography that was released earlier this month."</seg>
<seg id="8">Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami means "unity among the people of Canada" and there are few examples of the more powerful among our people who have shared their shared values for survival and our culture and language.</seg>
<seg id="9">That's very encouraging to me at this time.</seg>
<seg id="10">"In June 2011 when I was the president of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, we defended the renewal process for changes to our education system."</seg>
<seg id="11">"We created a national contest for single-payer education with 10 strong recommendations that focused on our shared vision to ensure that our children have the right education, the right to be able to learn, and the right to speak in Inuktitut, culture and language."</seg>
<seg id="12">Our recommendations included the establishment of a unified public registry.</seg>
<seg id="13">Single Canadians have taken many years to reach that goal and have reached a new culture.</seg>
<seg id="14">Single language creators in every community in Inuit Nunangat developed an Inuktut Roman orthography.</seg>
<seg id="15">This means that we will have one writing system in which all Inuit learn their language in a meaningful way.</seg>
<seg id="16">The use of this new system will grow rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The Tungasuvvingat alone will not replace or eliminate the use of traditional local writing systems, as it is intended to involve the use of Tungasuvvingat as a way to improve the use of single-use communications."</seg>
<seg id="18">It's a gift that we give today to our children and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="19">I can now imagine that single Canadians will be better able to communicate with each other and share learning materials and curriculum that will create a lot of good teaching issues and that our children will be able to attend high school in both languages and be able to write and speak.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We face the world's evolution as a people. Our attempts to preserve the western culture have been hampered by our social, family arrangements, and our language."</seg>
<seg id="21">But we're here today.</seg>
<seg id="22">Over the past few years we have had to look at our history to find out who we are today and why we are today in a state of crisis.</seg>
<seg id="23">I believe my vision is that we now have a system that we will have to look back on or we will be able to use it in the future.</seg>
<seg id="24">The use of Inuktut in Roman orthography in Canada is a sign that I understand that we want to move forward together as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It's been eight years since we started developing a national strategy for Inuit education, we have been able to implement a language called" Inuktut "that will mean every single person's language, regardless of where they may be from."</seg>
<seg id="26">To me this is a way for me to see the unity of individuals. It is a way for us to circumvent all aspects of our society's untruthful barriers.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Our language, our identity and our identity are visible, and our language is healthy."</seg>
<seg id="28">I am hopeful that we will be able to use Inuktut in all dialects and dialects and move forward on a consistent basis as we work together to fill our positions as Inuit.</seg>

<seg id="2">"This is a lot of hard work"</seg>
<seg id="3">Students walk four foxes in Iqaluit on September 27 to participate in the United Nations Climate Change Framework.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three legislative candidates for the federal government say they want to stop Nunavut's diesel fuel consumption by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="5">(Photo by Justin Potter)</seg>
<seg id="6">By Justin Potter</seg>
<seg id="7">"In this federal election, three legislative parties said Nunavut's use of diesel fuel will be shut down by 2030."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Right now all 25 communities in Nunavut have diesel generators operated by the Qulliq Energy Corporation, the only power corporation in Canada that does not have renewable energy systems in their communities."</seg>
<seg id="9">Changing that would be a huge and costly project.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" This is a lot of work, "said Martha Lionel, the Arctic renewable energy specialist for the World Wildlife Fund."</seg>
<seg id="11">"" It's probably possible, just a little bit of luck. ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The Green Party's campaign promises to "implement a renewable energy system.</seg>
<seg id="13">"By 2030, all of Canada's energy systems will go through renewable energy systems."</seg>
<seg id="14">This includes banning outpost camps in northern communities from using diesel fuel for electricity. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"The Liberal Party said it will" move forward financially to ensure that Inuit communities will no longer use diesel fuel until they can generate electricity using clean, renewable energy - such as hydro, wind and solar power - by 2030. ""</seg>
<seg id="16">The New Democratic Party (NDP) said it would "aim to bring Canada's renewable energy generation to its knees by 2030... to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by providing electricity to communities and creating jobs.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We would support applications for locally owned and operated clean energy projects to employ local and skilled residents, as well as work with Indigenous and Arctic communities to reduce the use of diesel fuel." "</seg>
<seg id="18">"According to the Department of Environment and Climate Change Canada's report released earlier this year, air pollution in Nunavut accounts for less than 1 per cent of this impact."</seg>
<seg id="19">"In 2017, Nunavut produced a total of 0.6 megawatts of carbon dioxide, equivalent to 18,000 vehicles per person."</seg>
<seg id="20">"That year, Alberta, which is the country's largest dust suppressant, produced about 84 million vehicles per person."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Despite that, Nunavut has seen its carbon emissions from vehicles more than 30 per cent since 2005, with the largest increase in Canada and Alberta almost double, which is the second largest increase in the same period."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Even if energy changes were made in the three legislatures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the impact on Canada's carbon emissions would still be small."</seg>
<seg id="23">The communities will be the ones who will get the most.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Nunavummiut pay the largest amount of electricity than any other jurisdiction in Canada, and funding for energy would reduce that."</seg>
<seg id="25">"However, taking action on renewable energy projects such as renewable energy projects may not match the cost of what is currently being spent on energy."</seg>
<seg id="26">"Last month, the World Wildlife Fund released a report that outlines how renewable energy can be delivered in each of the 25 communities in Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="27">"They found that by a reduction of 8 per cent - mainly because of the risk of a project or other sources of revenue - Baker Lake, Coral Harbour, Iqaluit and Rankin Inlet would save money by moving away from 20 per cent of renewable energy, including direct payments for about 15 years."</seg>
<seg id="28">The study also indicated that 16 other communities with a 4 per cent subsidy - roughly the Qulliq Energy Corporation's loan limit - could also receive about $2 million in subsidies and a 20 per cent cash transfer.</seg>
<seg id="29">"But the report only talks about the viability of these projects, with the decision to relocate renewable energy sources at a lower cost than the current energy costs."</seg>
<seg id="30">But moving communities to a viable renewable energy source would be a big task.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" It would require a lot of consultations, and they would have to start next year in order to meet their energy needs in each community, "said Lionel."</seg>
<seg id="32">"" They would have to go to the community, work with them on what they would like to do, and see what the community would like to see in the energy sector, to see what their priorities are and what the community would like to hear about the importance of hunting and hunting. ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"This does not include the development of an integrated infrastructure for solar energy or wind energy, which would take two years to properly collect, or projects for the Qulliq Energy Corporation to ensure that renewable energy systems are reliable."</seg>
<seg id="34">"For every community 100 per cent of the allocation of renewable energy, which the three parties are trying to get into the legislative assembly, it would not only take a long time, but it would also cost a lot of money."</seg>
<seg id="35">"The New Democratic Party (NDP) and the Liberal Party (Liberal) have not announced how much money they would contribute to the devolution process, the Green Party said last week."</seg>
<seg id="36">"As part of its campaign spending report, Green Party said it will contribute $150 million over the next five years to devolution to all rural and northern communities - not just in Nunavut - to reduce the use of fossil fuels."</seg>
<seg id="37">It's not enough.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Leno explained that if a community like Arctic Bay were to transfer at least 60 per cent of its power plant, it would require an operating cost of about $27.8 million."</seg>
<seg id="39">"According to the same report, for other communities to use 60 per cent of renewable energy, they would have to use a higher rate."</seg>
<seg id="40">"In Iqaluit, it is estimated to cost about $148 million."</seg>
<seg id="41">"While it is clear that it is smaller than the $250 million to $500 million that would have been spent on energy projects in the city, that would be spent on one community that the Green Party wants to contribute."</seg>
<seg id="42">"Leno does not expect the federal government to pay for all of these projects, but they also said they would work with partners and how they would be done and it would be difficult and time-consuming."</seg>
<seg id="43">"When you look at the 2030 deadline, there won't be much time left."</seg>
<seg id="44">"" In terms of solar energy, I think it's going to take two to five years. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"In terms of wind energy, it would take five to seven years," said Lionel when asked how much energy they would be doing. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"When you look at the deadlines and divide them into 25 communities and if they're going to be done at the same time in remote communities and the land is not always available, Leno is thinking about how to get it done, looking at all the options, he's saying it's possible."</seg>
<seg id="47">"" I think for those who want to get there, that's going to make a big difference. "</seg>
<seg id="48">"Even if we don't get to 100 per cent, then there's a lot of interest." "</seg>
<seg id="49">"Please note: This book covers the federal nomination of the Green Party, the Liberal Party and the New Democratic Party (NDP)."</seg>
<seg id="50">"When the book was developed, the Conservative Party had not yet announced its candidacy, so they were not included in this report."</seg>

<seg id="2">We must recognize the importance of early childhood education and daycare workers in Nunavut to our frontline workers.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Lukakuluk Wilson-Bathory, the chair of the Footprints Daycare Board, is seeking more support from the Government of Nunavut for quality early childhood education and child care based on Inuit language and culture."</seg>
<seg id="4">By Nunatsiak News</seg>
<seg id="5">Letter to Nunavut Premier Joe Savikataaq and Minister of Education David Joanasie Savikataaq and Minister Joanasie</seg>
<seg id="6">I am one of those people who are grieving because of our language and culture.</seg>
<seg id="7">"As the chair of the board of directors of the Footprints Sailivik Centre, the only Inuktut language school for children in early childhood education in Iqaluit and the only one in Iqaluit at the headquarters in Nunavut that provides daycare services to children who already speak Inuktitut."</seg>
<seg id="8">"The Footprints Sailivik Centre closed on Aug. 21 on Sept. 12, 2019 due to a staff shortage and, again, it has been operating under a staff shortage for almost a year."</seg>
<seg id="9">"A small number of people apply for jobs at the Tungasuvvingat Daycare Centre due to low pay (Iqaluit's highest daycare wage), employees who don't have income support, housing because they're viewed as a down-payment for women's work at the daycare as they see it."</seg>
<seg id="10">"The daycare is now open again, but the emergency operation is challenging: we lost our staff and a good employee was exhausted."</seg>
<seg id="11">"We now have a part-time office worker, a full-time daycare manager, two full-time daycare workers and each child care worker who work rotating shifts at the daycare (all of them are probation and safety), who work full-time, while we're looking for a full-time position, a qualified person."</seg>
<seg id="12">"This process is not uncommon, but for those of us who have children, we believe that our children have to be safe and speak Inuktitut to keep the mask open."</seg>
<seg id="13">There is still a risk that it could be closed permanently.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Nunavut's daycare operations are currently at a disadvantage. Day care workers are expected to provide one of the most important child care services to provide quality early childhood education, based on Inuit culture and language, despite the low cost and lack of support."</seg>
<seg id="15">The non-profit organization relies on a number of different sources of funding each year, as well as parents who volunteer their time to manage a daycare in the community.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Day care workers are often unable to afford to pay and receive no compensation, no training for their work and no housing for staff."</seg>
<seg id="17">Day care workers are now being asked to work below their basic needs in order to sustain themselves or their families.</seg>
<seg id="18">The challenges facing our daycares are due to the unique staffing needs that require the knowledge and expertise to promote and preserve the Inuit language and culture of our young children; Footprints hire only fluent Inuktut speakers.</seg>
<seg id="19">It's 100 per cent Inuit employment.</seg>
<seg id="20">But because of the high turnover of our employees, we're struggling with a staff shortage because of the lack of competition and the lack of compensation and benefits for our employees, they're leaving.</seg>
<seg id="21">"As a result, it has an impact on early childhood education and child learning."</seg>
<seg id="22">Inuit deserve the support they need and the value of our language and culture to be taught to our children.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Government of Nunavut must consider how to better support quality early childhood education and ensure that the daycare is based on Inuit language and culture.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Effective valued early childhood education and child care workers are paid to compete with the public and receive benefits, which include housing for their work, vacation, training in the workplace and in the school system."</seg>
<seg id="25">Footprints's vision of the daycare is to expand its reach to the public and increase resources so that more Inuit children can be accommodated.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We have now been looking for a larger daycare to meet our vision and that's why we have raised close to $80,000 for the new space that has been collected."</seg>
<seg id="27">They propose the following reforms to the Government of Nunavut:</seg>
<seg id="28">"â¢ Collecting early childhood education and daycare workers as part of the Government of Nunavut's workforce to provide the same level of pay as the Government of Nunavut's wage, consistent with the Government of Nunavut's payroll system in eight categories, which apply to employees in the Nunavut school system;"</seg>
<seg id="29">â¢ including the operations and maintenance of daycare facilities in Nunavut that are currently in place within the education system;</seg>
<seg id="30">"â¢ Provide funding for early childhood education and daycare staff but not limited to short-term measures that include long-term sick leave, vacation travel, bilingual pay, parental leave and housing"</seg>
<seg id="31">â¢ the creation of a body to support all daycares in Nunavut;</seg>
<seg id="32">â¢ Work with daycares to address immediate and urgent challenges. Together, we will work together to develop a long-term plan to change the operations of the daycare system.</seg>
<seg id="33">We must recognize the importance of early childhood education and daycare workers in Nunavut to our employees.</seg>
<seg id="34">We want to ensure that our daycares have a full complement of positions and that all employees receive a subsidy.</seg>
<seg id="35">We have to keep our daycares open.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Changing the operation of the daycare system will ensure that Nunavut's early childhood and daycare workers will be able to do their jobs in a way that will allow them to take a significant step forward to ensure that early childhood and daycare operations change the way they are able to provide the best quality of life for children, including learning the Inuktut language, grow a strong foundation of Inuit culture, and participate fully in the rest of Canada."</seg>

<seg id="8">"In the Montreal hotel room there was a lot of noise on Thursday, Oct. 3, when Inuit attended the 21st Inuit Cultural Education Conference as they walked in to hear two Inuit leaders talk about why the right to speak Inuktut in Nunavut is a right to be an Inuk and that the right to be denied."</seg>
<seg id="9">"NTI President Aluki Kotierk and Louis Tapardjuk, a former Government of Nunavut minister and member of the Inuit Uqausinginnik Taiguusiliuqtiit, the Nunavut Language Authority, appeared on time and sat in front of the chairs of the Inuit Uqausinginnik Taiguusiliuqtiit."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Photographers were organized to promote Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. 's Facebook page, which featured a video of a wide range of websites for English-language speakers, and participants were mostly Inuit who heard the full text of the speech."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Kotierk welcomed the audience and started speaking in Inuktitut, with those who speak Inuktitut sometimes agreeing to their head and clapping."</seg>
<seg id="12">"For those who don't speak Inuktitut, including the author, they just sat there and looked at it."</seg>
<seg id="13">Some people just walked out.</seg>
<seg id="14">Some people are just trying to listen to their phone while they're waiting for the English version.</seg>
<seg id="15">There was no English copy.</seg>
<seg id="16">Welcome to the amazing community of many Inuit in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" The name of the Inuit cultural school was something that, especially when we were talking about the Inuit language, we wanted to use the Inuit language, "Kotierk said at the start."</seg>
<seg id="18">"We talked about it and we knew there would be no interpreters but we decided it's very important to use our language when we talk about the need for support and promotion of our language."</seg>
<seg id="19">"The World Summit, which brings together northern experts from the Arctic and the south, has, in recent years, started to involve more Inuktut speakers and speakers, a conference focused on Inuit needs and a closer working relationship between Inuit and non-Inuit educated people."</seg>
<seg id="20">"The Inuktitut hearing, due to the language of the Inuit right, seemed to be in the process of developing this."</seg>
<seg id="21">Kotierk's statement addressed a number of pieces of legislation that need to promote and protect the Inuktut language in Nunavut, where there are more Inuit and more speakers in Inuktut.</seg>
<seg id="22">"These laws include the United Nations (United Nations) Act on the right of Indigenous peoples (and First Nations) to act on recommendations and legal action by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the National Inquiry into the Murdered and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, and the Nunavut Language Act."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Kotierk described many of the recent Inuit deaths, in part, to language and culture, such as Annie Kootoo, who died of liver failure in 2017, and the 15-year-old Eileen Kooneeliusie, who died of tuberculosis in the same year."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Inuit want the right to live and have the right to live.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Canadian Inuit should not die because of a lack of access and services comparable to other Canadians," Kotierk wrote in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="26">"In his statement, Tapardjuk referred to a recent incident in Iqaluit where officers went to an elder to tell him that his adopted son was shot dead at the youth centre."</seg>
<seg id="27">The woman is single and does not speak English.</seg>
<seg id="28">Tapardjuk said the RCMP had to stop the vehicle to ask for help in the announcement of the bad news.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" There are a number of things that this report could have done in this area. Does a person have an assistant in the event of a dramatic change in their life, who didn't even have an interpreter, "Kotierk told Nunatsiaq News."</seg>
<seg id="30">"Many of us Inuit who speak English and Inuktitut are invited to do the work.</seg>
<seg id="31">"We are thought to be able to interpret at any time, even if we don't know the Inuit."</seg>
<seg id="32">Sometimes it's confidential.</seg>
<seg id="33">"So, in that way, I can say that it's a violation of human rights." "</seg>
<seg id="34">"Kotierk said at least that those who speak Inuktut in Nunavut should have access to professional services in their language in the areas of health, justice and education."</seg>
<seg id="35">Even those things are not readily available.</seg>
<seg id="36">He and other leaders continue to call on the federal government to protect their language and their people at home.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ottawa passed a new Indigenous language legislation in June that has been criticized by NTI and ITK for saying their decisions have not been taken care of.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Kotierk said he wanted people to know," We are the authority. "</seg>
<seg id="39">Let's speak Inuktut when we go to the store.</seg>
<seg id="40">Let's speak Inuktut when we go to the bank.</seg>
<seg id="41">Let's speak Inuktut when we go to school.</seg>
<seg id="42">"If we speak more in Inuktut and don't think of those who can't understand, then they can be given a larger share of what is required." "</seg>

<seg id="1">Qikiqtani Inuit Association announces compensation for tourism operators in Inuit Nunangat</seg>
<seg id="2">Expenditures to be made mandatory</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tourism operators who visit the Qikiqtani region of Nunavut will now have to pay for tourism fees if they want to access Inuit Nunangat, the QIA announced at its annual general meeting in Iqaluit from Oct. 8 to 10."</seg>
<seg id="4">"The commercial tourism operators must now pay if they want to go to their own communities in the Qikiqtani region, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association announced at its annual general meeting in Iqaluit on Wednesday, Oct. 9."</seg>
<seg id="5">The Qikiqtani region hosts the largest number of ships carrying Inuit passengers across the territory.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Pond Inlet received 17 cruise ships this summer, while Iqaluit was visited by four passengers."</seg>
<seg id="7">"" Inuit in the Qikiqtani region have expressed concern about the increasing number of tourism activities in our region, especially with Inuit shipping ships. "</seg>
<seg id="8">"The Qikiqtani Inuit Association has developed a tourism executive compensation package to help Inuit in communities affected by cruise ships," P.J. Akeeagok, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association's president, said in a news release. "</seg>
<seg id="9">Following a news release the Qikiqtani Inuit Association's land and natural resources department announced the new funding.</seg>
<seg id="10">The new expenditures are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="11">â¢ Airplane landing in Inuit Nunangat: $150</seg>
<seg id="12">â¢ A helicopter landing in Inuit Nunangat: $100</seg>
<seg id="13">â¢ Economic mistakes in Inuit Nunangat: $50 a day</seg>
<seg id="14">â¢ Commercial visitor access in less than six hours in Inuit Nunangat: $25.00 a day</seg>
<seg id="15">"Half of the total spending would go to the hunters and trappers organization closest to the tourism industry that is available, the release said."</seg>
<seg id="16">Half of that would go to the Qikiqtani Inuit Association.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The ships carrying Inuit to Nunavut have a population of between 150 and 400 people," Rosen T. Reykjavik, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association's director of land and renewable resources, said at the Qikiqtani Inuit Association's board meeting. "</seg>
<seg id="18">The $25 a day fee would apply to all passengers who carry Inuit passengers in order to get to their own communities - or IOL (Inuit Nunangat).</seg>
<seg id="19">"" No matter how many people on the ship are going to be landed in Inuit Nunangat, they will be charged based on the number of people on the ship, "T. Reehr told the board."</seg>
<seg id="20">T. Reehr said the ships carrying Inuit passengers to the Qikiqtani region will have to submit to the Qikiqtani Inuit Association the number of Inuit passengers per month or before they start boating.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" If the ship offloaded 350 people, we would charge $25 a day per person. "</seg>
<seg id="22">"So the larger passenger vessels would have to pay between $10,000 and $20,000 to land in Inuit Nunangat," T. Reimer said. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"In a community where a lot of ships get Inuit passengers in the summer, such as Pond Inlet, the hunter and trappers organization would receive between $50,000 and $70,000 in compensation, she added."</seg>
<seg id="24">The new funding will also support the Qikiqtani Inuit Association's use of the land registration system.</seg>
<seg id="25">"That way, tourism operators will be notified when they apply for new fees to access Inuit Nunangat."</seg>
<seg id="26">T. Reehr said the Qikiqtani Inuit Association set the rates based on what other organizations pay for the tourism industry.</seg>
<seg id="27">"For example, Parks Canada charges $25 per person to go to national park."</seg>
<seg id="28">"Hamlets also charge people for transporting ships and tourism operators to their communities, T. Reykjavik said."</seg>
<seg id="29">"" The ships that carry Inuit who have been able to get into their own communities are penalized for that unless Inuit actually get into our own communities, "she said."</seg>
<seg id="30">"Joe Ataguttaaluk, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association's secretary / treasurer, asked if it was possible that these costs would rise in the future."</seg>
<seg id="31">"T. Reimer said the change would be possible, but it would require a lot of discussion and resolution by the Qikiqtani Inuit Association's board of directors."</seg>
<seg id="32">"This is a very exciting strategy.</seg>
<seg id="33">"We are once again leading the way in which Inuit can contribute to their communities," Akeeagok told the council. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"The payments will come into effect immediately, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association said."</seg>

<seg id="1">Baffinland's huge railway project has raised concerns among Pond Inlet residents</seg>
<seg id="2">"Does Baffinland feel that we don't know if the NIRB or the government will approve the project in advance?"</seg>
<seg id="3">"The cargo ship of the Pilgrim Broncos sank off the coast of Columbia, Germany, last summer."</seg>
<seg id="4">"In the barge you can see two potential construction units, 33 and 34 metres high, which Baffinland Iron Mines Corp. acquired from TI and shipped to the Mary River mine this summer."</seg>
<seg id="5">Two smaller units are also shipped in from the front.</seg>
<seg id="6">"This will be used for the railway expansion, which has not yet been approved by the legislative assembly."</seg>
<seg id="7">(Photo courtesy of Dawson)</seg>
<seg id="8">Local leaders in Pond Inlet are frustrated by the huge ship carrying railway parts of Baffinland Iron Mines Corp. 's Mary River iron mine this summer.</seg>
<seg id="9">"What they are concerned about is that Baffinland wants to expand its railway to phase 2 of the plan, and before the permitting process has been approved, Baffinland sent two large 10-storey buildings to Brigadien, Germany, to the company's port at Mary River in North Baffin this summer."</seg>
<seg id="10">"They also brought in two smaller units that could be built and large railways that would be used to build them, such as railway and land iron ore."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Baffinland, in November 2018, announced to rights groups and their partners that the Qikiqtani Inuit Association would be bringing in, in the form of a public registry for the Nunavut Impact Review Board and the Nunavut Water Board."</seg>
<seg id="12">But the people of Pond Inlet are finally finding that out.</seg>
<seg id="13">When the ship from the Pirurvik Broncos arrived at Baffinland's port at Mary River this past August, they shipped a package of modular buildings to be used to build a railway expansion.</seg>
<seg id="14">When the people of Pond Inlet saw a ship near their community, they will be the first to hear of a cargo ship. Two more ships carrying railway parts arrived shortly after that and more ships are expected to arrive in the summer of 2020.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We just found out about three or four weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We see cargo being shipped around Pond Inlet," Joshua Arreak, the executive director of the Pond Inlet Hunters and Trappers Association told Nunatsiaq News. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"We were wondering why and who they were and how they were doing it.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We have not received any information from the Nunavut Impact Review Board, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association or anyone else."</seg>
<seg id="19">"We didn't expect that," Arreak said. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"We have not heard from the Qikiqtani Inuit Association or the Nunavut Impact Review Board.</seg>
<seg id="21">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have a problem with the Inuit organizations.</seg>
<seg id="23">"They don't keep us informed," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="24">The Nunavut Impact Review Board knew about the sealift this winter</seg>
<seg id="25">"Any Nunavut permitting body and any federal minister rejected Baffinland's expansion plan, which would create a 110-kilometre railway from Mary River to Mary River, produce an additional 12 million tonnes a year, and travel up to 200 times a year to haul iron ore."</seg>
<seg id="26">This project cannot be fully approved by the federal government until the final public hearing that the Nunavut Impact Review Board has scheduled for Nov. 2 in Iqaluit and ends on Nov. 8 and 9 in Pond Inlet.</seg>
<seg id="27">"The Nunavut Impact Review Board, which did not seek comment from the stakeholders, said it would bring in a sealift order for the railway to be used in a letter sent to Baffinland this past July 25."</seg>
<seg id="28">"The NIRB told the company that if phase 2 is not approved, Baffinland would have to take responsibility for the shipping of the material, which could cost tens of millions of dollars, out of the mine."</seg>
<seg id="29">They also said the sealift will not affect the NIRB's decision on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="30">"In an email dated Oct. 17, the Nunavut Impact Review Board's executive director, Ryan Perry, indicated that the regulatory authority of the Nunavut Impact Review Board may or may not approve the vessel's activities."</seg>
<seg id="31">"" The NIRB was only able to say that these activities would be included in the evaluation process and that all materials for construction would have to be transferred if the application was rejected after the board's initial inspection, "Perry wrote."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is an aerial photo of the Pilgrim Broncos. This summer the ship shipped a package of modular buildings to Mary River to be used for Baffinland's railway expansion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"One of the units, referred to as the" destructive building, "is 33 metres high, 23.5 metres wide and weighing 1,470 tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="34">"On the other hand, it's referred to as the" dirt building, "which is 34 metres high."</seg>
<seg id="35">"So each building, which is part of an existing demolition and contamination facility, is roughly equivalent to a 10-floor building - or even higher than what is built in the eastern Arctic."</seg>
<seg id="36">But Baffinland has not yet been approved for the use of these funds.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" Baffinland will identify these assets only for phase 2 - not to use them "until phase 2 of the application is complete," the company wrote in its July 19 report to the Nunavut Impact Review Board. "</seg>
<seg id="38">Equipment stored in Inuit Nunangat</seg>
<seg id="39">"In a joint submission to the permitting body, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association and Baffinland wrote that the assets will be located in Inuit Nunangat, in accordance with the Qikiqtani Inuit Association's commercial lease agreement with the company."</seg>
<seg id="40">"For Arreak and others, an event such as this suggests Baffinland has already been approved for the project."</seg>
<seg id="41">"The people of Pond Inlet are not happy.</seg>
<seg id="42">Does Baffinland feel that we don't know if the NIRB or the government will approve the project in advance?</seg>
<seg id="43">"I don't know," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="44">"Rodrik Tester, a technical specialist at the Municipality of Pond Inlet, was granted permission by Pond Inlet's mayor, Joshua Shewchuk, to speak to Nunatsiaq News on behalf of the hamlet."</seg>
<seg id="45">"" Baffinland has been working on the idea of approving phase 2, "Tester said in an email."</seg>
<seg id="46">"" Even if the Nunavut Impact Review Board had the authority to do that, the final impact of the decision would be to put more pressure on the Nunavut Impact Review Board to act as a plebiscite authority and approve the application. "</seg>
<seg id="47">"This is a concern," Tester said on behalf of the hamlet. "</seg>
<seg id="48">"" On the other hand, the hamlet feels that it wasn't necessary to do that. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"This has been done financially and in the spirit of Baffinland's decision to approve phase 2," she wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="50">"" Our main concern is the animals, marine animals and their habitats. "</seg>
<seg id="51">We would be the most affected in our communities.</seg>
<seg id="52">That's our concern.</seg>
<seg id="53">"The money will not bring back the animals," Joshua Arreak said on behalf of the hunters and trappers organization, citing an ongoing discussion in Pond Inlet over the years regarding marine transportation to Baffinland's plan. "</seg>
<seg id="54">"For non-political organizations such as the Ocean North, who have expressed interest in the upcoming hearing on Baffinland's expansion plan, they said they support" responsible development "at the Mary River mine."</seg>
<seg id="55">"But they also said Baffinland's export of large amounts of fax had not already taken into account the environmental impact, and they were not satisfied with Baffinland's decision to export large iron ore from Mary River to the south of Arctic Bay, which was allowed to happen in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="56">"" It's no surprise that residents are not satisfied with the large amount of imported railway parts to Mary River prior to legislative approval for this expansion, "said Chris Thibicke, deputy minister of policy and legislative affairs at the Department of Fisheries and Oceans for the Arctic."</seg>
<seg id="57">Pan-designed equipment received from Tyson Crosby</seg>
<seg id="58">The materials that are being shipped to Mary River are part of an existing railway system that Baffinland acquired from Tirurutiup to various locations in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="59">"The two large buildings, which came in first, were designed in Primohan, which is the third built, a railway, built in Steensland, Bolsonaro, TI said in a news release."</seg>
<seg id="60">"Baffinland also brought in a cargo ship, a belt in the process and a bunch of equipment to be used for railway transport."</seg>
<seg id="61">"The material details of Baffinland's submission to the Nunavut Impact Review Board and the Nunavut Water Board included a railway link and a road link, as well as a bag of metal and garbage."</seg>
<seg id="62">"Tungasuvvingat's first ship to Baffinland, a ship called Bigfoot Barnes, weighs 5,500 tonnes of raw material, and departed from Columbia in early August."</seg>
<seg id="63">"Two more cargo ships also shipped more cargo this summer, and more cargo will be shipped in the summer of 2020, Tester said."</seg>
<seg id="64">"Under a partnership agreement with the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, Baffinland agreed to put an additional $18 million in compensation funding to clean up the Mary River mine if the project stopped, the water board's letter said."</seg>

<seg id="2">Inuit women account for 15 per cent of those attending the women's centre</seg>
<seg id="3">"Morina Buller Widden, the executive director of the women's shelter, the women's shelter and Cathy Wong, the city councillor representing Peet McGill Nunangat and a spokesman for the Montreal city council, discussed plans for a 22-bed homeless women's shelter in Montreal on Oct. 16 in a news release for the women's shelter."</seg>
<seg id="4">(Photo courtesy of the City of Montreal)</seg>
<seg id="5">"The Montreal town of Willet-Murray allows for the expansion of a program started by the women's shelter, a day shelter for women who are homeless, which was set up to replace a building that was inherited last year."</seg>
<seg id="6">"The residents" decision, announced on Wednesday, Oct. 16, will allow for the establishment of a new building within a short distance of the centre, which will then become an emergency night for women. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"The women's centre, a women's day centre on the 1430 per cent street in Montreal, is open every day of the week for women who need help."</seg>
<seg id="8">Many of them are born.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The women's centre is currently located on Sirty Road, not far from the Apron Road and CafÃ© Sirga, a gathering place for Inuit in the town."</seg>
<seg id="10">"The women's centre is well known by many Inuit women, who make up 15 per cent of the population."</seg>
<seg id="11">"With the scheduled opening in 2021, the building's emergency night centre was purchased with a contribution of $1 million from the Montreal businessman Andrew Harper through the Joyce Community Foundation in Montreal."</seg>
<seg id="12">"" Thanks to the new facility, we will now be able to accommodate 22 beds for women who are homeless, "said Morina Buller, executive director of Sarah Cree, who said in a news release after the event at the women's shelter."</seg>
<seg id="13">"" Right now, women make up 25 per cent of the homeless population in Montreal, but the benefits for women are often inadequate. "</seg>
<seg id="14">This project is a step in the right direction. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"This good news about the centre's expansion came less than a week after the person at the centre, Clara Okatsiak, a former resident of the Northwest Territories, died on Oct. 11 at the hospital."</seg>
<seg id="16">Princeton told Nunatsiaq News that after Okatsiak's daughter committed suicide while in custody she was in a state of health.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The majority of the people who go to the centre are people who go to the city due to housing shortages and legal problems," Bychok said. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"There are a lot of people who go to the women's shelter during the day. There are six beds in the facility. There are a few hours of sleep and they just stay outside in the evening."</seg>
<seg id="19">That's going to change with the new overnight accommodations.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Right now, the women's centre, which hosts about 100 women every day, provides services and programs for women to meet their basic needs in homelessness, food insecurity, mental health and substance abuse."</seg>
<seg id="21">Princeton said the number of Inuit women who go to the centre has remained stable since 2018.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" However, we have filled up women with people who need more help than they really need in clothing and bathrooms, "she said."</seg>
<seg id="23">"As the only women's day centre in Montreal, the St. Theresa's women's centre is now open seven days a week from 8: 30 a.m. to 3: 00 p.m."</seg>

<seg id="2">"For serious questions, the Liberals did not have much to offer"</seg>

<seg id="4">Do you remember the Liberal press release?</seg>
<seg id="5">Read a lot of stories in a row.</seg>
<seg id="6">More than anything we can remember.</seg>
<seg id="7">"That doesn't matter, because the majority of Nunavut voters released the results on Oct. 21, they didn't show anything."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Since 2015, Justin Trudeau and other Liberal governments in Nunavut have produced a lot of news."</seg>
<seg id="9">Even some of the information contained new details.</seg>
<seg id="10">"But in the end, the people of Nunavut just said" Tonight. ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"But in the end, they were thinner to politicians, since 1961, as Canadians have been thinner to change them: the New Democratic Party."</seg>
<seg id="12">"This elder Mamilak mountain's victory represents a rejection of Trudeau's strategy in the Arctic and northern Canada, which includes a rejection of what has been said repeatedly about the Inuit-Crown Partnership."</seg>

<seg id="16">"It's no secret that the majority of people in Nunavut are the most concerned about economic and social issues: the ongoing shortage of housing, food insecurity, high food prices and food prices, the prevalence of tuberculosis and suicide that is almost daily."</seg>
<seg id="17">"But on his last trip to Nunavut on Oct. 8, Trudeau did not have much good news on these issues."</seg>
<seg id="18">He made a statement in South Baffin about climate change and conservation.</seg>
<seg id="19">"These are issues for all Canadians, but during the general election year, Nunavummiut want to hear their concerns about housing and the high cost of living."</seg>
<seg id="20">"What happened was that the Sylvia Grinnel River was also filmed, not by Nunavut voters, but by southern Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="21">"In doing so, he did not respond to the pressing needs of Nunavummiut and to Nunavut's Liberal candidate, Megan Pizzo-Lyall, who did not even help him. He should have received more support from the president of the Liberal Party."</seg>
<seg id="22">"As for food prices and food insecurity, the Liberal party took action, put in place a higher contribution to the Nutrition North Canada Program, and gave more money, $12.5 million a year to Indigenous harvesters in Nunavut and other northern regions."</seg>
<seg id="23">But the hunter support program has to be developed and no one can tell why it is.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Also this past Aug. 1, Trudeau worked hard in Iqaluit and Arctic Bay, signing an agreement to establish the Tallurutiup Imanga Marine Conservation Area and promised to launch a new protected area called Tuvaijuittuq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"That's what he's doing and he's giving a lot of money to the communities in North Baffin, for small craft harbours and protection jobs."</seg>
<seg id="26">He also stressed the need for protection in such a way as to meet with Indigenous people.</seg>
<seg id="27">"The problem with this kind of work is that when you cough up a lot of tuberculosis in a overcrowded house, this" reunion "doesn't make sense."</seg>
<seg id="28">"With that in mind again, do you remember the Liberal government did a lot of good news about tuberculosis?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"They did that in early 2018, when Jane Willett, then the national health minister, said that tuberculosis would be eradicated in Inuit Nunangat by 2030."</seg>
<seg id="30">But Wilbur said the federal minister's commitment to this project is no longer there.</seg>
<seg id="31">"With Trudeau's approach to Jody Wilson-Raybould and his controversial handling of SNC-Lavalin, Wilbur resigned from the chamber."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Since then, the Liberal government has not heard of the eradication of tuberculosis."</seg>
<seg id="33">"Like the hunter support program, it seems to be stuck in the Inuit-Crown Partnership, and it appears that his strong message about the ban on tuberculosis is now in danger."</seg>
<seg id="34">"And everyone knows that tuberculosis is a symptom of poverty, poor nutrition and poor housing."</seg>
<seg id="35">"But on the housing side, Trudeau also offered a warm and rehearsal speech last summer."</seg>
<seg id="36">"And the Government of Canada's Inuit Housing Program," co-developed "by Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, has not done much of a hopeful thing."</seg>
<seg id="37">We would also like to congratulate Mamilaaq Qaqqaq for winning the medal.</seg>
<seg id="38">"As a member of the Fourth Legislative Assembly, he will need the support he needs to be heard."</seg>
<seg id="39">Let's just give the people of Nunavut an opportunity and support.</seg>
<seg id="40">"Qaqqaq won two awards, Leona Aglukkaq and Megan Pizzo-Lyall."</seg>
<seg id="41">I hope that the two parties do not lose sight of what they have lost and continue to serve Nunavummiut and the North.</seg>

<seg id="2">"When I look at my colleagues, we can certainly make a decision on the $80 million that could be used"</seg>
<seg id="3">"Joelie Qaunaq, the MLA for Amittuq, was one of the MLAs in the Nunavut legislature who were asking the government about the $80 million expansion of the Iqaluit- and Iqaluit-based Meadowbank Project."</seg>
<seg id="4">Some Nunavut MLAs are asking for an unspecified contribution to the expansion of the Nu-Iqaluit Weber Project.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Last August, the federal government committed $151 million to the project, which was targeted at 1,700 square kilometres of Weber Avenue in Nuuk, Greenland, through the Qikiqtaaluk region to Iqaluit."</seg>
<seg id="6">From that point on, it will be shipped to Kimmirut.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The Government of Nunavut will develop the framework and initiate the project, which will be completed by 2023."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Last year, MLAs approved the project, which cost $126 million."</seg>
<seg id="9">"" After that year, we were informed that the project's cost had gone up in line with the cost of living increases and that it was now estimated at $209 million, "John Main, MLA for Arviat North-Whale Cove, said in a member's statement on Wednesday, Oct. 23."</seg>
<seg id="10">"This is a $80 million difference, Maine said."</seg>
<seg id="11">"" When I look at my colleagues, we can make a good decision on the value of $80 million, "Maine said."</seg>
<seg id="12">The federal contribution comes from the Small Communities and Northern Communities Fund to the Investment Canada Plan.</seg>
<seg id="13">The project is now before the legislative assembly's review of the main estimates for 2020 / 21.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Later in the day of question period, Joelie Qaunaq, MLA for Amittuq, asked Quassa Kusugak, the Minister of Community and Government Services, about the $80 million increase before the government plans to do business."</seg>
<seg id="15">"This process, as outlined in the Government of Nunavut's Strategic Investments Program," aims to ensure that the project has a clear understanding, as well as access to information related to development, timely cost estimates and timelines, prior to the start of the capital planning process. ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" Has it been done prior to the planning, yes or no? ""</seg>
<seg id="17">Invitational question to Ms. Kusugak.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The planning is done and they're still trying to figure out how much it would cost.</seg>
<seg id="19">"When we were informed, we found out it was going to be a lot more expensive," Kusugak said. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"Main, who sits beside me as the chair of the legislative assembly, is standing up to ask more questions to Ms. Kusugak."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Can the minister tell us how this huge project has gone up over the course of the year?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"Ms. Kusugak added that after the budget was approved last year, the department re-looked at the project and the cost of the project increased after the review."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Ms. Kusugak added that, in May of 2019 her department felt that her funding proposal would have to increase to $201.6 million" to maximize the amount of federal funding available for the project if necessary. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"The next day, on Oct. 24, Maine rose again during question period to follow up with Finance Minister George Hickes on the same topic."</seg>
<seg id="25">"" Under the Financial Management Board, what steps were taken and what steps were taken to inform the department of the $80 million cost increase in this spending process? ""</seg>
<seg id="26">Main is asking.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Hickes said that in addition to the federal funding expansion project, and in addition to a well-supported marine research centre, the Government of Nunavut has also increased its contribution."</seg>
<seg id="28">"The Department of Community and Government Services resubmitted it to the Financial Management Board for this reason when they found out that the expenditures were too low."</seg>
<seg id="29">"Hickes also said the Government of Nunavut contributed half (25 per cent) to the project, while the federal government contributed 75 per cent."</seg>
<seg id="30">"" As the Government of Nunavut, we don't have to pay $80 million at all, and we would have to pay 25 per cent of that. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"Nunavik needs its own federal law enforcement agency, says Makivik president"</seg>
<seg id="2">Charlie Watt 's election calls for federal government to change</seg>
<seg id="3">"Charlie Watt, the president of Makivik Corp., issued a news release on Oct. 22 after a federal election, saying Nunavik needs its own federal law enforcement agency."</seg>
<seg id="4">By Elaine Anselmi</seg>
<seg id="5">"Makivik President Charlie Watt did not change his statement on Nunavik's legal standing during a ceremony announced by the incoming MLA, Sheppard Peck."</seg>
<seg id="6">"" We will be looking at the Electoral Boundaries Commission to make sure that this is understood, in other words, that Nunavik has its own political party that is geared towards our territory, which is particularly encouraging now given our independence process, "she said."</seg>
<seg id="7">"We need that as a provincial jurisdiction."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Abbey James Pan-Nunavik is the largest federal political project in Quebec, ranging from Nunavik's south to the La Vol-Orr region, where there are about four in six 2019 federal candidates living in the region, including Barbie to the Black Quebec region."</seg>
<seg id="9">Nunavik's leaders have chosen to form their own government in their homeland since 1972.</seg>
<seg id="10">"In 2002, the Kativik Regional Government, along with Makivik, went to the federal electoral district commission on this issue and reappeared in 2011."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Since then the division has been expanded in 2013, adding two more communities in the south."</seg>
<seg id="12">"The regions were re-designed, through the commission, to ensure that the population was balanced."</seg>
<seg id="13">"In Quebec, which has a population of 100,000 people in the region, the population of Abbe-James-Nunavik is less than 85,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="14">"While Nunavik's population was around 13,000, Nunavik was far below that of Nunavik, but its leaders have complained about Nunavik's independence from the region."</seg>
<seg id="15">"The smallest federal jurisdiction is Labrador, which has a population of approximately 26,000 people, while Newfoundland has a population of about 80,000."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Barbie won the Northern Quebec seat, picked by more than 11,000 people, or 40 per cent, behind the Liberal and Conservative candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Watt said he celebrated Green Party candidate Kahra Kahan-Wattley, an Inuk from Kuujjuaq, who will be the fifth elected candidate in more than 1,000 seats."</seg>
<seg id="18">"In his speech, Watt welcomed Peck to Nunavik to visit him as soon as possible."</seg>
<seg id="19">"" I look forward to coming together, and I appreciate his support for self-determination, as well as issues such as the implementation of the United Nations Act on the rights of Indigenous peoples, "Watt said."</seg>
<seg id="20">"There was a lot of news for Black Quebec President Evans Francois Blanc, who won 32 seats in Quebec."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" We expect us to support our development projects in Nunavik - through legal and economic development - and to be able to create a legal framework for a fair working relationship, "said Watt."</seg>
<seg id="22">"" However, in the spirit of Quebec's independence, Inuit have long contributed to the national unity. ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"Watt organized the election, although the Liberal Party does not have a seat in the current government, to allow the various parties to come together and meet with the rest of Canada."</seg>
<seg id="24">"" Justin Trudeau has a strong government that does not have a seat, and he can work with other parties (political parties) - NDP, Black Quebec, Green, Conservative and Independent candidates - to pass legislation and bring it to the legislature, and to work on bringing it together, "he said."</seg>
<seg id="25">"For Nunavut's newly elected MP, Mamilaaq Qaqqasiq of Baker Lake, he expressed some hope."</seg>
<seg id="26">"" I remember the NTI meeting in Baker Lake in 1871 with Tagak Curley, "Watt said."</seg>
<seg id="27">"At that time we were young.</seg>
<seg id="28">"They will do a good job, Mannilaq, and I look forward to seeing you and working together as Inuit strive for self-determination at the same time, for generations to come." "</seg>

<seg id="2">"" For Inuit, you would save money on the high rates of lung cancer ""</seg>
<seg id="3">The aircraft for emergency management at Nunavut's Lightstone Airport is parked at Iqaluit's airport this summer when it hosts a number of flights.</seg>
<seg id="4">"In some years, when children suffer from lung cancer (RSV, respiratory illness), they have to be sent out, which leads to the use of aircraft and medical travel."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Dr. Anna Banerjee and her fellow teachers at the University of Toronto's School of Health went to school in 1989 for the first time this year through Changen.org at the end of September, and to have more than 1,000 signatures from those who agreed to it."</seg>
<seg id="6">"But when this announcement was finally published, there were 23,322 names put together - and now they want to reach 25,000 signatures."</seg>
<seg id="7">The announcement said the Government of Nunavut would protect dozens of deaths and reduce the need for health care for infants by implementing a health protection program called Pavilion for all infants under six months of age.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Pavilion is a health protection program, though it's not a vaccination program, and it's a marketing campaign called SeanÃ©."</seg>
<seg id="9">"It has been pointed out that in infants with lower lung health rates starting with RSV, a summary of the" RespectEd virus, "which leads to lower blood pressure, and leads to serious health problems in what is known as bronchitis."</seg>
<seg id="10">"But Dr. Michael Patterson, the chief medical officer of health in Nunavut, told Nunatsiaq News in an interview that the Government of Nunavut contributes 11 per cent to 12 per cent of babies under the age of 2."</seg>
<seg id="11">"" We use it more for infants at risk for RSV, and for those who support the world's submission to the RCMP, "she said."</seg>
<seg id="12">"These include infants born to babies, under 35 weeks of pregnancy, or babies with chronic lung disease or heart disease."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Bennett, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Toronto's Institute of Pharmacy, has published a curriculum over the last 15 years on the prevalence and cost of RSV in the Arctic."</seg>
<seg id="14">"According to the study, she is not satisfied with the current Nunavut policy and says all Nunavut infants must receive this health protection."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Dr. Anna Bennett, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Toronto's Institute of Pharmacy, said in a recent study that if Inuit infants were to receive a vaccination program called Pavizomib, it would have a significant impact on their lives and finances."</seg>
<seg id="16">Nunavut's cost estimates are crucial</seg>
<seg id="17">She said in her research that RSV is a permanent and multifaceted disease that will result in multiple air and medical travel for Nunavut's health care providers.</seg>
<seg id="18">"The cost of health care is high: about $5,600 per prescription."</seg>
<seg id="19">"But despite that cost, Banerjee and many others believe that this is a price cut."</seg>
<seg id="20">"This is because Nunavut suffers from a high rate of cancer and emergency medical travel is the most efficient, responsive service."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" We have done a lot of cost analysis that has shown that if we put more in the North, we would save money, "she said in an interview."</seg>
<seg id="22">"The cost analysis, published in 2013, found a significant number of lung cancer among Kitikmeot infants: a rate of 389 out of 1,000."</seg>
<seg id="23">"In their study, which took place from January 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010, they found that the cost of living in the health centre reached $57,535."</seg>
<seg id="24">"In the Qikiqtani region, lung cancer among infants occurred in 2002 from 1,000 infants and in the Kivalliq region, 230 out of 1,000 infants."</seg>
<seg id="25">This means the Government of Nunavut spent $5.9 million on sicknesses in the Qikiqtani region and roughly $5.7 million on the Kivalliq region for infants, which was the result of the study.</seg>
<seg id="26">"However, as it stands, the Kivalliq had the highest percentage of lung cancer patients: $63,686."</seg>
<seg id="27">"" For Inuit, it's less economical, because of the high rates of lung cancer, "she said."</seg>
<seg id="28">Supervisor of Ontario Nurses Support Registration</seg>
<seg id="29">"Inuit infants are ten times more likely to be treated at the health centre for lung cancer than" vulnerable "infants and the disease is even more severe than it is.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Even though this is a serious problem, Inuit infants in Nunavut do not receive health care," Gladue wrote in her submission. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"This is also the case for professionals identified in the Northern School of Health, the Canadian Medical Association and the National Institutes of Health for Indigenous Peoples."</seg>
<seg id="32">But healthy babies in Nunavut who have completed their babies do not receive this health protection - even if they come from vulnerable communities other than Iqaluit and suffer from lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="33">Banerjee says that's the wrong way to do things.</seg>
<seg id="34">"I have been working very hard.</seg>
<seg id="35">I have shown them to the public.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Carolyn Bennett, Jane Weber, has seen what I have written and said it's credible," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="37">Nunavik vaccination for all infants</seg>
<seg id="38">"And she explained, not only in Nunavut, that health care providers in Nunavik have donated the Pavilion to all infants over the past three years."</seg>
<seg id="39">"In the Nunavut legislature on Oct. 18, Health Minister George Hickes said in response to questions from Iqaluit-Niaqunnguu MLA Pat Angnakak, that the Government of Nunavut should take a close look at Nunavik's situation."</seg>
<seg id="40">"" We're monitoring the project, "said Hickes."</seg>
<seg id="41">Arnakak said the RSV (RSV) has a devastating effect on families.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" Just recently, I know the baby had to be sent to the health centre for RSV and it had a big impact on the family, especially when the baby was too young. "</seg>
<seg id="43">But Hickes defended the Government of Nunavut's current system and said it was not the government's intention to save money by only providing it.</seg>
<seg id="44">"This is not a legal or policy decision on the cost.</seg>
<seg id="45">"It depends on the best health care system," Hickes said. "</seg>
<seg id="46">Patterson repeated Nunavik's success three years ago when it started with infants under six months old.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" We're still waiting for that figure, and if we find out that it's not going to cost us money to use the RCMP, then we would put that in place very quickly, "Patterson said."</seg>
<seg id="48">"But in his view, there is still not enough concrete evidence to implement it in Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="49">"" There are two things that I don't agree with in the petition and the other one is that there is evidence that this has been done, or that there is scientific evidence for that. "</seg>
<seg id="50">"There are a lot of people who still have questions," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="51">The use of the RCMP in Nunavut has been a long time coming.</seg>
<seg id="52">"In 2008, the Government of Nunavut refused to participate in the wind farm inspection of RSV, even when officials from Greenland, Nunavik and the Northwest Territories refused to participate."</seg>

<seg id="1">Iqaluit welcomes new fire chief</seg>
<seg id="2">"To me this is a bit of a fun exercise"</seg>
<seg id="3">Gord Howard became Iqaluit's fire chief two weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Since then he has been reading and doing a lot of research, but he said his new job is something he can do more."</seg>
<seg id="5">(Photo by Justin Rudd)</seg>
<seg id="6">"When Gordon Howard attended the city council's first meeting on Oct. 22 when he became president of the fire department, he didn't expect to be interviewed."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Do you support the Montreal Canadians?"</seg>
<seg id="8">Asked by Member Joanasie Akumalik.</seg>
<seg id="9">"After a while of silence, Howard replied," No. ""</seg>
<seg id="10">They're here laughing all the time.</seg>
<seg id="11">"A week later, in an interview with Nunatsiaq News, Howard said," That's why I decided that my clients would not be heard. ""</seg>
<seg id="12">"Hubard, who grew up in Hamilton, came to Iqaluit through our mayor, Ontario, in the community of Kaliningford near Georgetown Bay."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Even though he has been here for a long time, he has also lived in the Arctic."</seg>
<seg id="14">"For 10 years as an emergency health officer for the Canadian Rangers, he lived in a tent near Arviat in the middle of the winter."</seg>
<seg id="15">"" So I understand in the snow, I understand it's cold, but it's also something that has to be done. "</seg>
<seg id="16">He has always wanted to live in a different world and that's why I brought him here.</seg>
<seg id="17">"And the department is in a very good state," said Howard, referring to the Iqaluit fire department's collection - some of them are very professional firefighters and some of them are just volunteers. "</seg>
<seg id="18">That's the only thing that Howard didn't bring to Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="19">As part of their experience with the fire department and emergency management - where there are hardly any other cases - it was also due to the high frequency of fires in Iqaluit.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" The history of the department is staggering, "said Howard."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" There's a lot of work going on here, and there's a lot of work going on there. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"The activities of the department are, and now Howard, the new one in that area, from water problems and lack of support, to the fires and the fire hall is too small."</seg>
<seg id="23">"We can't change this overnight and there seems to be a lot of changes that we don't want to make overnight.</seg>
<seg id="24">"If we continue to move forward and not backwards I would be very happy," said Howard. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"" For me, it's a very exciting project. "</seg>
<seg id="26">"It's a pity, we're trying to do what we know and we can do what we know now." "</seg>
<seg id="27">"As for the first question of the city being appointed director of emergency management, I'm a Toronto assistant," said Howard with a smile. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"It's good to see some of the people who support the fire hall in Toronto.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I brought a flag, so we will be able to show them in our cars if they win Stanley Cup in the next 20 to 30 years." "</seg>

<seg id="1">Neglected bedbugs have become a concern for Nunavik patients going to Montreal</seg>
<seg id="2">The hotel manager says they do inspections but they haven't found any</seg>
<seg id="3">This is just something you don't want to see in your living room: a bedbug.</seg>
<seg id="4">"But in recent years, bedbugs have been seen at the QuÃ©bec Boarding Home where patients from Nunavik stay at their boarding home when they travel to the city."</seg>
<seg id="5">The sight of bedbugs at Nunavik's boarding home during medical travel to Montreal is of particular concern to patients and their families.</seg>
<seg id="6">This photo shows a bedbug in the bed that Cecilia Toochka saw last month in her mother's living room at the Qualifier Hotel in Kirt T. Lees Duvalle.</seg>
<seg id="7">(Photo courtesy of Cecilia Tuchukka)</seg>
<seg id="8">"In mid-October, Cecilia Kotierk was visiting her mother at the Qualifier Hotel in Kirt Lees Duval, where she was very scared: she saw a bedbug under her bed, and she took a picture of it."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Kochka's observation of the bed Komak told a patient from Nunavik by a security guard at the Uuluvik Boarding Home, in which there are a number of rooms, 39 in total, on the first floor when it is full."</seg>
<seg id="10">Kotierk called her mother and told her she would never be there again.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The hotel's president, Sadiq Abdus Noah, told Nunatsiaq News last week that he was looking after the bedbugs in the bed."</seg>
<seg id="12">"This was a recent case where, in the midst of a series of investigations, and with a biochemist's report, they were unable to find it."</seg>
<seg id="13">"One room study found that there was a bedbug in the bed, but they are no longer there."</seg>
<seg id="14">Abdus Noah also posted an email that showed survivors who saw the bedbugs in the bed.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Due to the importance of the Uuluvik Boarding Home operation, Abdus Noah said all rooms were worked on this year and are regularly inspected and dealt with if necessary."</seg>
<seg id="16">Nunatsiaq News was unable to communicate with Nunavik's entire community health committee or the Murdoch du QuÃ©bec who deal with Nunavik's health centre in Montreal on bedbugs and what to do about it.</seg>
<seg id="17">The MNQ has sent out their concerns in an email to Abdus Noah.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" It appears that the people who stay at the boarding home are seeing bedbugs and they don't want to stay at the hotel, "wrote George Delilah, president of Ublivik on Oct. 16."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Can I get an update on what is and how and when the problem will be resolved?</seg>
<seg id="20">We have to let the patients know that the bedbugs were taken care of. "</seg>
<seg id="21">Ublivik takes care of patients clothing / condoms before they enter the facility.</seg>
<seg id="22">There are bedbugs in Montreal: due to a lack of bedbugs, government offices were forced to shut down at the CombleGei-Fahreau last month.</seg>
<seg id="23">"And if there were bedbugs in the North, that wouldn't be the first time, as they did in 2010 in Winnipeg."</seg>
<seg id="24">"The bed's bedbugs are horrible: they are small, but they do not make it easy for them to eat, drink and hide after they have caught the skin."</seg>
<seg id="25">These bedbugs have been exposed to cold blood so that the blood can no longer be thick and can no longer be sensitive to the environment.</seg>
<seg id="26">"On the other side of the tunnel, the bedbugs pump in the blood, sometimes for five minutes, after they melt, they start looking for red blood and they want a shower."</seg>
<seg id="27">"The bedbugs eat within five to ten days and can live a full year, in areas ranging from the bottom to the bottom, to the bottom of the bed and other hot, dark and exposed to the food they want to eat."</seg>
<seg id="28">"The good news is that the bedbugs don't stay in a cold climate, so they end up sleeping and dying."</seg>
<seg id="29">So you can kill your bags outside for more than two days if you don't have any heat.</seg>
<seg id="30">"To avoid bedbugs while out on the land, check out the head of the house, look at the bottom and don't put your bags in bed."</seg>
<seg id="31">"And when you go home, wash your clothes before they get into the room and check your bags to make sure they don't have any bedbugs."</seg>
<seg id="32">"If you see a bedbug in a Montreal hotel, you can call 311 cities for problems."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Inuit have to be involved in the process.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It has an impact on all Inuit lives," said NTI president "</seg>
<seg id="4">"Representatives from Igloolik and Pond Inlet are listening to Aluki Kotierk, Nunavut Tunngavik Inc., in a motion to halt the NIRB's final hearing on Baffinland's project 2 expansion on Wednesday, November 6 in Iqaluit."</seg>

<seg id="6">By Emma Tranter and Elaine Anselmi</seg>
<seg id="7">"The NIRB's hearing on Baffinland Iron Mines Corp. 's proposal to expand the Mary River mine was abruptly adjourned, with two more days of hearings in Pond Inlet cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="8">"On Wednesday, November 6, NTI President Aluki Kotierk passed a resolution calling for an immediate halt to the final public hearing and that the hearing will continue for eight months to a year."</seg>
<seg id="9">A quiet speech was heard by a group of witnesses who looked at each other, with members looking at what Baffinland would do about the situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Baffinland's team had a good stop on their face, sometimes pulling their feet and turning their backs on the table when Kotierk made his motion."</seg>
<seg id="11">"We are concerned that the public hearing will be completed without the results of the strategy.</seg>
<seg id="12">People need to be heard and have a good conversation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Anybody here would like to understand all the things that are being said and how it would affect NTI and the organizations," Kotierk said while the chamber is full of people who want to talk about it and the people. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"It has an impact on all people's lives," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"The motion was introduced on the fifth day of the hearing in Iqaluit, just before the hour was over."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Nunavut Impact Review Board's first agenda was set to proceed with a hearing in Pond Inlet to allow the community to participate on Nov. 8 and 9.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The Nunavut Impact Review Board approved NTI's motion, which cancelled the meeting and cancelled the Pond Inlet meeting."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Over the course of the week, Baffinland's representatives have repeatedly expressed their plans to build a railway north of Mary River to the Mary River port."</seg>
<seg id="19">"With the railway and other parts of the port, it would make it easier for the company to produce more than the current six million tonnes of iron ore a year that produces up to 12 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="20">"But the most notable thing in the week is that Baffinland's proposal to amend its project permits to remove its disclosure limits and to create a limited export ban, 20 times the length of the railway and 176 cruise ships a year."</seg>
<seg id="21">"The motion to adjourn the meeting was supported by all those who wanted to have a say, many of whom expressed concern about the complexities of the project."</seg>
<seg id="22">"P.J. Akeeagok, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association's president, told Nunatsiaq News that he believes the Nunavut Impact Review Board is working to ensure that" Inuit have the opportunity to ask questions on these issues "and that it" provides an opportunity for residents to voice their concerns on an ongoing basis. ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"Akeeagok also said the motion was not expected, but it was well prepared on the last day of the meeting."</seg>
<seg id="24">Baffinland officials look at Kotierk's motion to ban the ban.</seg>
<seg id="25">"I think there are too many questions that haven't been resolved yet.</seg>
<seg id="26">"In my view, if you are going to make a decision about your future, then you have to be informed and make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="27">There was not enough here. "</seg>
<seg id="28">Representatives from the North Baffin communities also unanimously approved the resolution.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" It requires more attention and research, "said Amanda Hanson Main, a researcher at the Mittimatalik Hunters and Trappers Organization."</seg>
<seg id="30">He said the project "may have serious implications for our values and our people and our international standing."</seg>
<seg id="31">"Some participants in the table said they were not satisfied with the Mary River project, and they just wanted Baffinland to continue its work in Nunavut, but they had too many questions and concerns about the proposed expansion."</seg>
<seg id="32">"" What we hear is that it's too flooded and inadequate, "said Peter Ivalu, who represents the Hamlet of Igloolik."</seg>
<seg id="33">"All the information has to be translated.</seg>
<seg id="34">Everything has to be transparent. "</seg>
<seg id="35">"The Government of Nunavut also agreed with the motion, which points out that there is too much disagreement among those who want to have a say and that this is just a setback."</seg>
<seg id="36">"The Government of Canada also supported the resolution, but said the Nunavut Impact Review Board has the right to make a decision on how long the ban will take."</seg>
<seg id="37">"Through their legal team, Baffinland said they were opposed to the motion for a total of eight months and were opposed to the motion before it was announced."</seg>
<seg id="38">"" All of those who came to this hearing were ready to proceed as of November 2, "said Brad Armstrong, the lawyer for Baffinland."</seg>
<seg id="39">"No one said they didn't plan to start that day.</seg>
<seg id="40">No matter which topic was discussed, it was not possible to deter them from coming here. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"Megan Loehr, the deputy head of recycling for Baffinland, said the delay would have an impact on" immediate problems "with the project."</seg>
<seg id="42">"" But we will do everything we can to retain and protect 3,000 Canadians from employment, of which 476 are Inuit. "</seg>
<seg id="43">We have to know that Inuit will work with us.</seg>
<seg id="44">"We have to take the time to figure out what the potential problems are with the project," Dr. Hail said. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"While the Qikiqtani Inuit Association says it can't help in Phase 2, Akeeagok said it will continue to work on the Inuit communications project and the project's economic potential will remain limited."</seg>
<seg id="46">"We're not opposed to Mary River.</seg>
<seg id="47">We are working with them.</seg>
<seg id="48">We own the Inuit Nunangat.</seg>
<seg id="49">"We support Inuit employment," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="50">"We've spent a lot of money and a lot of work to make this project profitable for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="51">"So with that in mind, we have to find a balance."</seg>
<seg id="52">But there is none at this time. "</seg>
<seg id="53">Akeeagok also said the community's uncertainty about the railway's impact on our caribou is crucial.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" As an Inuk, these issues have a profound impact on our cultural rights. "</seg>
<seg id="55">"It was very clear to the elders that when they were here they were not only thinking about themselves, it's also a part of our future."</seg>
<seg id="56">That's one of the things I'm passionate about.</seg>
<seg id="57">"My decision right now is not only for now, but for the next generation."</seg>
<seg id="58">Do I leave them with a stronger foundation than I did before?</seg>
<seg id="59">"That's basically the basis of decision making, no matter what culture you have," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="60">"In its resolution, the Nunavut Impact Review Board provided an opportunity for interested parties to submit written submissions by way of Nov. 15."</seg>
<seg id="61">"From there, the Nunavut Impact Review Board will provide a written submission to the resolution and the length of time required to wait."</seg>

<seg id="1">Nunavut MLAs approve amendments to the Income Tax Act</seg>
<seg id="2">"Our government is working hard to bring back carbon pricing as a way of making money"</seg>
<seg id="3">"MLA Adam Main asked Finance Minister George Hickes about Bill 26, An Act to Amend the Income Tax Act, during the legislative assembly on Wednesday, November 6."</seg>
<seg id="4">Nunavut MLAs have recently updated Nunavut's Income Tax Act to amend the carbon tax.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The changes, which were read for the third time on Wednesday, November 6, included an increase in the personal allowance from $13,325 to $16,000."</seg>
<seg id="6">"This means that tax payers will make more than $3,000 a year before they have to pay the Nunavut Income Tax."</seg>
<seg id="7">"The other change is an increase in the cost of living tax from $1,200 to $1,500."</seg>
<seg id="8">"This means that if tax payers make more than $60,000 in their work they will receive an additional $300 in income taxes."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the territorial business tax rate for small businesses has dropped from 4 per cent to 3 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" Our government is working hard to bring back carbon pricing as a revenue source, "said Finance Minister George Hickes."</seg>
<seg id="11">"The federal government's proposed carbon tax came into effect in Nunavut on July 1, in an effort to make fuel prices more efficient - which would have increased by 5 per cent per litre - the Government of Nunavut introduced a carbon rebate program, which reduced fuel prices by 50 per cent."</seg>
<seg id="12">"In a speech on the proposed income tax reform, Nunavut MLAs agreed that carbon tax revenues must be returned to Nunavummiut."</seg>
<seg id="13">But there was no consensus on how best to do that.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Adam Lightstone, the MLA for Iqaluit-Manirajak, expressed concern that, with the reduction in income tax rates, the government would have to rely on carbon tax payments for government operations."</seg>
<seg id="15">"My understanding right now is that we need a lot of federal funding and our own revenues are only 10 per cent to 15 per cent of our total contribution.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We really need to use our own revenues to operate," said Lightstone. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"Why is the government trying to use the carbon tax to subsidize government operations?"</seg>
<seg id="18">"" The carbon tax rate that we're developing is only a fraction of what the Government of Nunavut has done and the company has tried to make it fit for our own carbon tax, "replied Hickes, adding," I don't think we're going to be satisfied if we just put the carbon tax in place for other revenues and don't get the money back from the consumer. ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Lightstone also said that an amendment to the Income Tax Act would be the best way to bring it back to Nunavummiut.</seg>
<seg id="20">"They also said that the carbon tax will go to the Government of Nunavut to ensure that it meets its intended purpose, reducing Nunavut's carbon footprint."</seg>
<seg id="21">"I'm very concerned about climate change and it's something that needs to be done now and in the future.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Having said that, I have brought forward some ideas for our government on how to develop or develop a strategy for Nunavummiut to reduce energy consumption," said Lightstone. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"Why is it that these ideas have not been considered and proposed to be used in the carbon tax system?"</seg>
<seg id="24">Hickes responded by saying each department - responsible for specific projects - is listening.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Some departments have been working with departments, including the Qulliq Energy Corporation, which is responsible for the development of renewable energy LEDs for all street lights in Nunavut, which was approved in advance of the meeting."</seg>
<seg id="26">"In 2019-20, the GN expects to raise $12 million in carbon tax payments."</seg>
<seg id="27">It would be broken down as follows:</seg>
<seg id="28">â¢ $2 million to the government for higher heating costs for public housing and government buildings, such as schools and health centres.</seg>
<seg id="29">â¢ $3.6 million for the new Nunavut carbon rebate.</seg>
<seg id="30">â¢ $6.2 million to be returned to Nunavummiut and Nunavut for work this year as a result of amendments to the Income Tax Act.</seg>
<seg id="31">But for Lightstone it's not a mathematical formula.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" When you look at a 50 per cent rebate from a fuel store and an additional 50 per cent of the carbon tax, why is there so little room for energy conservation activities? ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"Hickes responded that the federal government's rate of carbon tax increases each year over the next five years, and that while a 50 per cent reduction in fuel storage facilities will continue, the next year's increase in tax rates will generate more revenue for other projects."</seg>
<seg id="34">The bill received second reading on November 6 and received third reading that evening.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Even though that was the case, Lightstone, the other day his son told the legislature that he had only slept for three hours and got out."</seg>
<seg id="36">"In a subsequent email to Nunatsiaq News, Lightstone said he was not satisfied that he was going to vote on the legislation."</seg>
<seg id="37">"" I don't agree with the circumstances of Bill 26, so I don't think it's a perfect fiscal policy, "wrote Lightstone, who was going to make that statement in the House."</seg>
<seg id="38">"The purpose of the carbon tax is to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and propane from industry and to address climate change.</seg>
<seg id="39">"If this legislation includes energy related tax credits for individuals and businesses who want to save money, or if the Government of Nunavut had developed a strategy to help people purchase and develop energy efficiency programs, I would have been very pleased to have been able to approve the legislation." "</seg>
<seg id="40">Lightstone is not satisfied that the legislation was passed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Hickes said he is very interested in hearing ideas on how to use carbon tax revenues to reduce Nunavut's carbon footprint.</seg>
<seg id="42">"I strongly encourage the public to write a letter to MLAs or to the government with a view to the potential for action in this area."</seg>

<seg id="7">"The same people who came here spent a total of $271,383,000 on registration and travel costs."</seg>
<seg id="8">The report does not say how much has been spent other than travel.</seg>
<seg id="9">"On average, there were approximately 16,750 visitors from Nunavut who were non-residents from May to October 2015, according to that year's Nunavut exit survey."</seg>
<seg id="10">"The Qikiqtaaluk and Kivalliq regions were the most visited from July to September, 2018."</seg>
<seg id="11">"The Qikiqtaaluk region received a total of 95,600 visits, of which just over half (53.2 per cent) went to Iqaluit with a budget of $75.1 million."</seg>
<seg id="12">Pond Inlet and Pangnirtung are the second and third communities visited in the Baffin region.</seg>

<seg id="17">"The cruise ship operators spent $388,351 on community service, the report said."</seg>
<seg id="18">But the weather and ice conditions affected more than half of the ships that wanted to visit Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The department received a list of eight Inuit cargo operators with 23 passengers leaving the territory from July to September, 2018."</seg>
<seg id="20">"The ships brought 3,404 people together."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Just over half, at least 59 per cent of the cargo landed in Pond Inlet from Nunavut."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Iqaluit is the second largest cruise ship in Canada at 8.3 per cent, followed by Qikiqtarjuaq, which received 6.1 per cent and Grise Fiord at 5.9 per cent."</seg>
<seg id="23">"The cruise ship visitors to Pond Inlet did not only spend a total of $245,565, but these visitors were the most visited within 100 hours of the 189.5 hours of cruise ship visits in Nunavut, according to the report."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Cambridge Bay, Gjoa Haven, Kimmirut and Kugluktuk were not visited by cruise ships in 2018."</seg>
<seg id="25">"According to the report, both Cambridge Bay and Gjoa Haven were expected to receive seven visits, but both were cancelled due to weather."</seg>
<seg id="26">"The report noted that Cambridge Bay and Gjoa Haven had an impact on the cancellation of cruise ships, resulting in a total loss of about $25,000."</seg>
<seg id="27">"The information contained in the report came from the exit survey in 2018, which examined cruise ships operators and other visitors to Nunavut last year."</seg>
<seg id="28">"In 2018, the Government of Nunavut had to respond to community concerns from Pond Inlet and Clyde River about the number of cruise ships going out on the land."</seg>
<seg id="29">"In its report, the Government of Nunavut consulted with the Federation of the Arctic Research Vessel operators and all shipping companies to ensure that they did not go through this route."</seg>
<seg id="30">"It also said that while tourism is a private sector development, it requires government support for development."</seg>
<seg id="31">"In Nunavut, that means training and employment for Nunavummiut in the tourism industry."</seg>

<seg id="1">"Mary River: If it's an issue of wealth, let's make it a reality"</seg>
<seg id="2">MLAs should demand Baffinland's investment disclosure</seg>
<seg id="3">Participants sit in Iqaluit at Katannilik Hall on the fourth day of the Nunavut Impact Review Board's public hearing on Baffinland Iron Mines Corp. 's railway expansion proposal for Mary River.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Nunavut's approach to regulatory compliance with industry development, which began in 1993 with the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, has not been a work in progress except in a wide range of areas, ranging from environmental and social economic studies at the Mary River iron mine over the past decade."</seg>
<seg id="5">"This was posted in Iqaluit earlier this month, when the Nunavut Impact Review Board held its final public hearing on the $900 million railway expansion proposal from Baffinland Iron Mines Corp. for a sudden stop in confusion and uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="6">The final day of the seven-day meeting scheduled for Pond Inlet was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="7">"At the same time, with Baffinland costing billions, the multi-faceted iron ore mine is in a precarious state."</seg>
<seg id="8">"At the time of drafting this, the NIRB had yet to make a decision on a resolution from NTI that, if approved, would delay it from eight to 12 months."</seg>
<seg id="9">"And Baffinland Iron Mines Corp., the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, said it could not immediately support or approve a railway expansion."</seg>
<seg id="10">"But the Qikiqtani Inuit Association's Business Development Centre, the Qikiqtaaluk Corporation says it fully supports this project."</seg>
<seg id="11">Arctic Co-operatives Ltd.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is a complex process.</seg>
<seg id="13">"As for Baffinland, the vice-president of renewable energy, Megan Loehr, said the company is only concerned about the project's viability, saying," We will do everything we can to maintain and protect the Canadian population of 3,000 jobs, 476 of which are Inuit. ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"Last week, Baffinland told Nunatsiaq News that it had eliminated 490 southern contractors and 96 contractors from Inuit labour."</seg>
<seg id="15">That brings us to the biggest unanswered questions about the project: the Mary River project.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Baffinland says the mine's economic potential is uncertain unless regulators allow it to build a 110-kilometre railway to Milne Inlet and raise its production to 12 million tonnes a year, which would allow it to operate 176 times under the auspices of the Eskimo Sound."</seg>
<seg id="17">"The problem is, they haven't released a public report to help them out."</seg>
<seg id="18">"And more recently, more professionals stopped asking questions about it."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Last year, although there was nothing to show for it, it didn't stop the stakeholders from saying what they believed."</seg>
<seg id="20">"For example, in the summer and fall of 2018, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association activated the Baffinland Iron Mines Corp., protecting them from the NIRB."</seg>
<seg id="21">"On Aug. 31 of that year, the Nunavut Impact Review Board decided that the federal government would not approve an earlier and smaller year of production - from 4.2 million tonnes of iron ore to six million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="22">"So Baffinland and its partner, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, started a lot of work."</seg>
<seg id="23">"In a few weeks, a letter was sent to the chief negotiator, Dominic LeBlanc, then the federal minister of the Arctic, calling on the board to reverse its decision."</seg>
<seg id="24">Why?</seg>
<seg id="25">Money.</seg>
<seg id="26">"The Inuit organization said it is surprised that the Mary River mine's capacity, which will require significant donations and contributions, will cost more than $20 million under the new Inuit impact and benefit agreement."</seg>
<seg id="27">Ottawa agreed.</seg>
<seg id="28">"Given the Qikiqtani Inuit Association's concerns about funding for the mine, the federal government approved Baffinland's proposal last year."</seg>
<seg id="29">"" We are also concerned about the long-term viability of the Mary River mine and the knowledge of the Qikiqtani Inuit Association's concerns that the economic development project would be subject to a development proposal, "LeBlanc wrote in a September 30, 2018 letter signed by Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett."</seg>
<seg id="30">"In other words, the most important member of the public - the federal government - is committed to the importance and importance of economic development in this area."</seg>
<seg id="31">And they did that even though there was nothing in the budget to show for it.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Because if it's true that the project is not profitable, the MLA for the lord should be interested in seeing if what he says is true."</seg>
<seg id="34">"Throughout the Mary River project, Baffinland's staff - as required - must present a number of potential benefits to these environmental impact statements."</seg>
<seg id="35">"But in terms of the project's financial viability, I don't think the NIRB really wants to release a public registry."</seg>
<seg id="36">"For example, the Nunavut Impact Review Board has recommended that a lengthy financial statement obtained by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans in the Arctic" does not apply "and should not be made public on the board's public registry."</seg>
<seg id="37">(The document is still on our website.)</seg>
<seg id="38">The Nunavut Impact Review Board recommended that this document be used after it was released - and it was also removed from Baffinland's request.</seg>
<seg id="39">"By the way, Baffinland wanted to submit, individually, a shorter financial statement that said why Mary River could generate more revenue through a larger production."</seg>
<seg id="40">The desire to be independent may be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="41">At least Baffinland has made some changes to that.</seg>
<seg id="42">"In response, the NIRB made a different decision, which makes no sense."</seg>
<seg id="43">"If the federal government is going to make a significant investment, then the Crown Agency Council must also do so."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Of course, the Nunavut Impact Review Board and other regulators should try to get another piece of that kind of evidence."</seg>
<seg id="45">They have to be very committed.</seg>
<seg id="46">"As well as Baffinland's land lease, the Qikiqtani Inuit Association."</seg>
<seg id="47">"And while such concerns may arise elsewhere, the federal government should amend the federal legislation governing the Nunavut Impact Review Board's procedures, the Nunavut Planning Commission and the Program Review Act, to clarify how financial information must be handled in the future."</seg>
<seg id="48">"While there are still many unanswered questions about Baffinland's final expansion proposal, related to the railway's impact on caribou, the impact of cruise ships on whales, the project's lack of Inuit employment, and much more."</seg>
<seg id="49">"While many of the questions range from the Arctic Bay to the south railway proposal, which Baffinland approved in 2013 to build, and 18 million tonnes a year, it is not clear why Baffinland was asked to build in 2013 when it was allowed to produce 18 million tonnes a year."</seg>
<seg id="50">It is not yet clear why Baffinland has failed to implement this plan.</seg>
<seg id="51">But the biggest question is how this project will be sustainable.</seg>

<seg id="1">Child and Family Services Increase in Nunavik</seg>
<seg id="2">Healthy economy meets Quebec's promise</seg>
<seg id="3">Children and teachers were present at the Akausisarvik Early Childhood Education Centre in Hudson Bay in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="4">"At that time of the year the Quebec government added funding to support members of the children's group, based on family income."</seg>
<seg id="5">"On Nov. 7, 2019 all of those contributions were cancelled, with childcare costs set at $8.25 a day."</seg>
<seg id="6">(Photo courtesy of Nunaviks.nu.ca)</seg>
<seg id="7">By Elaine Anselmi</seg>
<seg id="8">"The economic restructuring in Quebec has resulted in additional funding for family and child services in Quebec, including Nunavik."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Quebec's economy was recorded at about 2.4 per cent in 2018-19, which is 0.6 per cent higher than previously thought."</seg>
<seg id="10">"In this case, Quebec's finance minister, Eric Jarrett, announced on Nov. 7 that $857 million will be used to meet the projected shortfall in previous years."</seg>
<seg id="11">Two major events will take place that have already been envy of the child welfare and child benefit system.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" The renewal of Quebec's economy and investment has demonstrated Quebec's success in this area, "Jarrett said in a news release."</seg>
<seg id="13">"The economic growth in Quebec provides us with an opportunity to reduce the deficit and deliver on the government's promises."</seg>
<seg id="14">"As for this program, Quebec is eliminating the additional funding for family childcare that was adopted by the former Philippe QuÃ©bec Liberal government in 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Through this program, an additional contribution to child care is made on top of the day's income."</seg>
<seg id="16">The subsidy was added to $15 a day for higher income earners.</seg>
<seg id="17">"For families who make less than $50,000, there was no increase in the subsidy."</seg>
<seg id="18">"The Nov. 7 news release will bring back Quebec's daycare fee of $8.25, which will no longer be used to pay for all income earners."</seg>
<seg id="19">This new funding in Nunavik will be used through the Kativik Regional Government program for Nunavik's child care system.</seg>
<seg id="20">"According to the Quebec news release, the new payment will be for this year, and the Montreal Post reported that it will be retroactive to January 1, 2019."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Next week, the head of daycare services at the Kativik Regional Government, Juli-Ann Peck, was not informed of how or when those payments would start in Nunavik."</seg>
<seg id="22">Premier Francois Lego's government first decided to slow down the process of phasing out additional funding and completely eliminate it by 2022.</seg>
<seg id="23">The sound economy and the recent budget surplus of $4 billion in the 2019-20 fiscal year is accelerating.</seg>
<seg id="24">"As well as removing the cost of childcare, the Quebec government is moving forward with a child benefit increase that was promised in 2021."</seg>
<seg id="25">"As of January 2020, the Quebec government said families in the territory will receive an increase of $779 a year."</seg>
<seg id="26">"This subsidy is tied to the basic income, with a minimum of $1,000 deductible to a maximum of $2,515 a year."</seg>
<seg id="27">"This new rule is about child equality, less that the Liberal party can afford to pay for a higher rate of child benefit than the oldest child."</seg>
<seg id="28">"" Today, we will complete the implementation of a wide range of programs to support Quebec residents, "Jarrett said."</seg>
<seg id="29">"We're getting more money back to Quebec at a faster rate."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Peter was respected for his commitment to providing services and environmental support"</seg>
<seg id="3">"The Sanikiluaq operation was erected in front of Nunavut's legislative assembly on Wednesday, November 20, on the evening, in the light of former MLA and former minister Peter Kattuk, who died in the morning of a long illness."</seg>
<seg id="4">"The Sanikiluaq community centre was erected on Wednesday, November 20 in front of the Nunavut Justice Centre in Iqaluit, in the opinion of Peter Kattuk of Sanikiluaq, who died this morning from a serious illness."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Kattuk, 69, a well-respected MLA, mayor and community leader at home, joined Nunavut in the early days of February 15, 1999, when voters in Hudson Bay voted for the first Nunavut legislature and held their first meeting on April 1 of the same year."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Peter Kattuk (left) accompanied Nunavut's former Commissioner Peter Irniq on April 12, 2000, when Kattuk was sworn in as Nunavut's minister."</seg>
<seg id="7">"At the beginning of the legislative assembly, Kattuk was appointed Minister of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth on April 12, 2000 to replace MLA Donald Havioyak, who resigned from his position."</seg>
<seg id="8">"On December 17, 2001, Kattuk was reappointed to his role as Minister of Community and Government Services, which he held until 2004."</seg>
<seg id="9">"And in 2004, Sanikiluaq voters again voted for Katannilik Hudson Bay, as an MLA until 2008."</seg>
<seg id="10">"" Peter was the representative of Hudson Bay for eight years on two terms and I send my condolences to his family, "Nunavut Speaker Simeon Mikkungwak said in a news release."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Born on June 2, 1950, Kattuk spent many years working in Sanikiluaq on environmental issues, serving as mayor and community leader."</seg>
<seg id="12">"In the early 1990s, he was a member of the Sanikiluaq Impact Review Board, which gathers local knowledge about the impacts of a massive hydroelectric project built in northern Quebec due to the impact of sea ice and sea ice on the Belcher Islands."</seg>
<seg id="13">That's the result of a report titled "Hudson Bay Voice: Traditional Knowledge for Inuit and First Nations in the Hudson Bay Area."</seg>
<seg id="14">"As mayor of Sanikiluaq, Kattuk also spoke out against the now-obsolete Kuujjuarapik hydro project proposal."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Following that, Kattuk was a member of the Nunavut and Hudson Bay Working Group, called the Nunavut Hudson Bay Interagency Working Group."</seg>
<seg id="16">"The organization, created by the Government of Nunavut, Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. and the Municipality of Sanikiluaq, is monitoring progress in the Belcher Islands on the second hydroelectric dam proposal, which has also been shut down since then, along with the rivers of Eastmain and Rupert River."</seg>
<seg id="17">"And in 1996, Kattuk was a member of the Nunavut Social Development Council, a body created in 1993 under the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Peter Kattuk speaks in the Nunavut legislature on February 19, 2008, at the end of his second term as MLA for Hudson Bay."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Koonoo Tattuinee, the president of Arctic Co-operatives Ltd., recalls Kattuk" s history, "and he completed the marine life of Shea Rhines of Sanikiluaq's food supply."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Paul Okalik, then Nunavut's premier, appointed Kattuk as minister of culture, language, elders and youth in April 2000, saying Kattuk introduced Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit before it was too much information."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" Peter was involved in the study of Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit long before that information was available, "Okalik said in a news release in April 2000."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Before he became prime minister in 2001, Kattuk was responsible for the" junk "that made him laugh."</seg>
<seg id="23">That's what happened when NTCL shipped gasoline to Nunavut and destroyed snowmobile engines in the Baffin and Kivalliq regions.</seg>
<seg id="24">"During his time in charge, Kattuk took a different approach: the Government of Nunavut's decision not to use NTCL and repurposed the supplier to Woodward's Group in Labrador."</seg>
<seg id="25">"He ran for re-election in October 2017, but he came in third place after Allan Rumbolt."</seg>

<seg id="5">A newly elected member of Nunavik's legislature wants to hear from Inuit leaders about their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="6">A member of the legislative assembly, Sheppard Barbie, won the Jaypeek-Jay-Nunavik nomination in the fall federal election with 37.7 per cent of the vote.</seg>
<seg id="7">"While Black Quebec members speak more French, he said he was looking for an Inuktitut interpreter to work with him."</seg>
<seg id="8">"" I want to be very clear about the needs of Indigenous communities, "she said."</seg>
<seg id="9">"So far, Barbie said she is aware of two critical urgent needs in Nunavik in the areas of health and housing."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Health care is a provincial jurisdiction, but it's a federal subsidy," said Barbie. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"In order to increase the level of health care funding, the federal government must consider how it allocates funding."</seg>
<seg id="12">Barbie has worked in the health care field for more than 30 years.</seg>
<seg id="13">"In the Black Quebec campaign, the party said the province needs 10,000 housing units over the next decade."</seg>
<seg id="14">"In this case, Barbie has been talking about a number of different designs," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"" If we want our new Liberal government to move forward, then we have to find a solution, "Barbie said."</seg>
<seg id="16">"This new member may not be seen in Nunavik, but he hopes to attend the next annual general meeting of Makivik, which will be held in March."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Following the election of Barbie, Makivik President Charlie Watt issued a news release inviting Peck to visit Nunavik as soon as possible."</seg>
<seg id="18">"" I look forward to meeting with you, and I welcome your support in our efforts to support and implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, "Watt said."</seg>
<seg id="19">A dialogue with Inuit leaders would help him in his role in helping Makivik achieve its goal of becoming a business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Barbie strongly supports Bill C-262, which would bring the country's law into line with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples."</seg>
<seg id="21">"There are two different pieces of legislation that would replace him, Ontario MLA Romeo Saggianas."</seg>
<seg id="22">"This was introduced in 2018, Bill C-262 was banned by Conservative Senators this spring but the Liberal government's representative in the Senate, Senator Peter Hunter, said if re-elected the Liberal government would have to implement the legislation."</seg>
<seg id="23">"" It is important for me to continue to work on Bill C-262 in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the work of my predecessor, Romeo Kagan, "Barbie said."</seg>
<seg id="24">"I will continue to support this project and I have committed to helping Romeo in the future strategy.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trudeau government 2.0: Don't expect too much</seg>
<seg id="2">"If you have a good idea don't expect too much"</seg>
<seg id="3">"Jane Weber, then Indigenous services minister on March 23, 2018, along with Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami President Natan Obed, said the federal government would eliminate Inuit Nunangat by 2030."</seg>
<seg id="4">Less than a year later he resigned as a federal councillor.</seg>
<seg id="5">Or did you find out during the federal election campaign that any of the leaders didn't really talk about the issues that are important to Nunavummiut and other northern regions?</seg>
<seg id="6">That's no surprise.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Most important legislators would like to think that the majority of Canadians, for the sake of the south, don't have enough votes to even talk about the Arctic that the majority of Canadians in the country have never heard of."</seg>
<seg id="8">"The Liberal government made this known, as they fell behind and released a long overdue northern and northern policy framework the day before the campaign began."</seg>
<seg id="9">"During the campaign, Indigenous issues, many of which brought northern concerns to the attention of the people, were also ignored."</seg>
<seg id="10">"With a new reduction in Justin Trudeau's government, and a board of directors sworn in for their role this past November 20, it is likely that they will continue to do so without much care."</seg>
<seg id="11">This is one of the indicators.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is because of a notable commitment to the North since the Trudeau government became prime minister in 2015: to eliminate at least 50 per cent (half) of tuberculosis cases in Inuit Nunangat by 2025 and completely eliminate it by 2030.</seg>
<seg id="13">"This included an initial contribution of $27.5 million over five years, which will be" settled "by four members of ITK."</seg>
<seg id="14">"But he was said to have smelled like a broken promise. From that point on, he was the TB eradication specialist for the federal government, Jane Weber, the former Indigenous services minister, said in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="15">He resigned from Trudeau's legislative assembly last March 4 after complaining about Trudeau's poor performance in Jody Wilson-Ripley.</seg>
<seg id="16">He did that less than four days before Trudeau was scheduled to come to Iqaluit to apologize for Canada's inappropriate treatment of people who had tuberculosis in the 1950s and 1960s.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Since then, they have been silent about the Arctic's tuberculosis epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Even though there was a lot of campaigning, there wasn't much to do with it."</seg>
<seg id="19">"And so far, the fight against tuberculosis has stalled."</seg>
<seg id="20">"For example, in Nunatsiavut, where tuberculosis rates between 2006 and 2016 were recorded at 248.5 people per 100,000, health officials surveyed only one community."</seg>
<seg id="21">"That's what happened in short, in 2018, when there was tuberculosis and there was a 14-year-old boy who died while he was in the hospital with Jane Johnson."</seg>
<seg id="22">"In Nunavik, 313 people were diagnosed with tuberculosis between 2006 and 2016, which was accompanied by tuberculosis in Inuit Nunangat, with 234 cases reported in the 100,000 cases."</seg>
<seg id="23">"But it appears that there haven't been any community surveys in Nunavik since 2018, when Wilbur made the announcement."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Indeed, in Nunavut there was a recent population survey after the tuberculosis outbreak, when Stephen Harper and our Conservative prime minister, long before Trudeau's Liberals were elected."</seg>
<seg id="25">"For Nunavut, there were about 670 people diagnosed with tuberculosis between 2006 and 2016, up from 171.8 out of 100,000 and there has been some work done on it."</seg>
<seg id="26">(One unaffected individual is Inuvialuit Nunatsiavut.)</seg>
<seg id="27">"At that time, there was no real TB reported between 2007 and 2016."</seg>
<seg id="28">Tuberculosis is a chronic disease due to a lack of resources.</seg>
<seg id="29">That's why it's often referred to as that.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it's true.</seg>
<seg id="31">"If people don't have enough food and adequate housing, tuberculosis can develop."</seg>
<seg id="32">"On the other hand, poverty in Cape Dorset, in which their 12-week tuberculosis screening program ended in May."</seg>
<seg id="33">In 2016 the unemployment rate was 27.3 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="34">"In 2015 the average income of people aged 15 and over was just over $18,933."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Of the 370 units, 120 units were in dire need of repair."</seg>
<seg id="36">"Under Canada's overcrowded housing system, 140 units of 370 units were deemed" unaffordable "under the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Act."</seg>
<seg id="37">This means that there is a lack of bedrooms based on the size of the population.</seg>
<seg id="38">There are also a small number of people in Canada who live in less subsidized housing.</seg>
<seg id="39">"It's no surprise that over the last 20 years, tuberculosis has been declared a crisis in Nunavut and other parts of the Arctic."</seg>
<seg id="40">And there is no hope that tuberculosis can be eradicated in these communities unless major changes have been made to increase the number of housing units and make them better.</seg>
<seg id="41">"But during the last election campaign, Trudeau's legislative assembly did not offer any public housing, only to reiterate its 2016 and 2017 budget commitments."</seg>
<seg id="42">"In this case, they can't even be blamed for violations of their language, nor did they have any concerns about what they said."</seg>
<seg id="43">"This is also a reflection of what has been done in Canada's national emergency management system, where tuberculosis rates in Inuit Nunangat are 300 times higher than those of non-Indigenous people born in Canada."</seg>
<seg id="44">"In Nunavut, it could be worse."</seg>
<seg id="45">Last year's report found that one in 100 infants born in Nunavut may suffer from this disease.</seg>
<seg id="46">"While they are not particularly concerned about the urgent nature of the disease, what concerns does Trudeau's Liberal government have about other issues, such as mental health, community housing, education and more?"</seg>
<seg id="47">"If you have a good idea, don't expect too much."</seg>
<seg id="48">"If you don't, prepare for a crash."</seg>
<seg id="49">"Please note: the number of cases of tuberculosis continues to rise from the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami's Inuit Tuberculosis Reduction Framework," released in November 2018. "</seg>

<seg id="24">Kuujjuaq MLA Jobie Takiapik hoped that these cameras would help people who have been in conflict with the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="25">"We hear from the RCMP about inappropriate activities and those who say they don't want to speak out.</seg>
<seg id="26">"The police are nervous," Takiapik said. "</seg>
<seg id="27">"The use of these body cameras is necessary."</seg>
<seg id="28">"He added that if only one or two police officers were not harassing Inuit, that's a big impact, and it's going to cause a lot of concern to the entire RCMP."</seg>
<seg id="29">"It is the view that these cameras, which take pictures of what the police are doing, can be used in the near future."</seg>
<seg id="30">Lenz said the cameras will be in effect in January.</seg>
<seg id="31">He added that the abuse and inappropriate actions will not only be offered to the RCMP.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" I just cancelled a police officer last week because of our program in Nunavik, "she said."</seg>
<seg id="33">"We don't want to have too many police officers in Nunavik."</seg>

<seg id="1">Close to Nunavut talks about renewable energy in the Arctic</seg>
<seg id="2">"Representatives from Greenland, Canada and the United States discuss ideas and findings"</seg>
<seg id="3">"Bruno Pereira, the president of the Qulliq Energy Corporation at the Arctic Empowerment and Communities Summit in Iqaluit, November 22, 2019."</seg>

<seg id="5">Renewable energy experts from the Arctic gathered in Iqaluit on Nov. 21 and 22 to consider and share their findings on the Arctic project.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Participants from Nunavut, the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, Greenland and the United States reported the drop in the number of cases involving different communities."</seg>
<seg id="7">"The gathering, called Optimism Operations, Interfering New Technologies and Engage Stakeholders (Enhancing Operations, Incorporating New Technologies and Engaging Stakeholders), was organized by American officials in partnership with the Government of Nunavut and the Qulliq Energy Corporation."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Bruno Pereira, the president of the Qulliq Energy Corporation, said the meeting brought awareness to each other of the problems."</seg>
<seg id="9">"" As for the use of renewable energy in our communities, we are very interested in what other jurisdictions do, and we will find out how well they have accomplished or fallen, "Pereira said."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Pereira also said that while it's important for representatives to get together to talk about fuel conservation, there are a lot of activities in Nunavut that are happening here in Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="11">"There are some communities that have access roads so there are not too many people in Nunavut communities.</seg>
<seg id="12">"But like most of us, there are challenges, in terms of space, being able to work in communities, so we can see similar challenges." "</seg>
<seg id="13">"Chris Roos, the executive director of renewable energy in Alaska, said the Alaska energy subsidy has been a boon to renewable energy development."</seg>
<seg id="14">"We have now been able to build 80 communities that have been able to use renewable energy in addition to diesel fuel.</seg>
<seg id="15">"So we think we know how beneficial this is," Roos said. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"This subsidy, designed to promote renewable economic development, also helps Alaska reduce its energy costs."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Roos said in northwestern Russia, the five communities are working together to develop wind energy and they are using it for energy."</seg>
<seg id="18">"" Now there is a consolidated knowledge of how to manage and manage wind energy and help each other in setting it up, "Roos said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"In Alaska, like Nunavut, home energy bills are high."</seg>
<seg id="20">Roos said the community is using wind energy not only for electricity but also for heating.</seg>
<seg id="21">"What they've done is put small heating systems in people's houses that are covered in diamonds that look like carpet.</seg>
<seg id="22">"When there is more wind, they go into the heat, and they have put in a small amount of data that can be collected from heat and energy providers," Roos said. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"" Due to the ability to keep the atmosphere warm, it can be kept warm. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"They can be shut off or burned in a home that is acceptable, and if they fail they can have alternative heating systems." "</seg>
<seg id="25">"But in Greenland, the installation of wind turbines has been difficult, according to News Corp's Eric Hague, a technical advisor for renewable energy in Nuuk."</seg>
<seg id="26">"Cold temperatures and high visibility make it difficult for wind farms in the south to use the Arctic," said Hague. "</seg>
<seg id="27">"Hague also said the two wind turbines were well designed in other parts of the north of Greenland, but they failed."</seg>
<seg id="28">"We can also say that in Greenland we have chosen a more realistic approach to resource development.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Even the two wind turbines were designed to test 200 different locations and the other one would be tested in 150 locations," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"One of the wind's arm fell, on the other hand, because the fuel was too thick for the cold and caused engine damage, Hague said."</seg>
<seg id="31">"During the 2019 federal election campaign, three political parties said the election of Nunavut's diesel fuel will be dissolved by 2030."</seg>
<seg id="32">"While it may take some time to develop a renewable energy program that will work in the Arctic, Hague said the reduction of fossil fuels is urgent."</seg>
<seg id="33">"" We have to do something to stop the use of fossil fuels, because of climate change, because there is something wrong with it now. "</seg>
<seg id="34">This is a legal matter because you have to have a fuel free program but you don't have any money.</seg>
<seg id="35">"It's a good job," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="36">Pirara said it is an interesting experience to talk to Nunavut's adjacent residents in the Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" I think that's something that needs to be looked at differently, to look at how we can move forward on recycling. "</seg>
<seg id="38">Some Inuit have taken advantage of the technology and have encountered problems in the south where they have been able to do so but they can't do it in the Arctic.</seg>
<seg id="39">"If we do become financially viable we will be able to track those problems," Parra said. "</seg>

<seg id="1">The Government of Nunavut must engage Inuit in the development of the Education Act: Nunavut Tunngavik Inc.</seg>
<seg id="2">"This is an important policy change that will affect thousands of Inuit parents and Inuit children in Nunavut"</seg>
<seg id="3">"Aluki Kotierk, president of Nunavut Tunngavik Inc., speaks during the Standing Committee on Legislation's consideration of Bill 25, An Act to Amend the Education Act and the Inuit Language Protection Act."</seg>
<seg id="4">"By Aluki Kotierk President, Nunavut Tunngavik Inc."</seg>
<seg id="5">Subject: Minister Joanasie's Letter to Nunatsiaq News on Bill 25</seg>
<seg id="6">"Minister Joanasie wrote a letter to Nunatsiaq News on Nov. 25, 2019 quoting from discussions between the Department of Education and Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. on Bill 25, indicating that these discussions were conducted in a spirit of mutual respect and offered NTI the opportunity to voice their concerns."</seg>
<seg id="7">The minister's view of encouraging NTI to participate in the public hearings and NTI's hearings is that the Government of Nunavut sees it as a working relationship with previous meetings.</seg>
<seg id="8">That's not the case.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Inuit have the right under Article 32 of the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement to participate in the development of social and cultural policies, as well as the development of social and cultural programs and services, including governance."</seg>
<seg id="10">It's a different kind of foundation.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bill 25 proposes to amend the Education Act and the Inuit Language Protection Act to provide for a framework for policies and the administration of Inuit language instruction.</seg>
<seg id="12">The fundamental change to the policy will affect many Inuit children and Inuit children in Nunavut.</seg>
<seg id="13">"In this case, Inuit have the right to participate in the development and development of the system."</seg>
<seg id="14">NTI did not have an opportunity to participate in the development of policy proposals outlined in the proposed Bill 25.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It's not just a violation of the government's mandate as outlined in the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, it's a history that demonstrates that the parties have reached the goal of implementing a strategy that better incorporates Inuit goals and objectives."</seg>
<seg id="16">"NTI has been working on legislation with the Government of Nunavut, such as the Inuit Language Protection Act, the Official Languages Act and the Wildlife Act."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Knowing that it can proceed, NTI informed the premier and the newly elected government to manage the collaborative and collaborative approach to Inuit priorities, including education, language and culture."</seg>
<seg id="18">"The Department of Education did not submit the proposed legislation to NTI until Aug. 31, 2018, in which the department submitted a list of planned community consultations."</seg>
<seg id="19">NTI had less than a week to review Bill 25 and prepare and prepare for the Nunavut consultation tour.</seg>
<seg id="20">That's not a working relationship.</seg>
<seg id="21">"The department coordinated the consultations with the right eye, and did not seek solutions or accommodations to address concerns raised by Inuit, NTI and other organizations such as the DEA (DEA) and the Coalition of Nunavut District Education Authorities (CDEA) were also present."</seg>
<seg id="22">"I encourage the Minister of Education to work with the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement to ensure that clear commitments are made under Article 32, and that the department must manage with due diligence, commitment and commitment and adopt the honour of the Queen when it comes to sharing with Inuit."</seg>
<seg id="23">"NTI's belief that a rewrite of the Education Act to allow for Inuit participation in the program must change the way the department operates, and in general recognition of Inuit rights," she wrote. "</seg>
