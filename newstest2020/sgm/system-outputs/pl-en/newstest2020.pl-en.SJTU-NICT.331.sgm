<seg id="1">Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in a white robe</seg>
<seg id="2">He is a charismatic.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Holy Mass celebrated by him for deliverance and healing attracts crowds.</seg>
<seg id="4">He was several years old when inexplicable things began to happen in his life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Today, through the Franciscan, others experience it.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Holy Masses celebrated by Fr Witko for deliverance and healing attract crowds</seg>
<seg id="7">He was once approached by the parents of a 7-month-old child who had a 7.5mm hole in his heart.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was to be operated on.</seg>
<seg id="9">Father Joseph Witko prayed over him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later that day, the boy was taken to hospital for a procedure.</seg>
<seg id="11">Astonished doctors ruled: "Surgery is not needed, the cavity is only 1.5mm."</seg>
<seg id="12">My parents were crying with happiness.</seg>
<seg id="13">After another prayer of the Franciscan, the hole disappeared completely.</seg>
<seg id="14">The clergyman began to experience the unusual actions of the Creator as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="15">In his dreams, the souls of purgatory came to him asking for help.</seg>
<seg id="16">I was awake at night and urged to pray for the dead and those who died at the moment, "he recalls.</seg>
<seg id="17">He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.</seg>
<seg id="18">And he had a vision of what was happening to a man who was committing mortal sin.</seg>
<seg id="19">'My body started to change.</seg>
<seg id="20">I lost my human qualities and started taking on the look of an animal, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="21">The invisible force lifted him up, he couldn't get his voice out of himself.</seg>
<seg id="22">He felt he was lost.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then God pointed out to him the rescue.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Immersed in the waters of the river symbolizing holy baptism, I was freed and returned to the human form...," he says.</seg>
<seg id="25">He didn't tell anyone about these strange experiences.</seg>
<seg id="26">The vocation matured in him.</seg>
<seg id="27">He was 16 when he joined the Franciscans.</seg>
<seg id="28">In his sermons, he wanted not only to talk about Jesus.</seg>
<seg id="29">He wanted people to experience Him alive.</seg>
<seg id="30">Members of the charismatic community of renewal in the Holy Spirit</seg>
<seg id="31">Many people participate in masses for healing celebrated by their father, who hope to get rid of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="32">The priest emphasizes, however, that their main goal is spiritual healing, not bodily healing.</seg>

<seg id="2">This afternoon (26th September) Kolping's FRAC team deservedly succumbed at home to the current Polish Darts champion Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki as part of the 3rd LOTTO Superliga Table Tennis.</seg>
<seg id="3">Yaroslavl, in the kind of personal juxtaposition they presented with the fortresses, has little chance of victories against the league's rulers.</seg>
<seg id="4">This was clearly shown by the duel with Dartom Bogoria.</seg>
<seg id="5">The team's leader, Chen Jingqi, is still missing.</seg>
<seg id="6">Perhaps with him in the squad, the Yaroslavs would reach for their third successive triumph of the new season.</seg>
<seg id="7">Young Asian Qiyao Han probably hasn't yet grown up to win over the likes of Greek Panagiotis Gionis and Czech Pavel Sirucek.</seg>
<seg id="8">Not even with one of the most promising Poles, that is, Marek Badowski.</seg>
<seg id="9">The player from Hellada was the biggest star of the match in the MOSiR hall at Sikorskiego Street in Jarosław.</seg>
<seg id="10">With both Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei, he was a class of his own.</seg>
<seg id="11">After three matches, Kolping FRAC led 2-1.</seg>
<seg id="12">Kou Lei probably edged Mark Badowski, and Daniel Górak after a thrilling five-set bout - Pavel Siruck.</seg>
<seg id="13">But then it was worse.</seg>
<seg id="14">Gionis gave Lea no chance.</seg>
<seg id="15">One could still hope for a two-point win, but Qiyao Han did not live up to Badowski.</seg>

<seg id="1">There will be no additional research for seniors.</seg>
<seg id="2">Why?</seg>
<seg id="3">As announced by Rafał Trzaskowski, a program of free preventive testing for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not received the approval of the Ministry of Health and its subordinate Agency for the Protection of Health Technology and Tariff.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the rationale, the agency explained that the target group had been mismatched.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The above actions may even result in detectability of individual disease units, which may contribute to exacerbating difficulties in accessing NHF benefits and negatively impacting the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort related to the falsely positive outcome of the research," it said.</seg>
<seg id="7">The decision of the ministry is not understood by the president of the capital.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The money is ours, we have predicted the money for it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only the government is afraid that if people examine themselves, they will go to the doctor later, which is absurd, because it is about bringing about a situation in which prevention can be done faster.</seg>
<seg id="10">All specialists know that this helps in terms of the burden on the health system, because it helps in the rapid detection of diseases and in a reliable approach to health.</seg>
<seg id="11">The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand, "said Rafał Trzaskowski.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It is hard for me to imagine that expert specialists say: Let us not examine ourselves, because there will be longer queues at the doctor, and if such specialists advise the government, I am not surprised that there is health care in such a state," the Civic Platform politician added.</seg>

<seg id="1">Palestine responds to Israel: We will break all existing agreements</seg>
<seg id="2">Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced Thursday at a session of the United Nations General Assembly that he would break any agreements reached with Israel if the country's future government tries to fulfill Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement to annex occupied Palestinian lands.</seg>
<seg id="3">"If the future Israeli government that is formed proceeds with the implementation of this plan, we will nullify all signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all commitments made," he announced.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We will reject the whole plan completely and completely," threatened Abbas with pressure.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It is our duty to defend all our rights by all means possible - not important what the consequences will be - by engaging completely in working towards the application of international law and in the fight against terrorism," declared the president of the Palestinian Authority, who had already made similar declarations in July.</seg>
<seg id="6">Netanyahu, Israel's former prime minister, was again given a mission to form a government after the Sept. 17 election.</seg>
<seg id="7">A week before the election, he announced that if he won it, he would announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and intend to include all Jewish settlements across the West Bank in Israel.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, led by Yasser Arafat at the time, signed a series of peace agreements under the auspices of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="9">Abbas, 84, also promised to hold a general election on Palestinian soil during the UN General Assembly session.</seg>
<seg id="10">The last took place in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="11">"On my return to the country, I will call local elections in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, and all those who oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community," the Palestinian president solemnly declared.</seg>
<seg id="12">Abbas also defended in his speech the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer at the United Nations, to exercise the powers afforded to "full members of the United Nations and all its bodies and institutions."</seg>
<seg id="13">The Palestinian leader concluded by calling on the international community to "compel Israel to comply in full respect of the provisions of the United Nations."</seg>
<seg id="14">Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas' speech, declaring that the Palestinian leader "prefers to focus at the United Nations on the Palestinian Authority's efforts against Israel rather than fight against calls for terrorism in the Autonomy under his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="15">Danon, however, as the agencies note, did not allude to Netanyahu's announced annexation of occupied Palestinian lands.</seg>

<seg id="1">PLN 105 million for video game companies from the National Centre for Research and Development</seg>
<seg id="2">Almost PLN 105 million of funding will go to companies from the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Friday, the National Centre for Research and Development announced the results of the third edition of the GameINN programme.</seg>
<seg id="4">Among the nearly 30 projects that supported the NCBR were, among others, the development of a platform for creating field games based on an AR game engine creating a map of the real world along with an application enabling data transmission by users; a test and training platform for verifying practical skills at the workplace and professional development using VR and AI technology; an innovative game simulating the management of real production processes using an innovative gameplay model based on the interaction of the virtual world with the real world using the concept of industry 4.0, according to the NCBR release sent to PAP on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="5">The aim of the GameINN sector programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game producers sector on the global market in the perspective of 2023.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the NCBR, today the Polish video game sector is growing at a rate of 10% per year.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 amounted to PLN 1.85 billion, while the forecast for 2019 is 2.23 billion.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The specially prepared GameINN research agenda and already reaching 300 million PLN support for entrepreneurs under this sector program provide an important impetus for further, dynamic growth of the Polish gamedev," reads the release.</seg>
<seg id="9">The video game industry is an excellent example of effective use of the potential we have in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The government's incentives for innovation-focused entrepreneurs, such as R &amp; D reliefs, competence improvement programmes, IP box or support programmes implemented by the NCBR drive innovation activities of companies and allow them to compete more effectively in a very competitive market," says Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the release.</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of the science ministry points out that money for innovation not only goes to innovators in the form of funding projects, but also stays in their pockets - three-quarters more entrepreneurs benefited from the R &amp; D relief in 2018 than a year earlier.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The amount of deductible costs related to R &amp; D activities amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, which resulted in over PLN 300 million of savings for companies benefiting from this relief.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is the equivalent of the support provided by the NCBR in three editions of GameINN, "emphasizes the deputy prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="14">Wojciech Kamieniecki, PhD, Director of the National Centre for Research and Development (NCBR), recalls that 78 innovative projects were awarded in two previous co-financing competitions with a total value of over PLN 211.2 million.</seg>
<seg id="15">The huge interest in the 3rd competition and the variety of applications submitted show that the video game industry has the ideas and competences to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Particularly gratifying is the fact that among the selected projects - as in previous editions - there are projects concerning solutions for not only entertainment, but also related to industry 4.0," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the third GameINN competition, entrepreneurs, consortia of entrepreneurs and consortia of entrepreneurs with scientific units could apply for funding of up to PLN 20 million.</seg>
<seg id="18">The NCBR received 87 applications for a total amount of PLN 317 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">The budget of the competition at the time of the announcement of the competition was PLN 100 million, but it was increased, thanks to which 27 projects were awarded almost PLN 105 million in funding.</seg>
<seg id="20">Detailed information about the results of the 3rd GameINN competition is available at ncbr.gov.pl.</seg>
<seg id="21">The GameINN sector programme is implemented within the framework of the Smart Development Operational Programme.</seg>
<seg id="22">NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to an initiative of entrepreneurs associated in the Polish Games Agreement, which includes companies such as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team and 11 bit studios.</seg>

<seg id="7">Players in the locker room have private safes at their disposal and the club area is monitored.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to AFP, Diaby-Fadiga eventually confessed to the theft.</seg>
<seg id="9">The 18-year-old has already apologised to Dolberg and his other teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.</seg>
<seg id="10">He also promised the Dane to return the money for his watch.</seg>
<seg id="11">Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most prospective footballers of the young generation in France.</seg>

<seg id="1">Iran president says he rejected proposal for talks with US, Donald Trump denies</seg>
<seg id="2">Tehran did not engage in talks with the US side during the UN General Assembly in New York, despite an offer by the Americans to lift sanctions, Iranian President Hassan Rowhani said on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">US President Donald Trump commented that it was the Iranian side that asked for the restrictions to be lifted, something he disagreed with.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Iranian President Hassan Rowhani, the Americans have proposed lifting all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for starting negotiations on a new international deal.</seg>
<seg id="5">It would regulate both Iran's nuclear program and its ballistic missile construction program.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rowhani: Iran will not engage in talks amid maximum pressure</seg>
<seg id="7">Iran's president said he had not agreed to engage in those talks because of the "toxic atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="8">He said he had met with American diplomats because he had succumbed to the urges of France, Germany and Britain.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, he insisted Iran would not engage in talks in an atmosphere of "maximum pressure."</seg>
<seg id="10">"And even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in the 5 + 1 format, no one is able to predict what the end result will be," Rowhani said.</seg>
<seg id="11">A day earlier, the Iranian leader said he was not ruling out talks with the US, and accused European parties to the nuclear deal of favoring US sanctions on Iran.</seg>
<seg id="12">He added that sanctions imposed on Iran following the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal "are a prerequisite that does not allow" dialogue to be established.</seg>
<seg id="13">If we can abolish this prerequisite and if America abolishes sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America, "he declared.</seg>
<seg id="14">He added that he did not rule out a meeting with US President Donald Trump, despite not agreeing to such a conversation in the past week during the UN General Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="15">Trump: 'Iran asked, I said no'</seg>
<seg id="16">Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that he was the one who rejected the Iranian side's request.</seg>
<seg id="17">'Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them so we could meet.</seg>
<seg id="18">Of course I said 'no!' "the US president tweeted.</seg>
<seg id="19">Tension with atomic deal in the background</seg>
<seg id="20">France, Germany and Britain are trying to ease tensions between Washington and Tehran to salvage in some form the 2015 Iran deal they were signatories to.</seg>
<seg id="21">It stated that in return for the lifting of economic sanctions, Iran would abandon its nuclear weapons construction program and that the nuclear sector would be placed under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).</seg>
<seg id="22">Since the US withdrew from the agreement in May 2015, the other signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to keep the agreement in place.</seg>
<seg id="23">For now, nothing has come of it.</seg>
<seg id="24">Washington uses tactics to put maximum pressure on Iran, and the sanctions also include a full embargo on Iranian oil.</seg>
<seg id="25">Tehran has announced that if it does not receive a permit to export the crude, it will limit its commitments, under the deal, every 60 days.</seg>

<seg id="1">A judge at the Provincial Administrative Court in Warsaw and husband of heiress Emilia, who - in her words and screenshots from WhatsAppa - participated in stalking against judges, was reinstated for ruling by the NSA on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="2">The reason: disciplinary proceedings have not been initiated against him, so there is no basis to uphold the order of the President of the Supreme Administrative Court Wojciech Mazur to remove him from his duties.</seg>
<seg id="3">Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary spokesman at the NSA, opened an investigation against Szmydt at the end of August, but it has not so far evolved into a proceeding against him.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though the NSA, which acts as a disciplinary court in such cases, must address the decision of the President of the JSC within a month of its issuance.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this situation, a judge who publicly talked about mental problems of his wife in order to discredit her, who due to suspicion of participating in the group was removed from the office of the National Court Register, will return to adjudication and will pass judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.</seg>
<seg id="6">Judge Szmydt denies his involvement in the heist group.</seg>
<seg id="7">He says there is no evidence of this except for falsified screenshots and the words of his wife, with whom he is divorced.</seg>
<seg id="8">Exactly the same is claimed by the other judges linked to "Caste": everyone is innocent, there is no evidence.</seg>
<seg id="9">And it's quite possible that they'll put on their own.</seg>
<seg id="10">Because the prosecution did not sneak its finger to secure evidence from their electronic media. It is also silent about the contents of Emilia Szmydt's phone, which was stopped by the phone in June in another case.</seg>
<seg id="11">The police did not tip their finger to secure the devices of people whom Judge Waldemar Żurek pointed out as persecutors in a report in February.</seg>
<seg id="12">There is no evidence - there is no case for Szmydt, there is no case for "Kasta."</seg>
<seg id="13">Nor is there a case by the head of the NIK Marian Banasia for renting the tenement to the basement and hiding the proceeds.</seg>
<seg id="14">The CBA checks his property statements.</seg>
<seg id="15">And he'll check when he checks.</seg>
<seg id="16">And the Commission of the Parliamentary Ethics will not deal with the Banas because the Sejm is suspended (but the Commission of State Control somehow came together to make a bizarre decision to dismiss Banas' deputies and appoint him as the acting lawyer, although the law does not provide for such a strange combination).</seg>
<seg id="17">The whole thing reminds me of a film novella, American probably, about how a wife comes home and finds her husband with his lover in bed.</seg>
<seg id="18">She is so amazed and devastated that she can't shout a word.</seg>
<seg id="19">She stands in the door speechless, and during that time her lover quickly pops out of bed, dresses up and walks out.</seg>
<seg id="20">And the husband shall cloth the bed.</seg>
<seg id="21">When the wife regains her voice and shouts: what is it supposed to be?</seg>
<seg id="22">Who is this woman?</seg>
<seg id="23">My husband quietly asks: what woman, darling?</seg>
<seg id="24">Only that in the case of 'Kasta' or Banasia there is a parody of the state.</seg>
<seg id="25">And that's not funny at all.</seg>

<seg id="9">'There were strange, distressing symptoms with me and I reported myself to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="10">It came out that I had jaundice.</seg>
<seg id="11">But the worst was in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the examination was done with a CT scan it was found that I had pancreatic cancer..., "the Prime Minister's father said.</seg>
<seg id="13">A few days later, Kornel Morawiecki underwent a major operation at the Ministry of Interior hospital in Warsaw.</seg>
<seg id="14">As Morawiecki said, president Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain priest Zbigniew Kras to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="15">The operation lasted about three hours and was successful.</seg>
<seg id="16">'I know many people prayed for me for which I thank you so much.</seg>
<seg id="17">Luckily, I don't rather have metastasis.</seg>
<seg id="18">I don't know yet if I'm going to undergo chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="19">I put myself in the hands of specialist doctors who are rather good-minded.</seg>
<seg id="20">For now, after this severe operation, I have to return to some state of usability.</seg>
<seg id="21">I hope that everything will be good, "noted Kornel Morawiecki in an interview with SE in January.</seg>

<seg id="1">The power of leaps and bounds.</seg>
<seg id="2">The title of the coverage of amateur sports competitions, held on Sunday afternoon September 15 on the hippodrome at Oleandry Street in Oława, can be confusing for some.</seg>
<seg id="3">The road to true power is a long one, but this is the name used to describe one of the types of horse rivalry...</seg>
<seg id="4">The competition of the power of jumping consists in overcoming higher and higher obstacles by the rider and horse, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed up to two meters.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is worth mentioning that the long and still unbeaten world record, set back in 1949 by the Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on the horse "Huaso," is 247 cm.</seg>
<seg id="6">Of course, nobody jumped so high in Oława, but the result of the best local amazons at 135 cm is also not the worst...</seg>
<seg id="7">The competition organized by tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other activists of JKS "In the Saddle," constituted a demonstration part of the previously held "Rainbow equestrian competitions," about which we write more broadly in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.</seg>
<seg id="8">Eight amazons took part in the competition, training horsemanship in JKS in Oława.</seg>
<seg id="9">Four competed on ponies and four on big horses.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the first group, the best was Nikola Szołdra, sitting crazy "Sprinter."</seg>
<seg id="11">This small but very dynamic rumac started by overcoming obstacles spread at a height of 40 cm, and ended only at the stationary with the upper beam 125 cm away from the ground.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he did not give up easily and it was only after three further refusals that he was dismissed from the competition by the jury.</seg>
<seg id="13">Second place in the pony jumps was taken by Amelia Pawlak, sitting "Famy," and third by Lena Boruń on "Harmider."</seg>
<seg id="14">Ambitiously fought the youngest participant of the tournament - Inga Aksman, galloping and jumping over obstacles on the small mare "Carmen."</seg>
<seg id="15">Even more excitement accompanied the starter amazons and spectators during the competition with the participation of large horses.</seg>
<seg id="16">Paulina Szewczyk, sitting on the "Declaration," and Anastasia Abramenko, who was riding on "Lotka," scored threatening falls.</seg>
<seg id="17">Fortunately, apart from minor bruises, nothing bad happened to the amazons or horses, so they continued to participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="18">Weronika Łuczkiewicz had a lot of problems with introducing the young mare "Wineta" to the parkur.</seg>
<seg id="19">Either an asist trainer or another horse for the pair was needed, followed by a little crazy "Wineta."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Everything is under control," reassured Jan Sienkiewicz a little scared spectators, especially the youngest ones.</seg>
<seg id="21">From the beginning of the big horses competition Marta Masalska, sitting on a beautifully presented "Whisky," performed great on the dance floor.</seg>
<seg id="22">This dignified mare, paired with an experienced amazon, was the first to jump 135 cm behind the second approach in the final phase and it was the best result of the competition at that moment.</seg>
<seg id="23">After a while, however, Paulina Szewczyk also scored the same height on the "Declaration," Weronika Łuczkiewicz on "Wineta" and Anastasia Abramenko on "Lotka."</seg>
<seg id="24">To decorate the flo and to receive the prizes in the form of equestrian equipment went all these contestants together, and finally together with the amazons on the ponies in the rhythm of the march Radecki performed an impressive round of honor, ending this interesting and exciting competition.</seg>

<seg id="2">KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko is the name of the electoral committee under which the political formation # R Revolution of Mariusz Max Kolonko was to go to the October parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="3">The revolution directed its proposal especially at young voters with right-wing views.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the elections, Kolonko announced cooperation with Marek Jakubiak or Paweł Kukiz, but none of these coalitions took place, and the Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko did not manage to collect enough signatures to issue letters in any constituency in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now, Kolonko announced on Twitter that he had ended his collaboration with KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I will expect the abovementioned KWW to delete my name from the name.</seg>
<seg id="7">I kindly ask you not to associate my person with the above mentioned entity, "he added and announced that he would provide more information soon.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is not yet known whether the journalist will continue his action or whether this is the end of formation # R Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="9">On July 4, US Independence Day, journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko announced the formation of a new political formation - # R Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="10">In recent years, Kolonko has become famous for hosting the Max TV channel on YouTube, where he comments on events in Poland and around the world.</seg>
<seg id="11">"We are fed up with the politicians, enough of your foolish games, enough of your amateur rule.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is time for the authorities in the state to take over the Nation and govern for the good of the Nation, "Kolonko said at the time.</seg>
<seg id="13">The party's agenda included issues relating to the judiciary (it should be elected in general elections), tax changes (equalling the tax-free quota for all), war reparations (in the form of military aid to NATO's eastern flank countries, with particular emphasis on Poland), holding a referendum on gun ownership, limiting the number of MPs or introducing single-member constituencies.</seg>
<seg id="14">A few days after the announcement of the formation of the new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko started talks with Marek Jakubiak.</seg>
<seg id="15">In late July, Kolonko posted information on his social media profile suggesting that # R would join forces with the Kukiz '15 movement.</seg>

<seg id="2">"The euro exchange rate will continue in the coming months near the ceiling of PLN 4.35, accompanied by a weak economic situation on global markets," says Michael Bolliger of UBS Wealth Management.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Expectations of maintaining a solid pace of economic growth and stable monetary policy are in favour of stabilizing the gold prices at the current ceiling," says the specialist in an interview with Bankier.pl.</seg>
<seg id="4">In his view, despite clear inflationary pressures, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide on rate hikes in an environment where the vast majority of central banks are easing policy.</seg>
<seg id="5">"While the zloty is properly valued - euro prices should remain around the ceiling of PLN 4.35 in the coming months - according to him, Polish bonds are not very attractive.</seg>
<seg id="6">Significantly more profitable than Polish securities are offered by bonds from emerging markets, "says Michael Bolliger, head of asset allocation for emerging markets, accompanied by UBS Wealth Management.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the downturn in the world.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The global slowdown could get worse, but there shouldn't be a severe recession and, at most, GDP dynamics going down slightly below zero," says Michael Bolliger.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Investors should underweight global equities that may be harmed by a lack of prospects for resolving the U.S.-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including Donald Trump's impeachment procedure and Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="10">Europe should behave relatively least among equity markets, "according to a recent letter to investors by UBS Wealth Management chief executive Mark Haefele.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Shares from euro zone countries should behave worse than U.S. ones because they are more vulnerable amid heightened uncertainty around global trade and fears of a slowdown," the document read.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to Michael Bolliger, after the boom in the bond markets of the safest countries pushed the profitability of the German 10-year to as low as minus 0.74%, it is still possible to deepen the decline in profitability.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, in the long term, the profitability of long-term securities should no longer fall, but only short-term ones, as a result of the easing of banks' monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Fed has the biggest room for rate cuts, which should lead to a weakening of the U.S. currency in the horizon of years to come.</seg>
<seg id="15">The long-term balance point for the euro is the $1.29 cap, which would mean a 19% potential to strengthen the common currency to the dollar.</seg>
<seg id="16">We expect further reductions in Fedu rates, which will result in a reduction in the differences in monetary policy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="17">"To maintain the strength of the dollar in the long term may not allow the current account and budget deficits," announces Michael Bolliger.</seg>

<seg id="2">Confidential report of the German Ministry of Defence</seg>
<seg id="3">Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehr has recorded the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 weapons and 19,445 rounds of ammunition, according to a confidential statement compiled in the Federal Ministry of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="4">The news was reported by press belonging to media group RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).</seg>
<seg id="5">According to a document from the MON parliamentary secretary of state Peter Tauber's office (CDU), two weapons, one weapon and 3,474 rounds of ammunition have so far been re-tracked.</seg>
<seg id="6">Among the military equipment still missing are six MG3 universal machine guns, 11 G3 automatic rifles, four G36 automatic rifles, six signal guns and two P8 pistols.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, 30 barrels for MG3 machine guns are missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Left party's vice-president, Martina Renner, expressed concern about the situation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The number of missing weapons and ammunition is "alarming," RND told reporters.</seg>
<seg id="10">All the more so because, as a result of the investigations, only a small part of the lost equipment was found.</seg>
<seg id="11">Martina Renner summed up the effects of these actions as a "miserable balance sheet."</seg>
<seg id="12">She also criticized the fact that the list did not show whether there was a weapon there either, which was found during an investigation against Bundeswehr kidnapper Franco A. In December 2017, the federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a grievous act of violence threatening state security and violating the provisions of the law governing access to firearms.</seg>
<seg id="13">The officer was accused of preparing assassinations of leading German politicians for far-right and racist motives.</seg>
<seg id="14">His "blacklist" of targets, which fell into the hands of the prosecution, included then-Justice Minister Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green party, and Anetta Kahane, a human rights defender and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung foundation in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="15">Franco A. entered illegally into possession of four firearms, more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition and more than 50 explosives.</seg>

<seg id="4">Japan Airlines has recently used a feature designed for people for whom travelling accompanied by a crying child is a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="5">Through the website, the airline allows you to check the schedule of seats on the plane.</seg>
<seg id="6">If a given connection is traveled by minors up to the age of two, the "child icon" appears on a specific seat reserved by parents or guardians.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thus, the person using the services of the carrier has the opportunity to choose a place distant from that occupied by the toddler.</seg>
<seg id="8">The BBC says the lines have already reported the imperfections of this solution.</seg>
<seg id="9">A "child icon" will not appear when a ticket has been booked by a third party or if there was a change in the aircraft at the last minute.</seg>
<seg id="10">As you might expect, the idea divided internet users.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some Twitter users point to the problem of travelling with crying children being solved with noise-cancelling headphones.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's kids, we used to be them, too.</seg>

<seg id="2">More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not arrive on holiday in Majorca in October as a result of a Thomas Cook travel agent declared bankrupt on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to an autonomous Balearic government representative, Marc Pons, on Friday, among the 25,000 holidaymakers who will not be able to take their October holiday in Majorca are also people who were due to travel with companies indirectly associated with Thomas Cook, such as Neckermann.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pons explained that 80% of expected holidaymakers who had to give up their holiday in Majorca next month are German and Scandinavian nationals due to the British company's bankruptcy.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, according to Pons, due to the fact that Thomas Cook did not direct tourists to the Balearic island in the November-April period, the losses to the local economy will be less.</seg>
<seg id="6">He revealed that the Balearic government had already begun negotiations with international operators about "entering the Majorca market" following the bankruptcy of the British operator.</seg>
<seg id="7">Estimates from the newspaper Diario de Mallorca show that more than 1,000 people will lose their jobs in October due to the tourism crisis in Mallorca.</seg>
<seg id="8">About 800 are laid off employees at Thomas Cook's office in Palma.</seg>
<seg id="9">Other people will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Monday, with Thomas Cook declaring bankruptcy at multiple Majorca hotels, facility owners demanded guests pay an additional overnight fee.</seg>
<seg id="11">This situation was experienced by, among others, dozens of tourists from Poland.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Balearic government estimates that by Thursday, dozens of hotels in Majorca had halted operations until at least the end of October due to Thomas Cook declaring bankruptcy and its affiliates.</seg>
<seg id="13">Friday's Diario de Ibiza, on the other hand, indicates that most Ibiza-based hotels that have worked with the Thomas Cook group are not carrying the intent to close outlets in the coming weeks.</seg>
<seg id="14">The paper recalls that on this Balearic island, the British bankruptcy cooperated with 42 hotels.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Wednesday, autonomous Balearic authorities announced they would ask the Spanish government to support the region with €100m to cover losses caused by travel agent Thomas Cook declaring bankruptcy.</seg>
<seg id="16">They revealed that the most affected tourists in this archipelago, about 36,000 people, are in Majorca.</seg>
<seg id="17">Balearic government figures show that Thomas Cook is inundating local travel companies, mostly hotel operators, for the implementation of contracts for the July-September 2019 period of around €5 million.</seg>

<seg id="3">"I believe that the result of the Left will be very good, because we feel that people bind hope to the fact that the Left is not only right, but also has strength," he noted.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Zandberg, the left could have 60-80 MPs.</seg>

<seg id="2">Tens of thousands of people from across Senegal gathered in the capital on Friday for the inauguration of a huge mosque, believed to be the largest in West Africa.</seg>
<seg id="3">Muslims flocked by bus, car and on foot to the Bopp district, where a new mosque stood, capable of holding 30,000 worshippers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The facility was built by the Mouride fraternity, part of the Sufi Islamic trend that dominates Senegal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Work on the mosque began ten years ago in a six-hectare wetland area donated by the government.</seg>
<seg id="6">The name of Massalikul Jinan ("Paths to Paradise") comes from the title of a poem by Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the 19th-century founder of the fraternity, revered by followers as a saint.</seg>
<seg id="7">The mosque is covered with Carrara marble and has five minarets.</seg>
<seg id="8">The highest point is 78 meters.</seg>
<seg id="9">The mosque will house 15,000 worshippers inside, and the other as many may be on the outer esplanade.</seg>
<seg id="10">The richly finished interiors feature a gilded dome, giant chandeliers and decorations hand-crafted by Moroccan workers.</seg>
<seg id="11">Builders say the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but the edifice has no comparison to mosques in other regions anyway.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Morocco, the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca can hold 105,000 worshippers.</seg>
<seg id="13">The construction of the mosque, which cost more than €30 million, was funded by private donations.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition to the land, the government has provided lighting, sanitation and road works worth EUR 10.5 million.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trainer Smyła: Our problem is not Silesia, but ourselves</seg>
<seg id="2">Passage of eight league games without a win Crown players will try to break in Friday's meeting with the Deputy Premier League of Silesia.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Our problem is not Wrocław, but ourselves, we have to work on what we play," emphasized coach Mirosław Smyła.</seg>
<seg id="4">Crown players last and so far the only victory in the league recorded in the first round, when away they beat 1-0 beniaminka Raków Częstochowa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The gelding later recorded two draws and six defeats, and lost 1-0 to Zagłębie Lubin in the 1 / 32 Polish Cup final on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">"It fills me with optimism that in the final seconds of the cup match the players were fighting for a goal, they wanted to draw.</seg>
<seg id="7">Their fall on the pitch after the final whistle was not due to a breakdown, only it was a collapse of anger because they were so close, "Smyła said.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he pointed out, Silesia has very strong wings, which is why it will sensitize the team to play in the side sectors of the pitch.</seg>
<seg id="9">"We're aware of the quality of the opponent, but we're also looking at what we want to play," the coach added.</seg>
<seg id="10">Friday's game in Crown will certainly not feature Ognjen Gnjatic pausing for an excess of yellow cards. Jakub Żubrowski and Michael Gardawski will also be missing from the squad.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the other hand, it is edifying to come forward in a knockout match of several players with a desire to play.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We have a headache, it seemed not to be there recently, and now it is," Smyła stated.</seg>
<seg id="13">Crown defender Daniel Dziwniel stressed that Silesia will not be an easy rival to break the streak of eight league games in a row without a win, while in the top flight anyone can win against anyone.</seg>
<seg id="14">"We're a good team.</seg>
<seg id="15">In recent weeks we may not be showing it on the pitch, but the moment will come when we win and we believe it will be on Friday, "the player noted.</seg>
<seg id="16">After nine rounds of the Ekstraklasa, Korona is 15th with five points.</seg>
<seg id="17">Silesia has accumulated 12 more and is in second place.</seg>
<seg id="18">Friday's game in Kielce will start at 8: 30 p.m.</seg>

<seg id="1">These trees can completely disappear from Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">"42% of the tree species that make up Europe's stands are endangered," warns the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in its Red List of European Trees published on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the top of the list are chestnuts and rowan.</seg>
<seg id="4">IUCN, an organisation based in Gland, Switzerland, publishes a list of endangered species of European trees for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was drawn up by specialists who, based on research, concluded that of the 454 tree species found in Europe (as well as elsewhere in the world), 42% are "highly endangered."</seg>
<seg id="6">Among the causes, the Red Paper lists the rapid growth of urban agglomerations and global climate change.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, the most endangered are those trees and shrubs that occur only or mainly on our continent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As for the typically European stands, 58% of species are at risk, according to IUCN specialists, and 15%, or 66 species of trees and shrubs, are at risk of extinction.</seg>
<seg id="9">Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Paper lists errors in the exploitation of stands, accelerated urbanisation, excessive logging, followed by forest fires and changes in the European ecostism.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of shrubs, mosses and lichens is also under serious threat.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The consequences of human activity lead to the gradual disappearance of European plant species and pose a threat in Europe to the extinction of important and undervalued varieties that underpin European ecosystems and affect the health of our planet," concluded the report by Luc Bas, who heads the European office of the IUCN.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grzegorz Schetyna: I don't promise 600 +</seg>
<seg id="2">"Today the Law and Justice party wants to bribe Poles by offering them a loan for their freedom, which will have to be repaid by future generations," says Grzegorz Schetyna in an interview for "Rzeczpospolita."</seg>
<seg id="3">In his opinion, "the whole politics of the Law and Justice party is pic."</seg>
<seg id="4">At the same time, the politician promises that "what is given will not be taken away."</seg>
<seg id="5">Schetyna asserts in an interview with Jacek Nizinkiewicz that she has an idea to defeat Law and Justice.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is about mobilising the electorate at the ballot boxes.</seg>
<seg id="7">In his opinion, the opposition has more potential in this respect than Kaczyński's party.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today there are more conscious people who want to live in a normal state than supporters of the Law and Justice party, a party which has betrayed the proclaimed values, such as modesty, humility, transparency," says Schetyna.</seg>
<seg id="9">The leader of the Civic Coalition and the chairman of the Civic Platform also marked the basic assumptions of the electoral programme of the KO.</seg>
<seg id="10">"First of all, nothing that is given will be taken away, but it is necessary to set the direction for the future, because the Law and Justice party deals only with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which can be seen even from dramatically low investments," he stated.</seg>
<seg id="11">Secondly, it is about 'mobilising the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work honestly - and those who are entrepreneurial'.</seg>
<seg id="12">Schetyna explains that the KO program includes, among others, a project that will give the least-paid Poles more about 614 zlotys per hand, and more earners - also several hundred.</seg>
<seg id="13">The politician also indicated that he did not want to race for handouts.</seg>
<seg id="14">As he said, he will do as much as he can do, but he does not promise 600 +.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I will never allow the Greek variant where those in power were bidding with the opposition for handouts until the financial collapse of the country finally occurred," he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="16">In an interview with Rz, Schetyna also stated that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki were afraid to debate with him and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We would expose their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Pride is stepping before the fall.</seg>

<seg id="4">Large condors have probably been poisoned with a means to kill predators such as pumas, foxes or wild dogs.</seg>
<seg id="5">The animals may have eaten a toxic carcass.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition to one young individual, the rest of the dead condors were adults.</seg>
<seg id="7">"This is a big loss for the environment as the condor needs to reach 10-15 years for it to become prolific and able to reproduce.</seg>
<seg id="8">So we're losing a protected species, an endangered species, "says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentine environmental organization.</seg>

<seg id="2">Work has begun to give the head of state a precious chain.</seg>
<seg id="3">The idea was supported by Andrzej Duda's office - we read in 'Rzeczpospolita'.</seg>
<seg id="4">As the newspaper explains, it is about the gold chain of the Order of the White Eagle, the royal insignia officially known in the interwar period as the jewel of the Republic of Poland.</seg>
<seg id="5">The last time it was used was probably by president Ignacy Mościcki.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Rz" states that soon such a chain can hit the shoulders of Andrzej Duda.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Senate Committee on Human Rights, the Rule of Law and Petitions voted on Wednesday to work on an amendment to the Orders and Orders Act to restore it.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Journal writes that this is also not the first attempt to restore this chain to the head of state.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Senate had already proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it was lost by one vote.</seg>
<seg id="10">This time, the work is rapid.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the beginning of August, the senators devoted a few minutes to this matter, considering that they would consult the President's Office.</seg>

<seg id="13">"I kindly inform you that the Chancellery of the President of the Republic of Poland does not comment on the position presented in this petition," the presidential minister Andrzej Dera wrote at the time.</seg>

<seg id="2">The police action will be conducted, among others, at the intersection of Cieplińskiego Avenue and Piłsudskiego Avenue.</seg>

<seg id="4">On Friday, 27 September, policemen begin preventive actions "Mobile junctions" in Rzeszów.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is about eliminating traffic obstructions: entering an intersection without the possibility of an exit, not adhering to light signals or road signs.</seg>

<seg id="14">In addition, the uniform will pay attention to non-compliance with light signals or road signs and incorrect parking in the intersection area.</seg>
<seg id="15">They will also observe a lack of smoothness of driving, late starting from under the signalling devices, slow crossing of intersections and leaving too long distances between vehicles.</seg>

<seg id="3">52 senators voted in favor of the amendment to the Family Assets of State Officials Act - unamended - 14 were against, three abstained.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thus, senators decided to reject 12 amendments tabled during Wednesday's debate by Senator PO Sławomir Rybicki.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to him, the amendments were meant to "civilize" the law and limit the scope of information provided in the statement about the property situation of children of their own, spouse's children, children adapted to cases where children remain in a common household with a person obliged to make a statement.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Act on the transparency of the assets of families of the most important government officials, whose project was created in the prime minister's office, was passed by the Sejm on 11 September.</seg>
<seg id="7">The rules stipulate that, among others, the prime minister, ministers, MPs, MEPs, senators, presidents of: the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as those at the head of other state institutions, will be required to include information on the personal assets of spouses, children and persons living together in a property statement.</seg>
<seg id="8">Nor did the Senate propose amendments to the Flight Act of the most important people in the state.</seg>
<seg id="9">It regulates what flights have HEAD status and who can be on board government aircraft along with the most important people in the state.</seg>

<seg id="11">The bill - unamended - was supported by 55 senators, 12 were against, four abstained.</seg>
<seg id="12">Under the law, each president's flight will be a flight "performed on an official mission."</seg>
<seg id="13">On flights, the president will be able to be accompanied by family members and others invited by the president.</seg>
<seg id="14">On the other hand, a flight in the mission of the official prime minister and Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate will only be a flight "carried out in order to carry out tasks directly related to the function."</seg>
<seg id="15">The law also specifies a list of people who can accompany the most important people in the state on a flight.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the regulations, members of the delegation can be on board the aircraft - invited MPs, senators, representatives of public authorities and experts; people providing technical, medical or organisational services; as well as journalists.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the Act, in case of doubts related to the flights of the Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate, the head of the KPRM will apply for their explanation.</seg>
<seg id="18">If such doubts are not clarified in the allotted time, the head of KPRM will be obliged to notify the heads of the Chancellery of the Sejm or the Senate about the inability to organize such a flight.</seg>

<seg id="3">Vital Heynen's charges closed the way to winning the title with a 1-3 defeat to the Slovenians in Ljubljana on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">There was a lot of talk about their troubles with travelling to this duel.</seg>

<seg id="6">According to the reports of those present at the classes, the world champion trainer was annoyed.</seg>
<seg id="7">As Heynen's assistant Michał Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not just to practice volleyball elements.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We went to the hall but for the most part it was a time for the team.</seg>
<seg id="9">The idea was to spend it together more than train.</seg>
<seg id="10">Talk, consider how to rebuild it all as a team, "he reported.</seg>
<seg id="11">He confirmed the semi-final defeat was a painful lesson for both the players and the training staff.</seg>

<seg id="13">Without any doubt, we are disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="14">We still believed we would be back for this match yet.</seg>
<seg id="15">We discussed this match between ourselves on the staff, the coach spoke a lot with the players.</seg>
<seg id="16">As the two main reasons for the defeat, I would point to inefficiency in attack and much worse than usual dealing with situational balls.</seg>
<seg id="17">Slovenians were much better than us in this respect, "he analysed.</seg>
<seg id="18">In his opinion, "White and Red" did not stand in the way of stress, related to the performance against the co-hosts of the tournament, supported by a loud and large audience.</seg>
<seg id="19">He admitted for the fact that the world champions could have slept a bit the smooth way to the semi-finals.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Perhaps if we had a similar-style defeat in the group stage, we would have analysed that lesson more quickly and would have played differently later in the tournament.</seg>
<seg id="21">But it's just a howling, "he stipulated.</seg>
<seg id="22">Gogol hopes the anger over Thursday's defeat for the Poles can be turned into aggression in the bronze match.</seg>

<seg id="24">There is something to fight for.</seg>

<seg id="26">Paris is the fifth city and France is the third country visited by Poles during these championships.</seg>

<seg id="4">A summary of the misdeeds of the most uncouth professional tennis player of recent years looks threatening - 16 weeks off plus a sizeable fine, but yet both penalties are halted for six months - a trial period in which the gregarious athlete will be able to improve.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nick Kyrgios is only 24, but he has been ramping up for a long time and has earned a kind of tennis world record - having to pay the highest single financial penalty in the history of the discipline for breaching the rules of behaviour on and next to the court.</seg>
<seg id="6">Loud curses, strange gestures, unsportsmanlike behavior, insulting the referee and spectators, breaking two rackets during his loss to Karen Khachanov - he paid $113,000 for it all after the ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati in August.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the 2019 US Open, he didn't play long either, but managed to publicly say that ATP activists "are corrupt," which hurt the organisation's authorities so much that they implemented a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and, after a few weeks, gave the aforementioned verdict of suspending starts and another fine.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, he was forgiven for his words about corruption, having listened to the defendant and learned the context of the speech.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the justification, however, tennis activists said that the investigation found that Kyrgios' behaviour throughout the past 12 months in many cases raised serious objections and constituted an almost constant violation of the rules, that he continually insulted people associated with tournaments and spectators in a vulgar way, hence the high penalty.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the ATP gave him five days to lodge an appeal and immediately adjourned the execution of the verdict, ordering several conditions to be met over the next six months: in ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour tournaments, Kyrgios can no longer in any way violate the rules of the code of conduct of professional tennis players, in particular he can no longer curse, destroy rackets, argue with judges and the public, or any other way behave obscenely and vulgar.</seg>
<seg id="11">He has also been advised to seek "ongoing support" from mental coaches during tournaments and also in the off-season to consult with people specialising in tackling the problems of athletes not coping with proper behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nick Kyrgios' first comment (on social media) on the verdict was: "Hey everybody, I can still play.</seg>
<seg id="13">I just have to control my behaviour, that's all. '</seg>
<seg id="14">In practice, the Australian will have at least a two-week break anyway, as he was aggravated by a shoulder injury in the Laver Cup, so he had to give up his next starts in Beijing (September 30-October 6) and Shanghai (October 6-13).</seg>
<seg id="15">In the ATP rankings, Kyrgios is ranked 27th.</seg>
<seg id="16">He won two tournaments this year - in Washington and Acapulco, earned more than $1.3 million, so even after the fines, he will have a lot left.</seg>

<seg id="1">GUS: Life in Poland is getting better</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the report on household budgets published by GUS on Friday, as many as 44% of them assessed their material situation as good or rather good last year.</seg>
<seg id="3">A year earlier, that percentage was 37.2%, in 2016 33.5%, and before that - since 2009, when the statistics office first examined subjective assessments of household situations - it had never exceeded 30%.</seg>
<seg id="4">A total of 8.1% of households considered a bad or rather bad material situation last year, compared to 11.2% a year earlier and more than 20% in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="5">The best situation is the material situation of households of self-employed workers.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this group, more than 70% of respondents consider it to be good or rather good.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the other extreme are renaissance households, where the percentage of such responses was just 18%.</seg>
<seg id="8">The subjective assessment of the material situation of households is also strongly influenced by the number of children.</seg>
<seg id="9">Parents raising their offspring alone are the worst, 32% of whom declare a good or rather good material situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among couples with children, the proportion varies (depending on the number of children) from 55% to 60%, and among childless households it is 48.8%.</seg>
<seg id="11">These statistics clearly show the effect of the 500 + programme.</seg>
<seg id="12">Before it was launched (in 2016), parents raising their offspring and large families (with at least three children) assessed their worst material situation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Improving subjective assessments of the material situation of Poles reflects a rapid increase in income, mainly from work.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, that is not all, because the percentage of households who consider their situation to be good increases faster than real incomes.</seg>
<seg id="15">Moreover, at the level of voivodships there is no clear relationship between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households.</seg>
<seg id="16">The best evaluations are made by the inhabitants of the Opolskie voivodship, where 48.9% of the respondents consider their situation to be good or rather good.</seg>
<seg id="17">The following regions are Lubuskie (47.7%), Śląskie (47.6%), Mazowieckie (47.3%) and Zachodniopomorskie (47.1%).</seg>
<seg id="18">Meanwhile, in Opole, disposable income (that is, after paying taxes and contributions) was less than 94% of the national average last year and 98% in Lubusko.</seg>
<seg id="19">The inhabitants of Mazowiecki (120% of the national average) and Śląskie (104%) had the highest income.</seg>
<seg id="20">On average, in Poland, disposable income per person amounted to PLN 1,693 in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="21">In real terms (after adjusting for the impact of price changes), it increased by 4.3% compared to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="22">Compared to previous years, this result is quite low.</seg>
<seg id="23">In 2016, per capita income increased by 7% and 6.3% a year later.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although income growth is slowing, it is also holding back spending growth.</seg>
<seg id="25">Those per capita amounted to PLN 1187 last year, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7%.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is the first such case since 2013.</seg>
<seg id="27">In 2017, per person spending increased by 1.9% in real terms and 4.3% in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="28">Household budget surveys suggest that the statistical household currently spends 70.1% of its disposable income, while as recently as 2014, that share exceeded 80% and exceeded 90% by 2006.</seg>

<seg id="1">Niesiołowski was critical of the pope.</seg>
<seg id="2">John Paul II did nothing</seg>
<seg id="3">In an interview with Piotr Lekszycki, Stefan Niesiołowski emphasized that in 1981 John Paul II was a great authority for opposition activists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Actually, every sentence of it was accepted."</seg>
<seg id="5">There was later criticism of some of his actions.</seg>
<seg id="6">"For me, the fact that John Paul II could not liquidate the harmful activity of Rydzyk is a great shadow on his pontificate.</seg>
<seg id="7">After all, this redemptorist - a pest of the Church and Poland - was developing his media in the best way during the life of the Polish pope ', he explained.</seg>
<seg id="8">The former politician of the Civic Platform admitted: 'there were murmurs of discontent, the pope said something, once Rydzyk did not accept but he had power and for politicking he could simply throw him out of the Church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor there.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, John Paul II did not do it, so did his successors, "explained Niesiołowski.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Besides, there was this fatal matter of paedophilia and actions of the Church, or rather their lack.</seg>
<seg id="11">I ran forward a little, but I wanted to draw attention to the totality of his life.</seg>
<seg id="12">We have known about the scale of pedophilia in the Church since a relatively recent time.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question arises how it is possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting matters', Niesiołowski says in an interview with a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the opinion of the former politician of the Civic Platform, the Polish Church is an ally of the Law and Justice party.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It must be admitted that during the Solidarity period the Church was our most important ally.</seg>
<seg id="16">All the celebrations began with mass, crosses hung everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now these crosses are scriptural, they have become a symbol of dictatorship - a sign of the written regime.</seg>
<seg id="18">I repeat: one of the biggest unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk shake the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing about it and that today the Church is an ally of the Law and Justice party.</seg>
<seg id="19">This is a black chapter of the Polish Church, for which he will pay dearly, "argued Niesiołowski.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I hope that Pope Francis will chase Jędraszewski, Rydzyk and a few others of this type," he concluded.</seg>

<seg id="4">After this incident, the match was abandoned for 20 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Polish Football Association (PZPN), investigating this case, imposed a severe penalty on Gryf, excluding him from future games.</seg>
<seg id="6">The club will not be allowed to compete in the Polish Cup in the 2020-2021 season.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, fans will not be allowed into their own stadium in the next match.</seg>

<seg id="9">Burdy at Widzew Łódź Stadium was also sparked by fans of Śląsk Wrocław.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here, however, the verdict of PZPN was more lenient, because Silesia warned that similar events could occur and sensitized the relevant authorities on this issue.</seg>

<seg id="4">In Podkarpacie began the implementation of an amendment to the regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on, among other things, saving the names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish.</seg>
<seg id="5">For example, "Lviv" will appear next to "L'viv."</seg>
<seg id="6">In our province, the changes will be made on 94 road signs set by the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.</seg>
<seg id="7">As we hear, it is to be easier, clearer and simpler.</seg>
<seg id="8">The new guidelines result from the amendment of the Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure on detailed technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety equipment.</seg>
<seg id="9">"We should remember that the names of towns in neighbouring countries often also have a Polish sound.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thanks to the changes we have prepared in the law, they will finally appear on the signposts by our roads.</seg>

<seg id="1">Gowin: 'we must stimulate Polish, small trade'</seg>
<seg id="2">"Effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will be necessary to consider whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade," said deputy prime minister, minister of science and higher education, leader of the Agreement Jarosław Gowin on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a talk in "Signals of the Day" on Radio One, Gowin stated that trade is overrun by international networks, which impose such low margins on Polish producers that Polish companies cannot actually develop.</seg>
<seg id="4">Noting that it is very difficult to fight this problem, the deputy prime minister reminded that the government of the Law and Justice party tried to deal with it at the very beginning of the term of office, but got a 'counter from the EC'.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We won before the court of justice and I hope that if the United Right wins the next election and formulates the government, we will come back to that topic," he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the same time, he noted that "effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish, and therefore small trade."</seg>
<seg id="7">"This will have to be considered whether the government, the state has any instruments to boost Polish trade," Gowin said.</seg>
<seg id="8">In May, an EU court found that the European Commission had made a mistake in finding that the Polish retail tax was an unauthorised public aid.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Retail Sales Tax Act provided for the introduction of two rates of tax on trade: 0.8% on revenue between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4% on revenue over PLN 170 million per month.</seg>
<seg id="10">The tax was supposed to be in place from September 2016.</seg>
<seg id="11">In September 2016, the European Commission opened an infringement proceeding against Poland.</seg>
<seg id="12">Brussels then argued that the design of the tax could favour smaller shops, which could be considered public aid.</seg>
<seg id="13">It then found that the tribute had been put into effect in an unlawful manner.</seg>
<seg id="14">It also issued an order suspending the use of the tax until officials in Brussels complete its analysis.</seg>
<seg id="15">Poland did not agree with this position, but the tax collection was suspended.</seg>
<seg id="16">An EU court decision in May opened the way for the tax to be reintroduced, but it did not end the case.</seg>
<seg id="17">On 24 July, the Commission lodged an appeal with the Court of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="18">On Thursday, the press service of the CJEU told PAP that the case is currently at a written stage, in which both the European Commission and the Polish government present their arguments in writing.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not yet known whether or when the oral procedure will start, i.e. hearing the parties and a possible hearing.</seg>
<seg id="20">It takes a good few to a dozen months from filing an appeal until the verdict is announced.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Such proceedings take an average of one year," a source told PAP at the Tribunal in Luxembourg.</seg>

<seg id="1">How to dress a child for baptism?</seg>
<seg id="2">We are putting forward some practical solutions</seg>
<seg id="3">Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of the infant and his parents.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is often the first occasion on which the whole family focuses around the child, together celebrating his appearance in the world.</seg>
<seg id="5">No wonder, then, that the newly minted mum and dad want their comfort to look their best on the day.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, before you make a final decision about your child's outfit, consider whether it will also be comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the shops you can find many outfit sets that do not provide the toddler with proper comfort.</seg>
<seg id="8">So what should you pay attention to?</seg>
<seg id="9">The basic criterion for choosing clothes for baptism is the age of the child</seg>
<seg id="10">Until recently, several weeks of toddlers were baptized, tuned into white sets and put into the same becaques or great spirits.</seg>
<seg id="11">Today, children who receive the sacrament are often older: a few months old, one year old and even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is not difficult to guess that such a big consolation needs a slightly different clothes for baptism.</seg>
<seg id="13">Therefore, if your child is 3-4 months old on the day of baptism, he will probably spend the ceremony in a stroller or in the hands of his parents or godparents.</seg>
<seg id="14">The best solution will therefore be to decorate it with comfortable cotton sleeping bags or sets.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although this piece of clothing is considered a everyday outfit, it is enough to search for its festive variants, for example with a ruffle or lace.</seg>
<seg id="16">For the boy, the perfect body will turn out to be printed with a fly and braces.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the case of older children, you can afford a bigger fantasy in clothing.</seg>
<seg id="18">The girl will look lovely in a simple tulle dress</seg>
<seg id="19">Many parents of girls look longingly towards richly embellished, ruffled christening dresses complete with planes, wristbands and hats.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers use artificial, non-breathable materials in which the child is simply uncomfortable.</seg>
<seg id="21">In search of the right clothing, it will be better to look at the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant outfits on cotton lining.</seg>
<seg id="22">Delicate, tulle skirts, satin dresses, lace, apps and adorable sets will make your baby girl look gorgeous and feel comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="23">Perfect dress for a little gentleman: cotton suit</seg>
<seg id="24">Until recently, there was a fashion among parents of boys for suits that were a copy of "adult" models.</seg>

<seg id="2">UK MPs voted against a three-day Commons recess in time for the Conservative Party's annual programme conference, as requested by the government.</seg>
<seg id="3">289 MPs voted in favour, 306 against.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is customary for the House of Commons not to hold party conferences so that MPs do not have to resign from either attending them or sitting in parliament.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, opposition parties felt that at such a crucial time as the final weeks before Britain's scheduled departure from the European Union on October 31, parliament should not interrupt the deliberations.</seg>
<seg id="6">The government's motion for a recess was supported by 289 MPs, with 306 against.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two opposition parties after the conventions</seg>
<seg id="8">The disagreement over the recess could be seen as a political revenge by the opposition on Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday, the decision was declared unlawful and non-existent by the Supreme Court) and for not wanting to apologise for it after the judges "ruling.</seg>
<seg id="9">Following that ruling, the House of Commons resumed its session on Wednesday. The most important event of the day was Mr Johnson's speech and the ensuing tumultuous debate.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr Johnson accused the opposition of blocking Brexit and avoiding an early election.</seg>
<seg id="11">'It's time to deliver Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="12">It must be implemented in order to respect the result of the referendum.</seg>
<seg id="13">Brexit must come so that we can address the deal on citizens' priorities, on health care, on the cost of living.</seg>
<seg id="14">Brexit needs to be delivered so we can bring this country together, "Mr Johnson said.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Conservative Party conference is due to begin in Manchester next Sunday and run until Wednesday 2 October.</seg>
<seg id="16">Conferences between the two main opposition groups - Labour and the Liberal Democrats - have already taken place.</seg>
<seg id="17">One of the justifications Johnson gave in explaining such a long suspension of parliament was just party conferences.</seg>

<seg id="2">"President Andrzej Duda believes that anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders," write foreign media.</seg>
<seg id="3">A spokesman for the president strongly denied those reports.</seg>
<seg id="4">"That's just not true," Blazej Spychalski wrote on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="5">Israeli media, including "Haaretz" and "Jerusalem Post," citing the "Jewish Insider," write that Andrzej Duda during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora at the Polish Consulate in New York declared that Israel was to blame for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="6">The president said the rise in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland was a reaction to anti-Polish rhetoric by Israeli leaders.</seg>
<seg id="7">He referred to the words of Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, who stated in February that "Poles have sent out anti-Semitism with the milk of mothers."</seg>
<seg id="8">Andrzej Duda said he regretted that Israel had not apologized for the humiliating statements of its politicians.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also mentioned the act of aggression against the Polish ambassador to Israel Marek Magierowski.</seg>
<seg id="10">In May, he was attacked by an attacker who shouted: "Pole, Pole."</seg>

<seg id="2">The tenement rented by the basements led the journalist to discover negligence in Marian Banasia's property statements.</seg>
<seg id="3">We take stock of another scandal that has rocked the ruling camp.</seg>
<seg id="4">The journalists of "Superwizjera" TVN revealed that Marian Banaś, the president of the Supreme Chamber of Control, has not included in the property statement of the 400-metre tenement house, which is located in Krakow's Podgórze.</seg>
<seg id="5">Moreover, his subtenant was to run a sex business in the aforementioned tenement house (and therefore rent rooms for hours).</seg>
<seg id="6">The building itself, on the other hand, has allegedly been safeguarding the loan repayment since 2016.</seg>
<seg id="7">Bertold Kittel pointed out the irregularities in the "Supervisor" program.</seg>
<seg id="8">The journalist revealed that from Banasia, the townhouse was rented by people linked to the criminal world to use it as a place of "erotic encounters."</seg>
<seg id="9">The clients were men using the services of prostitutes.</seg>
<seg id="10">Banas responded vaguely and vaguely to the allegations.</seg>
<seg id="11">Interestingly, the tenement rented by the basements led the journalist to discover negligence in Banasia's property statements.</seg>
<seg id="12">The house itself was described in vague terms, and the income from renting it was to be underestimated.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The property of Marian Banasia and his wife can be worth 6 to 8 million zlotys.</seg>
<seg id="14">In total, spouses can boast of two houses, three apartments, savings [...], "writes Money.pl.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the analysis of the portal, the Banasia tenement house itself was worth about PLN 3 million.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Central Anti-Corruption Bureau is currently conducting an inspection of Marian Banasia's property statements for 2015-2019.</seg>
<seg id="17">Banas announced that he would suspend his activities at the Supreme Chamber of Commerce by the time it was completed.</seg>
<seg id="18">The opposition demands clarification.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We do not hear the CBA expand its investigation or expedite the examination of Marian Banasia's property statements.</seg>
<seg id="20">Therefore, we are forced to torment the organs of the state and submit a notification about the possibility of committing a crime [...], "said Mariusz Witczak, MP of PO-KO.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If a normal Pole so grossly low priced renting his properties, he would already have 10 checks, a tax filing and criminal-fiscal proceedings," he added.</seg>
<seg id="22">He went high, fell low</seg>
<seg id="23">Marian Banaś is the new president of the Supreme Chamber of Control.</seg>
<seg id="24">He was appointed to the position on August 30, 2019, for a 6-year term.</seg>
<seg id="25">His candidacy was put forward by Law and Justice and voted by the party's politicians.</seg>
<seg id="26">Prior to that Banas was associated with the Supreme Chamber of Control in 1992-2005, he worked in this institution as a collaborator of Lech Kaczyński.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Rzeczpospolita": Ignoring a cop's order will be punished</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the newspaper, the disregard for a specific behaviour order issued by a police officer is to be a new type of offence, punishable by a fine, arrest or restriction of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="3">Police trade unionists want to make such a change.</seg>
<seg id="4">The idea went to the Sejm Committee on Petitions.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The case is serious, because already every year more than half a million misdemeanor cases go to Polish courts," we read.</seg>
<seg id="6">The "Republic" has determined that the petition that the Independent Police Trade Union writes to MPs on amending the misdemeanour code has a chance of succeeding.</seg>
<seg id="7">The authors of the petition propose a new wording of Article 54a of the Code of Misdemeanours.</seg>
<seg id="8">It would read: "Whoever does not comply with a request or order of a public official, issued within the limits and under the provisions of the Act, shall be punished with custody, a fine or a restriction of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Paragraph 3 of this provision speaks of an identical punishment for those who fail to carry out orders, prevent or impede the performance of a business activity," the Journal says.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski told Rzeczpospolita that despite agreeing with the main message of the proposal, he fears that if implemented, it could be used in political matters of manifestations.</seg>
<seg id="11">"In situations of freedom demonstrations, it would be disadvantageous and instead of mitigating the situation, it would even exacerbate it," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="12">Statistics provided by the newspaper show that 86% of citizens rated police interventions positively in 2018 and that 1.5 million interventions are made on the city each month by services.</seg>

<seg id="2">Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook has collapsed, its Belgian subsidiary Neckermann operates.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the company has problems.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to VRT, Brussels Airlines announced it would cancel 105 flights in October due to Thomas Cook's bankruptcy problems.</seg>
<seg id="5">Neckermann also laid off 75 employees.</seg>
<seg id="6">All trips with an office that have been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but holidaymakers will be able to receive a refund.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Ghent court also declared the bankruptcy of three Belgian daughter companies: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.</seg>
<seg id="8">Currently, around 12,000 Belgians are abroad on trips bought at Thomas Cook.</seg>
<seg id="9">Another 40,000 people were expected to leave with the office by the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">As recently as Monday, Thomas Cook Belgium spokeswoman Leen Segers said the company was now "fully operational" despite the British parent company declaring bankruptcy, which has caused concern among employees and customers.</seg>
<seg id="11">The office then reassured that customers who had bought trips in it would go on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thomas Cook - the oldest and one of the largest travel agencies in the world - declared bankruptcy on the night of Sunday to Monday.</seg>
<seg id="13">The immediate cause of the bankruptcy was the collapse of last-chance talks with creditors and potential investors on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="14">Creditors demanded that, in addition to the £900m rescue plan already agreed in August, the company win an additional 200m as collateral for the winter period, when travel agents usually have lower turnover.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, the company's problems have grown for several years, resulting in a debt of up to £1.6bn.</seg>

<seg id="1">Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for an opinion</seg>
<seg id="2">Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion - such an unusual offer was prepared for the newcomers of the German Görlitz.</seg>
<seg id="3">The measures are intended to help combat the continuing decline in the city's population.</seg>
<seg id="4">Görlitz is the easternmost city in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="5">The beautiful pastel old town attracts 140,000 tourists a year.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, according to The Guardian, the city is struggling with significant problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Görlitz has the lowest wages in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">The city is also struggling with a steady decline in the number of residents.</seg>
<seg id="9">After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them left for the west of the country, which translated into a 25% drop in the city's population.</seg>
<seg id="10">As of 2013, it had a population of 54,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="11">In a bid to combat the depopulation, officials came up with the idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.</seg>
<seg id="12">So far, 150 applications have been received into the programme.</seg>
<seg id="13">Two-thirds of them were made up by residents of big cities.</seg>
<seg id="14">People from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom were also interested in the programme.</seg>
<seg id="15">"When we applied, we thought the program was going to convince people to move to Görlitz," said one project participant.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Now we feel like it doesn't matter if we stay here after four weeks or not," he added.</seg>
<seg id="17">The city has seven thousand vacant housing units and unemployment is three times higher than the national average.</seg>
<seg id="18">Although the city authorities hope some will move permanently, the main goal of the program is to get feedback from participants in the program.</seg>
<seg id="19">Information gathered from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revive smaller German cities.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We want to know more about what people need, and if they decide to move - what their motivation was," said Robert Knippschild, responsible for the program.</seg>
<seg id="21">Other cities have already experimented with ideas to lure new residents, offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first was Detroit, which introduced a program to pay promising young professionals to live and work in the city for a year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy, or in the American Tulsa, Oklahoma.</seg>
