<seg id="1">Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in a white robe</seg>
<seg id="2">He is charismatic.</seg>
<seg id="3">Crowds gather for his Holy Mass for deliverance and healing.</seg>
<seg id="4">He was several years old when inexplicable things began to happen in his life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Today, through the Franciscan, others experience it.</seg>
<seg id="6">The masses for deliverance and healing, celebrated by Fr Witko, attract crowds.</seg>
<seg id="7">Once the parents of a 7-month-old child came to him, who had a 7.5 mm hole in his heart.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was supposed to be operated.</seg>
<seg id="9">Father Józef Witko prayed for him.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the same day, the boy was taken to hospital for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="11">Astonished doctors said: “surgery is not needed, the loss is only 1.5 mm.”</seg>
<seg id="12">My parents cried out of happiness.</seg>
<seg id="13">After another prayer the Franciscan hole disappeared completely.</seg>
<seg id="14">The priest began to experience extraordinary actions of the Creator as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="15">In his dreams the souls of Purgatory came to him asking for help.</seg>
<seg id="16">I was awakened at night and urged to pray for the dead and those who died at the moment,” he recalls.</seg>
<seg id="17">He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.</seg>
<seg id="18">And he had a vision of what was happening to a man who commits mortal sin.</seg>
<seg id="19">“My body started to change.</seg>
<seg id="20">I lost human qualities and started taking on the appearance of an animal,” he says.</seg>
<seg id="21">Invisible force lifted him up, he couldn't get his voice out of himself.</seg>
<seg id="22">He felt he was lost.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then God pointed to his rescue.</seg>
<seg id="24">“Immersed in the waters of a river symbolizing holy baptism, I was freed and returned to human form...”, he says.</seg>
<seg id="25">He didn't tell anyone about these strange experiences.</seg>
<seg id="26">The vocation matured in it.</seg>
<seg id="27">He was 16 when he joined the Franciscans.</seg>
<seg id="28">In his sermons he not only wanted to talk about Jesus.</seg>
<seg id="29">He wanted people to experience him alive.</seg>
<seg id="30">Members of the charismatic community of renewal in the Holy Spirit</seg>
<seg id="31">The Mass for healing celebrated by father Witko is attended by many people who hope to get rid of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, the priest emphasizes that their main purpose is spiritual healing, not bodily healing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Kolping's first defeat FRAC Yaroslav</seg>
<seg id="2">This afternoon (26 September) Kolping FRAC team deservedly succumbed to the current Polish champion Dartom Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki as part of the 3 rd LOTTO Superliga table Tennis.</seg>
<seg id="3">In such a personal juxtaposition as they presented with the peasants, the Yaroslavans have little chance of winning with the league's sovereigns.</seg>
<seg id="4">This was clearly demonstrated by the duel with Dartom Bogoria.</seg>
<seg id="5">Chen Jingqi, the team's leader, is still missing.</seg>
<seg id="6">Perhaps with him in the squad, the Yaroslavans would reach for a third consecutive triumph in the new season.</seg>
<seg id="7">Young Asian Qiyao Han has probably not yet grown up to win against the likes of Greek Panagiotis Gionis and Czech Pavel Sirucek.</seg>
<seg id="8">Not even with one of the most promising Poles, that is Marek Badowski.</seg>
<seg id="9">The player from Hellada was the biggest star of the duel in the MOSiR hall at Sikorskiego Street in Jarosław.</seg>
<seg id="10">Both in the clash with Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei was class for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">After three fights, Kolping FRAC led 2-1.</seg>
<seg id="12">Kou Lei probably played Marek Badowski, and Daniel Górak after an emotional five-set fight - Pavel Siruck.</seg>
<seg id="13">But then it was worse.</seg>
<seg id="14">Gionis didn't give Lei a chance.</seg>
<seg id="15">One could still hope to win by two points, but Qiyao Han did not meet Badowski.</seg>

<seg id="1">There will be no additional research for seniors.</seg>
<seg id="2">Why?</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the announcements of Rafał Trzaskowski, a program of free preventive tests for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not gained the approval of the Ministry of Health and its subordinate Agency for the Protection of Medical Technology and tariff treatment.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a statement, the agency explained that the target group had been badly selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">“The above actions may even result in the detection of individual disease units, which may contribute to the deepening of difficulties in accessing NFZ benefits and negatively affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with the false positive result of the research”, it was written.</seg>
<seg id="7">The ministry's decision is not understood by the president of the capital.</seg>
<seg id="8">“money is ours, we have provided money for it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only the government is afraid that if people are investigated, they will then go to the doctor, which is absurd, because it is about leading to a situation in which prevention can be done faster.</seg>
<seg id="10">All specialists know that this helps in terms of the burden on the health system, because it helps in the rapid detection of diseases and in a reliable approach to health.</seg>
<seg id="11">The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand“ , said Rafał Trzaskowski.</seg>
<seg id="12">“I find it hard to imagine that experts say: Let's not investigate because there will be longer queues at the doctor, and if such specialists advise the government, I am not surprised that there is a health service in this state,” the politician added.</seg>

<seg id="1">Palestine responds to Israel: we will break all existing agreements</seg>
<seg id="2">Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced at a session of the UN General Assembly on Thursday that he would break any agreement reached with Israel if the country's future government tries to meet Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement of annexation of occupied Palestinian lands.</seg>
<seg id="3">“If the future Israeli government that will be formed proceeds with this plan, we will cancel all signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all commitments made,” he said.</seg>
<seg id="4">“We will reject completely and completely the whole plan,” Abbas threatened with pressure.</seg>
<seg id="5">“It is our duty to defend all our rights with all possible means - no matter what the consequences will be - by fully engaging in the application of international law and in the fight against terrorism,” said the Palestinian Authority president, who had already made similar declarations in July.</seg>
<seg id="6">Netanyahu, Israel's former prime minister, was re-elected to form a government after the September 17 election.</seg>
<seg id="7">A week before the election, he announced that if he wins, he would announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and would include all Jewish settlements in Israel throughout the West Bank.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the early 90 s, Israel and the Palestinians, led by Jaser Arafat at the time, signed a series of peace agreements under the patronage of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="9">The 84-year-old Abbas also promised to hold a general election on Palestinian soil during a session of the UN General Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="10">The last one was held in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="11">“Upon my return to the country, I will convene local elections in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem and all those who oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community,” the Palestinian president declared solemnly.</seg>
<seg id="12">Abbas also defended in his speech the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer at the United Nations, to exercise the powers of “full members of the United Nations and all its bodies and institutions.”</seg>
<seg id="13">The Palestinian leader ended the speech by calling on the international community to “force Israel to comply with the United Nations's provisions with all due respect.”</seg>
<seg id="14">Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas' speech, saying the Palestinian leader “prefers to focus in the United Nations on the Palestinian Authority's efforts against Israel than to fight against calls for terrorism in the Autonomy under his leadership.”</seg>
<seg id="15">But Danon, according to the agencies, did not refer to Netanyahu's announced annexation of occupied Palestinian lands.</seg>

<seg id="1">PLN 105 million for video game companies from the National Centre for Research and Development</seg>
<seg id="2">Almost PLN 105 million of funding will go to companies from the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.</seg>
<seg id="3">The National Centre for Research and Development announced the results of the third edition of the GameINN programme on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Among the nearly 30 projects supported by the NCBR were, among others, the development of a platform for the creation of field games based on an AR game engine creating a map of the real world together with an application enabling the transfer of data by users; a test and training platform for verification of practical skills at the workplace and professional improvement using VR and AI technology; an innovative game simulating the management of real production processes using THE AP virtual interaction concept and the PCBR submission on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="5">The aim of the GameINN sector programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game industry on the global market in the perspective of 2023.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the NCBR, the Polish video game sector is already growing at a rate of 10% per year.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 amounted to PLN 1.85 billion, while the forecast for 2019 is 2.23 billion.</seg>
<seg id="8">“The specially prepared GameINN research agenda and the support already reaching PLN 300 million for entrepreneurs under this sector programme provide an important impetus for further dynamic growth of the Polish gamedevu”, reads the release.</seg>
<seg id="9">The video game industry is an excellent example of effective use of the potential we have in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="10">“The incentives introduced by the government for innovative entrepreneurs, such as R &amp; D incentives, competence improvement programmes, IP box or support programmes implemented by the National Centre for Research and Development (NCBR) drive innovative activities of companies and allow them to compete more effectively in a very competitive market”, says Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and higher Education Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the release.</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of the Ministry of Science points out that money for innovation not only goes to innovators in the form of financing projects, but also stays in their pockets – three quarters more entrepreneurs benefited from the relief for R &amp; D in 2018 than a year earlier.</seg>
<seg id="12">“The amount of deducted costs related to R &amp; D activities amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, which resulted in over PLN 300 million in savings for companies benefiting from this relief.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is the equivalent of the support provided by the National Centre for Research and Development in three editions of GameINN“ , emphasizes the Deputy Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="14">Director of the National Centre for Research and Development Dr. Wojciech Kamieniecki reminds that 78 innovative projects were awarded in two previous co-financing competitions with a total value of over PLN 211.2 million.</seg>
<seg id="15">The great interest in the third competition and the variety of applications submitted show that the video game industry has ideas and competences to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.</seg>
<seg id="16">“It is particularly pleasing that among the selected projects – as in previous editions – there are projects concerning solutions not only for entertainment, but also related to industry 4.0”, he adds.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the third GameINN competition, entrepreneurs, a consortium of entrepreneurs and a consortium of entrepreneurs with scientific units could apply for funding amounting to up to PLN 20 million.</seg>
<seg id="18">The National Centre for Research and Development received 87 applications for the total amount of co-financing of approx. PLN 317 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">The budget of the competition at the time of the announcement of the competition was PLN 100 million, but it was increased, thanks to which 27 projects were granted almost PLN 105 million in funding.</seg>
<seg id="20">Detailed information about the results of the 3 rd GameINN competition is available on the ncbr.gov.pl ncbr.gov.pl website.</seg>
<seg id="21">The GameINN sector programme is implemented under the Smart growth operational programme.</seg>
<seg id="22">NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs associated in the Polish Games agreement, which includes such companies as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober team or 11 bit Studios.</seg>

<seg id="5">The furious Danish did not attend classes the next day, explaining his stomach problems.</seg>
<seg id="6">The case has been puzzling from the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="7">Players in the locker room have private safes at their disposal and the club area is monitored.</seg>

<seg id="9">The 18-year-old has already apologised to Dolberg and other teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.</seg>
<seg id="10">He also promised the Danish to pay back the money for his watch.</seg>
<seg id="11">Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising young players in France.</seg>
<seg id="12">He joined Nice as a three-year-old to make his debut in the first team three years later.</seg>
<seg id="13">He has played seven games this season.</seg>
<seg id="14">He recently signed a professional contract but, according to the L' Equipe newspaper, the club is likely to resolve it with immediate effect.</seg>

<seg id="1">Iran's president says he rejected proposal for talks with US, Donald Trump denies</seg>
<seg id="2">Tehran has not entered into talks with the American side at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, despite the American offer to lift sanctions, Iranian President Hassan Rowhani said on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Us President Donald Trump commented that it was the Iranian side that asked to lift the restrictions, which he did not agree to.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Iranian President Hassan Rowhani, the Americans have proposed lifting all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for negotiating a new international agreement.</seg>
<seg id="5">It would regulate both Iran's nuclear program and its ballistic missile program.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rowhani: Iran will not hold talks under maximum pressure</seg>
<seg id="7">Iran's president said he did not agree to the talks because of the “toxic atmosphere.”</seg>
<seg id="8">He said he had met with American diplomats because he had succumbed to suggestions from France, Germany and the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id="9">But he stressed that Iran would not engage in talks in an atmosphere of “maximum pressure.”</seg>
<seg id="10">“And even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in a 5 +1 format, no one can predict what the final outcome will be,” Rowhani said.</seg>
<seg id="11">A day earlier, the Iranian leader said he did not rule out talks with the US and accused European parties to the nuclear deal of favoring US sanctions on Iran.</seg>
<seg id="12">He added that sanctions imposed on Iran following the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal “are a prerequisite that does not allow” for dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="13">If we can lift this precondition and if America lifts sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America,” he declared.</seg>
<seg id="14">He added that he did not rule out a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, even though he did not agree to such a conversation in the past week at the United Nations General Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="15">Trump: “Iran asked, I said no”</seg>
<seg id="16">President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that he rejected the Iranian request.</seg>
<seg id="17">“Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.</seg>
<seg id="18">Of course I said “no!” the US president tweeted.</seg>
<seg id="19">Tension with nuclear deal in the background</seg>
<seg id="20">France, Germany and Britain are trying to ease tensions between Washington and Tehran in some form to save the 2015 Iran deal, of which they were signatories.</seg>
<seg id="21">It said that in exchange for lifting economic sanctions, Iran would abandon its nuclear weapons program and the nuclear sector would be under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).</seg>
<seg id="22">Since the withdrawal of the US from the agreement in May 2015, other signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to keep the agreement in force.</seg>
<seg id="23">For now, nothing has come out of it.</seg>
<seg id="24">Washington is using tactics to put maximum pressure on Iran, and sanctions also include a full embargo on Iranian oil.</seg>
<seg id="25">Tehran has announced that if it does not receive a permit to export raw material, it will limit its obligations under the agreement every 60 days.</seg>

<seg id="1">The judge of the Provincial Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of heiress Emilia, who, according to her words and screenshots from WhatsApp, participated in stalking against the judges, was reinstated on Wednesday to be adjudicated by the NSA.</seg>
<seg id="2">Reason: disciplinary proceedings have not been initiated against him, so there is no basis for upholding the order of WSA President Wojciech Mazur to remove him from his duties.</seg>
<seg id="3">Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary spokesman for the NSA, opened an investigation into Szmydt at the end of August, but it has not yet turned into a case against him.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although the NSA, which acts as a disciplinary court in such cases, must deal with the decision of the President of the WSA within one month of its release.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this situation, a judge who spoke publicly about his wife's mental problems in order to discredit her, who due to suspicions of participation in the Hejter group was removed from the office of the National Court Register, will return to adjudication and will issue judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.</seg>
<seg id="6">Judge Szmydt denies his involvement in the heir group.</seg>
<seg id="7">He says there is no evidence of this except for the fake screenshots and words of his wife, with whom he divorces.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is exactly what other judges associated with the “caste” say: everyone is innocent, there is no evidence.</seg>
<seg id="9">And quite possibly they will bet on their own.</seg>
<seg id="10">Because prosecutors did not stick a finger to secure evidence from their electronic media, they also remain silent about the contents of Emilia Szmydt's phone, which she stopped in June in another case.</seg>
<seg id="11">Police did not stick a finger to secure the devices of people whom Judge Waldemar Żurek pointed out as persecutors in a February report.</seg>
<seg id="12">There is no evidence - there is no Shmydt case, there is no “caste” case.</seg>
<seg id="13">There is also no case of THE head of THE NIK, Marian Banaś, for renting a tenement house to suteners and hiding income.</seg>
<seg id="14">The CBA is reviewing his property statements.</seg>
<seg id="15">And he will check when he checks.</seg>
<seg id="16">And the Commission of Deputies Ethics will not deal with Banasia, because the Seym is suspended (but the Commission of State control somehow gathered to make a curiosical decision about dismissing the deputies of Banasia and appointing his lawyer as a p.o., although the law does not provide for such a strange combination).</seg>
<seg id="17">The whole thing reminds me of a film novel, American probably, about how my wife comes home and finds her husband with her lover in bed.</seg>
<seg id="18">She is so amazed and devastated that she cannot extort a word.</seg>
<seg id="19">She stands in the door and at that time the lover quickly jumps out of bed, dresses and goes out.</seg>
<seg id="20">And her husband makes a bed.</seg>
<seg id="21">When the wife regains her voice and screams: what is it supposed to be?</seg>
<seg id="22">Who is this woman?</seg>
<seg id="23">The husband calmly asks: What kind of woman, darling?</seg>
<seg id="24">Only that there is a parody of the state in the case of “Kasta” or Banasia.</seg>

<seg id="5">We all pray that he will recover,” an anonymous close person, Kornel Morawiecki, said in an interview with reporters of “Super Express.”</seg>
<seg id="6">In the upcoming elections, the Prime Minister's father is running for the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="7">“My closest family and politics keep me alive,” Kornel Morawiecki said in an interview he gave to reporters two weeks ago, “Super Express.”</seg>
<seg id="8">In January, Super Express reported that 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki had been taken to the military Hospital in Wrocław for testing.</seg>
<seg id="9">“I had strange, disturbing symptoms and I reported to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="10">It came out that I had jaundice.</seg>
<seg id="11">But the worst was in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="12">When a computer tomography examination was performed, it was found that I had pancreatic cancer...“ , said the Prime Minister's father.</seg>
<seg id="13">A few days later, Kornel Morawiecki underwent a serious operation at the MSWiA hospital in Warsaw.</seg>
<seg id="14">As Morawiecki said, president Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain priest Zbigniew Kras to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="15">The operation lasted about three hours and was successful.</seg>
<seg id="16">“I know that many people prayed for me for which I thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="17">Fortunately, I don't have metastases.</seg>
<seg id="18">I don't know if I will undergo chemotherapy yet.</seg>
<seg id="19">I put myself in the hands of specialist doctors who are rather good thinking.</seg>
<seg id="20">For now, after this heavy operation, I have to go back to a state of usability.</seg>
<seg id="21">I hope everything will be fine,” Kornel Morawiecki said in an interview with “SE” in January.</seg>
<seg id="22">“If I had submitted to the investigation too late, the situation would have been tragic and I would have said goodbye to it already...,” he added.</seg>

<seg id="1">The power of leaps.</seg>
<seg id="2">The title of the coverage of the amateur sports competition, played on Sunday afternoon, 15 September on the Hippodrome at Oleandry Street in Oława, may be confusing for some.</seg>
<seg id="3">The road to real power is far away, but this is the name of one of the types of horse rivalry...</seg>
<seg id="4">The competition of the power of jumping consists in the rider and the horse overcoming ever higher obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed even two meters.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is worth noting that the long and still unbeaten world record, set in 1949 by the Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on the horse “Huaso”, is 247 cm.</seg>
<seg id="6">So high in Oława of course nobody jumped, but the result of the best local amazons at the level of 135 cm is also not among the worst...</seg>
<seg id="7">The competition organized by the tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other JKS activists “in the saddle”, constituted a demonstration part of the “Rainbow equestrian competition”, which we write more about in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.</seg>
<seg id="8">Eight amazons joined the competition, training horse riding in the Oława JKS.</seg>
<seg id="9">Four competed on ponies and four on large horses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nikola Szołdra performed best in the first group, sitting on the crazy “Sprinter”.</seg>
<seg id="11">This small but dynamic rumor started from overcoming obstacles spread at a height of 40 cm, and finished only at the stationary with the upper beam 125 cm away from the ground.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he did not give up easily and only after three consecutive refusals was he removed from further competition by the jury of the competition.</seg>
<seg id="13">Second place in pony jumping was taken by Amelia Pawlak, who got “Fama”, and third by Lena Boruń on “Harmider”.</seg>
<seg id="14">The youngest participant of the tournament, Inga Aksman, was ambitious, galloping and jumping over obstacles on the small mare “Carmen”.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even greater emotions accompanied the competing Amazon and spectators during the competition with the participation of large horses.</seg>
<seg id="16">The dangerous-looking falls included Paulina Szewczyk, who sat on the “Declaration” and Anastasia Abramenko, who was riding on the “flight”.</seg>
<seg id="17">Fortunately, apart from the minor bruises, neither the Amazon nor the horses did anything wrong, so they continued to participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="18">A lot of problems with introducing the young mare “Wineta” to the parkour were experienced by Weronika Łuczkiewicz.</seg>
<seg id="19">You needed either a trainer's assist, or another horse for a couple, behind which a little crazy “Wineta” slipped.</seg>
<seg id="20">After passing the obstacle from the parkour, she also descended with a full shaft, so sometimes in the boxes and in the expansion room it was dangerous. “everything is under control!”, calmed Jan Sienkiewicz a little this scared viewers, especially the youngest ones.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since the beginning of the large horses competition Marta Masalska has done a great job on the parkour, sitting down beautifully presenting “Whisky”.</seg>
<seg id="22">This distinguished mare, paired with an experienced Amazon, followed the second approach in the final stage as the first jumped 135 cm and this was the best result of the competition at that moment.</seg>
<seg id="23">After a while, however, the same height also included Paulina Szewczyk on “Declaration”, Weronika Łuczkiewicz on “Wineta” and Anastasia Abramenko on “Lotka”.</seg>
<seg id="24">To decorate Flo and to receive the prizes in the form of equestrian equipment, all these competitors went together, and finally, together with the Amazons on ponies in the tact of Radecki's march, they performed an impressive round of honour, ending this interesting and exciting competition.</seg>
<seg id="25">Thanks</seg>
<seg id="26">Equestrian Sports Club “in the saddle” cordially thanks the sponsors of the competition of the power of the jump during the 16 th “Rainbow equestrian competition”: the Municipal Office in Oława, the Department of water supply and Sewerage in Oława, the county starost and the company “Mustang”.</seg>

<seg id="2">KWW Max Kolonko's Patriotic Revolution is the name of the electoral committee under which Mariusz Max Kolonko's #R Revolution was to go to the October parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="3">The revolution directed its proposal especially to young voters with right-wing views.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the election Kolonko announced cooperation with Marek Jakubiak or Paweł Kukiz, but none of these coalitions happened, and THE KWW itself The Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko did not even manage to collect enough signatures to issue lists in any constituency in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now Kolonko announced on Twitter that he had finished working with KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko.</seg>
<seg id="6">“I will expect the abovementioned KWW to remove my name from the name.</seg>
<seg id="7">I kindly ask you not to connect my person with the aforementioned entity,” he added and announced that he would provide more information soon.</seg>
<seg id="8">For now, it is not known whether the journalist will continue to act, or whether this is the end of the #R Revolution formation.</seg>
<seg id="9">On July 4, on American Independence day, journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko announced the formation of a new political formation, the #R Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="10">In recent years Kolonko has been famous for running the Max TV channel on YouTube, where he comments on events in Poland and around the world.</seg>
<seg id="11">“We have enough politicians, enough of your stupid antics, enough of your amateur governments.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is time for the authorities in the country to take over the nation and rule for the good of the nation,” Kolonko said at the time.</seg>
<seg id="13">The party's agenda included issues related to the judiciary (should be elected in the general election), tax changes (equalization of the tax-free amount for all), war reparations (in the form of military aid for the countries of the eastern flank of NATO, with particular emphasis on Poland), holding a referendum on gun ownership, limiting the number of deputies or introducing single-member constituencies.</seg>
<seg id="14">A few days after the announcement of a new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko began talks with Marek Jakubiak.</seg>
<seg id="15">In late July, Kolonko posted a message on his social media profile suggesting that #R would join forces with the Kukiz '15 movement.</seg>

<seg id="1">UBS: Gold close to balance point</seg>
<seg id="2">“The euro exchange rate will remain near the PLN 4.35 ceiling in the coming months, accompanied by a weak economic situation in global markets,” says Michael Bolliger of UBS wealth Management.</seg>
<seg id="3">“The expectations of maintaining a solid pace of economic growth and stable monetary policy are in favour of stabilizing the zloty quotations at the current ceiling,” the specialist said in an interview with Bankier.pl Bankier.pl.</seg>
<seg id="4">In his opinion, despite clear inflationary pressures, the Monetary policy Council will not decide to raise rates in an environment in which the vast majority of central banks soften policy.</seg>
<seg id="5">“While the zloty is properly valued – euro quotations should remain near the ceiling of PLN 4.35 in the coming months – Polish bonds are hardly attractive, according to him.</seg>
<seg id="6">Much more favorable yields than Polish securities are offered by emerging-market bonds,” says Michael Bolliger, head of emerging-market asset allocation at UBS wealth Management.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the deterioration of the global economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="8">“The global slowdown may get even worse, but there should not be a severe recession, and at most the GDP dynamics should go down slightly below zero,” says Michael Bolliger.</seg>
<seg id="9">“Investors should underestimate global stocks that may be hurt by the lack of prospects for resolving the US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including Donald Trump's impeachment process and Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="10">“Europe should behave relatively weakly among equity markets,” according to a recent letter to investors by UBS wealth Management chief executive Mark Haefele.</seg>
<seg id="11">“Shares in eurozone countries should behave worse than the US because they are more vulnerable in conditions of increased uncertainty around global trade and fears of a slowdown,” the document reads.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to Michael Bolliger, after the hossa in the bond markets of the safest countries pushed the yields of the German 10-year-old to minus 0.74 per cent, it is still possible to deepen the decline in profitability.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the long term, however, the profitability of long-term securities should no longer decrease, but only in the short term, thanks to the easing of banks' monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Fed has the biggest room for rate cuts, which should lead to a weakening of the US currency in the next few years.</seg>
<seg id="15">The long-term balance point for the euro is a ceiling of USD 1.29, which would mean a 19 percent potential to strengthen the single currency against the dollar.</seg>
<seg id="16">We expect further Fed rate cuts, which will result in a reduction in global monetary policy differences.</seg>
<seg id="17">“Maintaining the strength of the dollar in the long term may not be allowed by current and budget deficits,” says Michael Bolliger.</seg>

<seg id="1">Majorca counts losses after Thomas Cook travel agency goes bankrupt</seg>
<seg id="2">More than 25 thousand foreign tourists will not arrive on holiday in Majorca in October as a result of the bankruptcy announced by travel agency Thomas Cook on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="3">As Marc Pons, the representative of the Autonomous Balearic Government, informed on Friday, among 25 thousand holidaymakers who will not be able to take advantage of the October holiday in Majorca, there are also people who were supposed to travel with companies indirectly connected with Thomas Cook, such as Neckermann.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pons explained that 80 per cent of expected holidaymakers who, due to the bankruptcy of a British company, had to give up their holiday in Majorca next month are German and Scandinavian nationals.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, according to Pons, as Thomas Cook did not direct tourists to the ballet island between November and April, the losses to the local economy will be smaller.</seg>
<seg id="6">He revealed that the Balearic government had already begun negotiations with international operators about “entering the Majorca market” after the British operator went bankrupt.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Diario de Mallorca newspaper estimates that more than 1,000 people will lose their jobs in October due to the tourist crisis in Majorca.</seg>
<seg id="8">About 800 are dismissed employees of Thomas Cook's office in Palma.</seg>
<seg id="9">Other people will lose their jobs mainly in the hospitality sector.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Monday, with Thomas Cook declaring bankruptcy at many hotels in Majorca, property owners demanded that guests pay an additional accommodation fee.</seg>
<seg id="11">This situation was experienced, among others, by dozens of tourists from Poland.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Balearic government estimates that by Thursday, dozens of hotels in Majorca had halted operations until at least the end of October following the bankruptcy announcement by Thomas Cook and its cooperating companies.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile, Friday's Diario de Ibiza newspaper points out that most of the hotels operating in Ibiza, which have worked with Thomas Cook, are not expected to close facilities in the coming weeks.</seg>
<seg id="14">The newspaper recalls that on this ballet island the British bankrupt cooperated with 42 hotels.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Wednesday, the autonomous authorities in the Balearic Islands announced that they would ask the Spanish government to support the region with €100 million to cover losses caused by the announcement of bankruptcy by travel agency Thomas Cook.</seg>
<seg id="16">They revealed that the majority of tourists affected in this archipelago, about 36 thousand people, are located in Majorca.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to data from the Balearic government, Thomas Cook owes local travel companies, mainly hotel operators, around €5 million for the implementation of contracts for the period July-September 2019.</seg>

<seg id="1">Dakar: The largest mosque in West Africa opened</seg>
<seg id="2">Tens of thousands of people from across Senegal gathered in the capital on Friday for the inauguration of a huge mosque, considered the largest in West Africa.</seg>
<seg id="3">Muslims arrived by buses, cars and on foot to the BOPP district, where a new mosque was erected, which could accommodate 30 thousand believers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The building was built by the Mouride Brotherhood, which belongs to the Sufi Islamic movement, which dominates Senegal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Work on the mosque began ten years ago in a wetland area of six hectares, handed over by the government.</seg>
<seg id="6">The name of the mosque Masalikul Jinan (“paths to Paradise”) is derived from a poem by Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the 19 th-century founder of the fraternity, venerated by followers as a saint.</seg>
<seg id="7">The mosque is covered with Carrarian marble and has five minarets.</seg>
<seg id="8">The highest of them is 78 meters.</seg>
<seg id="9">The mosque in the middle will accommodate 15 thousand believers, and the second one can stay on the outside Esplanade.</seg>
<seg id="10">In richly finished interiors you can admire the gilded dome, giant chandeliers and decorations handmade by workers from Morocco.</seg>
<seg id="11">Builders say the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but there is no comparison to mosques in other regions anyway.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Morocco, Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca can accommodate 105 thousand believers.</seg>
<seg id="13">The construction of the mosque, which cost more than €30 million, was financed by private donations.</seg>
<seg id="14">The government, in addition to the land, funded lighting, sanitation and financed road works worth €10.5 million.</seg>

<seg id="1">Coach Smyła: our problem is not Silesia, but ourselves</seg>
<seg id="2">A streak of eight league games without victory, the Crown players will try to break in Friday's meeting with the vice-leader of the Silesian Premier League.</seg>
<seg id="3">“Our problem is not Wrocław, but ourselves, we have to work on what we are playing,” said Kielce coach Mirosław Smyła.</seg>
<seg id="4">Players of the Crown last and so far the only victory in the league recorded in the first round, when on away defeated 1-0 beniaminka Raków Częstochowa.</seg>
<seg id="5">Later, the Knicks recorded two draws and six defeats, and on Tuesday they lost 1-0 to Zagłębie Lubin in the 1/32 Polish Cup final.</seg>
<seg id="6">“It makes me optimistic that in the final seconds of the knockout match the players were fighting for a goal, they wanted a draw.</seg>
<seg id="7">Their fall on the turf after the final whistle was not due to the collapse, but it was a fall of anger because they were so close,” Smyła said.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he pointed out, Silesia has very strong wings, so it will sensitize the team to play in the side sectors of the pitch.</seg>
<seg id="9">“We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we are also looking at what we want to play,” added the coach.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Friday's game in the Crown will certainly not play pausing for excess yellow cards Ognjen Gnjatic, the squad will also run out of injured Jakub Żubrowski and Michael Gardawski.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, it is encouraging to report several players with a desire to play in a knockout match.</seg>
<seg id="12">“We have a headache, recently it seemed that it would not be, and now it is,” Smyła said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Crown defender Daniel Dziwniel stressed that Silesia will not be an easy rival to break the streak of eight league games in a row without a win, while in the Premier League anyone can win against anyone.</seg>
<seg id="14">“We are a good team.</seg>
<seg id="15">We may not be showing it on the pitch in recent weeks, but the moment will come that we will win and we believe it will be on Friday,” the footballer said.</seg>
<seg id="16">After nine queues of extra-class, the Crown with the achievements of five points ranks 15 th.</seg>
<seg id="17">Silesia has accumulated 12 more and ranks second.</seg>

<seg id="1">These trees can completely disappear from Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">“42% of the tree species that make up Europe's stands are at risk,” warns the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in its “European Red book of trees” published on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the top of the list are, among others, chestnuts and raspberries.</seg>
<seg id="4">IUCN, an organization based in Gland, Switzerland, publishes a list of endangered species of European trees for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was drawn up by specialists who, on the basis of research, concluded that of the 454 tree species found in Europe (and elsewhere in the world) 42% are “highly endangered”.</seg>
<seg id="6">Among the reasons, the Red paper mentions the rapid growth of urban agglomerations and global climate change.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, those trees and shrubs that occur only or mainly on our continent are most at risk.</seg>
<seg id="8">As far as typically European stands are concerned, 58% of species are at risk, according to IUCN specialists, and 15%, 66 species of trees and shrubs, are threatened with extinction.</seg>
<seg id="9">Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red paper lists errors in the exploitation of trees, accelerated urbanization, too intensive logging, followed by forest fires and changes in the European ecosystem.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of shrubs, mosses and lichens is also strongly endangered.</seg>
<seg id="11">“The consequences of human activity lead to the gradual disappearance of European plant species and pose a danger in Europe of the extinction of important and underestimated varieties that form the basis of European ecosystems and affect the health of our planet”, summed up the report by Luc Bas, who heads the European IUCN office.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grzegorz Schetyna: I do not promise 600 +</seg>
<seg id="2">“Today the law and Justice party wants to bribe Poles by offering them for their freedom distribution on credit, which will have to be repaid by future generations”, says Grzegorz Schetyna in an interview for “Rzeczpospolita”.</seg>
<seg id="3">In his opinion, “the whole PiS policy is a pic”.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the same time, the politician promises that “what is given will not be taken away.”</seg>
<seg id="5">Schetyna assures in an interview with Jacek Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea to defeat law and Justice.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's about mobilising the electorate at the ballot box.</seg>
<seg id="7">In his opinion, the opposition has more potential in this area than the Kaczynski party.</seg>
<seg id="8">“Today there are more conscious people who want to live in a normal country than supporters of the law and Justice party, a party which has betrayed the values proclaimed, such as modesty, humility and transparency”, says Schetyna.</seg>
<seg id="9">The leader of the Civic Coalition and the chairman of the Civic platform also emphasized the basic assumptions of the KO electoral programme.</seg>
<seg id="10">“Firstly, nothing that data will be received, but it is necessary to set a direction for the future, because the law and Justice party deals exclusively with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which can be seen even after dramatically low investments”, he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Secondly, it is about “activating the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work fairly - and those who are entrepreneurial”.</seg>
<seg id="12">Schetyna explains that the program of the KO included, among others, a project that will give the least-earning Poles more about 614 zlotys per hand, and more earners – also several hundred.</seg>
<seg id="13">The politician also pointed out that he did not want to race for a handout.</seg>
<seg id="14">As he said, he will do as much as he can do, but he does not promise 600 +.</seg>
<seg id="15">“I will never allow a Greek variant where the government bidded with the opposition for distribution until the financial collapse of the country finally took place,” he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">In an interview with “Rz” Schetyna also stated that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.</seg>
<seg id="17">“We would expose their hypocrisy and propaganda,” he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">“Pride walks before the fall.</seg>

<seg id="2">Six dead large condors have been found in the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, reports TVN24.</seg>
<seg id="3">Specialists believe that human activity has contributed to their deaths.</seg>
<seg id="4">Large condors were probably poisoned with a means to kill predators such as pumas, foxes and wild dogs.</seg>
<seg id="5">Animals could eat toxic carcasses.</seg>
<seg id="6">Apart from one young individual, the rest of the dead condors were adults.</seg>
<seg id="7">“This is a big loss for the environment, because the condor must reach 10-15 years in order to become fertile and able to reproduce.</seg>
<seg id="8">So we are losing a protected species, an endangered species,” says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentine environmental organisation.</seg>
<seg id="9">“I think that the use of toxic bait and poison not only puts this species at risk, but all other forms of life, including human health,” he adds.</seg>

<seg id="2">The police action will be carried out, among others, at the intersection of Cieplińskiego Avenue and Piłsudskiego Avenue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Uniformed actions are somehow related to recent complaints by the city authorities about drivers not always able to behave properly at the intersection.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Friday, September 27, police officers begin preventive actions in Rzeszów “passable intersections”.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is about eliminating traffic obstacles: entering the intersection without the possibility of exit, failure to comply with traffic signals or traffic signs.</seg>
<seg id="6">“We often think that we are alone at the intersection, and in fact we make life difficult for other drivers,” Marek Ustrobiński, the city's vice president, said a few days ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">His words echoed at a town hall press conference, where city authorities presented examples of inadequate movement of cars at intersections, resulting in traffic jams.</seg>
<seg id="8">At that time, the president appealed to travelers for common sense on the road and, among other things, faster traffic lights or not writing text messages while driving.</seg>
<seg id="9">The theme was somehow taken over by Rzeszów police officers, who from today start the action “passable intersections”.</seg>
<seg id="10">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="11">The aim of the action is to eliminate the phenomenon of constraints on crossings by drivers entering them without the possibility to continue driving.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is a common offence, which contributes to the intensification of traffic difficulties and the creation of traffic jams.</seg>
<seg id="13">He is threatened with a fine of 300 PLN and 2 penalty points.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, the uniform will pay attention to non-compliance with traffic signals or traffic signs and incorrect parking in the area of intersections.</seg>
<seg id="15">They will also observe the lack of smoothness of driving, late movement from under the signaling devices, free passage of intersections and leaving too long distances between vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="16">At what intersections will actions be carried out?</seg>
<seg id="17">Among others, on Lisa-Kula Street from Jagiellońska Street; Cieplińskiego Avenue from Piłsudskiego Avenue; Targowa Street from Piłsudskiego Avenue; Śreniawit Square from Dąbrowskiego Street or Hetmańska Street from Warsaw insurgents Avenue.</seg>

<seg id="3">52 senators voted in favour of the amendment to the Act on the assets of families of state officials - without amendments - 14 were against, three abstained.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thus, senators decided to reject 12 amendments tabled during Wednesday's debate by the senator after Sławomir Rybicki.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to him, the amendments were to “civilize” the act and limit the scope of information provided in the statement about the property situation of own children, spouse's children, children adapted to cases in which children remain in a common household with a person obliged to make a statement.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Act on the transparency of the assets of the families of the most important state officials, whose project was created in the prime minister's office, was passed by the Sejm on 11 September.</seg>
<seg id="7">The provisions stipulate that, among others, the prime minister, ministers, deputies, MEPs, senators, presidents of: the Constitutional Tribunal, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as persons leading other state institutions will be obliged to include information on the personal property of spouses, children and persons in common life in a property statement.</seg>

<seg id="12">Under the law, any presidential flight will be a flight “carried out on an official mission.”</seg>
<seg id="13">The president's flights will be accompanied by family members and other people invited by the president.</seg>
<seg id="14">On the other hand, the flight in the official mission of the Prime Minister and the Marshals of the Sejm and Senate will be only a flight “carried out in order to carry out tasks directly related to the performed function”.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Act also clarifies the list of persons who may accompany the most important persons in the country during the flight.</seg>

<seg id="2">Polish volleyball players held their first training session in Paris on Friday, where they will play in a bronze medal match on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Vital Heynen's side closed their way to winning the title with Thursday's 1-3 defeat to Slovenia in Ljubljana.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was loud about their trouble travelling to this duel.</seg>
<seg id="5">This time it happened without such problems – on Friday morning they went with the Slovenes charter to Paris, and a few hours later they had a training in the famous Bercy hall.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to reports of people attending classes, the world champion trainer was upset.</seg>
<seg id="7">As Heynen's assistant Michał Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not to exercise the volleyball elements.</seg>
<seg id="8">“We went to the hall, but in the vast majority it was time for the team.</seg>
<seg id="9">The idea was to spend it more together than to train.</seg>
<seg id="10">Talk, think about how to rebuild it all as a team,” he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">He confirmed that the semi-final defeat was a painful lesson for both the players and the coaching staff.</seg>
<seg id="12">“We were brutally brought to the ground.</seg>
<seg id="13">Without two sentences, we are disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="14">We still believed we would go back to this match.</seg>
<seg id="15">We discussed this match with each other in the squad, the coach talked a lot with the players.</seg>
<seg id="16">As two main reasons for failure I would point out ineffectiveness in attack and much worse than usual dealing with situational balls.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Slovenes were much better than us in this respect,” he analysed.</seg>
<seg id="18">In his opinion, “White and Red” was not hindered by the stress associated with the performance against the co-hosts of the tournament supported by loud and numerous audiences.</seg>
<seg id="19">He admitted that the world champions could sleep a bit on a smooth path to the semi-finals.</seg>
<seg id="20">“Perhaps if we had a similar-style defeat in the group stage, we would have analysed this lesson more quickly and then we would have played differently in the next phase of the tournament.</seg>
<seg id="21">But it's just bullying,” he said.</seg>
<seg id="22">Gogol hopes that the anger associated with Thursday's defeat will turn the Poles into aggression in the bronze match.</seg>
<seg id="23">“I hope we show our true face then.</seg>
<seg id="24">There is something to fight for.</seg>
<seg id="25">We recently won THE ME medal in 2011,” he recalled.</seg>
<seg id="26">Paris is the fifth city and France is the third country visited by Poles during these championships.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the group stage they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, for the first two group stage meetings they went to Apeldoorn, and for the semi-final they moved to Ljubljana.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nick Kyrgios: penalty harsh but in suspension</seg>
<seg id="2">The Australian tennis player received a 16-week ban and a $25 thousand fine - in a six-month suspension - for reprehensible words, gestures and deeds at recent ATP tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="3">ATP World Tour activists lose patience with Kyrgios but still give him a chance to improve.</seg>
<seg id="4">The summary of the misdeeds of the most unchallenged professional tennis player in recent years looks threatening - 16 weeks of break plus a big fine, but both penalties are suspended for half a year - a trial period in which a stubborn athlete will be able to improve.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nick Kyrgios is only 24, but has been brewing for a long time and has earned a kind of tennis world record - he had to pay the highest single financial penalty in the history of discipline for breaking the rules of behaviour on the court and next to him.</seg>
<seg id="6">Loud curses, strange gestures, unsportsmanlike behavior, insulting the referee and spectators, breaking two rockets during a loss to Karen Khachanov - for all this after the August ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati paid 113 thousand dollars.</seg>
<seg id="7">He also did not play long at the 2019 US Open, but was able to publicly say that ATP activists “are corrupt,” which hurt the organization's authorities so much that they implemented a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and after a few weeks gave the verdict about suspending starts and another mane.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, he was forgiven for his words about corruption after listening to the accused and knowing the context of his statement.</seg>
<seg id="9">In a statement, however, tennis activists said that the investigation showed Kyrgios' behaviour over the past 12 months in many cases raised serious reservations and constituted an almost continuous violation of the rules that he repeatedly insulted tournament-related players and spectators in a vulgar manner, hence the high punishment.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately postponed his sentence, ordering several conditions to be met within the next six months: Kyrgios can no longer violate the rules of the code of conduct of professional tennis players in the ATP Tour and ATP challenge Tour tournaments, in particular he can no longer curse, destroy rockets, argue with judges and the public, or any other way to behave obscene and vulgar.</seg>
<seg id="11">He also received a recommendation that he seek “continuous support” from mental trainers during tournaments and also consulted outside the season with people specializing in solving the problems of athletes not coping with proper behavior.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nick Kyrgios's first comment (on social media) on the verdict was: “Hey everyone, I can still play.</seg>
<seg id="13">I just have to control my behavior, that's all.”</seg>
<seg id="14">In practice, the Australian will have at least a two-week break as his shoulder injury worsened in the Laver Cup, so he had to give up his upcoming starts in Beijing (September 30 - October 6) and Shanghai (October 6-13).</seg>
<seg id="15">Kyrgios is ranked 27 th in the ATP rankings.</seg>
<seg id="16">He won two tournaments this year - in Washington and Acapulco, he earned more than 1.3 million dollars, so even after the fines he will have a lot left.</seg>

<seg id="1">CSO: Poland is living better and better</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the report on household budgets published by THE CENTRAL STATISTICAL OFFICE on Friday, 44% of households rated their material situation as good or rather good in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="3">A year earlier, this percentage was 37.2%, 33.5% in 2016, and previously, since 2009, when the statistical office first examined subjective assessments of the situation of households, it has never exceeded 30%.</seg>
<seg id="4">A total of 8.1% of households considered their material situation to be bad or rather bad, compared to 11.2% a year earlier and over 20% in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="5">The best is the material situation of households of self-employed people.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this group, more than 70% of respondents consider it good or rather good.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the other pole there are households of pensioners, where the percentage of such answers was only 18%.</seg>
<seg id="8">The subjective assessment of the material situation of households is also influenced by the number of children.</seg>
<seg id="9">Parents raising offspring alone are worst known, of whom 32% declare a good or rather good material situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among couples with children, this percentage varies (depending on the number of children) from 55 to 60%, and among childless households it is 48.8%.</seg>
<seg id="11">The effect of the 500 + programme is clearly visible in these statistics.</seg>
<seg id="12">Before it was launched (in 2016), parents raising offspring and large families (with at least three children) assessed the worst material situation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The improvement of subjective assessments of the material situation of Poles reflects a rapid increase in income, mainly from work.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, that is not all, because the percentage of households who consider their situation to be good is increasing faster than real income.</seg>
<seg id="15">Moreover, at the level of voivodships there is no clear correlation between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households.</seg>
<seg id="16">The best assessments are formulated by inhabitants of the Opolskie Voivodeship, where 48.9% of respondents consider their situation to be good or rather good.</seg>
<seg id="17">Next are Lubuskie (47.7%), Silesian (47.6%), Mazowieckie (47.3%) and Zachodniopomorskie (47.1%).</seg>
<seg id="18">Meanwhile, in Opole, disposable income (i.e. after paying taxes and contributions) amounted to less than 94% of the national average last year, and 98% in Lubuskie.</seg>
<seg id="19">Residents of Mazowiecki (120% of the national average) and Silesia (104%) had the highest income.</seg>
<seg id="20">On average in Poland disposable income per person in 2018 amounted to PLN 1693.</seg>
<seg id="21">In real terms (after adjusting the impact of price changes) it increased by 4.3% compared to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="22">Compared to previous years, this is a fairly low result.</seg>
<seg id="23">In 2016, income per person increased by 7% and a year later by 6.3%.</seg>
<seg id="24">While revenue growth slows down, it also hampers spending growth.</seg>
<seg id="25">Those per person amounted to PLN 1187 last year, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7%.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is the first such case since 2013.</seg>
<seg id="27">In 2017, expenditure per person increased in real terms by 1.9% and in 2016 by 4.3%.</seg>
<seg id="28">Household budgets surveys suggest that the statistical household currently spends 70.1% of its disposable income, while in 2014 this share exceeded 80%, and by 2006 it exceeded 90%.</seg>

<seg id="1">Niesiołowski critical of the pope.</seg>
<seg id="2">John Paul II did nothing</seg>
<seg id="3">In an interview with Piotr Lekszycki, Stefan Niesiołowski emphasized that in 1981 John Paul II was a great authority for opposition activists.</seg>
<seg id="4">“Actually, every sentence was accepted.”</seg>
<seg id="5">Later there was criticism of some of his actions.</seg>
<seg id="6">“for me, the fact that John Paul II could not liquidate the harmful activity of Rydzyk places a great shadow on his pontificate.</seg>
<seg id="7">After all, this Redemptorist – a pest of the Church and Poland – developed his media into the best still in the life of the Polish pope ', he explained.</seg>
<seg id="8">The former politician of the Civic platform admitted: 'There were murmurs of dissatisfaction, the pope said something, once Rydzyk did not accept, but he had authority and he could simply throw him out of the Church for politics or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor there.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, John Paul II did not do it, similarly his successor ', Niesiołowski explained.</seg>
<seg id="10">“Besides, there was this fatal matter of pedophilia and actions of the Church, or rather their lack.</seg>
<seg id="11">I ran forward a little bit, but I wanted to draw attention to the whole of his life.</seg>
<seg id="12">We have known about the scale of pedophilia in the Church relatively recently.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question arises how it is possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting matters', says Niesiołowski in an interview with a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to the former politician, the Polish Church is an ally of the law and Justice party.</seg>
<seg id="15">“One must admit that during the period of Solidarity the Church was our most important ally.</seg>
<seg id="16">All ceremonies started with Holy Mass, crosses were hanging everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now these crosses are written, they have become a symbol of dictatorship – a sign of the regime in writing.</seg>
<seg id="18">I repeat: one of the biggest unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk are shaking the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing about it and that today the Church is an ally of the law and Justice party.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is a black chapter of the Polish Church, for which he will pay a lot ', Niesiołowski argued.</seg>
<seg id="20">“I hope that pope Francis is chasing Jędraszewski, Rydzyk and a few others of this kind”, he concluded.</seg>

<seg id="2">Griffin disqualified</seg>
<seg id="3">The clash within the Polish Cup between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechia Gdańsk for a small hair did not end tragically when Zlatan Alomerović, the goalkeeper of the opposing team, was fired by fans from Wejherowo Raca by millimeters.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the incident, the match was interrupted for 20 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="5">The PZPN committee investigating the case imposed a severe penalty on the Griffin, excluding him from future games.</seg>
<seg id="6">The club will not be able to compete in the Polish Cup in the season 2020/2021.</seg>
<seg id="7">Additionally, fans will not be allowed into their own stadium in the next match.</seg>
<seg id="8">They will also not be allowed to leave groups for league matches until December 31.</seg>
<seg id="9">The storms at the Widzew Łódź stadium were also caused by fans of Silesia Wrocław.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here, however, the judgment of the PZPN was milder, because Silesia warned that similar events could occur and sensitized the relevant authorities in this matter.</seg>
<seg id="11">Nevertheless, the services allowed to throw the sector of Łódź fans in racks, set fire to chairs and push the host sector.</seg>
<seg id="12">The match was interrupted for eight minutes and the intervening police had to use water cannon.</seg>
<seg id="13">PZPN punished Silesia with a one-time stadium ban in the nearest match in the Polish Cup and prohibited the organization of trips to matches including the next edition of the PP.</seg>

<seg id="4">In Podkarpacie, the implementation of the amendment to the Regulation of the Ministry of infrastructure on, among others, saving the names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish began.</seg>
<seg id="5">For example, “Lviv” will appear next to “L' viv”.</seg>
<seg id="6">In our voivodship changes will be introduced on 94 road signs set at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.</seg>
<seg id="7">As we hear, it is supposed to be easier, clearer and simpler.</seg>
<seg id="8">The new guidelines result from the amendment to the Regulation of the Minister of infrastructure on detailed technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety devices.</seg>
<seg id="9">“We should remember that the names of towns in neighbouring countries often have a Polish sound.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thanks to the change prepared by us in the law, they will finally appear on signposts on our roads.</seg>
<seg id="11">We begin the introduction of the new marking with the Podkarpackie section of the A4 motorway“ , informed the Minister of infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Podkarpacie, changes will be introduced on 94 road signs set at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.</seg>
<seg id="13">Total investment cost?</seg>
<seg id="14">200 thousand zlotys.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the first place, the new marking will be implemented on the A4 motorway, which is planned by 1 November 2019.</seg>
<seg id="16">What is the idea supposed to look like?</seg>
<seg id="17">It will work without changing tables, on the basis of paste.</seg>
<seg id="18">They will replace the currently functioning names of the locality with new ones written in Polish on existing characters.</seg>
<seg id="19">Both names will be written in one row – first in Polish, then in the original, in brackets.</seg>

<seg id="1">Gowin: “We need to stimulate Polish small trade”</seg>
<seg id="2">“Effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will be necessary to consider whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade”, said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and higher Education, leader of the agreement Jarosław Gowin on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">During an interview in “signals of the day” on Radio One, Gowin stated that trade is controlled by international networks, which impose such low margins on Polish producers that Polish companies cannot actually develop.</seg>
<seg id="4">Noting that it is very difficult to fight this problem, the Deputy Prime Minister reminded that the government of the law and Justice party tried to deal with it at the very beginning of the term of office, but got 'a counter from THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION'.</seg>
<seg id="5">“We won before the court of justice and I hope that if the United right wins the next election and forms a government, we will come back to that,” he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the same time, he emphasized that “effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the Polish problem, i.e. small trade”.</seg>
<seg id="7">“It will be necessary to consider whether the government, the state, has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade,” Gowin said.</seg>
<seg id="8">In May, an EU court ruled that the European Commission had made a mistake in recognising that the Polish retail tax was prohibited state aid.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Retail sales tax Act assumed the introduction of two rates of trade tax: 0.8% on income between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4% on income over PLN 170 million per month.</seg>
<seg id="10">The tax was supposed to apply from September 2016.</seg>
<seg id="11">IN September 2016, THE EC initiated infringement proceedings against Poland.</seg>
<seg id="12">Brussels then argued that the tax structure could favour smaller shops, which could be considered public aid.</seg>
<seg id="13">She then stated that the tribute had been implemented in an unlawful manner.</seg>
<seg id="14">It also issued an order to suspend the tax until officials in Brussels have completed its analysis.</seg>
<seg id="15">Poland did not agree with this position, but the tax collection was suspended.</seg>
<seg id="16">May's decision by the EU court opened the way for a reintroduction of the tax, but did not end the case.</seg>
<seg id="17">On 24 July, the Commission lodged an appeal before the Court of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="18">On Thursday, the TSUE press service told PAP that the case is now at a written stage in which both the European Commission and the Polish government present their arguments in writing.</seg>
<seg id="19">For now, it is not known whether and when the oral procedure will start, that is, hearing the parties and a possible hearing.</seg>
<seg id="20">It takes a good few to several months to appeal the verdict.</seg>
<seg id="21">“This procedure takes an average of a year,” a source at the Luxembourg Tribunal told PAP.</seg>

<seg id="1">How to dress a child for baptism?</seg>
<seg id="2">We suggest some practical solutions</seg>
<seg id="3">Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of the infant and his parents.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is often the first occasion when the whole family focuses around the child, celebrating his appearance in the world.</seg>
<seg id="5">No wonder the freshly baked mum and dad want their consolation to look as good as possible on this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, before you make a final decision about your child's costume, consider whether it will also be comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="7">In shops you can find many steep sets that do not provide the toddler with proper comfort.</seg>
<seg id="8">So what should we pay attention to?</seg>
<seg id="9">The basic criterion for choosing clothing for baptism is the age of the child</seg>
<seg id="10">Until recently, several weeks old babies were baptized, dressed in white sets and put into the same beads or big pillows.</seg>
<seg id="11">Today, children joining the sacrament are often older: several months old, annual and even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is not difficult to guess that such a big consolation needs a slightly different dress for baptism.</seg>
<seg id="13">So if your child is 3-4 months old on the day of baptism, he will probably spend the feast in a stroller or in the hands of his parents or godparents.</seg>
<seg id="14">The best solution will therefore be to tune it into comfortable, cotton sleeping bags or sets.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although this item of clothing is considered to be a daily outfit, it is enough to search for its festive variants, for example with a flank or lace.</seg>
<seg id="16">For the boy, the body with the printing of flies and shells will prove ideal.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the case of older children, you can afford more fantasy in clothing.</seg>
<seg id="18">The girl will look lovely in a simple, tulle dress</seg>
<seg id="19">Many parents of girls with difficulty look towards richly decorated, wavy dresses for baptism complete with coats, armbands and caps.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers use artificial, non-breathable materials in which the child is simply uncomfortable.</seg>
<seg id="21">In search of the right clothes, it will be better to look at the Asanti for kids store, which offers elegant outfits on cotton lining.</seg>

<seg id="23">Perfect outfit for a little gentleman: cotton suit</seg>
<seg id="24">Until recently, there was fashion among boys' parents for suits that were a copy of “adult” models.</seg>
<seg id="25">Polyester jackets and trousers, rigid collar or cuffs often caused young elegants to loudly demonstrate their dissatisfaction.</seg>

<seg id="1">Vote on a break in the debates for the Conservative Party conference</seg>
<seg id="2">British MPs voted against a three-day break in the House of Commons for the Conservative Party's annual programme conference, which the government has requested.</seg>
<seg id="3">289 members voted in favour, 306 against.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is customary that the House of Commons does not meet at party conferences so that MPs do not have to resign from either participating in them or sitting in parliament.</seg>
<seg id="5">But opposition parties said that at such a crucial time as the last few weeks before Britain's scheduled exit from the European Union on October 31, parliament should not interrupt the talks.</seg>
<seg id="6">The government's request for a break was supported by 289 MPs, against 306.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two opposition parties after conventions</seg>
<seg id="8">The lack of approval for the break could be seen as a political revenge by the opposition to Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday, the decision was deemed unlawful and non-existent by the Supreme Court) and for refusing to apologise for it after the judges' ruling.</seg>
<seg id="9">Following the ruling, the House of Commons resumed its session on Wednesday, with Johnson's speech and subsequent turbulent debate the most important event of the day.</seg>
<seg id="10">Johnson accused the opposition of blocking Brexit and avoiding early elections.</seg>
<seg id="11">“It's time to deliver Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="12">It needs to be implemented to respect the result of the referendum.</seg>
<seg id="13">Brexit must come so that we can deal with the agreement on citizens' priorities, on health care, on the cost of living.</seg>
<seg id="14">Brexit must be implemented so that we can unite this country,” Johnson said.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Conservative Party conference is due to begin in Manchester next Sunday and run until Wednesday 2 October.</seg>
<seg id="16">Conferences between the two main opposition parties - Labour and the Liberal Democrats - have already taken place.</seg>
<seg id="17">One of the reasons Johnson gave in explaining such a lengthy suspension of parliament was just party conferences.</seg>

<seg id="2">“President Andrzej Duda believes that anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders,” foreign media write.</seg>
<seg id="3">A spokesman for the president strongly denied the reports.</seg>
<seg id="4">“It's simply not true,” Błażej Spychalski wrote on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="5">Israeli media, including “Haaretz” and “Jerusalem Post”, citing “Jewish Insider”, write that during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora at the Polish Consulate in New York, Andrzej Duda stated that Israel was responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="6">The president said the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland was a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.</seg>
<seg id="7">He referred to the words of Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, who said in February that “Poles sent anti-Semitism with breast milk.”</seg>
<seg id="8">Andrzej Duda said he regretted that Israel had not apologized for the humiliating statements of its politicians.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also mentioned the act of aggression against the Polish ambassador to Israel Marek Magierowski.</seg>
<seg id="10">In May, he was attacked by a striker who shouted: “Pole, Pole.”</seg>
<seg id="11">“The quote is not just inaccurate.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's simply not true,” Błażej Spychalski wrote on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="13">He stressed that Duda “never said that Israel was responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.”</seg>
<seg id="14">According to Spychalski, the portal “invented it”.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the interlocutors, DURING the meeting there was also a dispute between the Holocaust survivor, awarded the Commander's Cross of the order of merit of the Republic of Poland Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mosberg was to agree with the words of President Duda and say that it was Jews from Israel “like Israel Kac” who were responsible for the rise of anti-Semitism.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to sources, Boteach was supposed to interrupt Mosberg's statement.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who is Banaś and what did he blame?</seg>
<seg id="2">The tenement house rented by the containers led the journalist to discover the negligence in Marian Banaś's property statements.</seg>
<seg id="3">We are summing up another scandal that has shaken the ruling camp.</seg>
<seg id="4">Journalists of the “Supervisor” TVN revealed that Marian Banaś, the president of the Supreme Chamber of control, has not entered into the property statement of the 400-metre tenement house, which is located in Krakow Podgórze in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="5">What's more, his tenant was supposed to run a sexbusiness in the aforementioned tenement house (i.e. rent rooms for hours).</seg>
<seg id="6">In turn, the building itself has allegedly been a collateral for the repayment of the loan since 2016.</seg>
<seg id="7">Bertold Kittel pointed out the irregularities in the “Supervisor” program.</seg>
<seg id="8">The journalist revealed that from Banasia the tenement house was rented by people connected with the criminal world in order to use it as a place of 'erotic meetings'.</seg>
<seg id="9">Customers were supposed to be men using prostitutes.</seg>
<seg id="10">He answered the allegations vaguely and vaguely.</seg>
<seg id="11">Interestingly, the tenement house rented by the suteners led the journalist to discover the negligence in Banasia's property statements.</seg>
<seg id="12">The house itself was described vaguely in them, and the income from its rental was to be underestimated.</seg>
<seg id="13">“The property of Marian Banaś and his wife may be worth 6 to 8 million PLN.</seg>
<seg id="14">In total, spouses can boast of two houses, three apartments, savings [...]“ , writes Money.pl Money.pl.</seg>
<seg id="15">And according to the analysis of the portal, the Banasia tenement house itself was worth about PLN 3 million.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Central anti-corruption Bureau is currently conducting an audit of Marian Banasia's wealth statements for 2015-2019.</seg>
<seg id="17">Banaś announced that he would suspend his activities in NIK until it was completed. “I will apply to the Marshal for free leave,” he assured.</seg>
<seg id="18">The opposition demands explanations.</seg>
<seg id="19">“We don't hear the CBA expanding its investigation or accelerating the investigation into Marian Banasia's property claims.</seg>
<seg id="20">Therefore, we are forced to take out the organs of the state and submit a notification about the possibility of committing a crime [...]“ , said Mariusz Witczak, MP of PO-KO.</seg>
<seg id="21">“If a normal Pole so grossly undervalued the rental of his properties, he would already have 10 checks, a tax office and criminal and fiscal proceedings,” he added.</seg>
<seg id="22">He went high, fell low</seg>
<seg id="23">Marian Banaś is the new president of the Supreme Chamber of control.</seg>
<seg id="24">He was appointed to this post on 30 August 2019, for a 6-year term.</seg>
<seg id="25">His candidacy was submitted by the law and Justice Party and the votes of the politicians of the party were accepted.</seg>
<seg id="26">Previously Banaś was associated with NIK in 1992-2005. He worked in this institution as a co-worker of Lech Kaczyński.</seg>
<seg id="27">During the first governments of the law and Justice party (2005-2008) Banaś held the position of the President of the Customs Service and also the Undersecretary of State in the Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="28">Since 2015 he has again sat on the stool of the head of the Customs Service, and since 2017 he has managed the National Revenue Administration.</seg>

<seg id="1">“Rzeczpospolita”: ignoring police officer's order will be punished</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the newspaper, disregard for a specific behaviour order issued by a police officer is to be a new type of offence, threatened with a fine, arrest or restriction of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="3">Police unionists want such a change.</seg>
<seg id="4">The idea went to the Sejm Committee on petitions.</seg>
<seg id="5">“The case is serious because already every year more than half a million misdemeanor cases go to Polish courts,” we read.</seg>
<seg id="6">“Rzeczpospolita” has established that the petition which the Independent Trade Union of policemen writes to MPs on amending the code of offences has a chance of success.</seg>
<seg id="7">The authors of the petition propose a new wording of article 54a of the Code of offences.</seg>
<seg id="8">It would read: “Whoever does not comply with the request or order of a public officer, issued within the limits and under the provisions of the law, is subject to the penalty of arrest, fine or restriction of freedom.”</seg>
<seg id="9">“paragraph 3 of this provision speaks of an identical punishment for those who fail to comply with orders, prevent or hinder the performance of a business activity,” the newspaper reports.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski told Rzeczpospolita that although he agrees with the main message of the proposal, he fears that if implemented, it could be used in political matters of manifestations.</seg>
<seg id="11">“In situations of freedom demonstrations it would be unfavourable and instead of mitigating the situation, they would even exacerbate it,” he added.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to statistics published by the newspaper, 86% of citizens positively evaluated police interventions in 2018 and that every month services undertake 1.5 million interventions in the city.</seg>

<seg id="2">Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook has collapsed, its Belgian subsidiary Neckermann is operating.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the company has problems.</seg>
<seg id="4">Brussels Airlines announced that it would cancel 105 flights in October due to problems with Thomas Cook's bankruptcy, according to VRT.</seg>
<seg id="5">Neckermann also fired 75 employees.</seg>
<seg id="6">All trips with the office booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but holidaymakers will be able to receive a refund.</seg>
<seg id="7">The court in Ghent also announced the bankruptcy of three Belgian subsidiaries: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.</seg>
<seg id="8">Currently, about 12 thousand Belgians are abroad on trips bought at Thomas Cook.</seg>
<seg id="9">Another 40 thousand people were to leave office by the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">Earlier on Monday, Thomas Cook Belgium spokeswoman Leen Segers said the company was currently “fully operational” despite the announcement of bankruptcy by the British parent company, which has caused concern among employees and customers.</seg>
<seg id="11">The office then reassured that customers who bought trips in it would go on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thomas Cook - the oldest and one of the largest travel agencies in the world - declared bankruptcy overnight from Sunday to Monday.</seg>
<seg id="13">The immediate cause of the bankruptcy was the collapse of last-chance talks with creditors and potential investors on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="14">Creditors demanded that, in addition to the £900 million bailout plan agreed in August, the company earn an additional £200 million as collateral for the winter period, when travel agents usually have lower turnover.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, the company's problems have been growing for several years, resulting in a debt of up to £1.6 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1">Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for an opinion</seg>
<seg id="2">Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – such an unusual offer was prepared for newcomers by the German Görlitz.</seg>
<seg id="3">The measures are intended to help combat the progressive decline in the number of inhabitants of the city.</seg>
<seg id="4">Görlitz is the easternmost city in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="5">The beautiful pastel old town attracts 140 thousand tourists every year.</seg>
<seg id="6">But according to The Guardian, the city is struggling with significant problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Görlitz has the lowest wages in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">The city is also struggling with a steady decline in population.</seg>
<seg id="9">After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them left for the west of the country, which resulted in a 25 percent decline in the city's population.</seg>
<seg id="10">In 2013 it amounted to 54 thousand people.</seg>
<seg id="11">To combat the depopulation, officials came up with the idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.</seg>
<seg id="12">So far, 150 applications have been received for the programme.</seg>
<seg id="13">Two thirds of them were made up by inhabitants of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="14">People from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom were also interested in the programme.</seg>
<seg id="15">“When we applied, we thought the program was supposed to convince people to move to Görlitz,” said one of the project participants.</seg>
<seg id="16">“Now we feel it doesn't matter whether we stay here after four weeks or not,” he added.</seg>
<seg id="17">The city has seven thousand free housing, and unemployment is three times the average across the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">Although the city authorities hope that some will move permanently, the main objective of the programme is to obtain feedback from the participants.</seg>
<seg id="19">The information gathered from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revive smaller German cities.</seg>
<seg id="20">“We want to know more about what people need and if they decide to move, what was their motivation,” said program manager Robert Knippschild.</seg>
<seg id="21">Other cities have already experimented with ideas to lure new residents, offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first was Detroit, which introduced a program to pay promising young professionals for living and working in the city for a year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy, or in the American Tulsa in Oklahoma.</seg>
