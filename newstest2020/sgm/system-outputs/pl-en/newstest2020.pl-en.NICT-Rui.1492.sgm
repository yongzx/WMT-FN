<seg id="1">Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in a white robe</seg>
<seg id="2">He is charismatic.</seg>
<seg id="3">The masses celebrated by him for release and healing draw crowds.</seg>
<seg id="4">He was several years old when inexplicable things began to happen in his life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Today, with the help of a Franciscan, others experience it.</seg>
<seg id="6">Masses for deliverance and healing celebrated by Fr Witko are attended by crowds</seg>
<seg id="7">He was once visited by the parents of a 7-month-old child who had a hole of 7.5 mm in his heart.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was to be operated on.</seg>
<seg id="9">Father Józef Witko prayed over him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later that day, the boy was taken to hospital for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="11">Surprised doctors said: "Surgery is not needed, the loss is only 1.5 mm."</seg>
<seg id="12">My parents cried with happiness.</seg>
<seg id="13">After another Franciscan prayer, the hole disappeared completely.</seg>
<seg id="14">The spiritual extraordinary actions of the Creator began to experience as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="15">In his dreams, the souls of purgatory came to him asking for help.</seg>
<seg id="16">I was awake at night and urged to pray for the dead and those who died at a given moment," he recalls.</seg>
<seg id="17">He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.</seg>
<seg id="18">And he had a vision of what happens to a man who commits mortal sin.</seg>
<seg id="19">"My body started to change.</seg>
<seg id="20">I lost human qualities and started to take on the appearance of an animal," he says.</seg>
<seg id="21">The invisible force lifted him up, he could not get his voice out of him.</seg>
<seg id="22">He felt he was lost.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then God pointed to his rescue.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Immersed in the waters of the river symbolizing holy baptism, I was freed and returned to human form...," he says.</seg>
<seg id="25">He didn't tell anyone about these strange experiences.</seg>
<seg id="26">The vocation matured in him.</seg>
<seg id="27">He was 16 when he joined the Franciscans.</seg>
<seg id="28">In his sermons he wanted not only to talk about Jesus.</seg>
<seg id="29">He wanted people to experience Him alive.</seg>
<seg id="30">Members of the Charismatic Community of Renewal in the Holy Spirit</seg>
<seg id="31">The masses for healing celebrated by Father Witko are attended by many people who hope to get rid of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, the priest emphasizes that their main goal is spiritual healing, not physical healing.</seg>

<seg id="2">This afternoon (26 September) Kolping FRAC team deservedly succumbed at home to the current Polish champion Darts Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki as part of the 3rd round of LOTTO Superliga Table Tennis.</seg>
<seg id="3">Yaroslavl, in such a personal juxtaposition as they presented with the strongholds, have little chance of winning against the league's sovereignty.</seg>
<seg id="4">This was clearly shown by the duel with Darts Bogoria.</seg>
<seg id="5">The team is still missing, hailed as the team leader, Chen Jingqi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Perhaps with him in the squad Yaroslavl would reach for a third consecutive triumph in the new season.</seg>
<seg id="7">The young Asian Qiyao Han has probably not yet grown up to win against the likes of Greek Panagiotis Gionis and Czech Pavel Sirucek.</seg>
<seg id="8">Not even with one of the most promising Poles, that is Marek Badowski.</seg>
<seg id="9">The player from Hellada was the biggest star of the match in the MOSiR hall at Sikorskiego Street in Jarosław.</seg>
<seg id="10">Both in the clash with Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei was a class for himself.</seg>
<seg id="11">After three games, Kolping FRAC led 2-1.</seg>
<seg id="12">Kou Lei probably beat Marek Badowski, and Daniel Górak after an exciting, five-set fight - Pavel Siruck.</seg>
<seg id="13">But then it was worse.</seg>
<seg id="14">Gionis did not give Leia a chance.</seg>
<seg id="15">One could still hope to win for two points, but Qiyao Han did not match Badowski.</seg>

<seg id="1">There will be no additional research for seniors.</seg>
<seg id="2">Why?</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Rafał Lewandowski, a program of free preventive examinations for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not been accepted by the Ministry of Health and its subordinate Agency for Health Technology Protection and Tariff.</seg>
<seg id="5">In its justification, the agency explained that the target group had been poorly selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The above actions may even result in the detection of individual disease units, which may contribute to the worsening of difficulties in accessing NFZ benefits and adversely affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with a falsely positive test result," it says.</seg>
<seg id="7">The decision of the ministry is not understood by the president of the capital.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The money is ours, we predicted the money for it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only the government is afraid that if people examine themselves, they will go to the doctor later, which is absurd, because it is about bringing about a situation in which prophylaxis can be done faster.</seg>
<seg id="10">All specialists know that this helps in terms of the burden on the health system, because it helps in the rapid detection of diseases and in a reliable approach to health.</seg>
<seg id="11">The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand."</seg>
<seg id="12">"It is hard for me to imagine that proficient specialists say: Let us not examine ourselves, because there will be longer queues at the doctor, and if such specialists advise the government, I am not surprised that health care is in such a state," added the politician of the Civic Platform.</seg>

<seg id="1">Palestine responds to Israel: We will break all existing agreements</seg>
<seg id="2">Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced at a session of the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday that he would break all agreements with Israel if the country's future government tried to meet Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement of the annexation of occupied Palestinian lands.</seg>
<seg id="3">"If the future government of Israel, which will arise, starts to implement this plan, we will nullify all signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all commitments made," he announced.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We will reject the whole plan completely and completely," threatened Abbas with pressure.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It is our duty to defend all our rights by all possible means - no matter what the consequences will be - by engaging fully in the application of international law and in the fight against terrorism," said the President of the Palestinian Authority, who had already made similar declarations in July.</seg>
<seg id="6">Netanyahu, the former Prime Minister of Israel, was again sent to form a government after the 17 September elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">A week before the election, he announced that if he won, he would announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and intend to include all Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank in Israel.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, then led by Yasser Arafat, signed a series of peace agreements sponsored by the United States.</seg>
<seg id="9">The 84-year-old Abbas also promised during the session of the UN General Assembly to hold general elections on Palestinian lands.</seg>
<seg id="10">The last one took place in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="11">"On my return to the country, I will call local elections in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, and all those who oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community," the Palestinian president solemnly declared.</seg>
<seg id="12">Abbas also defended in his speech the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer at the United Nations, to exercise the rights of "full members of the United Nations and all its bodies and institutions."</seg>
<seg id="13">The Palestinian leader concluded the speech by calling on the international community to "force Israel to comply with the United Nations resolutions with all due respect."</seg>
<seg id="14">Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas' speech, declaring that the Palestinian leader "prefers to focus in the United Nations on the efforts of the Palestinian Authority against Israel rather than fight against calls for terrorism in the Autonomy under his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="15">Danon, however, as the agencies note, did not refer to the annexation of occupied Palestinian lands announced by Netanyahu.</seg>

<seg id="1">PLN 105 million for video game companies from the National Centre for Research and Development</seg>
<seg id="2">Almost PLN 105 million of funding will go to companies from the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.</seg>
<seg id="3">The National Centre for Research and Development announced the results of the third edition of GameINN on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Almost 30 projects supported by the NCBR included, among others, the development of a platform for creating field games based on the AR game engine creating a map of the real world with an application enabling the transmission of data by users; a test and training platform for verifying practical skills at the workplace and professional development using VR and AI technologies; an innovative game simulating the management of real production processes using an innovative gameplay model based on the interaction of the virtual world with the real world using the concept of industry 4.0 - it was stated in the NCBR release sent to PAP on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="5">The aim of the GameINN sector programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game industry on the global market by 2023.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the NCBR, the Polish video game sector is already growing at a rate of 10% per year.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 amounted to PLN 1.85 billion, while the forecast for 2019 is PLN 2.23 billion.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The specially prepared GameINN research agenda and already reaching 300 million PLN support for entrepreneurs under this sector program are an important impulse for further, dynamic growth of Polish gamedevu," reads the release.</seg>
<seg id="9">The video game industry is an excellent example of effective use of the potential we have in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The incentives introduced by the government for entrepreneurs who focus on innovation, such as R&amp;D incentives, competence improvement programmes, IP box or support programmes implemented by the National Centre for Research and Development (NCBR) drive innovative activity of companies and allow them to compete more effectively in a very competitive market," says Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the release.</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of the Ministry of Science points out that the money for innovation not only goes to innovators in the form of project funding, but also stays in their pockets - three quarters more entrepreneurs benefited from the R&amp;D relief in 2018 than the year before.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The amount of deducted costs related to R&amp;D activities amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, which gave over PLN 300 million savings for companies benefiting from this relief.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is the equivalent of the support provided by the NCBR in three editions of GameINN," underlines the Deputy Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="14">Wojciech Kamieniecki, Director of the National Centre for Research and Development, reminds that 78 innovative projects were awarded in two previous competitions with a total value of over PLN 211.2 million.</seg>
<seg id="15">The huge interest in the III competition and the variety of applications submitted show that the video game industry has the ideas and competences to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It is particularly pleasing that among the selected projects - as in previous editions - there are projects dealing not only with entertainment, but also with industry 4.0," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the third GameINN competition, entrepreneurs, consortia of entrepreneurs and consortia of entrepreneurs with scientific units could apply for funding of up to PLN 20 million.</seg>
<seg id="18">The National Centre for Research and Development received 87 applications for a total amount of PLN 317 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">The budget of the competition at the time of the announcement of the competition was PLN 100 million, but it was increased, thanks to which 27 projects were granted almost PLN 105 million in funding.</seg>
<seg id="20">Detailed information about the results of the 3rd GameINN competition is available at ncbr.gov.pl.</seg>
<seg id="21">The GameINN sector programme is implemented under the Smart Growth Operational Programme.</seg>
<seg id="22">NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs associated in the Polish Games Agreement, which includes companies such as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team and 11 bit studios.</seg>

<seg id="2">The incident occurred on 16 September.</seg>
<seg id="3">Dolberg, who went from Ajax Amsterdam to Nice at the end of August, realized after training that his watch had disappeared from the locker room.</seg>
<seg id="4">Not just any, because it is worth EUR 70 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="5">A furious Dane did not attend the class the next day, explaining his stomach problems.</seg>
<seg id="6">The case was puzzling from the start.</seg>
<seg id="7">Footballers in the locker room have private safes at their disposal and the club area is monitored.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to AFP, Diaby-Fadiga eventually confessed to the theft.</seg>
<seg id="9">The 18-year-old has already apologised to Dolberg and his other teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.</seg>
<seg id="10">He also promised the Danish to return the money for his watch.</seg>
<seg id="11">Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most prospective players of the young generation in France.</seg>
<seg id="12">He moved to Nice as a 13-year-old before making his debut in the first team three years later.</seg>
<seg id="13">He appeared in seven games this season.</seg>
<seg id="14">He recently signed a professional contract but, according to L'Equipe, the club is likely to dissolve it with immediate effect.</seg>

<seg id="4">This is important especially now that autumn infections are approaching.</seg>
<seg id="5">It takes at least 30-40 seconds for washing to sufficiently remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands</seg>
<seg id="6">And most of us wash them shorter!</seg>
<seg id="7">Warm water and ordinary soap are enough - it is not true that it must be antibacterial (many doctors even advise against them).</seg>
<seg id="8">When washing, we rub not only the soles and tops of the hand, but also: the tips of the fingers (joined or individually) - rub them with circular movements on the inside of the other hand, spaces between the fingers (intertwine hands, rubbing fingers against each other), thumbs - each thumb we embrace with the other hand and in such embrace we turn it a moment to the right and left.</seg>
<seg id="9">In an emergency (when you can't wash your hands) you should wipe your hands with a wet handkerchief, and then use an antibacterial gel (in drugstores, from PLN 5).</seg>

<seg id="1">Iran's president says he has rejected a proposal for talks with the US, Donald Trump denies</seg>
<seg id="2">Tehran did not enter into talks with the American side during the UN General Assembly in New York, despite the offer made by the Americans to abolish sanctions, said Iranian President Hassan Rowhani on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">US President Donald Trump commented that it was the Iranian side that asked for the restrictions to be lifted, which he did not agree to.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Iranian President Hassan Rowhani, the Americans offered to lift all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for negotiating a new international agreement.</seg>
<seg id="5">It would regulate both Iran's nuclear program and its ballistic missile program.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rowhani: Iran will not engage in talks amid maximum pressure</seg>
<seg id="7">The Iranian President said he did not agree to engage in these talks because of the "toxic atmosphere".</seg>
<seg id="8">He stated that he had met with American diplomats because he had been persuaded by France, Germany and the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, he stressed that Iran would not engage in talks in an atmosphere of "maximum pressure".</seg>
<seg id="10">"And even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in a 5 + 1 format, nobody can predict what the end result will be," Rowhani said.</seg>
<seg id="11">The day before, the Iranian leader said that he did not exclude talks with the US, and accused European parties to the nuclear agreement of favouring American sanctions on Iran.</seg>
<seg id="12">He added that sanctions imposed on Iran after the US withdrawal from the nuclear agreement "are a precondition that does not allow" dialogue to be established.</seg>
<seg id="13">If we can lift this precondition and if America abolishes sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America," he declared.</seg>
<seg id="14">He added that he did not exclude a meeting with the president of the USA Donald Trump, despite the fact that he did not agree to such a conversation last week during the UN General Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="15">Trump: "Iran asked, I said no"</seg>
<seg id="16">Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that he had rejected the Iranian side's request.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.</seg>
<seg id="18">Of course I said 'no!'," the US president vetoed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Tension with atomic understanding in the background</seg>
<seg id="20">France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to ease tensions between Washington and Tehran to somehow save the 2015 agreement with Iran, of which they were signatories.</seg>
<seg id="21">It stated that, in exchange for lifting economic sanctions, Iran would abandon its nuclear weapons program and put the nuclear sector under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).</seg>
<seg id="22">Since the US withdrew from the agreement in May 2015, the remaining signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to keep the agreement in place.</seg>
<seg id="23">For now, nothing has come of it.</seg>
<seg id="24">Washington is using tactics to put maximum pressure on Iran, and sanctions also include a full embargo on Iranian oil.</seg>
<seg id="25">Tehran has announced that if it does not receive permission to export the raw material, it will limit its obligations under the agreement every 60 days.</seg>

<seg id="1">The judge of the Provincial Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of the heiress Emilia, who - according to her words and screenshots from WhatsApp - participated in stalking against the judges, was reinstated by the NSA on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="2">The reason: disciplinary proceedings have not been initiated against him, so there is no basis for upholding the order of the President of the Province Administrative Court Wojciech Mazur to remove him from his duties.</seg>
<seg id="3">Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary spokesman at the Supreme Administrative Court, opened an investigation against Szmydt at the end of August, but it has not turned into proceedings against him so far.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although the Supreme Administrative Court, which acts as a disciplinary court in such cases, must deal with the decision of the President of the Supreme Administrative Court within a month of its issuance.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this situation, a judge who spoke publicly about his wife's mental problems in order to discredit her, who was removed from the office of the National Court Register due to suspicions of participation in a terrorist group, will return to adjudication and will issue judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.</seg>
<seg id="6">Judge Szmydt denies his participation in the Heist group.</seg>
<seg id="7">He claims that there is no evidence of this other than fake screenshots and the words of his wife, with whom he is divorced.</seg>
<seg id="8">Exactly the same is claimed by the other judges connected with the 'Caste': everybody is innocent, there is no evidence.</seg>
<seg id="9">And it's quite possible that they'll bet on their own.</seg>
<seg id="10">Because procurators have not nodded their fingers to secure evidence from their electronic media, they are also silent about the contents of Emilia Szmydt's phone, which she stopped in June in another case.</seg>
<seg id="11">The police did not shake their fingers to secure the devices of people whom Judge Waldemar Żurek pointed out as persecutors in a report from February.</seg>
<seg id="12">There is no evidence - there is no Szmydt case, there is no "Kasty" case.</seg>
<seg id="13">There is also no case of the chief of the Supreme Chamber of Control Marian Banasio about renting a tenement house to cassocks and hiding income.</seg>
<seg id="14">The CBA checks his property statements.</seg>
<seg id="15">And he will check when he checks.</seg>
<seg id="16">Whereas the Commission of Parliamentary Ethics will not take care of Banas, because the Seym is suspended (but the Commission of State Control somehow got together in order to make a curious decision about dismissing deputies of Banas and appointing him as his lawyer, although the law does not provide for such a strange combination).</seg>
<seg id="17">The whole thing reminds me of a film novella, an American one, about how my wife comes home and finds her husband with her lover in bed.</seg>
<seg id="18">She is so amazed and devastated that she can't shout a word.</seg>
<seg id="19">She stands in the door dumbfounded, and during this time the lover quickly jumps out of bed, dresses and leaves.</seg>
<seg id="20">And the husband is bedding the bed.</seg>
<seg id="21">When the wife regains her voice and shouts: what is it supposed to be?</seg>
<seg id="22">Who is this woman?</seg>
<seg id="23">The husband calmly asks: what woman, darling?</seg>
<seg id="24">Only that in the case of 'Caste' or Banasia there is a parody of the state.</seg>
<seg id="25">And that's not funny at all.</seg>

<seg id="9">"I had strange, disturbing symptoms and I reported to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="10">It turned out I had jaundice.</seg>
<seg id="11">But the worst was in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="12">When a CT scan was performed, it was found that I had pancreatic cancer...," the Prime Minister's father said.</seg>
<seg id="13">A few days later, Kornel Morawiecki underwent a serious operation at the Ministry of Interior hospital in Warsaw.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to Morawiecki, president Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain priest Zbigniew Kras to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="15">The operation lasted about three hours and was successful.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I know that many people prayed for me, for which I thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="17">Fortunately, I don't rather have metastases.</seg>
<seg id="18">I do not know yet if I will undergo chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="19">I put myself in the hands of specialist doctors, who are rather well-meaning.</seg>
<seg id="20">For now, after this severe operation, I have to return to some state of usability.</seg>
<seg id="21">I hope that everything will be good," said Kornel Morawiecki in an interview with "SE" in January.</seg>
<seg id="22">"If I had undergone an examination too late, the situation would have been tragic and I would have said goodbye to this fall...," he added.</seg>

<seg id="1">The power of Oława jumps.</seg>
<seg id="2">The title of the coverage of amateur sports competitions, held on Sunday afternoon 15 September at the hippodrome at Oleandry Street in Oława, can be confusing for some.</seg>
<seg id="3">The road to true power is far away, but this is what one of the types of horse rivalry is called...</seg>
<seg id="4">The jumping power competition consists in the rider and horse overcoming higher and higher obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed even two meters.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is worth mentioning that the long-standing and still unbeaten world record, set in 1949 by the Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on the horse "Huaso", is 247 cm.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nobody jumped so high in Oława, of course, but the result of the best local amazons at 135 cm is not the worst either...</seg>
<seg id="7">The competition organized by tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other activists of JKS "W sodle", constituted a demonstration part of the earlier "Rainbow equestrian competitions," about which we write more in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.</seg>
<seg id="8">Eight amazons took part in the competition, training equestrian in Oława JKS.</seg>
<seg id="9">Four competed on ponies and four on large horses.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the first group the best was Nikola Szołdra, sitting on the crazy "Sprinter".</seg>
<seg id="11">This small but very dynamic tiller started by overcoming obstacles spread at a height of 40 cm, and ended only at the stationary with the upper beam 125 cm away from the ground.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he did not give up easily and only after three consecutive refusals he was removed from further competition by the jury.</seg>
<seg id="13">The second place in pony jumping was taken by Amelia Pawlak, sitting on "Fama", and the third by Lena Boruń on "Harmider".</seg>
<seg id="14">Ambitiously fought the youngest participant of the tournament - Inga Aksman, galloping and jumping through obstacles on the small mare "Carmen".</seg>
<seg id="15">Even more excitement accompanied the competing amazons and spectators during the competition with the participation of large horses.</seg>
<seg id="16">Terrible-looking falls included Paulina Szewczyk, sitting on the "Declaration" and Anastasia Abramenko, who rode on "Lotka".</seg>
<seg id="17">Fortunately, apart from minor bruises, nothing bad happened to the amazons or horses, so they continued to participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="18">Weronika Łuczkiewicz had a lot of problems with introducing the young mare "Wineta" to the car park.</seg>
<seg id="19">What was needed was either an assistant trainer or another horse for the pair, followed by a little crazy "Wineta".</seg>
<seg id="20">"Everything is under control," reassured Jan Sienkiewicz a little to those frightened spectators, especially the youngest ones.</seg>
<seg id="21">From the beginning of the big horses competition Marta Masalska, sitting on a beautiful "Whisky," did a great job on the park.</seg>
<seg id="22">This dignified mare, paired with an experienced amazon, after the second approach in the final phase was the first to jump 135 cm and this was the best result at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="23">After a while, however, Paulina Szewczyk on "Declaration", Weronika Łuczkiewicz on "Wineta" and Anastasia Abramenko on "Lotka" also scored the same height.</seg>
<seg id="24">So, to decorate the flo and to receive the prizes in the form of equestrian equipment, all these contestants left together, and at the end, together with the amazons on ponies in the rhythm of Radecki's march, they performed an impressive round of honour, ending this interesting and exciting competition.</seg>
<seg id="25">Thanks</seg>
<seg id="26">The Equestrian Sports Club "W Siodle" cordially thanks the sponsors of the jump power competition during the 16th "Rainbow Equestrian Competition": the Municipal Office in Oława, the Water Supply and Sewerage Plant in Oława, the District Office and the company "Mustang".</seg>

<seg id="2">KWW The Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko is the name of the election committee under which the political formation # R Revolution of Mariusz Max Kolonko was to go to the October parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="3">The revolution directed its proposal especially to young voters with right-wing views.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the elections Kolonko announced cooperation with Marek Jakubiak or Paweł Kukiz, but none of these coalitions happened, and the KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko did not even manage to collect enough signatures to issue lists in any electoral district in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now Kolonko has announced on Twitter that he has ended his collaboration with KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I will expect the abovementioned KWW to remove my name from the name.</seg>
<seg id="7">I kindly ask you not to connect my person with the aforementioned entity," he added and announced that he will provide more information soon.</seg>
<seg id="8">For now, it is not known whether the journalist will continue his action or whether it is the end of the # R Revolution formation.</seg>
<seg id="9">On 4 July, American Independence Day, journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko announced the formation of a new political formation, the # R Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="10">In recent years, Kolonko has become famous for running the Max TV channel on YouTube, where he comments on events in Poland and around the world.</seg>
<seg id="11">"We have enough politicians, enough of your foolish games, enough of your amateur governments.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is time for the authorities in the country to take over the Nation and rule for the good of the Nation," said Kolonko.</seg>
<seg id="13">The party's programme included, among others, issues concerning the judiciary (it should be elected in general elections), tax changes (equalization of the tax-free amount for all), war reparations (in the form of military aid for the countries of the eastern flank of NATO, with particular emphasis on Poland), holding a referendum on the possession of weapons, limiting the number of MPs or introducing single-member constituencies.</seg>
<seg id="14">A few days after the announcement of the new political formation Mariusz Max Kolonko started talks with Marek Jakubiak.</seg>
<seg id="15">At the end of July, Kolonko posted a message on his social media profile suggesting that #R would join forces with the 15 movement.</seg>

<seg id="2">"The euro exchange rate will remain around PLN 4.35 in the coming months, accompanied by a weak economic situation in global markets," says Michael Bolliger from UBS Wealth Management.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Expectations to maintain a solid pace of economic growth and stable monetary policy speak for the stabilization of the zloty quotations at the current ceiling," says the specialist in an interview with Bankier.pl.</seg>
<seg id="4">In his opinion, despite the clear inflation pressure, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide to raise rates in an environment in which the vast majority of central banks are easing policy.</seg>
<seg id="5">"While the zloty is properly valued - euro prices should remain around the ceiling of PLN 4.35 in the coming months - in his opinion Polish bonds are not very attractive.</seg>
<seg id="6">Emerging-market bonds offer much more favorable yields than Polish securities," says Michael Bolliger, Head of Asset Allocation for Emerging Markets at UBS Wealth Management.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the deterioration of the global economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The global slowdown may get worse, but there should not be a severe recession, and at most GDP growth should fall slightly below zero," says Michael Bolliger.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Investors should underweight global equities, which may be harmed by the lack of prospects for resolving the US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including Donald Trump's impeachment procedure and Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="10">Europe should behave relatively weakly among equity markets," says Mark Haefele, chief executive of UBS Wealth Management, in a recent letter to investors.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Shares from eurozone countries should behave worse than the US, because they are more vulnerable in conditions of increased uncertainty around global trade and fears of slowing down," reads the document.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to Michael Bolliger, after the boom in the bond markets of the safest countries pushed the profitability of German 10-year-olds even to minus 0.74%, it is still possible to deepen the decline in profitability.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, in the long term, the profitability of long-term securities should no longer fall, but only in the short term, due to the easing of banks' monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Fed has the biggest scope for interest rate cuts, which should lead to a weakening of the US currency over the next few years.</seg>
<seg id="15">The long-term equilibrium point for euro notes is the ceiling of USD 1.29, which would mean a 19% potential for strengthening the common currency to the dollar.</seg>
<seg id="16">We expect further cuts in Fed rates, which will result in a reduction in the differences in monetary policy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="17">"To maintain the strength of the dollar in the long term may not allow deficits in the current and budget accounts," announces Michael Bolliger.</seg>

<seg id="9">As the RND told reporters, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is "alarming".</seg>

<seg id="2">More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not travel to Majorca in October as a result of the bankruptcy announced by travel agent Thomas Cook on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the representative of the autonomous government of the Balearic Islands Marc Pons, among the 25,000 holidaymakers who will not be able to take advantage of the October holiday in Majorca, there are also people who were supposed to travel with companies indirectly associated with Thomas Cook, such as Neckermann.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pons explained that 80% of expected holidaymakers who, due to the bankruptcy of a British company, had to give up their holiday in Majorca next month are citizens of Germany and Scandinavian countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, according to Pons, as Thomas Cook did not direct tourists to the Balearic island between November and April, the losses to the local economy will be smaller.</seg>
<seg id="6">He revealed that the Balearic government had already begun negotiations with international operators about "entering the Majorca market" following the bankruptcy of the British operator.</seg>
<seg id="7">Estimates by the newspaper Diario de Mallorca show that more than 1,000 people will lose their jobs in October due to the tourism crisis in Majorca.</seg>
<seg id="8">Around 800 are dismissed employees of the Thomas Cook office in Palma.</seg>
<seg id="9">Other people will lose their jobs mainly in the hospitality sector.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Monday, with Thomas Cook declaring bankruptcy in many Majorca hotels, the owners of the facilities demanded that guests pay an additional fee for accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="11">This situation was experienced, among others, by several dozen tourists from Poland.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Balearic government estimates that by Thursday, dozens of hotels in Majorca had ceased operations at least until the end of October following the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook and its associated companies.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the other hand, the Friday newspaper 'Diario de Ibiza' indicates that most of the hotels operating in Ibiza, which cooperated with the Thomas Cook group, do not have the intention of closing their facilities in the coming weeks.</seg>
<seg id="14">The newspaper recalls that on this Balearic island the British bankruptcy cooperated with 42 hotels.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Wednesday, the autonomous Balearic authorities announced that they would ask the Spanish government to support the region with €100 million to cover losses caused by the bankruptcy of travel agent Thomas Cook.</seg>
<seg id="16">They revealed that the most affected tourists in this archipelago, about 36,000 people, are in Majorca.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to data from the Balearic government, Thomas Cook owes around €5 million to local tourism companies, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of contracts for the period July-September 2019.</seg>

<seg id="4">According to Zandberg, the left may have 60-80 MPs.</seg>

<seg id="2">Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered in the capital on Friday for the inauguration of the huge mosque, believed to be the largest in West Africa.</seg>
<seg id="3">Muslims came by buses, cars and on foot to the district of Bopp, where a new mosque was built, which could accommodate 30,000 believers.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was built by the Mouride Brotherhood, part of the Sufi Islamic movement that dominates Senegal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Work on the mosque began ten years ago in a six-hectare wetland area donated by the government.</seg>
<seg id="6">The name of the mosque Massalikul Jinan ("Paths to Paradise") comes from the title of a poem by Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the 19th-century founder of the fraternity, revered by followers as a saint.</seg>
<seg id="7">The mosque is covered with Carrara marble and has five minarets.</seg>
<seg id="8">The highest of them is 78 meters.</seg>
<seg id="9">The mosque can hold 15,000 people inside, and the other as many can stay on the outer esplanade.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the richly finished interiors you can admire the gilded dome, giant chandeliers and decorations handmade by Moroccan workers.</seg>
<seg id="11">Builders say the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but the edifice still has no comparison to mosques in other regions.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Morocco, Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca can accommodate 105,000 worshippers.</seg>
<seg id="13">The construction of the mosque, which cost more than 30 million euros, was funded by private donations.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition to the land, the government provided lighting, sanitation and financed road works worth €10.5 million.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trainer Smyła: Our problem is not Silesia, but ourselves</seg>
<seg id="2">The pass of eight league matches without a victory Crown players will try to break in Friday's meeting with the vice-leader of the Ekstraklasa Silesia.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Our problem is not the inhabitants of Wrocław, but ourselves, we have to work on what we play," emphasized the coach Mirosław Smyła.</seg>
<seg id="4">Machine translation-Bing, Google Korona players last and so far the only victory in the league recorded in the first round, when the away beat 1-0 beniaminka Raków Częstochowa.</seg>
<seg id="5">Later, they recorded two draws and six defeats, and on Tuesday they lost 0-1 to Zagłębie Lubin in the 1/32 finals of the Polish Cup.</seg>
<seg id="6">"It fills me with optimism that in the last seconds of the cup match the players were fighting for a goal, they wanted to draw.</seg>
<seg id="7">Their fall on the pitch after the last whistle was not due to a breakdown, but it was a fall of anger because they were so close," Smyła said.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he pointed out, Silesia has very strong wings, so it will sensitize the team to play in the side sectors of the pitch.</seg>
<seg id="9">"We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we are also looking at what we want to play," added the coach.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Friday's game in the Crown certainly will not play pausing for excess yellow cards Ognjen Gnjatic, the team will also miss injured Jakub Żubrowski and Michael Gardawski.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, it is edifying to register a few players with a desire to play in a cup match.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We have a headache, recently it seemed to be gone, and now it is," stated Smyła.</seg>
<seg id="13">Crown defender Daniel Dziwniel stressed that Silesia will not be an easy rival to break the streak of eight league matches in a row without a win, while in the Ekstraklasa anyone can win against anyone.</seg>
<seg id="14">"We are a good team.</seg>
<seg id="15">In recent weeks we may not be showing it on the pitch, but the moment will come that we will win and we believe that it will be on Friday," noted the player.</seg>
<seg id="16">After nine rounds of the Premier League, Korona finished in 15th place with five points.</seg>
<seg id="17">Silesia has accumulated 12 more and is in second place.</seg>
<seg id="18">Friday's match in Kielce will start at 8:30 p.m.</seg>

<seg id="1">These trees can completely disappear from Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">"42% of the tree species that make up Europe's stands are threatened," warns the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in its Red Book of European Trees published on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the top of the list are chestnuts and rowan.</seg>
<seg id="4">The IUCN, an organisation based in Gland, Switzerland, publishes a list of endangered species of European trees for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was drawn up by experts who concluded that of the 454 tree species found in Europe (and elsewhere in the world), 42% are "highly endangered".</seg>
<seg id="6">Among the causes, the Red Paper lists the rapid growth of urban agglomerations and global climate change.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, those trees and shrubs that occur only or mainly on our continent are most at risk.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to IUCN experts, 58% of species are threatened and 15%, i.e. 66 species of trees and shrubs, are threatened with extinction.</seg>
<seg id="9">Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Paper lists errors in the exploitation of trees, accelerated urbanisation, excessive logging, followed by forest fires and changes in the European ecosystem.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of shrubs, mosses and lichens is also under serious threat.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The consequences of human activities lead to the gradual disappearance of European plant species and pose a danger in Europe of the extinction of important and undervalued varieties that form the basis of European ecosystems and have an impact on the health of our planet," concluded Luc Bas, who heads the European IUCN office.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grzegorz Schetyna: I don't promise 600 +</seg>
<seg id="2">"Today the Law and Justice party wants to bribe Poles by offering them distribution on credit for their freedom, which will have to be paid by future generations," says Grzegorz Kaczyński in an interview for 'Rzeczpospolita'.</seg>
<seg id="3">In his opinion, "the whole policy of the Law and Justice party is pic".</seg>
<seg id="4">At the same time, the politician promises that "whatever is given will not be taken away."</seg>
<seg id="5">He claims in an interview with Jacek Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea to defeat the Law and Justice party.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is about mobilising the electorate at the ballot boxes.</seg>
<seg id="7">In his opinion, the opposition has a greater potential in this area than Kaczyński's party.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today there are more conscious people who want to live in a normal country than supporters of the Law and Justice party, a party which has betrayed the proclaimed values, such as modesty, humility, transparency," he says.</seg>
<seg id="9">The leader of the Civic Coalition and the chairman of the Civic Platform also pointed out the basic assumptions of the KO electoral programme.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Firstly, nothing given will be taken away, but it is necessary to set a direction for the future, because the Law and Justice party deals exclusively with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which can be seen even after dramatically low investments," he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Secondly, it is about 'activating the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work honestly - and those who are enterprising'.</seg>
<seg id="12">He explains that in the KO program there is, among the others, a project which will give the least earning Poles more by 614 zlotys per hand, and the more earning ones - also by several hundred zlotys.</seg>
<seg id="13">The politician also noted that he did not want to race for distribution.</seg>
<seg id="14">As he said, he will do as much as he can do, but he does not promise 600 +.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I will never allow the Greek variant, where the rulers were bidding with the opposition for distribution, until finally there was a financial collapse of the country," he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="16">In an interview for "Rz" he also stated that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We would expose their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Pride steps before the fall.</seg>
<seg id="19">Kaczynski is such a statesman as Banas is crystal," he added.</seg>
<seg id="20">The leader of the Civic Platform also said that he had not yet decided whether he would run for the chairmanship of the Platform.</seg>

<seg id="2">Six dead great condors have been found in the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, reports TVN24.</seg>
<seg id="3">Specialists believe that human activity contributed to their deaths.</seg>
<seg id="4">Large condors were probably poisoned with a means of killing predators such as pumas, foxes and wild dogs.</seg>
<seg id="5">The animals may have eaten a toxic carcass.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition to one young individual, the rest of the dead condors were adults.</seg>
<seg id="7">"This is a big loss for the environment because the condor has to reach 10-15 years to become fertile and able to reproduce.</seg>
<seg id="8">So we're losing a protected species, an endangered species," says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentine environmental organization.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I think the use of toxic bait and poison puts not only this species at risk, but all other forms of life, including human health," he adds.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Rom": They want a gem for the president</seg>
<seg id="2">Work has begun to give the head of state a precious chain.</seg>
<seg id="3">The idea was supported by the office of Andrzej Duda - we read in 'Rzeczpospolita'.</seg>
<seg id="4">As the newspaper explains, it is about the golden chain of the Order of the White Eagle, the royal insignia officially called in the interwar period the jewel of the Republic of Poland.</seg>
<seg id="5">The last time it was used was probably by president Ignacy Mościcki.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Rz" says that soon such a chain may hit the shoulders of Andrzej Duda.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Senate Committee on Human Rights, the Rule of Law and Petitions voted on Wednesday to work on an amendment to the Law on Orders and Orders to restore it.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Journal writes that this is also not the first attempt to restore this chain to the head of state.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Senate had already proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it was lost by one vote.</seg>
<seg id="10">This time the work is rapid.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the beginning of August, the senators devoted a few minutes to this matter, considering that they would consult the Chancellery of the President.</seg>
<seg id="12">This came in mid-September.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I kindly inform you that the Chancellery of the President of the Republic of Poland does not comment on the position presented in this petition," wrote the presidential minister Andrzej Dera.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Wednesday, the Senate committee continued the case and again devoted little time to the matter.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The Chancellery of the President answered us briefly: it is in favour of bringing it back," said the chief of the commission Robert Mamątow from the Law and Justice party, quoted by 'Rz'.</seg>

<seg id="1">Police officers will teach drivers how to drive through the intersection</seg>
<seg id="2">The police action will be conducted, among others, at the intersection of Cieplińskiego Avenue and Piłsudskiego Avenue.</seg>
<seg id="3">The uniformed actions are somehow related to the recent complaints of the city authorities about drivers who are not always able to behave properly at the crossroads.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Friday, 27 September, policemen begin preventive actions in Rzeszów.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is about eliminating traffic obstructions: entering the intersection without the possibility of exit, not adhering to traffic signals or signs.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We often think that we are alone at the crossroads, and in fact we make life difficult for other drivers," said Marek Ustrobiński, vice-president of the city a few days ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">His words were heard at a press conference of the town hall, where the city authorities presented examples of inappropriate movement of cars at intersections, which creates traffic jams.</seg>
<seg id="8">At that time, the president appealed to travellers for common sense on the road and, among other things, faster starting at traffic lights or not writing text messages while driving.</seg>
<seg id="9">The subject was somehow taken over by Rzeszów police officers, who are starting the action 'Crossing crossings' from today.</seg>
<seg id="10">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="11">The aim of the actions is to eliminate the phenomenon of limiting mobility at intersections by drivers entering them without the possibility to continue driving.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is a common offence, which contributes to aggravating traffic congestion and creating traffic jams.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is threatened with a fine of PLN 300 and 2 penalty points.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, the uniform will pay attention to non-compliance with traffic signals or traffic signs and incorrect parking in the area of intersections.</seg>
<seg id="15">They will also observe the lack of smoothness of driving, late starting from under sirens, slow crossing of intersections and leaving too long distances between vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="16">At which intersections will actions be carried out?</seg>
<seg id="17">Among others, on Lisa-Kuli Street from Jagiellońska Street; Cieplińskiego Avenue from Piłsudskiego Avenue; Targowa Street from Piłsudskiego Avenue; Śreniawitów Square from Dąbrowskiego Street or Hetmańska Street from Powstańców Warszawy Avenue.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Senate passed without amendments the Act on disclosure of the assets of the families of the most important state officials and on flights of the most important people in the state.</seg>
<seg id="3">The amendment to the law on the property of families of state officials - without amendments - was voted by 52 senators, 14 were against, three abstained.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thus, the senators decided to reject 12 amendments tabled during Wednesday's debate by the senator of the Civic Platform Sławomir Rybicki.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to him, the amendments were to "civilize" the law and limit the scope of information provided in the declaration on the property situation of own children, spouse's children, adopted children to cases in which children remain in a common household with a person obliged to submit a statement.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Act on the disclosure of the assets of the families of the most important state officials, whose project was created in the office of the Prime Minister, was passed by the Sejm on 11 September.</seg>
<seg id="7">The provisions assume that, among the others, the prime minister, ministers, MPs, MEPs, senators, presidents of: the Constitutional Tribunal, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as people standing at the head of other state institutions will be obliged to include information about the personal property of spouses, children and people living together in the property statement.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Senate also did not propose amendments to the law on the flights of the most important people in the state.</seg>
<seg id="9">It regulates which flights have HEAD status and who can be on board government aircraft along with the most important people in the state.</seg>
<seg id="10">The law also specifies who is responsible for keeping the Central Flight Register.</seg>
<seg id="11">55 senators voted in favour of the bill, 12 against, four abstentions.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the law, every flight of the president will be a flight "performed on an official mission".</seg>
<seg id="13">On flights, the president will be able to be accompanied by family members and other people invited by the president.</seg>
<seg id="14">Whereas the flight in the official mission of the prime minister and marshals of the Seym and Senate will be only a flight 'carried out in order to carry out tasks directly connected with the function'.</seg>
<seg id="15">The law also clarifies the list of people who can accompany the most important people in the country during the flight.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the regulations, members of the delegation may be on board the aircraft - invited MPs, senators, representatives of public authorities and experts; persons providing technical, medical or organizational services; as well as journalists.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the Act, in the event of doubts related to the flights of the Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate, the head of the National Broadcasting Council will apply for their clarification.</seg>
<seg id="18">If such doubts are not clarified within the prescribed time, the head of the National Broadcasting Council will be obliged to notify the heads of the Chancellery of the Sejm or the Senate about the impossibility of organising such a flight.</seg>

<seg id="2">Polish volleyball players had their first training in Paris on Friday, where they will compete in the bronze medal match on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Vital Heynen won the title with a 1-3 defeat to Slovenia in Ljubljana on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">There was a lot of talk about their troubles with travelling to this duel.</seg>
<seg id="5">This time it was without such problems - on Friday morning they went with the Slovenes on a charter to Paris, and a few hours later they had a training in the famous Bercy hall.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to reports of people present at the classes, the trainer of the world champions was upset.</seg>
<seg id="7">As Heynen's assistant Michał Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not just to practice volleyball elements.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We went to the hall but in the vast majority it was time for the team.</seg>
<seg id="9">The idea was to spend it together more than train.</seg>
<seg id="10">Talk, think about how to rebuild it all as a team," he reported.</seg>
<seg id="11">He confirmed that the semi-final defeat was a painful lesson for both the players and the training staff.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We were brutally brought to the ground.</seg>
<seg id="13">Without a doubt, we are disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="14">We still believed we would go back to this match.</seg>
<seg id="15">We discussed this match between ourselves on the staff, the coach talked a lot with the players.</seg>
<seg id="16">As the two main reasons for the defeat I would point to inefficiency in the attack and much worse than usual dealing with situational balls.</seg>
<seg id="17">Slovenians were much better than us in this respect," he analyzed.</seg>
<seg id="18">In his opinion, "White and Red" did not stand in the way of the stress associated with the performance against the co-hosts of the tournament, supported by a loud and large audience.</seg>
<seg id="19">He admitted that the world champions could sleep a bit on the smooth road to the semi-finals.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Perhaps if we had a similar-style defeat in the group stage, we would have analysed this lesson more quickly and would have played differently later in the tournament.</seg>
<seg id="21">But it's just a whim," he warned.</seg>
<seg id="22">Gogol hopes that the anger associated with Thursday's defeat can be turned into aggression in the bronze match.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I hope we will show our true face at that time.</seg>
<seg id="24">There is something to fight for.</seg>
<seg id="25">We last won the ME medal in 2011," he recalled.</seg>
<seg id="26">Paris is the fifth city and France is the third country visited by Poles during these championships.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the group stage, they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, went to Apeldoorn for the first two group stage meetings, and moved to Ljubljana for the semi-final.</seg>

<seg id="7">At the 2019 US Open, he also did not play long, but managed to publicly say that ATP activists "are corrupt", which hurt the organization's authorities so much that they implemented a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and after a few weeks gave the aforementioned verdict to suspend starts and another fine.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, his words about corruption were forgiven, after hearing the defendant and knowing the context of the statement.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the justification, however, tennis activists stated that the investigation showed that Kyrgios' behaviour over the past 12 months in many cases raised serious objections and constituted an almost constant violation of the rules, that he constantly insulted people associated with tournaments and spectators in a vulgar way, hence the high penalty.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately postponed the execution of the sentence, ordering him to meet several conditions within the next six months: in ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour tournaments Kyrgios can no longer in any way violate the rules of the code of conduct applicable to professional tennis players, in particular he can no longer curse, destroy rackets, argue with judges and the public, or otherwise behave indecently and vulgarly.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was also advised to seek "constant support" from mental coaches during tournaments and also consulted outside the season with people specialising in solving the problems of athletes not coping with proper behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nick Kyrgios' first comment (on social media) on the verdict was: "Hey everyone, I can still play.</seg>
<seg id="13">I just have to control my behaviour, that's all."</seg>
<seg id="14">In practice, the Australian will still have at least a two-week break, as his shoulder injury worsened in the Laver Cup, so he had to resign from the upcoming starts in Beijing (30 September - 6 October) and Shanghai (6-13 October).</seg>
<seg id="15">In the ATP rankings, Kyrgios is ranked 27th.</seg>
<seg id="16">This year he won two tournaments - in Washington and Acapulco, he earned more than $1.3 million, so even after the fines he will stay a lot.</seg>

<seg id="1">CSO: Poland is living better and better</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the report on household budgets published by GUS on Friday, as many as 44% of them assessed their material situation as good or rather good.</seg>
<seg id="3">A year earlier, this percentage was 37.2%, in 2016 33.5%, and before that - since 2009, when the statistical office first examined subjective assessments of the situation of households - it had never exceeded 30%.</seg>
<seg id="4">A total of 8.1% of households considered their material situation to be bad or rather bad last year, compared to 11.2% a year earlier and more than 20% in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="5">The best is the material situation of households of self-employed workers.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this group, more than 70% of respondents consider it good or rather good.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the other extreme are the households of pensioners, where the percentage of such responses was only 18%.</seg>
<seg id="8">The subjective assessment of the material situation of households is also strongly influenced by the number of children.</seg>
<seg id="9">The worst situation is for single parents raising their offspring, among whom 32% declare a good or rather good material situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among couples with children, this percentage varies (depending on the number of children) from 55% to 60%, and among childless households it is 48.8%.</seg>
<seg id="11">These statistics clearly show the effect of the 500 + programme.</seg>
<seg id="12">Before it was launched (in 2016), the worst financial situation was assessed by single parents and large families (with at least three children).</seg>
<seg id="13">Improving subjective assessments of the material situation of Poles is a reflection of the rapid growth of income, mainly from work.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, this is not all, because the percentage of households that consider their situation to be good increases faster than real income.</seg>
<seg id="15">Moreover, at the level of voivodships there is no clear relationship between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households.</seg>
<seg id="16">The best assessments are formulated by the inhabitants of the Opole voivodship, where 48.9% of the respondents consider their situation to be good or rather good.</seg>
<seg id="17">Next are Lubuskie (47.7%), Śląskie (47.6%), Mazowieckie (47.3%) and Zachodniopomorskie (47.1%).</seg>
<seg id="18">Whereas in Opole the disposable income (that is, after paying taxes and contributions) was less than 94% of the national average last year, and in Lubuskie 98%.</seg>
<seg id="19">The inhabitants of Mazowiecki (120% of the national average) and Śląskie (104%) had the highest income.</seg>
<seg id="20">On average in Poland, disposable income per person amounted to PLN 1,693 in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="21">In real terms (after the correction on the impact of price changes) it increased by 4.3% compared to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="22">Compared to previous years, this is quite low.</seg>
<seg id="23">In 2016, per capita income increased by 7% and a year later by 6.3%.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although income growth slows down, it also hampers spending growth.</seg>
<seg id="25">Those per person amounted to PLN 1187 last year, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7%.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is the first such case since 2013.</seg>
<seg id="27">In 2017, spending per person increased by 1.9% in real terms and 4.3% in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="28">Household budget surveys suggest that a statistical household currently spends 70.1% of its disposable income, while that share exceeded 80% in 2014 and exceeded 90% by 2006.</seg>

<seg id="1">Niesiołowski critical of the pope.</seg>
<seg id="2">John Paul II did nothing</seg>
<seg id="3">In an interview with Piotr Lekszycki, Stefan Niesiołowski emphasized that in 1981 John Paul II was a great authority for opposition activists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Actually, his every sentence was accepted."</seg>
<seg id="5">There was later criticism of some of his actions.</seg>
<seg id="6">"For me, the fact that John Paul II could not eliminate the harmful activity of Rydzyk puts a great shadow on his pontificate.</seg>
<seg id="7">After all, this Redemptorist - a pest of the Church and Poland - was developing his media into the best during the life of the Polish Pope," he explained.</seg>
<seg id="8">The former politician of the Civic Platform admitted: there were murmurs of discontent, the pope said something, once he did not accept Rydzyk but he had authority and for politicking he could simply throw him out of the Church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor there.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, John Paul II did not do it, neither did his successors," explained Niesiołowski.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Besides, there was this terrible matter of pedophilia and actions of the Church, and in fact their lack.</seg>
<seg id="11">I ran a little forward thinking, but I wanted to draw attention to the whole of his life.</seg>
<seg id="12">We have known about the scale of pedophilia in the Church since relatively recently.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question arises how it is possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting matters', says Niesiołowski in an interview with a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to the former politician of the Civic Platform, the Polish Church is an ally of the Law and Justice party.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We must admit that during the period of Solidarity the Church was our most important ally.</seg>
<seg id="16">All ceremonies began with the Holy Mass, with crosses hanging everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now these crosses are written, they have become a symbol of dictatorship - a sign of the written regime.</seg>
<seg id="18">I repeat: one of the biggest unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk are shaking the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing in this matter and that today the Church is an ally of the Law and Justice party.</seg>
<seg id="19">This is a black chapter of the Polish Church, for which he will pay dearly," argued Niesiołowski.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I hope that pope Francis is chasing Jędraszewski, Rydzyk and a few others of this type," he concluded.</seg>

<seg id="3">The clash within the Polish Cup between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechia Gdańsk by a small hair did not end tragically, when fired by fans from Wejherowo turns by millimeters passed the goalkeeper of the opposing team, Zlatan Alomerović.</seg>
<seg id="4">After this incident, the match was abandoned for 20 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="5">The PZPN committee investigating this case imposed a severe penalty on Gryf, excluding him from future games.</seg>
<seg id="6">The club will not be able to compete in the Polish Cup in the 2020/2021 season.</seg>
<seg id="7">Additionally, fans will not be allowed into their own stadium in the next match.</seg>

<seg id="9">Burdy at Widzew Łódź stadium was also caused by fans of Śląsk Wrocław.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here, however, the verdict of the PZPN was softer, because Silesia warned that similar events could occur and sensitized the relevant authorities in this matter.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite this, the services allowed for throwing rackets at the Łódź fans' sector, setting fire to chairs and pushing the hosts' sector.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will be necessary to consider whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade," said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, leader of the Agreement Jarosław Gowin on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Gowin during an interview in 'Signals of the Day' on radio Jedynka stated that trade is controlled by international networks which impose such low margins on Polish producers that Polish companies cannot develop.</seg>
<seg id="4">Considering that it is very difficult to fight this problem, the Deputy Prime Minister reminded that the government of the Law and Justice party tried to deal with it at the very beginning of the term of office, but got 'a counter-attack from the European Commission'.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We won before the court of justice and I hope that if the United Right wins the next election and formulates a government, we will come back to this topic," he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He also noted that "effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish, that is, small trade."</seg>
<seg id="7">"It will be necessary to consider whether the government, the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade," said Gowin.</seg>
<seg id="8">In May, an EU court found that the European Commission had made a mistake in finding that the Polish retail tax was an unauthorised public aid.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Retail Sales Tax Act provided for the introduction of two trade tax rates: 0.8% on revenue between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4% on revenue above PLN 170 million per month.</seg>
<seg id="10">The tax was due to apply from September 2016.</seg>
<seg id="11">In September 2016 the European Commission initiated proceedings for violation of EU law by Poland.</seg>
<seg id="12">Brussels then argued that the design of the tax could favour smaller shops, which could be considered public aid.</seg>
<seg id="13">It then found that the tribute had been implemented in an unlawful manner.</seg>
<seg id="14">It also issued an order to suspend the application of the tax until its analysis is completed by officials in Brussels.</seg>
<seg id="15">Poland did not agree with this position, but the tax collection was suspended.</seg>
<seg id="16">The EU court's decision in May opened the way for the tax to be reintroduced, but it did not end the case.</seg>
<seg id="17">On 24 July, the Commission brought an appeal before the Court of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="18">On Thursday, the CJEU press service told PAP that the case is currently at a written stage in which both the European Commission and the Polish government present their arguments in writing.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not yet known whether and when the oral procedure will start, that is, hearing the parties and a possible hearing.</seg>
<seg id="20">It takes a good few to several months from filing an appeal to announce the verdict.</seg>

<seg id="1">How to dress a child for baptism?</seg>
<seg id="2">We suggest some practical solutions</seg>
<seg id="3">Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of the infant and his parents.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is often the first occasion on which the whole family gathers around the child, celebrating his appearance in the world together.</seg>
<seg id="5">No wonder, then, that newly baked mum and dad want their child to look their best on this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, before you make a final decision about your child's outfit, consider whether it will also be comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="7">In shops you can find many costume sets that do not provide the toddler with proper comfort.</seg>
<seg id="8">So what should you pay attention to?</seg>
<seg id="9">The basic criterion for choosing clothes for baptism is the age of the child</seg>
<seg id="10">Until recently, a few weeks old babies were baptized, dressed in white sets and put in the same becks or big cushions.</seg>
<seg id="11">Today, children who receive the sacrament are often older: several months old, one year old and even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is not difficult to guess that such a big consolation needs slightly different clothes for baptism.</seg>
<seg id="13">Therefore, if your child is 3-4 months old on the day of baptism, he will probably spend the ceremony in a stroller or in the hands of his parents or godparents.</seg>
<seg id="14">The best solution will therefore be to decorate it in comfortable, cotton sleeping bags or sets.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although this piece of clothing is considered an everyday outfit, it is enough to look for its festive variants, for example with frill or lace.</seg>
<seg id="16">For the boy, a body with a print of flies and braces will be perfect.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the case of older children, you can afford more fantasy in clothing.</seg>
<seg id="18">The little girl will look beautiful in a simple tulle dress</seg>
<seg id="19">Many parents of girls look longingly towards richly decorated, frilly dresses for baptism complete with coats, bands and hats.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers use artificial, non-breathable materials, in which the child is simply uncomfortable.</seg>
<seg id="21">In search of the right clothes, it will be better to look at the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant outfits on cotton lining.</seg>
<seg id="22">Delicate, tulle skirts, satin dresses, laces, applications and charming sets will make your daughter look beautiful and feel comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="23">The perfect outfit for a little gentleman: a cotton suit</seg>
<seg id="24">Until recently, among parents of boys, there was a fashion for suits that were a copy of "adult" models.</seg>
<seg id="25">Polyester jackets and trousers, stiff collars or couches often made young elegants loudly demonstrate their dissatisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="26">Today, fortunately, they have been displaced by comfortable cotton sets.</seg>
<seg id="27">Just look at the sets available in Asanti for Kids, which are soft, sweatpants, and a blouse decorated at the front on the pattern of a vest.</seg>
<seg id="28">These outfits look extremely festive, and at the same time do not restrict the movements of a toddler learning about the world.</seg>

<seg id="2">British MPs voted against a three-day pause in the House of Commons for the Conservative Party's annual programme conference, as requested by the government.</seg>
<seg id="3">289 MPs voted in favour, 306 against.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is customary for the House of Commons not to meet during party conferences so that MPs do not have to resign from either participating in them or from parliamentary meetings.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, opposition parties felt that, at such a crucial time as the last weeks before the UK's planned exit from the European Union on 31 October, Parliament should not interrupt its deliberations.</seg>
<seg id="6">289 MPs voted in favour of the government's request for a break, 306 against.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two opposition parties after the conventions</seg>
<seg id="8">The lack of consent to the interruption may be seen as a political revenge of the opposition on Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday, the decision was declared illegal and non-existent by the Supreme Court) and for not wanting to apologise for it after the judges' ruling.</seg>
<seg id="9">Following this ruling, the House of Commons resumed its session on Wednesday, and the most important event of the day was Johnson's speech and subsequent stormy debate.</seg>
<seg id="10">Johnson accused the opposition of blocking Brexit and avoiding an early election.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It's time to deliver Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="12">It must be implemented in order to respect the outcome of the referendum.</seg>
<seg id="13">Brexit must come so that we can deal with an agreement on citizens' priorities, on health care, on the cost of living.</seg>
<seg id="14">Brexit needs to be delivered so that we can unite this country," Johnson said.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Conservative Party conference is due to begin in Manchester next Sunday and run until Wednesday 2 October.</seg>
<seg id="16">Conferences of the two main opposition groups - the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats - have already taken place.</seg>
<seg id="17">One of the justifications Johnson gave in explaining such a long suspension of parliament was the party conferences.</seg>

<seg id="2">"President Andrzej Duda believes that anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders," foreign media write.</seg>
<seg id="3">The president's spokesman strongly denied these reports.</seg>
<seg id="4">"It's just not true," Błażej Spychalski wrote on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="5">Israeli media, among the others, 'Haaretz' and 'Jerusalem Post', referring to 'Jewish Insider', write that Andrzej Duda, during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora in the consulate of the Polish Republic in New York, stated that Israel was to blame for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="6">The president said that the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland was a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.</seg>
<seg id="7">He referred to the words of the Israeli foreign minister Israel Katz, who stated in February that "Poles will blow up anti-Semitism with mothers' milk."</seg>
<seg id="8">Andrzej Duda said he regretted that Israel had not apologized for the humiliating statements of its politicians.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also mentioned the act of aggression against the Polish ambassador to Israel Marek Magierowski.</seg>
<seg id="10">In May, he was attacked by an attacker who shouted: "Pole, Pole".</seg>
<seg id="11">"The quote is not only inaccurate.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's just not true," Błażej Spychalski wrote on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="13">He emphasized that Duda "never said that Israel was responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland."</seg>
<seg id="14">According to Spychalski, the portal "invented it".</seg>

<seg id="2">The tenement house rented by the cellars led the journalist to discover negligence in Marian Banasia's property statements.</seg>
<seg id="3">We sum up another scandal that has shaken the ruling camp.</seg>
<seg id="4">Journalists of TVN 'Supervisor' revealed that Marian Banaś, the president of the Supreme Chamber of Control, has not entered a 400-meter tenement house, which is located in Kraków's Podgórze, into the property statement in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="5">Moreover, his sub-tenant was to run a sex business in the mentioned tenement house (that is, rent rooms for hours).</seg>
<seg id="6">In turn, the building itself has allegedly been a collateral for repayment of the loan since 2016.</seg>
<seg id="7">Bertold Kittel pointed out the irregularities in the "Supervisor" program.</seg>
<seg id="8">The journalist revealed that from Banasia the tenement house was rented by people associated with the criminal world to use it as a place of "erotic encounters".</seg>
<seg id="9">The clients were men using the services of prostitutes.</seg>
<seg id="10">Banas answered the allegations vaguely and vaguely.</seg>
<seg id="11">Interestingly, the tenement rented by the cellars led the journalist to discover negligence in Banasia's property statements.</seg>
<seg id="12">The house itself was described vaguely, and the income from renting it was to be underestimated.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The property of Marian Banasia and his wife may be worth 6 to 8 million zlotys.</seg>
<seg id="14">In total, spouses can boast of two houses, three apartments, savings [...]," writes Money.pl.</seg>
<seg id="15">And according to the analysis of the portal, the Banasia tenement house itself was worth about PLN 3 million.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Central Anti-Corruption Bureau is currently conducting an audit of Marian Banasia's property statements for the years 2015-2019.</seg>
<seg id="17">Banas announced that he would suspend his activities at the Supreme Chamber of Control until its completion. "I will apply to the Marshal for free leave," he assured.</seg>
<seg id="18">The opposition demands clarification.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We do not hear that CBA has expanded its investigation or accelerated the examination of Marian Banasia's property statements.</seg>
<seg id="20">That is why we are forced to exonerate the organs of the state and submit a notification about the possibility of committing a crime [...]," said Mariusz Witczak, PO-KO MP.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If a normal Pole valued the rental of his properties so grossly low, he would already have 10 inspections, a tax charge and criminal-fiscal proceedings," he added.</seg>
<seg id="22">He went high, fell low</seg>
<seg id="23">Marian Banaś is the new president of the Supreme Chamber of Control.</seg>
<seg id="24">He was appointed to the position on 30 August 2019, for a six-year term.</seg>
<seg id="25">His candidacy was put forward by Law and Justice and approved by the party's politicians.</seg>
<seg id="26">Previously, Banaś was associated with the Supreme Chamber of Control in the years 1992-2005, he worked in this institution as an associate of Lech Kaczyński.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Rzeczpospolita": Ignoring a police officer's order will be punished</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the newspaper, neglecting a specific behaviour order issued by a police officer is to be a new kind of offence, threatened with a fine, arrest or restriction of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="3">Police trade unionists want to make such a change.</seg>
<seg id="4">The idea went to the Sejm Committee on Petitions.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The case is serious, because now more than half a million misdemeanor cases go to Polish courts every year," we read.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Rzeczpospolita" has established that the petition that the Independent Trade Union of Police Officers is writing to MPs on the amendment of the Code of Offences has a chance of success.</seg>
<seg id="7">The authors of the petition propose a new wording of Article 54a of the Code of Offences.</seg>
<seg id="8">It would read: "Whoever does not comply with the request or order of a public official, issued within the limits and on the basis of the provisions of the Act, is subject to arrest, fine or restriction of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Paragraph 3 of this provision refers to an identical penalty for those who do not obey orders, make it impossible or difficult to perform a business activity," the daily reports.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski told Rzeczpospolita that although he agrees with the main message of the proposal, he fears that if it is implemented, it can be used in matters of political manifestations.</seg>
<seg id="11">"In situations of freedom demonstrations, this would be disadvantageous and, instead of mitigating the situation, would even exacerbate it," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="12">Statistics provided by the newspaper show that 86% of citizens welcomed police interventions in 2018 and that 1.5 million interventions in the city are carried out each month by the services.</seg>

<seg id="2">Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook has collapsed, its Belgian subsidiary Neckermann operates.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the company has problems.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to VRT, Brussels Airlines announced it would cancel 105 flights in October due to Thomas Cook's bankruptcy problems.</seg>
<seg id="5">Neckermann also laid off 75 employees.</seg>
<seg id="6">All trips with the office that have been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but holidaymakers will be able to receive a refund.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Ghent court also declared the bankruptcy of three Belgian daughter companies: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.</seg>
<seg id="8">Currently, around 12,000 Belgians are abroad on trips purchased from Thomas Cook.</seg>
<seg id="9">Another 40,000 people were expected to leave the office by the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Monday, spokeswoman Thomas Cook Belgium Leen Segers said the company was now "fully operational" despite the declaration of bankruptcy by the British parent company, which caused concern among employees and customers.</seg>
<seg id="11">At that time, the office reassured that customers who bought trips in it would go on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thomas Cook - the oldest and one of the largest travel agencies in the world - declared bankruptcy on the night of Sunday to Monday.</seg>
<seg id="13">The immediate cause of the bankruptcy was the collapse of last-chance talks with creditors and potential investors on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="14">Creditors demanded that in addition to the £900 million rescue plan already agreed in August, the company gain an additional £200 million as collateral for the winter period, when travel agencies usually have lower turnover.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, the company's problems have been growing for several years, resulting in a debt of up to £1.6 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1">Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for your opinion</seg>
<seg id="2">Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion - such an unusual offer prepared for newcomers German Görlitz.</seg>
<seg id="3">The measures are intended to help combat the progressive decline in the city's population.</seg>
<seg id="4">Görlitz is the easternmost city in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="5">The beautiful pastel old town attracts 140,000 tourists every year.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, according to The Guardian, the city is struggling with significant problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Görlitz has the lowest wages in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">The city is also struggling with a steady decline in population.</seg>
<seg id="9">After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them left for the west of the country, which resulted in a 25% decline in the city's population.</seg>
<seg id="10">In 2013 it amounted to 54,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="11">In order to combat depopulation, officials came up with the idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.</seg>
<seg id="12">So far, 150 applications have been submitted to the programme.</seg>
<seg id="13">Two thirds of them were made up of residents of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="14">People from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom were also interested in the programme.</seg>
<seg id="15">"When we applied, we thought the program was meant to convince people to move to Görlitz," said one project participant.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Now we feel it doesn't matter if we stay here after four weeks or not," he added.</seg>
<seg id="17">The city has seven thousand vacant housing units, and unemployment is three times higher than the national average.</seg>
<seg id="18">Although the city authorities hope that some will move permanently, the main goal of the program is to get feedback from the participants.</seg>
<seg id="19">Information gathered from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revive smaller German cities.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We want to know more about what people need, and if they decide to move - what their motivation was," said Robert Knippschild, responsible for the program.</seg>
<seg id="21">Other cities have already experimented with ideas to lure new residents, offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first was Detroit, which introduced a program to pay promising young professionals to live and work in the city for a year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy, or in the American Tulsa, Oklahoma.</seg>
