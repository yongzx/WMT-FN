<seg id="3">According to Rafał Trzaskowski's announcement, a free prevention program for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the idea will not be implemented because it did not gain approval from the Ministry of Health and the subject of the Agency for the Protection of Medical Technology and Tarification.</seg>

<seg id="11">The government has a very strange position here that I don't understand ", said Rafał Trzaskowski.</seg>

<seg id="2">Tehran did not speak with the American side during the United Nations General Assembly in New York, despite the offer submitted by Americans to abolish sanctions - said Iran President Hasan Rowhani on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">US President Donald Trump commented that it was the Iranian side who asked to abolish restrictions, which he did not agree to.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Iran President Hasan Rowhani, the Americans have proposed abolishing all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for negotiations on a new international agreement.</seg>

<seg id="1">Judge of the voivodeship Administrative Court in Warsaw and husband of haters Emilia, who, according to her words and screenshots from WhatsApp, participated in stalking against judges, was restored to NSA ruling on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="2">Reason: Disciplinary proceedings have not been opened against him, so there is no reason to maintain the order of WSA President Wojciech Mazur to dismiss him from his duties.</seg>
<seg id="3">Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary spokesperson for the NSA, opened an investigation against Szmydt at the end of August, but it has not yet transformed into proceedings against him.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although the NSA, who acts as a disciplinary court in such cases, has to take care of the decision of the WSA president within one month of its issue.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this situation, a referee who publicly talked about his wife's mental problems to discredit her, who, due to suspicion of participation in the hater group, has been removed from the KRS office, will return to ruling and will give sentences on behalf of the Republic of Poland.</seg>
<seg id="6">Judge Szmydt denies his participation in the haters group.</seg>
<seg id="7">He claims that there is no evidence but fake screenshots and words from his wife he divorces.</seg>
<seg id="8">That's exactly what the other judges associated with ′′ Caste ′′ say, everyone is innocent, no evidence.</seg>
<seg id="9">And it's quite possible that they'll get their way.</seg>
<seg id="10">Because the prosecutor's office didn't lift a finger to secure evidence from their electronic media, she is also silent about the contents of Emilia Szmydt's phone, who stopped this phone in June for another matter.</seg>
<seg id="11">The police did not lift a finger to secure the devices of people who judge Waldemar Żurek pointed out as persecutors in the February report.</seg>
<seg id="12">No evidence - no problem Szmydt no problem ′′ Obsidian order ".</seg>
<seg id="13">There is also no problem with the head of NIK Marian Banasia about renting a tenement house to pimps and hiding income.</seg>
<seg id="14">CBA is checking his property statements.</seg>
<seg id="15">And he'll check when he checks.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Committee on Parliamentary Ethics will not take care of Banasiem, because the Sejm is suspended (but the Committee on State Control has somehow gathered to make a curiosal decision to cancel Deputy Banaś and appoint as acting his lawyer, although the law does not provide for such a strange combination).</seg>
<seg id="17">The whole thing reminds me of a movie novel, American, probably, about how my wife comes home and finds her husband with her mistress in bed.</seg>
<seg id="18">She's so amazed and devastated she can't say a word.</seg>
<seg id="19">Standing in the door speechless, while the lover quickly jumps out of bed, dresses and goes out.</seg>
<seg id="20">And the husband makes the bed.</seg>
<seg id="21">When the wife regains her voice and shouts: what is this?</seg>
<seg id="22">Who is this woman?</seg>
<seg id="23">Husband calmly asks: what woman, darling?</seg>

<seg id="9">On July 4, on American Independence Day, journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko, announced that a new political formation was created - #R Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="10">In recent years, Kolonko has been famous for running a Max TV channel on YouTube, where he comments on events in Poland and around the world.</seg>

<seg id="2">′′ The euro course will last in the coming months around the ceiling of PLN 4,35, which will be accompanied by poor economic activity on global markets ", promises Michael Bolliger from UBS Wealth Management.</seg>
<seg id="3">′′ The expectations of maintaining a sound pace of economic growth and a stable monetary policy are in favour of stabilizing gold quotes on the current ceiling ", says a specialist in a conversation with Banker. pl.</seg>
<seg id="4">In his opinion, despite the clear inflationary pressure, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide to raise its feet in an environment where the vast majority of central banks relieve politics.</seg>
<seg id="5">′′ While gold is properly valued - euro ratings should remain around the ceiling of PLN 4,35 in the coming months - Polish bonds are not attractive.</seg>
<seg id="6">Much more favourable profitability than Polish papers offer bonds from emerging markets ", assesses Michael Bolliger, head of asset allocation to emerging markets accompanied by UBS Wealth Management.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to a specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the global economic deterioration.</seg>
<seg id="8">′′ Global slowdown may continue to deepen, but there should not be a severe recession, and at most GDP dynamics slightly below zero ", promises Michael Bolliger.</seg>
<seg id="9">′′ Investors should undermine global actions that may harm the lack of prospects of resolving the trade conflict on the US-China line and other geopolitical risk factors, including Donald Trump and brexit impeachment procedure.</seg>
<seg id="10">Europe should behave relatively lowest among the stock markets ", it is based on the latest investor letter by the head managing UBS Wealth Management Marek Haefele.</seg>
<seg id="11">′′ Actions from euro area countries should behave worse than American, because they are more vulnerable in conditions of increased uncertainty around global trade and concerns about slowing down ", we read in the document.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to Michael Bolliger, after hossa on the safest countries bond markets pushed the profitability of German 10-year-olds up to minus 0,74., it is still possible to deepen the decrease in profitability.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, in the long term, the viability of long-term papers should no longer decrease, but only short-term, thanks to mitigating bank s' monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id="14">The biggest foot reduction field has Fed, which should lead to weakening American currency in the horizon of the next years.</seg>
<seg id="15">The long-term balance point for euro quotes is the pułap 1,29 ceiling, which would mean the 19 % potential of strengthening the single currency to the dollar.</seg>
<seg id="16">We are expecting further reduction in Fed's feet, resulting in a decrease in global monetary policy differences.</seg>

<seg id="2">Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered in the capital on Friday for the inauguration of a huge mosque considered to be the largest in West Africa.</seg>
<seg id="3">Muslims came by buses, cars and on foot to Bopp district, where a new mosque stood, which could accommodate 30 k. faithful.</seg>
<seg id="4">The object was built by the Mouride fraternity belonging to the Sufice mainstream of Islam, which dominates Senegal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Work on the mosque began ten years ago in a wet area of six hectares, transferred by the government.</seg>
<seg id="6">The name of the Massalikul Jinan mosque (′′ Path to Paradise ′′) comes from the title of the poem by Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the th century founder of the fraternity, worshipped by followers as a saint.</seg>
<seg id="7">The mosque is covered with Carrarian marble and has five minarets.</seg>
<seg id="8">The highest one is 78 meters.</seg>

<seg id="11">Builders say the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but the building still has no comparison to mosques in other regions.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Morocco, the Hassan II mosque in Casablanca can accommodate 105 k. faithful.</seg>
<seg id="13">The construction of a mosque, which cost over 30 million euros, was financed by private donations.</seg>
<seg id="14">The government, apart from the ground, gave lighting, sanitary equipment and financed road robots worth 10,5 million euros.</seg>

<seg id="2">′′ Today, PiS wants to bribe Poles by offering them free free on a loan that future generations will have to pay off ", says Grzegorz Schetyna in an interview for ′′ Republic ".</seg>

<seg id="7">In his opinion, the opposition has greater potential in this area than Kaczyński's party.</seg>

<seg id="7">He didn't play long in the US Open 2019 either, but he was able to publicly say that ATP activists are ′′ corrupt ", which hurt the organization's authorities so much that they implemented a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and after a few weeks gave this verdict about suspension of launch and another one fine.</seg>
<seg id="8">He was forgiven, however, after hearing the blame and hearing the context of the statement.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the justification, however, tennis activists stated that the investigation showed that Kyrgios's behaviour throughout the past 12 months in many cases raised serious reservations and was almost constant violation of the rules, that he constantly insulted people associated with tournaments and viewers, hence high punishment.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately postponed the execution of the sentence, ordering several conditions to be fulfilled in the next six months: in the ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgios can no longer violate the rules of the code of conduct of professional tennis players in any way in particular, he can no longer curse, destroy rockets, argue with judges and the audience, or any other way to act indecent and vulgar.</seg>
<seg id="11">He also received a recommendation to seek ′′ continuous support ′′ from mental coaches during tournaments and also out of season consulting people specializing in solving the problems of athletes who can't handle proper behavior.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nick Kyrgios's first comment (on social media) on the verdict was: ′′ Hey everyone, I can still play.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just gotta control my behavior, that's all."</seg>
<seg id="14">In practice, the Australian will take at least two weeks break anyway, as his shoulder injury got sharpened in Lavera Cup, so he had to give up his upcoming launches in Beijing (September 30-October 6) and Shanghai (October 6-13).</seg>
<seg id="15">Kyrgios ranked 27. rd place.</seg>
<seg id="16">He won two tournaments this year - in Washington and Acapulco, earned over 1,3 million dollars., so even after fines he has a lot left.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the report published on Friday by GUS on household budgets, it appears that as a good or rather good material situation, it assessed as much as 44 % in ub.r. of them.</seg>

<seg id="4">A total of 8,1 % considered bad or rather bad material situation in Ub.r. households compared to 11,2 % a year earlier and over 20 % in 2009</seg>
<seg id="5">The best is the material situation of households of self-employed persons.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this group, more than 70 % considered good or rather good. respondents.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the second pole there are pensioners households, where the percentage of such answers was only 18 %</seg>
<seg id="8">The subjective assessment of the material situation of households is also influenced by the number of children.</seg>
<seg id="9">Parents raising offspring alone are the worst, of whom 32 % declare a good or rather good material situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among couples with children, this percentage varies (depending on the number of children) between 55 % and 60 % among childless households.</seg>
<seg id="11">These statistics clearly show the effect of the 500 % programme.</seg>
<seg id="12">Before it started (2016) the worst material situation was judged by parents raising offspring and multi-families (with at least three children).</seg>
<seg id="13">Improving subjective assessments of the material situation of Poles is a reflection of rapid increase in income, primarily from work.</seg>
<seg id="14">That's not all, however, because the percentage of households that consider their situation good is increasing faster than real income.</seg>
<seg id="15">Moreover, at the level of provinces there is no clear relationship between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households.</seg>
<seg id="16">The best grades are formulated by the inhabitants of the Opole voivodeship, where 48,9 % consider their situation good or rather good. tested.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Lubuskie voivodships are still here (47,7 %).), Silesian (47,6 %).), Mazowiecki (47,3 %).) and West Pomeranian (47,1 %).).</seg>
<seg id="18">Meanwhile in Opole, the income is available (i.e. after paying taxes and contributions) was less than 94 % in ub.r. the national average, and in Lubusz 98 %</seg>
<seg id="19">The highest income was the inhabitants of Mazowiecki (120 %). national average) and Silesian (104 %).).</seg>
<seg id="20">On average in Poland, the income per person was available in 2018 1693 PLN.</seg>
<seg id="21">Real (after correction by price changes) increased by 4,3 % against 2017</seg>
<seg id="22">Against the background of previous years, this result is quite low.</seg>
<seg id="23">In 2016 income per person increased by 7 % and a year later by 6,3 %</seg>
<seg id="24">Even though income growth is slowing down, it also inhibits expenditure growth.</seg>
<seg id="25">These per person were PLN 1187, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0,7 %</seg>
<seg id="26">This is the first such case since 2013</seg>
<seg id="27">In 2017 expenses per person increased real by 1,9 % and in 2016 by 4,3 %</seg>
<seg id="28">Household budget surveys suggest that the statistical household is currently spending 70,1 % its own income, while still in 2014 this share exceeded 80 % and until 2006 exceeded 90 %</seg>

<seg id="2">John Paul II did nothing</seg>
<seg id="3">In a conversation with Piotr Lekszycki Stefan Niesiołowski stressed that in 1981 John Paul II was a huge authority for opposition activists.</seg>
<seg id="4">′′ In fact, every sentence he had was accepted ".</seg>
<seg id="5">Then some of his actions appeared criticism.</seg>
<seg id="6">′′ For me, the fact that John Paul II couldn't eliminate Rydzyk's harmful activities, lays down a big shadow on his pontificate.</seg>
<seg id="7">After all, this redemptorist - a pest of the Church and Poland - developed his media into the best in the life of Pope Pole ", explained.</seg>
<seg id="8">Former PO politician admitted: ′′ there were grunts of dissatisfaction, the pope said something, once Rydzyk did not accept, but he had power and could simply throw him out of the church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to raise money for poor people there.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, John Paul II did not do it, so did his successor ", explained Niesiołowski.</seg>
<seg id="10">′′ In addition, this terrible issue of paedophilia and actions of the Church has come, actually the absence of them.</seg>
<seg id="11">I ran a bit forward, but wanted to draw attention to his lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="12">We've known about the scale of paedophilia in the Church since relatively recently.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question arises, how is it possible that John Paul II, being head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting things ", says in a conversation with journalist Niesiołowski.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the opinion of former PO politician, the Church is an ally of PiS.</seg>
<seg id="15">′′ We have to admit that during the Solidarity period, the Church was our most important ally.</seg>
<seg id="16">All celebrations started with the holy mass, crosses hung everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now these crosses are PiS, they have become a symbol of dictatorship - a sign of the PiS regime.</seg>

<seg id="2">′′ Effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will have to consider whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade ", said on Friday Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, leader of the Agreement Jarosław Gowin.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a conversation in ′′ Signals of the day ′′ on Radio One, Gowin stated that trade is mastered by international networks that impose such low margins on Polish manufacturers that actually Polish companies cannot grow.</seg>

<seg id="1">How to dress a child for baptism?</seg>
<seg id="2">We are giving you some practical solutions</seg>
<seg id="3">Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of an infant and his parents.</seg>
<seg id="4">Often is the first opportunity the whole family focuses around the child, celebrating his appearance in the world.</seg>
<seg id="5">So no wonder the freshly baked mom and dad want their comfort to look the best on this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, before you make the final decision about the child's outfit, think about whether it will also be comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="7">In stores you can find many outfits that do not provide the baby with proper comfort.</seg>
<seg id="8">So what should you pay attention to?</seg>
<seg id="9">The basic criterion for choosing baptism clothes is the age of the child</seg>
<seg id="10">Until recently, several weeks old little ones were baptized, decorated in white sets and put in the same beciks or big pillows.</seg>
<seg id="11">Today children joining the sacrament are often older: several months, one year old and even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's not hard to guess that such a big consolation needs a slightly different baptism clothes.</seg>
<seg id="13">So if your child is 3-4 months old on baptism day, he will probably spend the ceremony in a wheelchair or on the hands of his parents or godparents.</seg>
<seg id="14">The best option is to dress it up with comfortable cotton sleepyheads or sets.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although this element of the wardrobe is considered a daily outfit, just search for its festive variants, for example with frill or lace.</seg>
<seg id="16">A body with a bow tie and harness print will be perfect for a boy.</seg>
<seg id="17">For older children, you can afford a bigger fantasy in clothes.</seg>
<seg id="18">The girl will look pretty in a simple tulle dress</seg>
<seg id="19">Many parents of girls looking forward to richly decorated, frill dresses for baptism included with coats, bands and hats.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers for their manufacture uses artificial, non-breathable materials in which the child is simply uncomfortable.</seg>
<seg id="21">In search of the right outfit, it would be better to take a look at the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant outfits on cotton lining.</seg>
<seg id="22">Delicate tulle skirts, satin dresses, laces, apps and cute sets will make your daughter look beautiful and comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="23">Perfect outfit for a little gentleman: cotton suit</seg>
<seg id="24">Until recently, among the boys's parents there was a fashion for suits that were a copy of ′′ adult ′′ models.</seg>
<seg id="25">Polyester jackets and trousers, rigid collar or capquettes often made young elegant people loudly demonstrate their dissatisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="26">Fortunately, today they were denied by comfortable cotton sets.</seg>
<seg id="27">Just look at the sets available in Asanti for Kids, i.e. soft, sweatpants, and a blouse decorated at the front like a vest.</seg>
<seg id="28">These outfits look extremely festive and at the same time don't embarrass the movements of a toddler's world.</seg>

<seg id="11">′′ It's time to realize the brexit.</seg>
<seg id="12">It needs to be completed to respect the result of the referendum.</seg>
<seg id="13">Brexit needs to come in so we can deal with the agreement on citizen s' priorities, health care, the cost of living.</seg>
<seg id="14">Brexit needs to be realised so we can unite this country ", said Johnson.</seg>
<seg id="15">Conservative Party Conference is to start in Manchester this Sunday and will last until Wednesday October 2</seg>
<seg id="16">Conferences of two main opposition groups - Labour Party and Liberal Democrats - have already been held.</seg>

<seg id="2">Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion - such an extraordinary offer was prepared by German Görlitz for visitors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Actions are intended to help fight the progressive decrease in the number of residents of the city.</seg>
<seg id="4">Görlitz is the eastmost town of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="5">Beautiful pastel town attracts 140 k per year. tourists.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, as ′′ The Guardian ′′ writes, the city struggles with significant problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Görlitz has the lowest wages in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">The city is also struggling with a permanent loss of residents.</seg>
<seg id="9">Following the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them went west of the country, which translated into a decrease in the population of the city by 25</seg>
<seg id="10">In 2013 it was 54 thousand people.</seg>
<seg id="11">In order to fight depopulation, officials came up with an idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.</seg>
<seg id="12">150 applications have been received so far.</seg>
<seg id="13">Two thirds of them were submitted by the residents of the big cities.</seg>
<seg id="14">People from Hungary, Czech Republic, United States and UK were also interested in the program.</seg>

<seg id="16">′′ Now we feel that it doesn't matter if we stay here after four weeks or not ", he added.</seg>
<seg id="17">The city has seven thousand apartments available and unemployment is three times higher than the average country wide.</seg>
<seg id="18">Although the city authorities hope that some people will move permanently, the main goal of the programme is to obtain the opinion of the participants in the programme.</seg>
<seg id="19">Information collected from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help bring back smaller German cities.</seg>
<seg id="20">′′ We want to know more about what people need, and if they decide to move - about what their motivation was ", said Robert Knippschild.</seg>
<seg id="21">Other cities have already experimented with ideas for luring new residents, offering them accommodation incentives.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first one was Detroit, which introduced a program to pay promising young specialists for living and working in the city for a year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Today, these solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikyther to Candela in Italy or in American Tulsa, Oklahoma.</seg>
