<seg id="1">Father Józef Witko: I saw Jesus in a white robe</seg>
<seg id="2">He's charismatic.</seg>
<seg id="3">His Mass for release and healing draws crowds.</seg>
<seg id="4">He was a dozen years old when inexplicable things began to happen in his life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Today, through the Franciscan, others experience this.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Mass for release and healing, celebrated by Fr. Witko, draws crowds</seg>
<seg id="7">The parents of a 7-month-old baby who had a 7.5 mm hole in his heart came to see him.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was supposed to be operated on.</seg>
<seg id="9">Father Józef Witko prayed over him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later that day, the boy was rushed to hospital for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="11">Astonished doctors ruled: 'surgery is not needed, the defect is just 1.5 mm'.</seg>
<seg id="12">My parents cried with happiness.</seg>
<seg id="13">After another Franciscan prayer, the hole disappeared completely.</seg>
<seg id="14">He began to experience the unusual actions of the Creator as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="15">In his dreams, purgatory Souls came to him asking for help.</seg>
<seg id="16">I was woken up in the night and urged to pray for the dead and those who were dying in the moment, " he recalls.</seg>
<seg id="17">He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.</seg>
<seg id="18">And he had a vision of what happens to a man who commits a mortal sin.</seg>
<seg id="19">"My body started to change.</seg>
<seg id="20">I lost my human features and started to take on the appearance of an animal,” she says.</seg>
<seg id="21">An invisible force lifted him up, he couldn't get his voice out.</seg>
<seg id="22">He felt lost.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then God gave him a rescue.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Immersed in the waters of the river symbolizing holy baptism, I was freed and returned to human form...” I don't know, " he says.</seg>
<seg id="25">He never told anyone about these strange experiences.</seg>
<seg id="26">He had a vocation.</seg>
<seg id="27">He was 16 when he joined the Franciscans.</seg>
<seg id="28">In his sermons, he wanted not only to talk about Jesus.</seg>
<seg id="29">He wanted people to experience him alive.</seg>
<seg id="30">Members of the charismatic community of renewal in the Holy Spirit</seg>
<seg id="31">Many people participate in the healing masses celebrated by Father Witko, who hope to get rid of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, the clergyman stresses that their main purpose is spiritual healing, not carnal healing.</seg>

<seg id="2">On this afternoon (26 September 2014) Kolping FRAC team deservedly defeated the current Polish Darts Champion Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki at home in the 3. Lotto Table Tennis Superleague standings.</seg>
<seg id="3">The jaroslavians, in the same personnel combination they presented with grodziskanów, have a slim chance of winning against the league champions.</seg>
<seg id="4">This was demonstrated by a duel with Dartom Bogoria.</seg>
<seg id="5">The team is still missing the team's designated leader, Chen Jingqi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Perhaps with him in the squad, Yaroslavl could claim a third consecutive triumph in the new season.</seg>
<seg id="7">Young Asian Player Qiyao Han has yet to match the likes of Greek Panagiotis Gionis and Czech Pavel Sirucek.</seg>
<seg id="8">Not even with one of the most promising Poles, Marek Badowski.</seg>
<seg id="9">The player from Hellada was the biggest star of the match in the MOSiR Hall on Sikorskiego Street in Jarosław.</seg>
<seg id="10">Both Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei were a class in their own right.</seg>
<seg id="11">After three duels Kolping FRAC led 2-1.</seg>
<seg id="12">Kou Lei probably beat Marek Badowski and Daniel Górak after a thrilling five – set battle with Pavel Siruck.</seg>
<seg id="13">But then it got worse.</seg>
<seg id="14">Gionis gave no chance to Lea.</seg>
<seg id="15">There was still hope of winning by two points, but Qiyao Han failed to match Badowski.</seg>

<seg id="1">There will be no additional testing for seniors.</seg>
<seg id="2">Why?</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the announcements of Rafał Trzaskowski, a programme of free preventive tests for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the idea will not go into effect because it has not gained approval from the Ministry of Health and its subordinate agency for Health Technology Protection and Tarification.</seg>
<seg id="5">In its explanatory memorandum, the agency explained that the target group had been poorly selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">"These actions may even impair the detection of individual disease individuals, which may exacerbate the difficulty of accessing NHS services and negatively affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with false positive tests," they wrote.</seg>
<seg id="7">The decision of the ministry is not understood by the president of the capital.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The money is ours, we have money for it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The only thing the government is afraid of is that if people get tested they will go to the doctor later, which is absurd because the idea is to bring about a situation where prevention can be done more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="10">All the experts know that it helps when it comes to the burden of the health system, because it helps with the rapid detection of diseases and a reliable approach to health.</seg>
<seg id="11">The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand,” said Rafał Trzaskowski.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It's hard for me to imagine experts saying, Let's not get tested, because there will be longer queues at the doctor, and if such specialists are advising the government, I'm not surprised that the health service is in this state," Mr PO added.</seg>

<seg id="1">Palestine responds to Israel: we will scrap all existing agreements</seg>
<seg id="2">Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas told a session of the U. N. General Assembly on Thursday that he would scrap any agreements reached with Israel if the country's future government tried to comply with Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement to annex occupied Palestinian lands.</seg>
<seg id="3">"If the future government of Israel, which will be formed, proceeds to implement this plan, we will cancel all signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all commitments made," he announced.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We will reject the whole plan completely and completely," Abbas threatened with pressure.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It is our duty to defend all our rights by all possible means – no matter what the consequences – by fully engaging in the application of international law and in the fight against terrorism," declared the Palestinian Authority President, who made similar declarations in July.</seg>
<seg id="6">Netanyahu, Israel's former prime minister, was once again given the task of forming a government after the September 17 election.</seg>
<seg id="7">A week before the election, he announced that if he won it, he would announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and would include all Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank into Israel.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the early 1990s. Israel and the Palestinians, led by Yasser Arafat at the time, signed a series of peace agreements that the United States supported.</seg>
<seg id="9">The 84-year-old Abbas also promised during a session of the U. N. General Assembly to hold general elections on Palestinian lands.</seg>
<seg id="10">The last was held in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="11">”When I return home, I will call local elections in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, and all who oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community,” the Palestinian President solemnly declared.</seg>
<seg id="12">Abbas also defended in his speech the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer at the UN, to exercise the powers enjoyed by "full members of the UN and all its bodies and institutions."</seg>
<seg id="13">The Palestinian leader ended his speech with a call to the international community to "force Israel to comply with the provisions of the United Nations in full."</seg>
<seg id="14">Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas's speech, declaring that the Palestinian leader "would rather focus at the UN on the Palestinian Authority's efforts against Israel than fight against calls for terrorism in the Palestinian Authority under his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="15">Danon, the agencies note, made no reference, however, to Netanyahu's announced annexation of Occupied Palestinian lands.</seg>

<seg id="1">PLN 105 million for video game companies from the National Centre for research and development</seg>
<seg id="2">Almost PLN 105 million of the funding will go to companies in the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.</seg>
<seg id="3">The National Center for research and Development announced the results of the third edition of GameINN on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Among the nearly 30 projects supported by the NCBR were m.in. development of a platform for creating Field Games based on the AR game engine creating a map of the real world with an application for user data transfer; a test and training platform for verifying practical skills at work and training using VR and AI technologies; an innovative game simulating the management of real production processes using an innovative gameplay model based on the interaction of the virtual world with the real world using the Industry 4.0 concept, the NCBR announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="5">The goal of the GameINN sector programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game industry on the global market by 2023.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the NCBR, already today the Polish video game sector is growing at a rate of 10%. annual.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 amounted to PLN 1.85 billion, while the forecast for 2019 is PLN 2.23 billion.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The specially prepared GameINN research agenda and the support already reaching PLN 300 million for entrepreneurs under this sector programme provide an important impetus for the further, dynamic growth of the Polish gamedev", we read in the communication.</seg>
<seg id="9">The video game industry is an excellent example of the effective use of the potential that we have in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Incentives introduced by the government for innovative entrepreneurs, such as R &amp; amp; D concessions, competency improvement programmes, IP box and support programmes implemented by NCBR drive the innovative activities of companies and allow them to compete more effectively in a very competitive market", says Deputy Prime Minister, minister of Science and higher education Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the communication.</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of the Ministry of Science points out that money for innovation not only goes to innovators in the form of project funding, but also stays in their pockets – three-quarters more entrepreneurs benefited from R &amp; amp; D in 2018 than the year before. </seg>
<seg id="12">"The amount of deducted costs for R &amp; amp; D activities amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, which resulted in over PLN 300 million in savings for companies benefiting from this relief.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is equivalent to the support provided by the NCBR in the three editions of GameINN,” says the deputy prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="14">Wojciech Kamieniecki, director of the NCBR, recalls that in the two previous competitions, 78 innovative projects were awarded funding totalling over PLN 211.2 million.</seg>
<seg id="15">The huge interest in the competition and the variety of applications submitted show that the video game industry has the ideas and skills to further develop and increase its competitive advantage.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It is particularly pleasing that among the projects selected – as in previous editions – there are projects for solutions not only for entertainment, but also for Industry 4.0," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the third GameINN competition, entrepreneurs, consortia of entrepreneurs and consortia of entrepreneurs with scientific units could apply for funding up to PLN 20 million.</seg>
<seg id="18">The NCBR received 87 applications for a total amount of funding approx. £ 317m.</seg>
<seg id="19">The budget of the competition at the time of the announcement of the competition was PLN 100 million, but it was increased, thanks to which 27 projects received almost PLN 105 million in funding.</seg>
<seg id="20">Detailed results of the 3rd GameINN competition are available at ncbr.gov.pl.</seg>
<seg id="21">The GameINN sector programme is implemented under the Smart Development Operational Programme.</seg>
<seg id="22">NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to an initiative by entrepreneurs associated with the Polish games Alliance, which includes m.in. companies such as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team and 11 bit studios.</seg>

<seg id="2">The incident occurred on September 16.</seg>
<seg id="3">Dolberg, who joined Nice from Ajax at the end of August, realised after training that his watch had disappeared from the dressing room.</seg>
<seg id="4">Not just any, because it's worth 70,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Furious Dane did not show up for class the next day, citing stomach problems.</seg>
<seg id="6">The case was puzzling from the start.</seg>
<seg id="7">Players in the changing rooms have private safes at their disposal and the club's grounds are monitored.</seg>
<seg id="8">Diaby-Fadiga eventually confessed to the theft, according to the AFP news agency.</seg>
<seg id="9">The 18-year-old has already apologised to Dolberg and other teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.</seg>
<seg id="10">He also promised the Dane to return the money for the watch.</seg>
<seg id="11">Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising young footballers in France.</seg>
<seg id="12">He joined Nice as a 13-year-old, making his first-team debut three years later.</seg>
<seg id="13">He appeared in seven games that season.</seg>
<seg id="14">He recently signed a professional contract but, according to the newspaper L'equipe, the club are likely to terminate him with immediate effect.</seg>
<seg id="15">For now, he has opened disciplinary proceedings against his player.</seg>

<seg id="2">Tehran has not entered into talks with the U.S. side at the U. N. General Assembly in New York despite an American offer to lift sanctions, Iranian President Hasan Rowhani said on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">US President Donald Trump commented that it was the Iranian side who asked for the restrictions to be lifted, which he refused to do.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Iranian President Hasan Rowhani, the Americans offered to lift all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for negotiating a new international agreement.</seg>
<seg id="5">It would regulate both Iran's nuclear program and its ballistic missile program.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rowhani: Iran won't enter talks amid pressure</seg>
<seg id="7">The Iranian president said he had not agreed to the talks because of the "toxic atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="8">He said he had met with American diplomats because he had succumbed to pressure from France, Germany and Britain.</seg>
<seg id="9">He stressed, however, that Iran would not engage in talks under "maximum pressure."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in a 5+1 format, no one can predict what the end result will be," Rowhani said.</seg>
<seg id="11">A day earlier, the Iranian leader said he would not rule out talks with the U.S. and accused European parties to the nuclear deal of favoring U.S. sanctions on Iran.</seg>
<seg id="12">He added that sanctions imposed on Iran after the U.S. pulled out of the nuclear deal "are a precondition that does not allow" for dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="13">If we can lift that precondition and if America lifts sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America, " he declared.</seg>
<seg id="14">He added that he did not rule out a meeting with US President Donald Trump, even though he did not agree to such a conversation at the UN General Assembly last week.</seg>
<seg id="15">Trump: "Iran asked, I said no”</seg>
<seg id="16">Donald Trump tweeted that he rejected the Iranian side's request.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.</seg>
<seg id="18">Of course I said "no!""tweeted the US President.</seg>
<seg id="19">Tension with nuclear deal in the background</seg>
<seg id="20">France, Germany and Britain are trying to ease tensions between Washington and Tehran to salvage in some form a 2015 deal with Iran, of which they were signatories.</seg>
<seg id="21">It said that in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions, Iran would give up its nuclear weapons program and put its nuclear sector under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).</seg>
<seg id="22">Since the U.S. withdrawal from the agreement in May 2015, its other signatories have repeatedly said they want to keep the agreement in place.</seg>
<seg id="23">So far, nothing has come of it.</seg>
<seg id="24">Washington uses tactics to exert maximum pressure on Iran, and sanctions include a full embargo on Iranian oil.</seg>
<seg id="25">Tehran has said that if it does not get permission to export the raw material, it will limit its obligations under the agreement every 60 days.</seg>

<seg id="1">A judge at the Regional Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of Emilie's hater, who, according to her words and WhatsApp screenshots, was involved in stalking the judges, was reinstated by the NSA on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="2">Reason: no disciplinary action has been taken against him, so there is no basis for upholding the order of WSA president Wojciech Mazur to remove him from his duties.</seg>
<seg id="3">Judge Jerzy Chromicki, the disciplinary spokesman for the NSA, opened an investigation into Szmydt in late August, but it has not yet evolved into a case against him.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although the NSA, which acts as a disciplinary tribunal in such cases, has to deal with the decision of the president of the NSA within a month of its release.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this situation, a judge who has spoken publicly about his wife's mental problems in order to discredit her, who has been removed from the Office of the Supreme Court because of his suspected involvement in a hatter's group, will return to the bench and issue judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.</seg>
<seg id="6">Judge Szmydt denies his involvement in the hate group.</seg>
<seg id="7">He claims there is no evidence for this other than fake screenshots and the words of his wife, whom he is divorcing.</seg>
<seg id="8">That's exactly what the other judges associated with "caste" say: they're all innocent, there's no evidence.</seg>
<seg id="9">And it's quite possible that they'll get their way.</seg>
<seg id="10">Because prosecutors have not lifted a finger to secure evidence from their electronic devices, they are also silent about the contents of Emilia Szmydt's phone, which she seized in June in another case.</seg>
<seg id="11">Police did not lift a finger to secure the devices of those whom Judge Waldemar Żurek identified as stalkers in a February report.</seg>
<seg id="12">There's no evidence – there's no Szmydt case, there's no caste case.</seg>
<seg id="13">Nor is the case against NIK boss Marian Banasia of renting out the tenement to pimps and concealing income.</seg>
<seg id="14">CBA is reviewing its asset statements.</seg>
<seg id="15">And he'll check when he does.</seg>
<seg id="16">And the committee of parliamentary ethics will not take up Banas, because the Sejm is suspended (but the committee of State control somehow got together to make a curio-decision to dismiss banasio's deputies and appoint as acting his lawyer, although the law does not provide for such a strange combination).</seg>
<seg id="17">The whole thing reminds me of a movie novel, An American one, about a wife coming home and finding her husband in bed with her lover.</seg>
<seg id="18">She is so stunned and devastated that she can't cough up a word.</seg>
<seg id="19">She stands at the door speechless, and at that time the mistress quickly jumps out of bed, gets dressed and leaves.</seg>
<seg id="20">And the husband makes the bed.</seg>
<seg id="21">When the wife regains her voice and shouts: "What is this?"</seg>
<seg id="22">Who is this woman?</seg>
<seg id="23">The husband calmly asks: What woman, darling?</seg>
<seg id="24">Except when it comes to" caste " or Banasia, it's a parody of the state.</seg>
<seg id="25">And it's not funny at all.</seg>

<seg id="1">The power of the oława jumps.</seg>
<seg id="2">The title of the coverage of the amateur sports competition, played on Sunday afternoon 15 September at the Hippodrome on Oleandry Street in Oława, may be confusing to some.</seg>
<seg id="3">True power is a long way away, but this is the name of one of the types of horse competition...</seg>
<seg id="4">The power of jumping competition involves the rider and horse overcoming ever higher obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed up to two metres.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is worth to add that the long-standing and still unbeaten world record, set in 1949 by the Chilean Albert Larraguibel on the horse "Huaso", is 247 cm.</seg>
<seg id="6">No one has jumped this high in Oława, of course, but the result of the best local Amazons at 135 cm is not one of the worst...</seg>
<seg id="7">The competition organized by the tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other JKS activists "in the saddle", was a demonstration part of the "Rainbow riding competitions", about which we write more broadly in this issue of the newspaper, on Page 22.</seg>
<seg id="8">Eight Amazons, who train equestrian in oława JKS, joined the competition.</seg>
<seg id="9">Four competed on ponies and four on large horses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nikola Szołdra, riding a crazy "sprinter", was the best performer in the first group.</seg>
<seg id="11">This small but dynamic steed started by overcoming obstacles spread over a height of 40 cm, and finished only at a stationary position with the top beam 125 cm away from the ground.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he did not give up easily and after three consecutive rejections he was removed from further competition by the jury of the competition.</seg>
<seg id="13">Second place in pony jumping was taken by Amelia Pawlak, riding "Famy", and third by Lena Boruń on "Harmider".</seg>
<seg id="14">The youngest participant of the tournament - Inga Aksman, galloping and jumping over obstacles on the small mare "Carmen" - competed.</seg>
<seg id="15">There was even greater excitement among the contestants and spectators during the competition involving the big horses.</seg>
<seg id="16">Serious-looking falls included Paulina Shevczyk, who rode "Declaration," and Anastasia Abramenko, who rode "Lotta."</seg>
<seg id="17">Fortunately, apart from minor bumps, neither the Amazons nor the horses were harmed, so they continued to participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="18">A lot of problems with introducing the young mare "Wineta" to parkur had Weronika Łuczkiewicz riding her.</seg>
<seg id="19">It required either an assistant trainer or another horse to pair up, followed by the somewhat crazy "Wineta".</seg>
<seg id="20">After she passed the parkour hurdle, she also skidded full speed, so it got dangerous in the stalls and on the stretch. "Everything is under control!", reassured Jan Sienkiewicz some frightened viewers, especially the youngest ones.</seg>
<seg id="21">From the beginning of the big horses competition, Marta Masalska performed well on the parkura, riding a beautifully presented "Whisky".</seg>
<seg id="22">This dignified mare, paired with the experienced Amazon, was the first to jump 135 cm in the final stage and was the best result of the competition at the time.</seg>
<seg id="23">After a while, however, Paulina Shevczyk on "declaration", Veronika Łuczkiewicz on "Wineta" and Anastasia Abramenko on "Lotka"also scored the same amount.</seg>
<seg id="24">To decorate flo and to receive prizes in the form of equestrian equipment, all these contestants went together, and at the end together with Amazons on ponies in the tact of the March Radecki performed an impressive round of honour, ending with this interesting and exciting competition.</seg>
<seg id="25">Credits</seg>
<seg id="26">The Equestrian Sports Club " W saddle "warmly thanks the sponsors of the power of the jump competition during the XVI" Rainbow riding competitions": the Oława City office, the Oława Waterworks and sewerage plant, the district administration and the company"Mustang".</seg>

<seg id="2">KWW patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko is the name of the electoral committee under which the political formation #R Revolution of Mariusz Max Kolonko was to go to the October parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="3">The revolution targeted its proposal especially to young voters with right-wing views.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the election, Kolonko announced his cooperation with Marek Jakubiak or Paweł Kukiz, but none of these coalitions occurred, and the KWW patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko alone failed to gather enough signatures to issue lists in any constituency in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now Kolonko has announced on Twitter that he has ended his partnership with KWW's Max Kolonko's patriotic Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I will expect w/w KWW to remove my name from the name.</seg>
<seg id="7">I kindly ask you not to connect my person with the aforementioned entity,” he added, and announced that he would provide more information soon.</seg>
<seg id="8">For now, it is unclear whether the journalist will continue his work, or whether this is the end of the #R revolution formation.</seg>
<seg id="9">On July 4, on the American Independence Day, journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko, residing in the USA, informed about the formation of a new political formation - #R Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="10">In recent years Kolonko has become famous for hosting the YouTube channel Max TV, on which he comments on events in Poland and the world.</seg>
<seg id="11">"We are sick of politicians, sick of your stupid games, sick of your amateurish governments.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is time for the government in the state to embrace the nation and govern for the good of the nation,” Kolonko said at the time.</seg>
<seg id="13">The party's agenda included m.in. issues concerning the judiciary (she should be elected by General Election), tax changes (equalising the tax-free quota for all), war reparations (in the form of military aid to the eastern flank of NATO, with particular regard to Poland), holding a referendum on arms ownership, reducing the number of MPs or introducing single-member constituencies.</seg>
<seg id="14">A few days after the new political formation was announced, Mariusz Max Kolonko entered into talks with Marek Jakubiak.</seg>
<seg id="15">In late July, Kolonko posted a message on his social media profile suggesting that #R would join forces with the Kukiz'15 movement.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, none of these coalitions ultimately came to fruition.</seg>

<seg id="2">"The euro will remain around the € 4.35 ceiling in the coming months, accompanied by weak global markets," said Michael Bolliger of UBS Wealth Management.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Expectations of maintaining a solid economic growth rate and stable monetary policy are in favour of stabilising the zloty at the current ceiling," the specialist says in an interview with Bankier.pl.</seg>
<seg id="4">He said Despite clear inflationary pressures, the Monetary Policy Council would not decide to raise rates in an environment where the vast majority of central banks are easing policy.</seg>
<seg id="5">"While the zloty is properly valued – the euro should remain around the PLN 4.35 ceiling in the coming months – Polish bonds are not attractive," he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Emerging-market bonds offer much more favourable yields than Polish bonds,” said Michael Bolliger, head of asset allocation for emerging markets at UBS Wealth Management.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the global downturn.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The global slowdown may deepen further, but it should not lead to a severe recession, or at most to GDP growth falling slightly below zero," predicts Michael Bolliger.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Investors should be wary of global equities, hurt by the lack of prospects for a resolution to the US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risks, including Donald Trump's impeachment process and brexit.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among equity markets, Europe should be the least likely to behave, " according to a recent letter to investors by UBS Wealth Management Chief Executive Mark Haefele.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Eurozone stocks should fare worse than U.S. ones because they are more vulnerable amid heightened uncertainty around global trade and fears of a slowdown," the paper reads.</seg>
<seg id="12">Michael Bolliger's comments came after a slide in the bond markets of the safest countries pushed German 10-year yields to minus 0.74 per cent. it is still possible to deepen the decline in profitability.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the longer term, however, yields on long-term securities should no longer fall, but only short-term, due to the easing of bank monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Fed has the greatest scope for rate cuts, which should lead to a weakening of the U.S. currency over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="15">The long-term equilibrium point for the euro is a ceiling of $ 1.29, which would imply a 19 percent potential to strengthen the single currency against the dollar.</seg>
<seg id="16">We expect further Fed rate cuts, which will result in a narrowing of monetary policy differences around the world.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The dollar's strength in the long term may not be helped by current account and budget deficits," says Michael Bolliger.</seg>

<seg id="2">How to avoid them?</seg>

<seg id="4">Japan Airlines recently introduced a feature designed for people for whom travelling in the company of a crying child is a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="5">Through its website, the airline allows you to check the seating arrangements on the plane.</seg>
<seg id="6">If a child is traveling by age two, the "child icon" appears on a specific seat reserved by parents or guardians.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thus, the person using the carrier's services has the option of choosing a seat away from the one occupied by the toddler.</seg>
<seg id="8">The BBC reports that the airline has already informed the airline of the failure to do so.</seg>
<seg id="9">The "child icon" will not appear if the ticket has been booked by a third party or if there has been a last-minute change of plane.</seg>
<seg id="10">Unsurprisingly, the idea divided internet users.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some Twitter users point out that the problem of travelling with crying children can be solved with noise-cancelling headphones.</seg>
<seg id="12">They're children, we used to be.</seg>
<seg id="13">"We need to learn tolerance because soon we'll start to need a map of seating for mouth-breathing, drooling or drunks," user G Sundar wrote.</seg>

<seg id="3">"Our problem is not Wrocław, it is ourselves, we have to work on what we play," said kielczan coach Mirosław Smyła.</seg>
<seg id="4">The footballers recorded their last and so far only win in the league when they beat 1-0 beniaminek raków Częstochowa on away goals.</seg>

<seg id="15">We may not have shown that on the pitch in recent weeks, but there will come a point where we will win and we believe it will be on Friday,” the footballer said.</seg>

<seg id="2">"42 percent. the tree species that make up the tree stand of Europe is endangered," the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) warns in its "Red Book of European trees"published on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the top of the list are m.in. Chestnut and green.</seg>
<seg id="4">The IUCN, an organization based in Gland, Switzerland, is publishing a list of endangered European tree species for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was compiled by experts who, based on their research, found that of the 454 tree species found in Europe (as well as elsewhere in the world), 42 per cent. it is "at high risk."</seg>
<seg id="6">Among the causes, the red paper cites the rapid growth of urban agglomerations and global climate change.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, those trees and shrubs that occur only or mainly on our continent are most at risk.</seg>
<seg id="8">As for the typical European Tree, 58 percent are threatened, according to the IUCN. the species, and 15 percent, or 66 species of trees and shrubs, are threatened with extinction.</seg>
<seg id="9">Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Book Lists errors in the operation of the stands, accelerated urbanisation, over-intensive logging, and subsequently forest fires and changes in the European ecosystem.</seg>
<seg id="10">The existence of many European varieties of shrubs, mosses and lichens is also at serious risk, according to the report's authors.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The consequences of human activity are leading to the gradual disappearance of European plant species and are putting important and underrated varieties that form the basis of European ecosystems and affect the health of our planet in Europe at risk of extinction in Europe," concluded the report by Luc Bas, who heads the IUCN European office.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grzegorz Schetyna: I will not promise 600+</seg>
<seg id="2">"Today PiS wants to bribe Poles by offering them for their freedom to give away credit that future generations will have to repay", says Grzegorz Schetyna in an interview for "Rzeczpospolita".</seg>
<seg id="3">"The whole politics of PiS is pic,"he said.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the same time, the politician promises that "what is given will not be taken away."</seg>
<seg id="5">Schetyna assures in an interview with Jacek Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea to defeat Law and Justice.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's about mobilizing the electorate at the ballot box.</seg>
<seg id="7">In his view, the opposition has more potential in this area than Kaczynski's party.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today, conscious people who want to live in a normal state are more than supporters of PiS, a party that has embezzled proclaimed values such as modesty, humility, transparency," says Schetyna.</seg>
<seg id="9">The leader of the Citizens Coalition and chairman of the Citizens Platform also outlined the basic tenets of KO's electoral program.</seg>
<seg id="10">"First of all, nothing that the data will be taken away, but we need to set the direction for the future, because PiS is only dealing with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, as can be seen even after the dramatically low investments", he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Second, it is about "energising Poles, helping and investing in those who work hard - and those who are entrepreneurial."</seg>
<seg id="12">Schetyna explains that in the program KO was m.in. the project which the lowest earning poles will give more by 614 zlotys per hand, and more earning Poles – also several hundred.</seg>
<seg id="13">The politician also indicated that he did not want to run for re-election.</seg>
<seg id="14">As he said, he will do as much as he can, but not promise 600+.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I will never allow a Greek scenario where the rulers bid with the opposition for a handout until the country's financial collapse," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Schetyna also stated in an interview for "Rz" that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate him and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We would expose their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.</seg>

<seg id="5">The animals may have eaten the toxic carcass.</seg>
<seg id="6">Except for one juvenile, the rest of the dead condors were adults.</seg>
<seg id="7">'It's a big loss to the environment because the Condor needs to reach 10-15 years to become fertile and able to reproduce.</seg>
<seg id="8">So we're losing a protected species, an endangered species,” says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentine environmental organization.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Rz": they want a jewel for the president</seg>
<seg id="2">Work has begun on awarding the precious chain to the head of state.</seg>
<seg id="3">The idea was supported by Andrzej Duda's law firm – we read in "Rzeczpospolita".</seg>
<seg id="4">As the newspaper explains, it refers to the golden chain of the Order of the White Eagle, the royal insignia officially called in the interwar period the jewel of the Republic of Poland.</seg>

<seg id="6">"Rz" reports that soon such a chain may end up on the shoulders of Andrzej Duda.</seg>

<seg id="8">The Journal writes that this is not the first attempt to restore the chain to the head of state.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Senate had already proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it was defeated by one vote.</seg>
<seg id="10">This time the work is rapid.</seg>

<seg id="2">Police action will be carried out m.in. at the intersection of ciepliński Avenue and Piłsudski Avenue.</seg>
<seg id="3">The uniformed officers ' actions have something to do with recent complaints from city officials about drivers not always being able to behave properly at intersections.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Friday, September 27th, police officers begin "crossing crossing"prevention activities in Rzeszów.</seg>
<seg id="5">The idea is to eliminate traffic obstacles: entering an intersection without the possibility of a Exit, not following traffic signals or traffic signs.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We often think that we are alone at an intersection, and we are actually making life difficult for other drivers," Marek ustrobiński, vice president of the city, said a few days ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">His words resonated at a city hall press conference, where city officials presented examples of cars being improperly moved around intersections, resulting in traffic jams.</seg>
<seg id="8">At the time, the president appealed to travelers for common sense on the road and m.in. speeding at traffic lights or texting while driving.</seg>
<seg id="9">The subject was taken over by the Rzeszów police officers, who from today begin the operation "Przedsiębiorstwo przedsiębiorstwo".</seg>
<seg id="10">What is it?</seg>
<seg id="11">The aim of the measures is to eliminate the phenomenon of congestion at intersections by drivers entering them without being able to continue driving.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's a common offense that contributes to increasing traffic congestion and creating traffic jams.</seg>
<seg id="13">He faces a £ 300 fine and two penalty points.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, uniformed officers will look out for non-compliance with traffic lights or signs and improper parking in the intersection area.</seg>
<seg id="15">They will also observe a lack of driving fluency, a late start from under traffic lights, slow crossing and leaving too much distance between vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="16">At what junctions will the action take place?</seg>
<seg id="17">M.in on Lisa-Kuli street from Jagiellońska Street; Cieplińskiego Avenue from Piłsudski Avenue; Targowa street from Piłsudski Avenue; Śreniawitów street from Dąbrowskiego street or Hetmańska street from Warsaw's Al.insurgents.</seg>

<seg id="3">Under vital Heynen, the road to winning the title was closed by Thursday's 1-3 defeat to the Slovenians in Ljubljana.</seg>
<seg id="4">There was a lot of talk about their trouble travelling to this match.</seg>
<seg id="5">This time there were no such problems – they travelled with the Slovenians on a charter flight to Paris on Friday afternoon, and a few hours later they had a training session in the famous Bercy Hall.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to accounts of people present at the class, the world champion trainer was nervous.</seg>
<seg id="7">As Heynen's assistant Michał Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not just the exercise of the volleyball elements.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We went to the arena, but for the most part it was time for the team.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was more about spending it together than training.</seg>
<seg id="10">Talk, think about how to rebuild it all as a team,” he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">He confirmed that the semi-final defeat was a painful lesson for both the players and the coaching staff.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We were brutally brought down to Earth.</seg>
<seg id="13">We are obviously disappointed.</seg>

<seg id="15">We discussed the game among ourselves in the staff, the coach talked a lot with the players.</seg>
<seg id="16">I would point to inefficiency in attack and far worse than usual handling of situational balls as the two main reasons for failure.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Slovenians were much better than us in that respect,” he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">In his opinion, the "red and White" did not stand in the way of the stress of performing against the tournament's co-hosts, supported by a loud and large audience.</seg>
<seg id="19">He acknowledged that the world champions may have been somewhat put off by the smooth path to the semi-finals.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Perhaps if we had lost in the group stage in a similar style, we would have studied the lesson more quickly and played differently later in the tournament.</seg>
<seg id="21">But it's only a matter of time,” he said.</seg>
<seg id="22">Gogol is hoping the anger from Thursday's defeat to the poles can turn into aggression in the bronze medal match.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I hope we show our true colors then.</seg>
<seg id="24">There's a lot to fight for.</seg>

<seg id="2">An Australian tennis player has been handed a 16 – week ban and a $ 25,000 fine – with a six-month suspension-for reprehensible words, gestures and actions during recent ATP tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="3">ATP World Tour officials are losing patience with Kyrgios but are still giving him a chance to improve.</seg>
<seg id="4">The summary of the misdeeds of the most uncouth professional tennis player of recent years looks menacing – 16 weeks off plus a hefty fine, but both punishments are suspended for six months – a probation period in which the wayward athlete can improve.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nick Kyrgios is only 24 but has been playing for a long time and set a tennis world record – he had to pay the highest single financial penalty in the history of the discipline for breaching rules of behaviour on and off the court.</seg>
<seg id="6">Loud swearing, strange gestures, unsportsmanlike behaviour, insulting the referee and spectators, breaking two rackets during a losing match against Karen Khachanov – all paid $ 113,000 after August'S ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati.</seg>
<seg id="7">He did not play for long at the 2019 US Open, but he did publicly say that ATP officials were "corrupt," which hurt the organization so much that it launched a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and, a few weeks later, handed down a suspended start and another fine.</seg>
<seg id="8">But he was forgiven for speaking out about corruption after hearing the blame and learning the context of the speech.</seg>
<seg id="9">In a statement, however, tennis officials said that the investigation showed that Kyrgios ' behaviour over the past 12 months had in many cases raised serious concerns and constituted a near-constant violation of the rules, that he had continually insulted Tournament members and spectators in a vulgar manner, hence the heavy penalty.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately deferred the execution of his sentence, ordering him to comply within the next six months with several conditions: in ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour tournaments, Kyrgios must no longer violate the rules of the code of Conduct applicable to professional tennis players, in particular, he must no longer swear, destroy his rackets, argue with judges and the public, or behave in any other manner obscene or vulgar.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was also advised to seek "continuous support" from mental coaches during tournaments and also consulted in the off-season to deal with athletes not coping with proper behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nick Kyrgios ' first comment (on social media) to the verdict was: "Hey everybody, I can still play.</seg>
<seg id="13">I just need to control my behavior, that's all.”</seg>
<seg id="14">In practice, the Australian will have at least a two – week break anyway as his shoulder injury worsened in the Laver Cup, so he had to withdraw from the upcoming starts in Beijing (September 30-October 6) and Shanghai (October 6-13).</seg>
<seg id="15">Kyrgios is ranked 27th in the ATP rankings. place.</seg>
<seg id="16">He won two tournaments this year – in Washington and Acapulco-and earned more than $ 1.3 million, so even after the fines, he'll have plenty left.</seg>

<seg id="1">Niesiołowski was critical of the pope.</seg>
<seg id="2">John Paul II did nothing</seg>
<seg id="3">In an interview with Piotr Lekszycki, Stefan Niesiołowski stressed that in 1981 John Paul II was a great authority for opposition activists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"In fact, every sentence he said was acceptable,"he said.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was later criticism of some of his actions.</seg>
<seg id="6">"For me, the fact that John Paul II was unable to eliminate Rydzyk's harmful activities casts a great shadow on his pontificate.</seg>
<seg id="7">After all, this Redemptorist – a pest of the church and Poland – developed his media into the best even during the life of the Polish pope”, he explained.</seg>
<seg id="8">The former PO politician admitted: "there were grunts of discontent, the pope said something, he didn't take Rydzyk, but he had power, and for politics he could just throw him out of the church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to raise money for the poor there.</seg>
<seg id="9">But John Paul II did not do it, nor did his successors”, Niesiołowski explained.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said: "then there was this terrible case of paedophilia and the actions of the church, and actually the lack of them.</seg>
<seg id="11">I kind of rushed forward, but I wanted to draw attention to his whole life.</seg>
<seg id="12">We have known about the scale of paedophilia in the church since relatively recently.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question arises, how is it possible that John Paul II, being the head of the church, did not know about these disgusting things”, says Niesiołowski in an interview with the journalist.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Church is an ally of PiS, according to a former Polish politician.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It must be acknowledged that during the period of solidarity the church was our most important ally.</seg>
<seg id="16">All the celebrations started with mass, there were crosses everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now these crosses are written, they have become a symbol of the dictatorship – a sign of The Pisan regime.</seg>
<seg id="18">I repeat: one of the biggest unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk shake the Polish church, that John Paul II did nothing about it and that today the Church is an ally of PiS.</seg>
<seg id="19">This is a black chapter of the Polish Church, for which it will pay dearly,” argued Niesiołowski.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I hope that Pope Francis will pursue Jędraszewski, Rydzyk and a few others of this kind," he concluded.</seg>

<seg id="5">The PZPN commission investigating the case gave Griffin a severe punishment, ruling him out of future games.</seg>

<seg id="9">The brawl at Widzew Łódź Stadium was also caused by fans of śląsk Wrocław.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here, however, the judgment of the PZPN was more lenient, as Silesia had warned that similar events might occur and had alerted the relevant authorities in this matter.</seg>

<seg id="1">Gowin: "we need to boost Poland, small trade”</seg>
<seg id="2">"Effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, we will have to wonder whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade," Jarosław Gowin, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and higher education, said on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Gowin said during an interview in "signals of the day" on Radio One that trade is dominated by international networks, which impose such low margins on Polish producers that Polish companies cannot actually grow.</seg>
<seg id="4">Noting that this problem is very difficult to fight, the deputy prime minister recalled that the PiS government tried to deal with it at the very beginning of the term of office, but got a "counter-attack from the EC".</seg>
<seg id="5">"We have won before the court of justice and I hope that if the United right wins the next election and forms a government, we will come back to that," he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the same time, he pointed out that "effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the Polish problem, i.e. small trade".</seg>
<seg id="7">"It will be a question of whether the government, the state, has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade," Gowin said.</seg>
<seg id="8">In May, an EU court ruled that the European Commission had made a mistake in finding that the Polish retail sales tax was illegal state aid.</seg>
<seg id="9">The retail sales tax Act required two sales tax rates of 0.8 percent. on revenue between £ 17m and £ 170m a month and 1.4 per cent. on revenue of more than PLN 170 million per month.</seg>
<seg id="10">The tax was due to take effect from September 2016.</seg>
<seg id="11">In September 2016, the EC opened proceedings for infringement of EU law by Poland.</seg>
<seg id="12">Brussels argued at the time that the tax could favour smaller shops, which could be considered state aid.</seg>
<seg id="13">She later stated that the tribute had been implemented in an unlawful manner.</seg>
<seg id="14">It also ordered that the tax be suspended until officials in Brussels had completed their analysis.</seg>
<seg id="15">Poland disagreed with this position, but the tax collection was suspended.</seg>
<seg id="16">May's EU court decision opened the way for the tax to be reintroduced, but it did not end the case.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Commission lodged an appeal with the Court of Justice on 24 July.</seg>
<seg id="18">On Thursday, the press service of the European Court of Justice told PAP that the case is now at the written stage where both the European Commission and the Polish government present their arguments in writing.</seg>
<seg id="19">For now, it is unclear if and when the oral procedure, which includes hearing the parties and a possible hearing, will start.</seg>

<seg id="1">How do I dress a child for christening?</seg>
<seg id="2">Here are some practical solutions</seg>
<seg id="3">Baptism is an extremely important ceremony in the life of an infant and his or her parents.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is often the first occasion on which the whole family focuses around the child, together celebrating his or her emergence into the world.</seg>
<seg id="5">No wonder, then, that fresh-faced mums and dads want their children to look their best on the day.</seg>
<seg id="6">But before you make a final decision about your child's outfit, consider whether it will also be comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="7">In shops, you can find many outfits that do not provide the toddler with proper comfort.</seg>
<seg id="8">So what should we pay attention to?</seg>
<seg id="9">The primary criterion for choosing clothing for baptism is the age of the child</seg>
<seg id="10">Until recently, a few-week-old babies had been christened, dressed in white sets and tucked into the same buns or large pillows.</seg>
<seg id="11">Today, children entering the sacrament are often older: several months old, one year old, and even larger.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is not hard to imagine that such a large comfort would need a slightly different outfit for the baptism .</seg>
<seg id="13">So if your child is 3-4 months old on the day of baptism, he will probably spend the ceremony in a pram or on the hands of his parents or godparents.</seg>
<seg id="14">The best option, then, is to dress it up in comfortable cotton sleepers or ensembles.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although this wardrobe item is considered an everyday outfit, it is enough to look for festive variants, such as a frill or lace.</seg>
<seg id="16">For a boy, a body with a bow tie and suspenders is ideal.</seg>
<seg id="17">Older children can afford more fancy dress.</seg>
<seg id="18">The little girl will look lovely in a simple tulle dress</seg>
<seg id="19">Many parents of the girls look on fondly at the richly decorated, frilly dresses for the christening, complete with coats, headbands and hats.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers use artificial, non-inhaling materials for their product, in which the child is simply uncomfortable.</seg>
<seg id="21">If you're looking for the right outfit, you might want to check out the Asanti for Kids Store, which offers elegant outfits on cotton lining.</seg>
<seg id="22">Delicate tulle skirts, satin dresses, lace, apps and adorable ensembles will make your little girl look beautiful and comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="23">Perfect outfit for a small gentleman: cotton suit</seg>
<seg id="24">Until recently, there was a fashion among parents of boys for suits that were copies of "adult" models.</seg>
<seg id="25">Polyester jackets and trousers, stiff collars or helmets often made young men loudly demonstrate their displeasure.</seg>
<seg id="26">Today, thankfully, they have been supplanted by comfortable cotton sets.</seg>
<seg id="27">Just look at the kits available at Asanti for Kids, which are soft, sweatpants, plus a blouse decorated at the front in the pattern of a vest.</seg>
<seg id="28">These outfits look very festive, and at the same time they do not restrain the movements of the world-cognizant toddler.</seg>

<seg id="2">British MPs have voted against a three-day break in the House of Commons for the Conservative Party's annual conference, the government has requested.</seg>
<seg id="3">289 MPs voted in favour, 306 against.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is customary for the House of Commons not to sit during party conferences, so that MPs do not have to resign either from attending them or from sitting in Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="5">But opposition parties have said that at such a crucial time, which is the final weeks before Britain's planned exit from the European Union on October 31, Parliament should not be interrupted.</seg>
<seg id="6">289 MPs voted in favour of the government's recess motion, with 306 against.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two opposition parties after conventions</seg>
<seg id="8">The failure to agree to a recess could be seen as political revenge by the opposition on Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday the decision was declared illegal by the Supreme Court) and for refusing to apologise after the judges ' ruling.</seg>
<seg id="9">Following that ruling, the House of Commons resumed session on Wednesday, and the most important event of the day was Johnson's speech and the ensuing stormy debate.</seg>
<seg id="10">Johnson accused the opposition of blocking Brexit and avoiding an early election.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said: "the time has come to deliver brexit.</seg>
<seg id="12">It needs to be implemented to respect the referendum result.</seg>
<seg id="13">Brexit has to come so we can get on with the deal on people's priorities, on the health service, on the cost of living.</seg>
<seg id="14">Brexit must be done so that we can unite this country,” Johnson said.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Conservative Party conference is due to begin in Manchester next Sunday and run until Wednesday 2 October.</seg>
<seg id="16">Conferences of the two main opposition parties – Labour and the Liberal Democrats – have already taken place.</seg>
<seg id="17">One of the reasons Johnson gave in explaining the long suspension of Parliament was party conferences.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the newspaper, disobeying a specific conduct order issued by a police officer is to be a new type of misdemeanor, threatened with a fine, arrest or restriction of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="3">That is the change the police unions want.</seg>
<seg id="4">The idea went to the Sejm Committee on petitions.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The case is serious, because already every year more than half a million cases of misconduct are brought to the Polish courts," it reads.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Rzeczpospolita said the petition, which The Independent Police trade union is writing to MPs to change the offence code, had a chance of success.</seg>
<seg id="7">The authors of the petition propose a new wording for Article 54A of the code of offences.</seg>
<seg id="8">It would read:"Anyone who does not comply with the request or instruction of a public officer, issued within the limits and under the provisions of the Act, shall be subject to the penalty of arrest, fine or restriction of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Par. 3 of this provision provides for an identical penalty for those who fail to follow orders to prevent or impede the execution of an official act," the Journal reported.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski told "Rzeczpospolita" that although he agrees with the main message of the proposed rule, he fears that if implemented, it could be used in political matters.</seg>
<seg id="11">"In situations of freedom demonstrations, this would be counterproductive and instead of mitigating the situation, they would exacerbate it," he adds.</seg>

<seg id="2">Free accommodation in exchange for feedback – such an unusual offer has been prepared for visitors by the German city of Görlitz.</seg>
<seg id="3">The measures are designed to help combat the city's growing population decline.</seg>
<seg id="4">Görlitz is the easternmost city of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="5">The beautiful pastel Old Town attracts 140,000 visitors a year. tourists.</seg>
<seg id="6">But as the Guardian writes, the city faces significant problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Görlitz has the lowest wages in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">The city is also struggling with a steady decline in population.</seg>
<seg id="9">After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them left for the west of the country, resulting in a 25 percent decline in the city's population.</seg>
<seg id="10">It had a population of 54,000 in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="11">Wanting to fight depopulation, officials came up with the idea to start offering free monthly housing in the city.</seg>
<seg id="12">So far, 150 applications have been submitted to the program.</seg>
<seg id="13">Two-thirds of these were made up by residents of major cities.</seg>
<seg id="14">People from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom also took an interest in the program.</seg>
<seg id="15">"When we applied, we thought the program was to convince people to move to Görlitz," said one project participant.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Now we feel it doesn't matter if we stay here after four weeks or not," he added.</seg>
<seg id="17">The city has 7,000 vacant housing units, and unemployment is three times higher than the national average.</seg>
<seg id="18">While city officials hope some will move permanently, the main goal of the program is to get feedback from the participants.</seg>
<seg id="19">Information gathered from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revitalize smaller German cities.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We want to find out more about what people need and if they decide to move – what their motivation was," said Program Director Robert Knippschild.</seg>
<seg id="21">Other cities have already experimented with ideas to lure new residents by offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first was Detroit, which introduced a program to pay promising young professionals to live and work in the city for a year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Today, such solvents are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy, and in the American city of Tulsa, Oklahoma.</seg>
