<seg id="1">Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in a white robe</seg>
<seg id="2">He is a charismatic.</seg>
<seg id="3">For the mass he celebrated, he celebrated. for release and healing draw crowds.</seg>
<seg id="4">He was a dozen years old when inexplicable things began to happen in his life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Today, through the Franciscan, others experience it.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the Mass celebrated by Fr. Witko. for release and healing draw crowds</seg>
<seg id="7">Once, the parents of a 7-month-old child came to him, who had a hole in his heart the size of 7.5 mm.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was supposed to be operated on.</seg>
<seg id="9">Father Joseph Witko prayed over him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later that day, the boy was taken to hospital for surgery.</seg>
<seg id="11">Astonished doctors said, "Surgery is not needed, the loss is only 1.5 mm."</seg>
<seg id="12">My parents cried with happiness.</seg>
<seg id="13">After another prayer, the Franciscan hole disappeared completely.</seg>
<seg id="14">The clergyman began to experience the extraordinary actions of the Creator as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="15">In his dreams, purgatory souls came to him asking for help.</seg>
<seg id="16">I was awakened at night and urged to pray for the dead and those who were dying at the moment," he recalls.</seg>
<seg id="17">He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.</seg>
<seg id="18">And he had a vision of what was happening to a man who commits mortal sin.</seg>
<seg id="19">"My body began to change.</seg>
<seg id="20">I lost my human characteristics and started to take on the appearance of an animal," he says.</seg>
<seg id="21">The invisible force lifted him up, he could not get his voice out of himself.</seg>
<seg id="22">He felt he was lost.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then God pointed to his rescue.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Immersed in the waters of the river symbolizing baptism, I was freed and returned to the human form...", he says.</seg>
<seg id="25">He didn't tell anyone about these strange experiences.</seg>
<seg id="26">His vocation matured.</seg>
<seg id="27">He was 16 when he joined the Franciscans.</seg>
<seg id="28">In his sermons, he wanted not only to talk about Jesus.</seg>
<seg id="29">He wanted people to experience Him alive.</seg>
<seg id="30">Members of the charismatic community of Renewal in the Holy Spirit</seg>
<seg id="31">Witko's masses are attended by many people who are counting on getting rid of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="32">The clergyman emphasizes, however, that their main purpose is spiritual healing, not bodily healing.</seg>

<seg id="1">First defeat of Kolping FRAC Yaroslavl</seg>
<seg id="2">Today (September 26th) in the afternoon, the Frac Kolping team deservedly succumbed at home to the current Polish champion Dartom Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki in the 3rd. LOTTO Table Tennis Superleague.</seg>
<seg id="3">Yaroslavl in such a personal statement, which they presented with the bulkheads, have a slim chance of winning with the sovereigns of the league.</seg>
<seg id="4">This was clearly demonstrated by the duel with Dartom Bogoria.</seg>
<seg id="5">The team is still missing, called the leader of the team, Chen Jingqi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Perhaps with him in the composition of the Yaroslavl would reach for a third consecutive triumph in the new season.</seg>
<seg id="7">Young Asian Qiyao Han probably hasn't grown up to win with the likes of Greek Panagiotis Gionis and Czech Pavel Sirucek.</seg>
<seg id="8">Not even with one of the most promising Poles, marek Badowski.</seg>
<seg id="9">The player from Hellada was the biggest star of the duel in the MOSiR hall at ul. Sikorski in Yaroslavl.</seg>
<seg id="10">Against both Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei, he was a class for himself.</seg>
<seg id="11">After three duels, Kolping FRAC led 2-1.</seg>
<seg id="12">Kou Lei probably played Marek Badowski, and Daniel Górak after a thrilling five-set battle - Pavl Siruck.</seg>
<seg id="13">But then it got worse.</seg>
<seg id="14">Gionis did not give Leia a chance.</seg>
<seg id="15">One could still hope to win by two points, but Qiyao Han did not meet Badowski.</seg>

<seg id="1">There will be no additional research for seniors.</seg>
<seg id="2">Why?</seg>
<seg id="3">As announced by Rafał Trzaskowski, a program of free preventive examinations for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not received the approval of the Ministry of Health and its subordinate Agency for the Protection of Medical Technologies and Tarification.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the explanatory memorandum, the agency explained that the target group had been poorly chosen.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The above actions may even result in the detection of individual disease units, which may contribute to aggravating difficulties in accessing NFZ services and negatively affecting the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with false positive test results," they wrote.</seg>
<seg id="7">The decision of the ministry does not understand the president of the capital.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The money is ours, we have foreseen the money for it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only the government is afraid that if people get tested, then later they will go to the doctor, which is absurd, because it is precisely about bringing about a situation where prevention can be done more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="10">All specialists know that this helps when it comes to the burden on the health system, because it helps in the rapid detection of diseases and in a reliable approach to health.</seg>
<seg id="11">The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand," said Rafał Trzaskowski.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It is difficult for me to imagine that experts say, Let's not be afraid, because there will be longer queues with a doctor, and if such specialists advise the government, Then I am not surprised that there is a health service in this state," added the OP politician.</seg>

<seg id="1">Palestine responds to Israel: We will break all existing agreements</seg>
<seg id="2">Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced at a session of the UN General Assembly on Thursday that he would tear up any agreements reached with Israel if the country's future government tries to fulfill Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement of an annexation of occupied Palestinian lands.</seg>
<seg id="3">"If the future Israeli government that will be created proceeds to implement this plan, we will nullify all signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all commitments made," he said.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We will reject the whole plan completely and completely," Abbas insisted.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It is our duty to defend all our rights by all possible means – not important what the consequences will be – by fully engaging in the application of international law and the fight against terrorism," declared the President of the Palestinian Authority, who has already made similar declarations in July.</seg>
<seg id="6">Netanyahu, the former Prime Minister of Israel, was once again given the mission of forming a government after the 17th elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">A week before the elections, he announced that if he won it, he would announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and intend to include all Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank in Israel.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, led by Jaser Arafat at the time, signed a series of peace agreements that were patronized by the United States.</seg>
<seg id="9">The 84-year-old Abbas also promised to hold a general election on Palestinian soil during the UN General Assembly session.</seg>
<seg id="10">The last one took place in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="11">"When I return home, I will convene local elections in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, and all those who oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community," declared the Palestinian President solemnly.</seg>
<seg id="12">In his speech, Abbas also defended the rights of Palestine, regarded as a permanent observer at the UN, to exercise the powers of "full members of the UN and all its bodies and institutions."</seg>
<seg id="13">The Palestinian leader concluded the speech by calling on the international community to "force Israel to comply with all the provisions of the United Nations."</seg>
<seg id="14">Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas' speech, declaring that the Palestinian leader "prefers to focus at the United Nations on the Palestinian Authority's efforts against Israel rather than fighting against calls for terrorism under his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="15">Danon, according to the agencies, did not refer, however, to Netanyahu's announced annexation of occupied Palestinian lands.</seg>

<seg id="1">PLN 105 million for video game companies from the National Centre for Research and Development</seg>
<seg id="2">Almost PLN 105 million in funding will go to companies from the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.</seg>
<seg id="3">The National Center for Research and Development announced on Friday the results of the 3rd edition of the GameINN program.</seg>
<seg id="4">Among the nearly 30 projects supported by NCBR were m.in. developing a platform for creating field games based on an AR game engine that creates a map of the real world together with an application that allows users to transfer data; a test and training platform for the verification of practical skills at the workplace and professional development using VR and AI technologies; an innovative game simulating real-world process management using an innovative gameplay model based on the interaction of the virtual world with the real world using the concept of industry 4.0 – stated in the NCBR message sent on Friday PAP.</seg>
<seg id="5">The aim of the GameINN sectoral program is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game industry on the global market with a view to 2023.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to NCBR, the Polish video game sector is already growing at a rate of 10% per year.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 was PLN 1.85 billion, and the forecast for 2019 is 2.23 billion.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The specially prepared GameINN research agenda and the support for entrepreneurs already reaching PLN 300 million under this sectoral programme represent an important impetus for the further dynamic growth of The Polish gamedev," the communication reads.</seg>
<seg id="9">The video game industry is an excellent example of the effective use of the potential we have in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The government's incentives for innovation-driven entrepreneurs, such as R&amp;amp;D relief, competence improvement programmes, IP box and support programmes implemented by NCBR, drive the innovative activities of companies and allow them to compete more effectively in a highly competitive market," says Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the communication.</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of the science department points out that money for innovation not only goes to innovators in the form of project funding, but also stays in their pockets – three-quarters more entrepreneurs benefited from the R&amp;amp;D relief in 2018 than the year before.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The deducted costs for R&amp;amp;D activities amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, which resulted in more than PLN 300 million in savings for companies benefiting from this relief.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is the equivalent of the support provided by NCBR in the three editions of GameINN", stresses the Deputy Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="14">Director of NCBR Dr. Ind. Wojciech Kamieniecki points out that in the two previous competitions, grants totalling over PLN 211.2 million were awarded to 78 innovative projects.</seg>
<seg id="15">The huge interest in the 3rd competition and the variety of applications submitted show that the video game industry has ideas and competences to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It is particularly pleasing that the selected projects – as in previous editions – include projects for solutions not only for entertainment, but also related to industry 4.0,"he adds.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the third GameINN competition, entrepreneurs, consortia of entrepreneurs and consortia of entrepreneurs with scientific units could apply for funding of up to PLN 20 million.</seg>
<seg id="18">The NCBR received 87 applications for a total grant amount of approximately EUR 100 million. 317 million PLN.</seg>
<seg id="19">The budget of the competition at the time of the announcement of the competition was PLN 100 million, but it was increased, thanks to which 27 projects were awarded almost PLN 105 million in funding.</seg>
<seg id="20">Detailed information about the results of the GameINN 3rd competition is available on the ncbr.gov.pl website.</seg>
<seg id="21">The GameINN sectoral programme is implemented under the Intelligent Development Operational Programme.</seg>
<seg id="22">NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs associated in the Polish Games Agreement, which includes m.in. companies such as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team and 11 bit studios.</seg>

<seg id="2">The incident occurred on September 16.</seg>
<seg id="3">Dolberg, who arrived from Ajax Amsterdam to Nice at the end of August, realized after training that his watch had disappeared from the locker room.</seg>
<seg id="4">Not just any, because it's worth 70,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="5">The furious Dane did not show up in class the next day, explaining his stomach problems.</seg>
<seg id="6">The case was puzzling from the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="7">Players in the changing room have private safes at their disposal and the club area is monitored.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the AFP agency, Diaby-Fadiga eventually confessed to the theft.</seg>
<seg id="9">The 18-year-old has already apologised to Dolberg and other team-mates and coach Patrick Vieira.</seg>
<seg id="10">He also promised the Dane to return the money for the watch.</seg>
<seg id="11">Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most forward-looking footballers of the young generation in France.</seg>
<seg id="12">He joined Nice as a 13-year-old to make his first-team debut three years later.</seg>
<seg id="13">He has appeared in seven games this season.</seg>
<seg id="14">He recently signed a professional contract, but as reported by L'Equipe newspaper, the club is likely to terminate him with immediate effect.</seg>

<seg id="1">Iran's president says he has rejected suggestion of talks with US, Donald Trump denies</seg>
<seg id="2">Tehran has not entered into talks with the American side at the UN General Assembly in New York, despite the American bid to lift sanctions, Iranian President Hasan Rowhani said on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">US President Donald Trump commented that it was the Iranian side that asked for the restrictions to be lifted, to which he disagreed.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Iranian President Hasan Rowhani, the Americans have proposed lifting all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for negotiations on a new international agreement.</seg>
<seg id="5">It would regulate both Iran's nuclear programme and its ballistic missile programme.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rowhani: Iran will not engage in talks in an atmosphere of maximum pressure</seg>
<seg id="7">The Iranian president said he refused to enter into these talks because of the "toxic atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="8">He said he had met with American diplomats because he had succumbed to the advances of France, Germany and The United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, he stressed that Iran would not engage in talks in an atmosphere of "maximum pressure."</seg>
<seg id="10">"And even if we want to negotiate with americans in 5+1 format, no one can predict what the end result will be," Rowhani said.</seg>
<seg id="11">A day earlier, the Iranian leader said he would not rule out talks with the US, and the European parties to the nuclear deal accused us of favoring US sanctions on Iran.</seg>
<seg id="12">He added that sanctions imposed on Iran after the US withdrawal from the nuclear agreement "are a precondition that does not allow" dialogue to be established.</seg>
<seg id="13">"If we can lift this precondition, and if America lifts sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America," he declared.</seg>
<seg id="14">He added that he did not rule out meeting with US President Donald Trump, even though he refused to hold such a conversation last week at the UN General Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="15">Trump: "Iran begged, I said no"</seg>
<seg id="16">Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that he had rejected the Iranian side's request.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.</seg>
<seg id="18">Of course, I said no," the US President tweeted.</seg>
<seg id="19">Tension with the nuclear agreement in the background</seg>
<seg id="20">France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to ease tensions between Washington and Tehran in order to save the 2015 Iran deal, to which they were signatories, in some form.</seg>
<seg id="21">It stipulated that, in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions, Iran would abandon its nuclear weapons programme and the nuclear sector would be put under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).</seg>
<seg id="22">Since the US withdrawal from the agreement in May 2015, the other signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to keep the agreement in force.</seg>
<seg id="23">For now, none of this has worked out.</seg>
<seg id="24">Washington is using the tactic of putting maximum pressure on Iran, and sanctions also include a full embargo on Iranian oil.</seg>
<seg id="25">Tehran has announced that if it does not receive a permit to export the raw material, it will limit its obligations under the agreement every 60 days.</seg>

<seg id="1">The judge of the Regional Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of hejterka Emilia, who, according to her words and screenshots from WhatsApp, participated in stalking against the judges, was on Wednesday reinstated to the nsa ruling.</seg>
<seg id="2">The reason: no disciplinary proceedings have been initiated against him, so there is no reason to uphold the order of the President of the WSA Wojciech Mazur to oust him from his duties.</seg>
<seg id="3">Judge Jerzy Chromicki, disciplinary spokesman at the NSA, opened an investigation into Szmydt at the end of August, but it has not yet turned into proceedings against him.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although the NSA, which acts as a disciplinary court in such cases, it must address the decision of the President of the WSA within one month of its release.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this situation, the judge who publicly spoke about his wife's mental problems in order to discredit her, who, due to suspicions of participation in the Heyter group, was removed from the KRS office, will return to adjudicate and issue judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.</seg>
<seg id="6">Judge Szmydt denies his involvement in the heyter group.</seg>
<seg id="7">He claims that there is no evidence of this except for the falsified screenshots and words of his wife, with whom he divorces.</seg>
<seg id="8">Exactly the same is said by the other judges associated with "Caste": they are all innocent, there is no evidence.</seg>
<seg id="9">And it's quite possible that they bet on their own.</seg>
<seg id="10">Because the prosecutor's office did not nod to secure the evidence from their electronic media, it also remains silent about the contents of Emilia Szmydt's phone, which stopped the phone in June in another case.</seg>
<seg id="11">The police did not nod to secure the devices of the people they had identified as persecuting persons, judge Waldemar Żurek.</seg>
<seg id="12">There is no evidence – there is no Smydt case, there is no case of "Caste".</seg>
<seg id="13">There is also no matter that nik boss Marian Banas is not involved in renting the townhouse to suteners and hiding income.</seg>
<seg id="14">CBA checks its declarations of assets.</seg>
<seg id="15">And he will check when he will check.</seg>
<seg id="16">And the Committee on Parliamentary Ethics will not take care of Banasiem, because the Sejm is suspended (but the State Audit Committee somehow came together to take a bizarre decision to dismiss Banasia's deputies and appoint him as acting lawyer, although the law of such a bizarre combination does not provide).</seg>
<seg id="17">The whole thing reminds me of a movie novel, an American, probably, about how the wife comes home and finds her husband with his mistress in bed.</seg>
<seg id="18">She is so amazed and devastated that she can't make a word.</seg>
<seg id="19">He stands in the door speech, and at this time the lover quickly jumps out of bed, dresses and leaves.</seg>
<seg id="20">And the husband made a bed.</seg>
<seg id="21">When the wife regains her voice and yells, what is it supposed to be?</seg>
<seg id="22">Who is this woman?</seg>
<seg id="23">The husband calmly asks: what woman, darling?</seg>
<seg id="24">Only that in the case of "Caste" or Banasia it is a parody of the state.</seg>
<seg id="25">And it's not funny at all.</seg>

<seg id="7">"I am kept alive by my immediate family and politicians," kornel Morawiecki said in an interview he gave to "Super Express" journalists two weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="8">In January, "Super Express" reported that 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki was sent for tests to the Military Hospital in Wrocław.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I had strange, disturbing symptoms and i reported myself to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="10">It came out that I have jaundice.</seg>
<seg id="11">But the worst was in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the CT scan was performed, it was found that I had pancreatic cancer...", the Prime Minister's father said.</seg>
<seg id="13">A few days later, kornel Morawiecki underwent major surgery at the MSWiA hospital in Warsaw.</seg>
<seg id="14">As Morawiecki recounted, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain, Father Zbigniew Kras, to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="15">The operation lasted about three hours and was successful.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I know that many people prayed for me, for which I thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="17">Fortunately, I don't have metastases.</seg>
<seg id="18">I don't know yet if I'm going to undergo chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="19">I put myself in the hands of specialist doctors who are rather of good cheer.</seg>
<seg id="20">For now, after this heavy operation, I have to return to some state of use.</seg>
<seg id="21">I hope that everything will be fine", kornel Morawiecki pointed out in January in an interview with "SE".</seg>
<seg id="22">"If I had examined too late, the situation would have been tragic and I would have said goodbye to it already...", he added.</seg>

<seg id="1">The power of Oława jumps.</seg>
<seg id="2">The title of the coverage of the amateur sports competition, held on Sunday afternoon, September 15, on the hippodrome on Oleandry Street in Oława, can be confusing for some.</seg>
<seg id="3">The road to real power is far away, but this is what one of the types of horse competition is called ...</seg>
<seg id="4">The competition of the power of jumping consists in overcoming the rider and the horse with ever higher obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed up to two meters.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is worth noting here that the long and still unbeaten world record, set as recently as 1949 by Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on the horse "Huaso", is 247 cm.</seg>
<seg id="6">So high in Oława, of course, no one jumped, but the result of the best local amazons at the level of 135 cm also among the worst is not ...</seg>
<seg id="7">The competition organized by the tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other activists JKS "In the saddle", formed a demonstration part of the slightly earlier "Rainbow equestrian competitions", which we write more about in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.</seg>
<seg id="8">Eight amazons, who train equestrianism in Oława JKS, joined the competition.</seg>
<seg id="9">Four competed on squats and four on big horses.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the first group the best was Nikola Szołdra, who got a crazy "Sprinter".</seg>
<seg id="11">This small but dynamic steed began by overcoming obstacles spread at a height of 40 cm, and ended up only at the station with the upper beam 125 cm away from the ground.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he easily did not give up and only after three consecutive refusals was removed from further competition by the jury.</seg>
<seg id="13">Second place in pony jumping was taken by Amelia Pawlak, who took "Famy" and lena Boruń third on "Harmidera".</seg>
<seg id="14">Ambitiously fought the youngest participant of the tournament - Inga Aksman, galloping and jumping over obstacles on a small mare "Carmen".</seg>
<seg id="15">Even more excitement accompanied amazon starters and spectators during a competition with the participation of large horses.</seg>
<seg id="16">Paulina Shewczyk, who joined the Declaration, and Anastasia Abramenko, who was riding "Lotka", were among the dangerous-looking falls.</seg>
<seg id="17">Fortunately, apart from minor bruises, neither amazons nor horses did anything wrong, so they continued to participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="18">A lot of problems with introducing the young mare "Wineta" on the parkr had veronica Łuczkiewicz.</seg>
<seg id="19">You needed either the assistant of the trainer or another horse to the couple, behind which a little crazy "Wineta".</seg>
<seg id="20">After passing the obstacle from the park, she also descended full of cwał, so at times in the boxes and on the expansion was dangerous. "Everything is under control!", reassured Jan Sienkiewicz a little frightened spectators, especially the youngest ones.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since the beginning of the competition of large horses, Marta Masalska, who has been enjoying the "Whisky" was a great performer.</seg>
<seg id="22">This distinguished mare, in tandem with an experienced amazon, after the second approach in the final stage, was the first to jump 135 cm and this was the best result at this point.</seg>
<seg id="23">After a while, however, the same height was also counted by Paulina Shewczyk on the "Declaration", Weronika Łuczkiewicz on "Winecie" and Anastasia Abramenko on "Lotka".</seg>
<seg id="24">To decorate flo and to receive prizes in kind in the form of equestrian equipment went so all these riders together, and finally together with amazons on ponies in the tact of radecki march made an impressive round of honor, ending it with these interesting and exciting competitions.</seg>
<seg id="25">Thanks</seg>
<seg id="26">Equestrian Sports Club "In The Saddle" thanks the sponsors of the jump power competition during the XVI "Rainbow Equestrian Competitions": the Municipal Office in Oława, the Water and Sewerage Plant in Oława, the District Old Town and the company "Mustang".</seg>

<seg id="2">KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko is the name of the electoral committee under which the political formation of the #R Revolution of Mariusz Max Kolonka was to go to the October parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="3">The revolution directed its proposal, especially to young voters with right-wing views.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the elections, Kolonko announced cooperation with Marek Jakubiak or Paweł Kukiz, but none of these coalitions took place, and max Kolonko's Patriotic Revolution itself did not even manage to collect enough signatures to list in any constituency in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now Kolonko announced on Twitter that he has ended his cooperation with KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I will expect the above mentioned KWW to delete my name from the name.</seg>
<seg id="7">I kindly ask you not to link my person to the above mentioned entity," he added, and announced that he would provide more information shortly.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is not yet known whether the journalist will continue his action, or whether this is the end of the formation #R Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="9">On July 4, american Independence Day, journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko, who was in the U.S., announced the formation of a new political formation , #R Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="10">In recent years, Kolonko became famous for running the YouTube channel Max TV, where he comments on events in Poland and around the world.</seg>
<seg id="11">"We're fed up with politicians, enough of your stupid games, enough of your amateur governments.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is time for the authorities in the state to embrace the Nation and rule for the good of the Nation," Kolonko said at the time.</seg>
<seg id="13">There are m.in in the party's agenda. issues relating to the judiciary (should be elected by universal suffrage), tax changes (tax-free quota equalisation for all), war reparations (in the form of military assistance to nato's eastern flank countries, with a particular focus on Poland), holding a referendum on arms, limiting the number of Members or introducing single-seat constituencies.</seg>
<seg id="14">A few days after the announcement of the formation of a new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko joined the talks with Marek Jakubiak.</seg>
<seg id="15">In late July, Kolonko posted on his social media profile that #R would join forces with the Kukiz'15 movement.</seg>

<seg id="2">"The euro will remain around the ceiling of PLN 4.35 in the coming months, accompanied by a weak global market situation," announces Michael Bolliger of UBS Wealth Management.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Expectations of maintaining a solid pace of economic growth and a stable monetary policy speak in favour of stabilising the gold price at the current ceiling," the specialist said in an interview with Bankier.pl.</seg>
<seg id="4">In his view, despite clear inflationary pressures, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide to raise rates in an environment where the vast majority of central banks are softening policy.</seg>
<seg id="5">"While the zloty is properly valued – the euro should remain around the ceiling of PLN 4.35 in the coming months – polish bonds are not attractive.</seg>
<seg id="6">Much more favourable yields than Polish securities offer bonds from emerging markets", says Michael Bolliger, head of asset allocation to emerging markets with UBS Wealth Management.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the global downturn.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The global slowdown may be exacerbated, but there should not be a severe recession, or at most, gdp growth just below zero," says Michael Bolliger.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Investors should underestimate global equities, which may be affected by the lack of prospects for a solution to the US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including Donald Trump's impeachment procedure and Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="10">Europe should behave relatively weakly among stock markets," according to a recent letter to investors by UBS Wealth Management chief Mark Haefele.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Stocks from euro area countries should behave worse than the US, as they are more vulnerable amid heightened uncertainty around global trade and fears of a slowdown," the document reads.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to Michael Bolliger, after the bull market in the safest countries' bond markets pushed German 10-year yields down to minus 0.74%, it is still possible to deepen the decline in yields.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the long term, however, the profitability of long-term securities, but only short-term securities, should fall, thanks to the easing of banks' monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Fed has the biggest case for rate cuts, which should lead to a weakening of the U.S. currency over the next few years.</seg>
<seg id="15">The long-term balance for the euro is the $1.29 ceiling, which would mean a 19 percent potential for the single currency to strengthen against the dollar.</seg>
<seg id="16">We expect further fed rate cuts, which will result in a narrowing of global monetary policy gaps.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The long-term strength of the dollar may not allow current and budget deficits," announces Michael Bolliger.</seg>

<seg id="2">Confidential report of the German MON</seg>
<seg id="3">Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehr has seen the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 weapons and 19,445 ammunition, according to a confidential statement drawn up in the Defence Ministry of The Federal Republic of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="4">The information was provided by the press belonging to the media group RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).</seg>
<seg id="5">According to a document from the parliamentary office of the Secretary of State at the MON Peter Tauber (CDU), two weapons, one piece of weapons and 3,474 rounds of ammunition have so far been re-traced.</seg>
<seg id="6">Among the military equipment still missing are six MG3 universal machine guns, 11 G3 automatic rifles, four G36 automatic carbines, six flare guns and two P8 pistols.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, 30 MG3 machine gun barrels are missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">The left's vice-president, Martina Renner, expressed concern about the situation.</seg>
<seg id="9">As rnd journalists told reporters, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is "alarming."</seg>
<seg id="10">All the more so because, as a result of the investigations, only a small part of the lost equipment was found.</seg>
<seg id="11">Martina Renner summed up the effects of these actions as a "miserable balance sheet."</seg>
<seg id="12">She also criticised the fact that it is not clear from the statement whether there is also a weapon found during the investigation against The Bundeswehr Lieutenant Franco A. In December 2017, the Federal Prosecutor's Office in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence threatening state security and violating the provisions of the law governing access to firearms.</seg>
<seg id="13">The officer was accused of preparing attacks on leading German politicians for far-right and racist motives.</seg>
<seg id="14">On his "blacklist" of targets, which fell into the hands of the prosecutor's office, there were m.in. then Justice Minister Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green party and Anetta Kahane, human rights activist and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung Foundation in Berlin.</seg>

<seg id="8">The BBC reports that the lines have already reported the shortcomings of this solution.</seg>
<seg id="9">The "child icon" will not appear if the ticket has been booked by a third party or if there has been a change of aircraft at the last minute.</seg>
<seg id="10">As you might expect, the idea divided internet users.</seg>

<seg id="14">The newspaper recalls that on this Balearic island, the British bankrupt cooperated with 42 hotels.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Wednesday, the Autonomous Balearic Islands announced that they would ask the Spanish government to support the region with €100 million to cover losses caused by the bankruptcy of the Thomas Cook travel agency.</seg>
<seg id="16">They revealed that the largest number of tourists affected in this archipelago, about 36 thousand. is located in Majorca.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to balearic government data, Thomas Cook is in arrears with local travel companies, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of contracts for the Period July-September 2019, about 5 million euros.</seg>

<seg id="2">When asked on ZET radio how many candidates his party could get to the Sejm from the list of left-wing groups (KW SLD from which the candidates for the SLD, Spring and Left Sejm start together, running with the common logo "Left"), replied that it depends on the outcome of the committee.</seg>
<seg id="3">"I believe that the result of the Left will be very good, because we feel that people have hope that the Left is no longer only right, but also has strength," he said.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Zandberg, it follows that the left may have 60-80 Members.</seg>
<seg id="5">"This may mean that the together circle or club will have a dozen Members.</seg>
<seg id="6">But it depends on The Poles and Poles.</seg>
<seg id="7">I'm not going to guess and say how it's going to happen," he said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Asked if the Left Together would have a separate circle, Zandberg replied: "We are agreed that we are diverse, and we will not pretend that there is no diversity.</seg>

<seg id="11">In turn, noting that it was the SLD that would get the entire subsidy, he replied that "the purpose of a political party is to represent its constituents."</seg>
<seg id="12">Zandberg admitted that he would vote for himself in the elections to the Sejm.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the case of senate elections, he indicated that he was considering it.</seg>

<seg id="2">The streak of eight league matches without victory crown players will try to break in Friday's meeting with the vice-leader of the Silesian premier league.</seg>

<seg id="4">Korona's players last and so far the only victory in the league were recorded in the first round, when on the away side they defeated 1-0 benjamin of the competition Raków Częstochowa.</seg>
<seg id="5">Later, the Kielce recorded two draws and six defeats, and on Tuesday they lost 0-1 to The Lubin Basin in the 1/32 final of the Polish Cup.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I am optimistic that in the last seconds of the cup match the players fought for a goal, they wanted to draw.</seg>
<seg id="7">Their fall to the turf after the final whistle was not due to a breakdown, only it was a fall of anger, because they were so close," said Smyła.</seg>

<seg id="12">"We have a headache, recently it seemed like it wouldn't be, and now it is," Said Smyła.</seg>
<seg id="13">Crown defender Daniel Dziwniel stressed that Silesia will not be an easy rival to break the streak of eight league games in a row without a victory, while in the league everyone can win with anyone.</seg>
<seg id="14">"We are a good team.</seg>
<seg id="15">We may not show it on the pitch in recent weeks, but the moment will come that we will win and we believe it will be on Friday," the player said.</seg>

<seg id="2">"42% of the tree species that make up Europe's stands are under threat," warns the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in the "Red Book of European Trees" published on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">M.in are at the top of the list. chestnut trees and rowan.</seg>
<seg id="4">The IUCN, an organisation based in Gland, Switzerland, publishes a list of endangered European tree species for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was drawn up by experts who, on the basis of research, concluded that of the 454 tree species found in Europe (as well as elsewhere in the world), 42% are 'highly endangered'.</seg>
<seg id="6">Among the reasons, the Red Paper mentions the rapid growth of urban agglomerations and global climate change.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, those trees and shrubs that occur only or mainly on our continent are the most vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="8">As far as the typical European stand is concerned, according to experts at the IUCN, 58% of species are at risk, and 15 percent, i.e. 10 per cent, are at risk. 66 species of trees and shrubs are in danger of extinction.</seg>
<seg id="9">Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Book mentions errors in the operation of the stand, accelerated urbanisation, excessive felling of trees, followed by forest fires and changes in European eco-style.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of shrubs, mosses and lichens is also under serious threat.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The consequences of human activity lead to the gradual disappearance of European plant species and pose a risk in Europe of the extinction of important and undervalued varieties that underpin European ecosystems and affect the health of our planet," concluded the report by Luc Bas, who heads the European IUCN office.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grzegorz Schetyna: I do not promise 600+</seg>
<seg id="2">"Today, PiS wants to bribe Poles by offering them a credit deal for freedom, which will have to repay future generations," says Grzegorz Schetyna in an interview with "Rzeczpospolita".</seg>
<seg id="3">In his opinion, "the whole pis policy is a pic".</seg>
<seg id="4">At the same time, the politician promises that "what is given will not be taken away."</seg>
<seg id="5">Schetyna assures in an interview with Jack Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea to defeat Law and Justice.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's about mobilizing the electorate at the ballot box.</seg>
<seg id="7">In his opinion, the opposition has more potential in this regard than Kaczynski's party.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today, conscious people who want to live in a normal state are more than supporters of PiS, a party that has misrepresented its preaching values, such as modesty, humility, transparency," says Schetyna.</seg>
<seg id="9">The leader of the Citizens' Coalition and the President of the Civic Platform also highlighted the basic principles of the KO electoral programme.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Firstly, nothing that data will be received, but it is necessary to set a direction for the future, because PiS deals only with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, as can be seen even after the dramatically low investments", he stated.</seg>
<seg id="11">Secondly, it is about "mobilising the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work reliably - and those who are enterprising."</seg>
<seg id="12">Schetyna explains that there is a m.in in the KO program. a project that the lowest earning Poles will give more by 614 zlotys per hand, and more to earners – also a few hundred.</seg>
<seg id="13">The politician also indicated that he did not want to race for the breakout.</seg>
<seg id="14">As he said, he will do as much as he can do, but will not promise 600+.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I will never allow the Greek option, where the ruling parties were bidding with the opposition for a break-up, until the country's financial collapse finally occurred," he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="16">Schetyna also stated in an interview with "Rz" that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We would expose their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Pride walks before falling.</seg>

<seg id="2">Six dead large condors have been found in the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, reports TVN24.</seg>
<seg id="3">Specialists believe that human activity contributed to their deaths.</seg>
<seg id="4">Large condors have probably been poisoned with a means to kill predators such as cougars, foxes and wild dogs.</seg>
<seg id="5">The animals could eat toxic carrion.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition to one young individual, the rest of the dead condors were adults.</seg>
<seg id="7">"This is a big loss for the environment, because the condor must reach 10-15 years to become fertile and capable of reproduction.</seg>
<seg id="8">So we're losing a protected species, an endangered species," says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentine environmental organization.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I think the use of toxic bait and poison puts not only this species at risk, but all other forms of life, including human health," he adds.</seg>

<seg id="2">Work has begun on giving the head of state a valuable chain.</seg>
<seg id="3">The idea was supported by Andrzej Duda's law firm – we read in "Rzeczpospolita".</seg>
<seg id="4">As the newspaper explains, it is a golden chain of the Order of the White Eagle, a royal insignia officially called in the interwar period the jewel of the Republic.</seg>

<seg id="6">"Rz" reports that soon such a chain could hit the arms of Andrzej Duda.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Senate Committee on Human Rights, The Rule of Law and Petitions voted on Wednesday to work on an amendment to the Order and Honours Act to reinstate it.</seg>
<seg id="8">The journal writes that this is also not the first attempt to restore this chain to the head of state.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Senate had already proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it was lost by one vote.</seg>
<seg id="10">This time the work is lightning fast.</seg>
<seg id="11">In early August, senators devoted a few minutes to the matter, acknowledging that they would consult the President's Office.</seg>
<seg id="12">This one came in mid-September.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I would like to inform you kindly that the Chancellery of the President of the Republic does not comment on the position set out in this petition," wrote the then Presidential Minister Andrzej Dera.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Wednesday, the Senate committee continued the case and again devoted little time to the case.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The President's Office has responded briefly to us: it is in favour of restoring this," said the head of the commission, Robert Mamątow of PiS, as quoted by "Rz".</seg>

<seg id="4">On Friday, September 27, police officers begin preventive action in Rzeszów "Passable intersections".</seg>
<seg id="5">The aim is to eliminate traffic difficulties: entering the intersection without the possibility of exit, not complying with light signals or traffic signs.</seg>

<seg id="3">Vital Heynen's charges closed the way to winning the title closed thursday's 1-3 defeat to the Slovenians in Ljubljana.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was loud about their troubles with traveling to this duel.</seg>
<seg id="5">This time it was without such problems – on Friday morning they went with the Slovenes chartered to Paris, and a few hours later they trained in the famous Bercy hall.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to reports of those present in the classes, the trainer of the world champions was upset.</seg>
<seg id="7">As Heynen's assistant Michal Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not the exercise of volleyball elements itself.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We went to the hall, but for the most part it was time for the team.</seg>
<seg id="9">The idea was to spend it together more than to train.</seg>
<seg id="10">Talk, think about how to rebuild it all as a team," he reported.</seg>
<seg id="11">He confirmed that the semi-final defeat was a painful lesson for both the players and the coaching staff.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We were brutally brought to the ground.</seg>
<seg id="13">Without a doubt, we are disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="14">We kept believing we would be back in this match.</seg>
<seg id="15">We discussed this match among themselves in the staff, the coach talked a lot with the players.</seg>
<seg id="16">As the two main reasons for failure, I would point to ineffectiveness in attack and much worse than usual coping with situational balls.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Slovenes were much better than us in this respect," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">In his opinion, "White and Red" did not stand in the way of stress, associated with the performance against the loud and numerous co-hosts of the tournament supported by a loud and large audience.</seg>
<seg id="19">He admitted that the world champions could have put the smooth road to the semi-finals a bit.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Perhaps if we had a similar defeat in the group stage, we would have analysed this lesson faster and we would have played differently later in the tournament.</seg>
<seg id="21">But it's just a woe," he said.</seg>
<seg id="22">Gogol hopes that the anger associated with Thursday's defeat poles will be able to turn into aggression in the match for bronze.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I hope that we will show our true face.</seg>
<seg id="24">There's something to beat.</seg>
<seg id="25">We last won the ME medal in 2011," he recalled.</seg>
<seg id="26">Paris is the fifth city and France is the third country visited by Poles during these championships.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the group stage they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, went to Apeldoorn for the first two group stage meetings and moved to Ljubljana for the semi-finals.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Australian tennis player was given a 16-week ban and a $25,000 fine - in a six-month suspension - for reprehensible words, gestures and deeds at recent ATP tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="3">ATP World Tour activists are losing patience with Kyrgios, but they still give him a chance to improve.</seg>
<seg id="4">The summary of the transgresses of the most uncouth professional tennis player of recent years looks menacing – 16 weeks break plus a large fine, but nevertheless both penalties are suspended for half a year – a trial period during which the wayward athlete will be able to improve.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he's been making a long-time history of tennis - he had to pay the highest single financial penalty in the history of the sport for breaking the rules of behavior on and off the court.</seg>
<seg id="6">Loud swearing, strange gestures, unsportsmanlike behavior, insulting the referee and spectators, breaking two rockets during a losing match against Karen Khachalyse – for all this after the August ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati paid $113,000.</seg>
<seg id="7">He didn't play long at the 2019 US Open either, but he was able to publicly say that ATP activists were "corrupt", which hurt the authorities of the organization so much that they implemented a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and after a few weeks they gave the verdict about the suspension of starts and another fine.</seg>
<seg id="8">The words about corruption, however, he was forgiven, after listening to the accused and learning the context of the speech.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the explanatory memorandum, however, tennis activists stated that the investigation showed that Kyrgios' conduct over the past 12 months had in many cases raised serious concerns and constituted an almost constant violation of the rules, that he constantly insulted people associated with tournaments and spectators in a vulgar manner, hence the high penalty.</seg>
<seg id="10">The ATP, however, gave him five days to appeal and immediately postponed the execution of the judgment, ordering that a number of conditions be met over the next six months: in the ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour tournaments, Kyrgios can no longer in any way violate the rules of the code of conduct applicable to professional tennis players, in particular, can no longer curse, destroy rockets, argue with referees and the public, or otherwise behave indecently and vulgarly.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was also advised to seek "continued support" from mental coaches during tournaments and also consult with people specializing in problem-solving athletes who can't handle proper behavior during the off-season.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nick Kyrgios' first comment (on social media) for the verdict was: "Hey everyone, I can still play.</seg>
<seg id="13">I just have to control my behavior, that's all."</seg>
<seg id="14">In practice, the Australian will still have at least a two-week break, as he was aggravated by a shoulder injury in the Laver Cup, so he had to give up his next starts in Beijing (30 September - 6 October) and Shanghai (6-13 October).</seg>
<seg id="15">Kyrgios is ranked 27th in the ATP rankings. Place.</seg>
<seg id="16">This year he won two tournaments - in Washington and Acapulco, he earned more than $1.3 million, so even after fines he will stay a lot.</seg>

<seg id="1">GUS: Poland is living better and better</seg>
<seg id="2">According to a report published on Household Budgets published by the GUS on Friday, it was assessed as good or rather good material situation in ub.r. as many as 44% of them.</seg>
<seg id="3">A year earlier, this figure was 37.2%, in 2016 it was 33.5%, and before that, since 2009, when the statistics office first examined subjective assessments of household situations, it had never exceeded 30%.</seg>
<seg id="4">He considered his material situation to be bad or rather bad in ub.r. 8.1% of households, compared to 11.2% a year earlier and more than 20% in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="5">The best is the material situation of households in the self-employed.</seg>
<seg id="6">More than 70% of respondents consider it good or rather good in this group.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the other extreme are pensioner households, where the proportion of such responses was only 18%.</seg>
<seg id="8">The subjective assessment of the financial situation of households is also greatly influenced by the number of children.</seg>
<seg id="9">The worst are parents with single children, of whom 32% declare a good or rather good material situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among couples with children, the proportion varies (depending on the number of children) from 55 to 60% and among childless households it is 48.8%.</seg>
<seg id="11">The effect of the 500+ program is clearly visible in these statistics.</seg>
<seg id="12">Before it was launched (in 2016) the worst of its material situation was assessed by single parents with offspring and large families (with at least three children).</seg>
<seg id="13">The improvement of subjective assessments of the material situation of Poles is a reflection of the rapid increase in income, primarily from work.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, this is not all, because the proportion of households that consider their situation to be good increases faster than real incomes.</seg>
<seg id="15">Moreover, at the regional level, there is no clear correlation between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households.</seg>
<seg id="16">The best ratings are formulated by the inhabitants of the Opole region, where 48.9% of respondents consider their situation to be good or rather good.</seg>
<seg id="17">Next are the Lubuskie (47.7%) ), Silesian (47.6%) ( 47.3%) and West Pomeranian (47.1%)</seg>
<seg id="18">In Opole, however, the disposable income (i.e. after payment of taxes and contributions) was in ub.r. less than 94% of the national average and 98% in Lubusz.</seg>
<seg id="19">The highest incomes were given to residents of Mazowiecki (120% of the national average) and Silesian (104%).</seg>
<seg id="20">On average in Poland, the disposable income per person was PLN 1693 in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="21">In real terms (after adjusting for the impact of price changes) increased by 4.3% compared to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="22">Against the background of previous years, this result is quite low.</seg>
<seg id="23">Income per person increased by 7% in 2016 and 6.3% a year later.</seg>
<seg id="24">While revenue growth slows down, it also inhibits spending growth.</seg>
<seg id="25">These per person amounted to ub.r. 1187 PLN, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7%.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is the first such case since 2013.</seg>
<seg id="27">In 2017, per-person spending increased by 1.9% in real terms and by 4.3% in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="28">Surveys of household budgets suggest that a statistical household currently spends 70.1% of its disposable income, compared with 80% in 2014 and more than 90% by 2006.</seg>

<seg id="1">Niesiołowski was critical of the pope.</seg>
<seg id="2">John Paul II did nothing</seg>
<seg id="3">In an interview with Piotr Lekszycki, Stefan Niesiołowski pointed out that in 1981 John Paul II was a great authority for opposition activists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Virtually every sentence he was accepted."</seg>
<seg id="5">Later, there was criticism of some of his actions.</seg>
<seg id="6">"For me, the fact that John Paul II could not eliminate the harmful activity of Rydzyk is cast a great shadow on his pontificate.</seg>
<seg id="7">After all, this redemptorist – a pest of the Church and Poland – developed his media in the best in the life of pope Polak,"" he explained.</seg>
<seg id="8">The former PO politician admitted: "there were rumblings of discontent, the pope said something, once Rydzyk did not accept, but he had power and for the politician could simply throw him out of the Church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to raise money for the poor.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, John Paul II did not do so, nor did his successor," Niesiołowski explained.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Besides, this terrible case of paedophilia and the church's actions, or indeed their absence, has come.</seg>
<seg id="11">I ran a little thought forward, but I wanted to draw attention to the whole of his life.</seg>
<seg id="12">We have known about the scale of paedophilia in the Church relatively recently.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question arises as if it was possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting things," niesiołowski says in an interview with the journalist.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to a former POLITICIAN PO, the Polish Church is an ally of PiS.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It must be acknowledged that during the Solidarity period the Church was our most important ally.</seg>
<seg id="16">All the celebrations began with the Holy Mass, crosses hung everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now these crosses are, they have become a symbol of dictatorship – a sign of the regime.</seg>
<seg id="18">I repeat: one of the biggest unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk are shaking the Polish Church, that John Paul II has done nothing about it and that today the Church is an ally of PiS.</seg>
<seg id="19">This is a black chapter of the Polish Church, for which it will pay for it salty,"" niesiołowski argued.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I hope that Pope Francis is chasing Jędraszewski, Rydzyk and a few others of this kind," he concluded.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will be necessary to consider whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade," said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, Leader of the Agreement Jarosław Gowin on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Gowin, during an interview on "Signals of the Day" on Radio One, stated that the trade is controlled by international networks that impose such low margins on Polish producers that polish companies cannot develop.</seg>
<seg id="4">Noting that this problem is very difficult to deal with, the Deputy Prime Minister recalled that the PiS government tried to deal with this at the very beginning of the term of office, but got a "counter-attack from the EC".</seg>
<seg id="5">"We won before the court of justice, and I hope that if the United Right wins the next elections and formulates a government, we will come back to that," he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the same time, he pointed out that "the effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish, that is, small trade".</seg>
<seg id="7">"This will have to be considered whether the government, the state, has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade," Gowin said.</seg>
<seg id="8">In May, an EU court ruled that the European Commission had erred in considering that polish retail tax was illegal public aid.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Retail Sales Tax Act provided for the introduction of two rates of trade tax: 0.8% on revenues between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4% on revenue above PLN 170 million per month.</seg>
<seg id="10">The tax was to be in effect from September 2016.</seg>
<seg id="11">In September 2016, the EC initiated proceedings for violation of EU law by Poland.</seg>
<seg id="12">Brussels argued at the time that the construction of the tax could favour smaller shops, which could be considered state aid.</seg>
<seg id="13">It went on to state that the tribute had been unlawfully implemented.</seg>
<seg id="14">It also issued an order suspending the application of the tax until its analysis by officials in Brussels was completed.</seg>
<seg id="15">Poland disagreed with this position, but the tax collection was suspended.</seg>
<seg id="16">May's EU court decision paved the way for the reintroduction of the tax, but it did not end the case.</seg>
<seg id="17">On 24 July, the Commission lodged an appeal with the Court of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="18">On Thursday, the CJEU's press service informed the PAP that the case is currently at a written stage in which both the European Commission and the Polish Government are presenting their arguments in writing.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not yet known whether and when the oral procedure will begin, namely the hearing of the parties and a possible hearing.</seg>
<seg id="20">It takes a good few to a dozen months after the appeal to the judgment is delivered.</seg>

<seg id="1">How to dress a child for baptism?</seg>
<seg id="2">We provide some practical solutions</seg>
<seg id="3">Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of an infant and his parents.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is often the first occasion where the whole family focuses around the child, celebrating his appearance in the world together.</seg>
<seg id="5">No wonder, then, that a freshly baked mom and dad want their comfort to look their best on this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, before you make a final decision on your child's outfit, consider whether it will also be comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="7">In stores you can find many dressed sets that do not provide the little one with proper comfort.</seg>
<seg id="8">So what should I pay attention to?</seg>
<seg id="9">The primary criterion for choosing a dress for baptism is the age of the child</seg>
<seg id="10">Until recently, a few weeks of toddlers were baptized, dressed in white sets and inserted into the same beige or big drumsted.</seg>
<seg id="11">Today, children joining the sacrament are often older: several months, annual, and even larger.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is not difficult to guess that such a big consolation already needs a slightly different clothes for baptism.</seg>
<seg id="13">Therefore, if your child is 3-4 months old on the day of baptism, the ceremony will probably be spent in a stroller or at the hands of parents or godparents.</seg>
<seg id="14">The best option will therefore be to dress it up in comfortable, cotton-like sleeps or sets.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although this element of the wardrobe is considered a casual outfit, it is enough to search for its festive variants, for example, with a frill or lace.</seg>
<seg id="16">For the boy, a bodysuit with a print of bow ties and harnesses will turn out to be perfect.</seg>
<seg id="17">For older children, you can afford a bigger fantasy in clothing.</seg>
<seg id="18">The girl will look cute in a straight tulle dress</seg>
<seg id="19">Many parents of girls eagerly look towards the richly decorated, frilly dresses for baptism complete with coats, headbands and hats.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers use artificial, non-letting materials for their product, in which the child is simply uncomfortable.</seg>
<seg id="21">In search of the right clothes, it will be better to look into the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant outfits on cotton linings.</seg>
<seg id="22">Delicate tulle skirts, satin dresses, lace, appliqués and charming sets will make your little girl look gorgeous and comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="23">Perfect outfit for a little gentleman: cotton suit</seg>
<seg id="24">Until recently, among parents of boys there was a fashion for suits that are a copy of "adult" models.</seg>
<seg id="25">Polyester jackets and trousers, stiff collars and chests of coughs often made young elegics loudly demonstrate their displeasure.</seg>
<seg id="26">Today, fortunately, they were displaced by comfortable, cotton sets.</seg>
<seg id="27">Just look at the sets available in Asanti for Kids, that is, soft, tracksuit shorts, and a blouse decorated on the front on the pattern of a vest.</seg>
<seg id="28">These outfits look extremely festive, and at the same time do not embarrass the movements of the world-familiar toddler.</seg>

<seg id="2">British MPs voted against a three-day break in the House of Commons in time for the Conservative Party's annual programme conference, as requested by the Government.</seg>
<seg id="3">289 Members voted in favour, 306 against.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is customary for the House of Commons not to meet at party conferences so that Members do not have to give up either their participation in them or from parliamentary meetings.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, opposition parties have recognised that at such a crucial time as the final weeks before Britain's planned exit from the European Union on 31 October, parliament should not interrupt the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="6">289 Members voted in favour of the government's request for a break, 306 against.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two opposition parties after the conventions</seg>
<seg id="8">The disagreement with the break can be seen as political revenge on the opposition to Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday the decision was declared illegal and illegal by the Supreme Court) and for not wanting to apologise for it after the judges' ruling.</seg>
<seg id="9">Following that ruling, the House of Commons resumed its session on Wednesday, and the most important event of the day was Johnson's speech and the subsequent heated debate.</seg>
<seg id="10">Johnson accused the opposition of blocking Brexit and avoiding early elections.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It's time to deliver Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="12">It must be implemented in order to respect the result of the referendum.</seg>
<seg id="13">Brexit must come so that we can deal with a deal on citizens' priorities, on health care, on the cost of living.</seg>
<seg id="14">Brexit must be realised so that we can unite this country," Johnson said.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Conservative Party Conference is due to start in Manchester next Sunday and last until Wednesday 2 October.</seg>
<seg id="16">Conferences of the two main opposition groups – Labour and the Liberal Democrats – have already taken place.</seg>
<seg id="17">One of the reasons Johnson gave explaining the long suspension of parliament was the party conferences.</seg>

<seg id="2">"President Andrzej Duda believes that anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a response to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders," foreign media write.</seg>
<seg id="3">The president's spokesman strongly denied these reports.</seg>
<seg id="4">"It's just not true," Blazej Spychalski wrote on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="5">Israeli media, m.in.

<seg id="6">The president said that the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland is a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.</seg>
<seg id="7">He referred to the words of Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, who stated in February that "Poles have sucked anti-Semitism out of their mothers' milk."</seg>
<seg id="8">Andrzej Duda said he regretted that Israel had not apologized for the humiliating statements made by its politicians.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also mentioned the act of aggression against the Polish ambassador to Israel, Marek Magierowski.</seg>
<seg id="10">In May, he was attacked by an assailant who shouted, "Pole, Pole."</seg>

<seg id="1">Who is Banaś and what is he at fault for?</seg>
<seg id="2">The tenement house rented by the suteners led the journalist to discover negligence in the declarations of assets of Mariana Banasia.</seg>
<seg id="3">We summarize another scandal that shook the ruling camp.</seg>
<seg id="4">Journalists of "Superviewfinder" TVN revealed that Marian Banaś, president of the Supreme Audit Office, in recent years did not include in the declaration of assets of the 400-meter tenement house, which is located in Krakow's Podgórz.</seg>
<seg id="5">Moreover, his sub-tenant was to run a sex business in the aforementioned tenement house (and thus rent rooms for hours).</seg>
<seg id="6">In turn, the building itself was allegedly secured since 2016.</seg>
<seg id="7">Bertold Kittel's "Super Viewfinder" programme drew attention to the irregularities.</seg>
<seg id="8">The journalist revealed that from Banasia the tenement house was rented by people associated with the criminal world to use it as a place of "erotic encounters".</seg>
<seg id="9">The clients were supposed to be men using the services of prostitutes.</seg>
<seg id="10">Banaś responded vaguely and vaguely to Banaś's allegations.</seg>
<seg id="11">Interestingly, the tenement house rented by the suteners led the journalist to discover negligence in the declarations of assets of Banasia.</seg>
<seg id="12">The tenement house itself was described vaguely in them, and the income from its rental was to be understated.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The estate of Marian Banasia and his wife can be worth from 6 to 8 million PLN.</seg>
<seg id="14">In total, spouses can boast two houses, three apartments, savings ...", writes Money.pl.</seg>
<seg id="15">And according to the analysis of the portal, the Banasia tenement house itself was already worth about PLN 3 million.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Central Anti-Corruption Bureau is currently inspecting Mariana Banasia's declarations of assets for the period 2015-2019.</seg>
<seg id="17">Banaś announced that he would suspend his activities at NIK until it is completed. "I will ask the Marshal for unpaid leave," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">The opposition is demanding clarification.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We do not hear cba extend its investigation or expedite the examination of Mariana Banasia's declarations of assets.</seg>
<seg id="20">Therefore, we are forced to take care of the state authorities and make a notification of the possibility of committing a crime ...", said PO-KO MEP Mariusz Witczak.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If a normal Pole had so grossly low-priced the rental of his property, he would already have 10 checks, tax bills and criminal and fiscal proceedings," he added.</seg>
<seg id="22">He went high, fell low</seg>
<seg id="23">Marian Banaś is the new President of the Supreme Audit Office.</seg>
<seg id="24">He was appointed on 30 August 2019 for a six-year term.</seg>
<seg id="25">His candidacy was submitted by Law and Justice and adopted by the votes of the party's politicians.</seg>
<seg id="26">Previously, Banaś was associated with NIK from 1992 to 2005.</seg>
<seg id="27">During the first reign of PiS (2005–2008), Banaś held the post of President of the Customs Service and also undersecretary of state in the Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="28">Since 2015, he has again sat on the stool of the head of the Customs Service, and since 2017 he has managed the National Tax Administration.</seg>

<seg id="1">'Commonwealth': Ignoring the police officer's command will be punished</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the newspaper, the disregard of a warrant for certain conduct issued by a police officer is intended to be a new type of offence, threatened with a fine, arrest or restriction of liberty.</seg>
<seg id="3">Police trade unionists want to make such a change.</seg>
<seg id="4">The idea went to the Parliamentary Committee on Petitions.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The case is serious, because already every year more than half a million cases of misconduct go to Polish courts," it reads.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Republic has determined that the petition that the Independent Police Union writes to MPs on the amendment of the Code of Misconduct has a chance of success.</seg>
<seg id="7">The petitioners propose a new wording of Article 104 of the Treaty on the European Union. Article 54a of the Code of Infractions.</seg>
<seg id="8">It would read: 'Anyone who fails to comply with a request or order of a public official, issued within the limits and under the provisions of the Law, shall be liable to a custodial sentence, a fine or a restriction of liberty.'</seg>
<seg id="9">"Paragraph 3 of that provision refers to an identical penalty for those who, by failing to follow orders, prevent or hinder the performance of a work activity," the journal states.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski told "Rzeczpospolita" that although he agrees with the main message of the proposal for a provision, he fears that if implemented, it can be used in matters of political manifestation.</seg>
<seg id="11">"In situations of freedom demonstrations, this would be unfavorable and instead of alleviating the situation, they would even exacerbate it," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to statistics provided by the newspaper, 86% of citizens gave a positive assessment of police interventions in 2018 and that 1.5 million interventions per month in the city are undertaken.</seg>

<seg id="2">Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook has collapsed, its Belgian subsidiary Neckermann operates.</seg>

<seg id="4">According to VRT, Brussels Airlines announced it would cancel 105 flights in October due to problems with the thomas cook bankruptcy.</seg>
<seg id="5">Neckermann also laid off 75 employees.</seg>
<seg id="6">All trips with the office that have been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but holidaymakers will be able to receive a refund.</seg>

<seg id="10">As recently as Monday, Thomas Cook Belgium spokeswoman Leen Segers said the company was now "fully operational" despite the uk's parent company declaring bankruptcy, which has caused concern among employees and customers.</seg>
<seg id="11">The office then reassured that customers who bought tours in it would go on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thomas Cook - the oldest and one of the largest travel agencies in the world - declared bankruptcy on the night of Sunday to Monday.</seg>

<seg id="2">Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – such an unusual offer prepared for the newcomers German Görlitz.</seg>
<seg id="3">The measures are intended to help combat the progressive decline in the city's population.</seg>
<seg id="4">Görlitz is germany's easternmost city.</seg>
<seg id="5">The beautiful pastel old town attracts 140,000 people a year. Tourists.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, as The Guardian writes, the city is struggling with significant problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Görlitz has the lowest wages in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">The city is also struggling with a permanent loss of population.</seg>
<seg id="9">After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them left for the west of the country, resulting in a 25% drop in the city's population.</seg>
<seg id="10">In 2013, it amounted to 54,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="11">In an attempt to combat the depopulation, officials came up with the idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.</seg>
<seg id="12">So far, 150 applications have been submitted to the programme.</seg>
<seg id="13">Two-thirds of them were made by residents of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="14">People from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom also became interested in the programme.</seg>
<seg id="15">"When we applied, we thought the program was going to convince people to move to Görlitz," said one of the participants in the project.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Now we feel that it doesn't matter if we stay here after four weeks or not," he added.</seg>
<seg id="17">The city has seven thousand vacant apartments, and unemployment is three times higher than the national average.</seg>
<seg id="18">Although the city authorities hope that some will move permanently, the main purpose of the program is to get the opinions of the participants of the program.</seg>
<seg id="19">The information gathered from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revitalise smaller German cities.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We want to know more about what people need, and if they decide to move - what their motivation was," said program director Robert Knippschild.</seg>
<seg id="21">Other cities have already experimented with ideas to lure new residents, offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first was Detroit, which introduced a program to pay promising young professionals for living and working in the city for a year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy, or in the American Tulsa, Oklahoma.</seg>
