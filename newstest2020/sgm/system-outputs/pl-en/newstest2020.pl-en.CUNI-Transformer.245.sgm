<seg id="1">Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in a white robe</seg>
<seg id="2">He is charismatic.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Holy Mass he celebrates for deliverance and healing draws crowds.</seg>
<seg id="4">He was several years old when inexplicable things began to happen in his life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Today, through the Franciscan, others are experiencing it.</seg>
<seg id="6">Masses celebrated by Fr. Witko for deliverance and healing draw crowds</seg>
<seg id="7">Once there came to him parents of a 7-month-old baby who had a hole in his heart the size of 7.5 mm.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was to be operated on.</seg>
<seg id="9">Father Joseph Witko prayed over him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later that day, the boy was taken to the hospital for surgery.</seg>
<seg id="11">Astonished doctors said: "Surgery is not needed, loss is only 1.5 mm."</seg>
<seg id="12">My parents were crying with happiness.</seg>
<seg id="13">After another Franciscan prayer, the hole disappeared completely.</seg>
<seg id="14">The clergyman began to experience the extraordinary actions of the Creator as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="15">In his dreams, Purgatorial souls came to him asking for help.</seg>
<seg id="16">I was awakened at night and urged to pray for the dead and those who were dying at that moment," he recalls.</seg>
<seg id="17">He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.</seg>
<seg id="18">And he had a vision of what was happening to a man who was committing a mortal sin.</seg>
<seg id="19">"My body started to change.</seg>
<seg id="20">I lost my human qualities and started to look like an animal," he says.</seg>
<seg id="21">The invisible force lifted him up, he could not bring out his voice.</seg>
<seg id="22">He felt he was lost.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then God showed him rescue.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Immersed in the waters of the river symbolizing holy baptism, I was freed and returned to human form..." he says.</seg>
<seg id="25">He did not tell anyone about these strange experiences.</seg>
<seg id="26">His vocation matured.</seg>
<seg id="27">He was 16 when he joined the Franciscans.</seg>
<seg id="28">In his sermons, he wanted not only to talk about Jesus.</seg>
<seg id="29">He wanted people to experience him alive.</seg>
<seg id="30">Members of the Charismatic Renewal in the Spirit Community</seg>
<seg id="31">The healing masses celebrated by Father Witko are attended by many people who hope to get rid of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, the clergyman stresses that their main goal is spiritual healing, not bodily healing.</seg>

<seg id="1">First defeat for Kolping FRAC Jaroslaw</seg>
<seg id="2">This afternoon (26 September) the team of Kolping FRAC deservedly fell at home to the current Polish Darts Champion Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki as part of the 3rd round of the LOTTO Table Tennis Super League.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Yaroslavs, in the kind of personal combination they presented with the governorates, have little chance of winning against the league's sovereigns.</seg>
<seg id="4">This was clearly demonstrated by the duel with Dartom Bogoria.</seg>
<seg id="5">The team is still missing, acclaimed team leader Chen Jingqi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Perhaps with him in the squad jarosławianie would reach the third consecutive triumph in the new season.</seg>
<seg id="7">The young Asian Qiyao Han has probably yet to win against the likes of the Greek Panagiotis Gionis and the Czech Pavel Sirucek.</seg>
<seg id="8">Not even with one of the most prospective Poles, Marek Badowski.</seg>
<seg id="9">The wrestler from Hellady was the biggest star of the match in the MOSiR hall on Sikorskiego Street in Jaroslaw.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was a class unto himself against both Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei.</seg>
<seg id="11">After three matches, Kolping FRAC led 2:1.</seg>
<seg id="12">Kou Lei probably outplayed Marek Badowski, and Daniel Górak after a thrilling, five-set battle – Pavel Siruck.</seg>
<seg id="13">But then it got worse.</seg>
<seg id="14">Gionis did not give Leia a chance.</seg>
<seg id="15">One could still hope for a two-point win, but Qiyao Han was no match for Badowski.</seg>

<seg id="1">There will be additional testing for seniors.</seg>
<seg id="2">Why?</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Rafal Trzaskowski, a program of free preventive examinations for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the idea will not be implemented because it did not gain the approval of the Ministry of Health and its subordinate Agency for the Protection of Medical Technologies and Tariffs.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the explanatory statement, the agency explained that the target group was poorly chosen.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The above actions may even result in detection of particular disease units, which may contribute to deepening the difficulties in accessing NHF services and negatively affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort related to a falsely positive test result," it says.</seg>
<seg id="7">The decision of the ministry is not understood by the president of the capital.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The money is ours, we have foreseen the money.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only the government is afraid that if people get tested, they will go to the doctor later, which is absurd, because it is all about getting a situation in which prevention can be done more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="10">All specialists know that it helps when it comes to the strain on the health system, because it helps in the rapid detection of diseases and in a reliable approach to health.</seg>
<seg id="11">The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand," said Rafał Trzaskowski.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It is hard for me to imagine that expert specialists say: Let's not examine ourselves because there will be longer queues at the doctor's, and if such specialists advise the government, I am not surprised that the health service is in such a state," added the PO politician.</seg>

<seg id="1">Palestine responds to Israel: We will terminate all existing agreements</seg>
<seg id="2">Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas told the UN General Assembly on Thursday that he would break all agreements reached with Israel if the country's future government tries to comply with Benjamin Netanyahu's annexation of occupied Palestinian land.</seg>
<seg id="3">"If the future Israeli government that emerges starts to turn this plan into reality, we will cancel all signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all commitments made," he announced.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We will reject completely and utterly the whole plan," threatened Abbas with leverage.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It is our duty to defend all our rights by all possible means - no matter what the consequences will be - by committing ourselves wholly to the application of international law and to the fight against terrorism," declared the President of the Palestinian Authority, who had already made similar declarations in July.</seg>
<seg id="6">Netanyahu, the former Israeli prime minister, was again given the mission to form a government after the September 17 elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">A week before the election, he announced that if he won, he would annex the Jordan Valley and include all Jewish settlements across the West Bank in Israel.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, then led by Yasser Arafat, signed a series of peace accords, which were sponsored by the United States.</seg>
<seg id="9">The 84-year-old Abbas also promised to hold general elections in Palestinian lands during the UN General Assembly session.</seg>
<seg id="10">The most recent was in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Back home, I will call local elections in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem and all those who oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community," declared the Palestinian president solemnly.</seg>
<seg id="12">Abbas also defended in his speech the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer at the United Nations, to exercise the powers of "full members of the United Nations and all its bodies and institutions."</seg>
<seg id="13">The Palestinian leader concluded by calling on the international community to "force Israel to comply with the United Nations with full respect."</seg>
<seg id="14">Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas' speech by declaring that the Palestinian leader "prefers to focus in the United Nations on the Palestinian Authority's efforts against Israel rather than to fight against calls for terrorism in the Authority under its leadership."</seg>
<seg id="15">Danon, the agencies note, did not refer to Netanyahu's annexation of occupied Palestinian land.</seg>

<seg id="1">PLN 105 million for video game companies from the National Centre for Research and Development</seg>
<seg id="2">Almost PLN 105 million of funding will go to companies in the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.</seg>
<seg id="3">The National Centre for Research and Development announced the results of the third edition of the GameINN program on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Among the nearly 30 projects supported by the NCBR were the development of a platform for field games development based on an AR game engine creating a map of the real world with an application enabling data transmission by users; a test and training platform for verification of practical skills at the workplace and professional development using VR and AI; an innovative game simulating real-world production processes management using an innovative gameplay model based on the interaction of the virtual world with the real world using the concept of industry 4.0, stated in the NCBR release sent on Friday to PAP.</seg>
<seg id="5">The aim of the GameINN sector programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game industry in the global market in the perspective until 2023.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the NCBR, already today the Polish video games sector is growing at a rate of 10 percent per year.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to government data, the value of the Polish video games market in 2016 was PLN 1.85 billion, while the forecast for 2019 is 2.23 billion.</seg>
<seg id="8">"A specially prepared research agenda of GameINN and support for entrepreneurs already reaching 300 million PLN within this sector program are a significant boost for the further, dynamic growth of Polish gamedev," reads the release.</seg>
<seg id="9">The video games industry is an excellent example of effective use of the potential we have in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Incentives introduced by the government for innovative entrepreneurs, such as R&amp;D tax credits, competence improvement programs, IP box or support programs implemented by the NCBR drive innovative activities of companies and allow them to compete more effectively in a very competitive market," according to Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the release.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Minister of Science points out that money for innovation not only goes to innovators in the form of project funding, but also stays in their pockets - three quarters more entrepreneurs benefited from the R&amp;D tax credit in 2018 than the year before.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The amount of deducted costs relating to R&amp;D activities amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, which resulted in over PLN 300 million of savings for companies benefiting from this relief.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is equivalent to the support provided by the NCBR in three editions of GameINN”, emphasises the Deputy Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="14">Dr Wojciech Kamieniecki, director of the National Centre for Research and Development, reminds that 78 innovative projects have been awarded in two previous contests with a total value of over PLN 211.2 million.</seg>
<seg id="15">The huge interest in the 3rd competition and the variety of applications submitted show that the video games industry has the ideas and competences to further develop itself and increase its competitive advantages.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It is particularly pleasing that the projects selected, as in previous editions, include not only entertainment but also industry 4.0-related solutions," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the third GameINN competition, entrepreneurs, consortia of entrepreneurs and consortia of entrepreneurs with scientific units could apply for funding of up to PLN 20 million.</seg>
<seg id="18">The NCBR received 87 applications for a total amount of funding of approximately PLN 317 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">The budget of the competition at the time of the announcement was 100 million zlotys, but it was increased, so that 27 projects were awarded almost 105 million zlotys of funding.</seg>
<seg id="20">Detailed information about the results of the 3rd GameINN competition is available at ncbr.gov.pl.</seg>
<seg id="21">The GameINN sector programme is implemented under the Smart Growth Operational Programme.</seg>
<seg id="22">The NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to an initiative by entrepreneurs associated to the Polish Games Agreement, which includes companies such as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team and 11 bit studios.</seg>

<seg id="2">The incident occurred on September 16.</seg>
<seg id="3">Dolberg, who had joined Nice from Ajax Amsterdam at the end of August, realised after training that his watch had disappeared from the dressing room.</seg>
<seg id="4">Not just any, because it is worth 70 thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="5">The furious Dane did not show up for class the next day, citing stomach problems.</seg>
<seg id="6">The case was mysterious from the start.</seg>
<seg id="7">The players in the dressing room have private safes and the club area is monitored.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the AFP news agency, Diaby-Fadiga eventually confessed to the theft.</seg>
<seg id="9">The 18-year-old has already apologised to Dolberg and the rest of his team-mates and coach Patrick Vieira.</seg>
<seg id="10">He also promised to return the money for the watch.</seg>
<seg id="11">Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising young footballers in France.</seg>
<seg id="12">He arrived in Nice as a teenager and made his debut in the first team three years later.</seg>
<seg id="13">He appeared in seven games that season.</seg>
<seg id="14">He has recently signed a professional contract, but - as L'Equipe newspaper reported - the club is likely to terminate him with immediate effect.</seg>
<seg id="15">For the time being, he has initiated disciplinary proceedings against his player.</seg>

<seg id="4">This is important especially now, when autumn infections are approaching.</seg>
<seg id="5">It takes at least 30-40 seconds for washing to sufficiently remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands</seg>

<seg id="1">Iranian president says he rejected US offer of talks, Donald Trump denies</seg>
<seg id="2">Tehran did not engage in talks with the US during the UN General Assembly in New York, despite an offer by the Americans to lift the sanctions, Iranian President Hassan Rowhani said on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">U.S. President Donald Trump commented that it was the Iranian side that asked for the restrictions to be lifted, which he did not agree to.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Iranian President Hassan Rowhani, the Americans proposed lifting all sanctions on Tehran in exchange for negotiating a new international agreement.</seg>
<seg id="5">It would regulate both Iran's nuclear program and its ballistic missile program.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rowhani: Iran will not hold talks amid maximum pressure</seg>
<seg id="7">The Iranian president said he had not agreed to the talks because of the "toxic atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="8">He stated that he met U.S. diplomats because he gave in to the encouragement of France, Germany and the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, he stressed that Iran would not enter the talks in an atmosphere of "maximum pressure."</seg>
<seg id="10">"And even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in a 5+1 format, no one can predict what the end result will be," said Rowhani.</seg>
<seg id="11">A day earlier, the Iranian leader said he did not rule out talks with the US, and accused the European parties to the nuclear agreement of favoring US sanctions on Iran.</seg>
<seg id="12">He added that sanctions imposed on Iran after the US withdrawal from the nuclear agreement "are a precondition that does not allow" the establishment of dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="13">If we manage to abolish this precondition and if America abolishes sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America,' he declared.</seg>
<seg id="14">He added that he does not rule out a meeting with US President Donald Trump, despite the fact that he did not agree to such a conversation in the past week during the UN General Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="15">Trump: "Iran asked, I said no"</seg>
<seg id="16">Trump tweeted that he had rejected the Iranian side's request.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions on them so that we could meet.</seg>
<seg id="18">Of course I said 'no!' blurted the US President.</seg>
<seg id="19">Tension with nuclear agreement in the background</seg>
<seg id="20">France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to ease tensions between Washington and Tehran in order to somehow salvage the 2015 agreement with Iran, of which they were signatories.</seg>
<seg id="21">It stated that in exchange for lifting economic sanctions, Iran would abandon its nuclear weapons programme and bring the nuclear sector under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).</seg>
<seg id="22">Since the US withdrawal from the agreement in May 2015, the other signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to keep the agreement in place.</seg>
<seg id="23">Nothing has come of it yet.</seg>
<seg id="24">Washington is using the tactic of exerting maximum pressure on Iran, and the sanctions also include a full embargo on Iranian oil.</seg>
<seg id="25">Tehran has said that if it does not receive an export permit, it will limit its obligations under the agreement every 60 days.</seg>

<seg id="1">The judge of the Provincial Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of hate-worker Emilia, who – according to her words and screenshots from WhatsApp – participated in stalking against the judges, was reinstated by the NSA on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="2">The reason: no disciplinary proceedings were initiated against him, so there is no basis to uphold the order of WSA President Wojciech Mazur to remove him from his duties.</seg>
<seg id="3">Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary spokesman for the NSA, initiated an investigation against Szmydt in late August, but it has not yet evolved into an investigation against him.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although the NSA, which acts as a disciplinary court in such cases, must deal with the decision of the president of the WSA within a month of its issuance.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this situation, the judge who publicly talked about his wife's mental problems in order to discredit her, who was removed from the KRS office due to suspicions of participation in a hate group, will return to adjudicate and will pass judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.</seg>
<seg id="6">Judge Szmydt denies his involvement in the hate group.</seg>
<seg id="7">He claims that there is no evidence of this apart from fake screenshots and words of his wife, with whom he is divorcing.</seg>
<seg id="8">The other judges connected with “Kasta” say exactly the same: they are all innocent, there is no evidence.</seg>
<seg id="9">And quite possibly they will bet on their own.</seg>
<seg id="10">Because the prosecution did not wag its finger to secure the evidence from their electronic media, it is also silent about the contents of Emilia Szmydt's phone, which she stopped in June in another case.</seg>
<seg id="11">The police did not wag their finger to secure the devices of the people, who were pointed out as persecutors by Judge Waldemar Żurek in a February report.</seg>
<seg id="12">There is no evidence - there is no Szmydt case, there is no "Kasty" case.</seg>
<seg id="13">Nor is the case of the head of the Supreme Chamber of Control, Marian Banasi, about renting a tenement house to souvenirs and hiding the income.</seg>
<seg id="14">CBA is reviewing his financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="15">And it will check when it checks.</seg>
<seg id="16">And the Commission of Post-Legislative Ethics will not take up Banas, because the Sejm is suspended (but the Commission of State Control somehow got together to make a bizarre decision to dismiss Banas' deputies and appoint as acting his lawyer, although the law does not provide for such a bizarre combination).</seg>
<seg id="17">The whole thing reminds me of a film novella, American, probably, about how a wife comes home and finds a husband with his mistress in bed.</seg>
<seg id="18">She is so amazed and devastated that she can't choke a word.</seg>
<seg id="19">She is standing in the doorway speechless, and during this time her lover quickly jumps out of bed, dresses and leaves.</seg>
<seg id="20">And the husband is cutting the bed.</seg>
<seg id="21">When the wife regains her voice and shouts: what is it supposed to be?</seg>
<seg id="22">Who is this woman?</seg>
<seg id="23">My husband calmly asks: what woman, darling?</seg>
<seg id="24">Only in the case of 'Kasta' or Banasi there is a parody of the state.</seg>
<seg id="25">And it's not funny at all.</seg>

<seg id="12">When the CT scan was done, it was found that I had pancreatic cancer..." the Prime Minister's father said.</seg>
<seg id="13">A few days later, in the hospital of the Ministry of Interior in Warsaw, Kornel Morawiecki underwent a serious operation.</seg>
<seg id="14">As Morawiecki recounted, president Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain priest Zbigniew Kras to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="15">The operation lasted about three hours and was successful.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I know that many people have prayed for me, for which I thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="17">Fortunately, I don't have metastasis.</seg>
<seg id="18">I don't know if I'm going to undergo chemotherapy yet.</seg>
<seg id="19">I put myself in the hands of specialist doctors who are rather cheerful.</seg>
<seg id="20">For now, after this hard surgery, I have to return to some kind of working condition.</seg>
<seg id="21">I hope that everything will be fine”, said Kornel Morawiecki in an interview with SE in January.</seg>

<seg id="1">The power of OAO jumps.</seg>
<seg id="2">The title of the coverage of amateur sports competitions, held on Sunday afternoon September 15 at the hippodrome in Oleandry Street in Olawa, may be misleading to some.</seg>
<seg id="3">It's a long way from true power, but that's the name of one type of horse competition...</seg>
<seg id="4">The competition of jumping power consists in the rider and horse overcoming higher and higher obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed even two meters.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is worth noting that the long and still unbeaten world record, set back in 1949 by the Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on the horse Huaso, is 247 cm.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nobody jumped so high in Oława, of course, but the result of the best local amazons at 135 cm is not one of the worst either...</seg>
<seg id="7">The competition, organized by tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other JKS “In the Saddle” activists, was a showcase part of the “Rainbow Equestrian Competition” that was held there a little earlier, about which we write more in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.</seg>
<seg id="8">Eight amazons, who train equestrians in Oława JKS, entered the competition.</seg>
<seg id="9">Four competed on ponies and four competed on big horses.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the first group, Nikola Szołdra performed best, riding the insane "Sprinter".</seg>
<seg id="11">This small but very dynamic steed started from overcoming obstacles spread at the height of 40 cm and ended only at the station with the top beam 125 cm away from the ground.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he did not give up easily and only after three consecutive refusals was he removed from further competition by the jury.</seg>
<seg id="13">Amelia Pawlak, riding Famy, finished second in the pony jumps, while Lena Boruń took third place on Harmider.</seg>
<seg id="14">The youngest participant of the tournament - Inga Aksman, galloping and jumping over obstacles on the small mare "Carmen" - fought Ambitiously.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even more excitement followed the amazons competing and the spectators during the competition with the participation of large horses.</seg>
<seg id="16">Terrible-looking falls included Paulina Szewczyk, riding the "Declaration" and Anastasia Abramenko, who was riding the "Lot."</seg>
<seg id="17">Fortunately, apart from minor bruises, neither amazons nor horses were harmed, so they continued to participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="18">Weronika Łuczkiewicz had a lot of problems with introducing the young mare “Wineta” to the parkour.</seg>
<seg id="19">It needed either the assistance of a trainer or another horse to pair, behind which a little crazy "Wineta" dashed.</seg>
<seg id="20">After passing the obstacle from the parkour she was also going off at full speed, so at times in the stalls and in the warm-up area it was getting dangerous. "Everything is under control!" reassured Jan Sienkiewicz, a little frightened spectators, especially the youngest ones.</seg>
<seg id="21">From the beginning of the big horse competition, Marta Masalska, riding a beautifully presented "Whisky" performed great on the park.</seg>
<seg id="22">This dignified mare, paired with an experienced amazon, on the second try in the final phase were the first to jump 135 cm and it was the best result of the competition at that point.</seg>
<seg id="23">After a while, however, the same height was also scored by Paulina Szewczyk on "Declaration", Weronika Luczkiewicz on "Wineta" and Anastasia Abramenko on "Lotka".</seg>
<seg id="24">So, for the flo decoration and for the collection of prizes in the form of equestrian equipment, all these competitors went out together, and at the end, together with the amazons on their ponies, they made an impressive round of honour to the Radecki's march, ending this interesting and exciting competition with it.</seg>

<seg id="2">Max Kolonko's Patriotic Revolution was the name of the election committee under which the #R Revolution political formation of Mariusz Max Kolonka was to go to the October parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="3">The revolution targeted young right-wing voters in particular.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the election, Kolonko announced his cooperation with Marek Jakubiak or Paweł Kukiz, but none of these coalitions took place, and the KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko itself failed to even collect enough signatures to put lists in any constituency in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now Kolonko has announced on Twitter that he has ended his collaboration with the KWW, Max Kolonko's Patriotic Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I will expect the above mentioned KWW to remove my name from the name.</seg>
<seg id="7">I kindly ask you not to connect my person with the above mentioned entity," he added, and announced that he would provide more information soon.</seg>
<seg id="8">For now, it is not known whether the journalist will continue his action, or whether this is the end of the #R Revolution formation.</seg>
<seg id="9">On July 4, US Independence Day, journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko announced the formation of a new political formation - #R Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="10">In recent years, Kolonko has become famous for hosting the Max TV channel on YouTube, where he comments on events in Poland and around the world.</seg>
<seg id="11">"We are fed up with politicians, fed up with your foolish little games, fed up with your amateur rule.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's time for the government to take over the Nation and rule for the good of the Nation," Kolonko said at the time.</seg>
<seg id="13">The party's agenda included issues concerning the judiciary (it should be elected in general elections), tax changes (leveling the tax-free amount for all), war reparations (in the form of military aid for the countries of the eastern flank of NATO, with particular emphasis on Poland), holding a referendum on gun ownership, limiting the number of MPs or introducing single-member constituencies.</seg>
<seg id="14">A few days after the announcement of the formation of the new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko began talks with Marek Jakubiak.</seg>
<seg id="15">In late July, Kolonko posted a message on his social media page suggesting that #R would join forces with the Kukiz'15 movement.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, none of these coalitions ultimately took place.</seg>

<seg id="1">UBS: Gold close to equilibrium point</seg>
<seg id="2">"The euro will remain around the 4.35 zloty ceiling in the coming months, accompanied by a weak global market situation," announces Michael Bolliger of UBS Wealth Management.</seg>
<seg id="3">“Expectations of maintaining a solid economic growth pace and a stable monetary policy support the stabilisation of the zloty at the current ceiling”, the specialist says in an interview with Bankier.pl.</seg>
<seg id="4">In his opinion, despite the clear inflationary pressure, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide to raise rates in an environment where the vast majority of central banks soften their policy.</seg>
<seg id="5">"While the zloty is properly valued - the euro should remain near the 4.35 zloty ceiling in the coming months - Polish bonds are unattractive, according to him.</seg>
<seg id="6">Emerging market bonds offer much more favorable yields than Polish securities," says Michael Bolliger, head of asset allocation for emerging markets at UBS Wealth Management.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the global downturn.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The global slowdown could get even worse, but there should be no severe recession, at most GDP growth going slightly below zero," predicts Michael Bolliger.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Investors should underweight global equities, which may be hurt by the lack of prospects for resolving the US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including the impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump and Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among stock markets, Europe should behave relatively least," according to a recent letter to investors by UBS Wealth Management chief executive Mark Haefele.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Shares in eurozone countries should behave worse than those in the US because they are more susceptible amid heightened uncertainty around global trade and fears of a slowdown," the document says.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to Michael Bolliger, after the boom in the bond markets of the safest countries pushed German 10-year yields as low as minus 0.74 percent, it is still possible to deepen the decline in yields.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the long term, however, yields on long-term securities should no longer fall, only on short-term securities, due to the easing of banks' monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Fed has the greatest scope for rate cuts, which should lead to a weakening of the US currency in the years to come.</seg>
<seg id="15">The long-term equilibrium point for the euro is a ceiling of $1.29, which would imply a 19% strengthening potential of the single currency against the dollar.</seg>
<seg id="16">We expect further Fed rate cuts, which will result in a narrowing of global monetary policy differences.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The dollar's strength may not be sustained in the long term by current and budget deficits," announces Michael Bolliger.</seg>

<seg id="2">More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not be on holiday in Majorca in October as a result of bankruptcy declared on Monday by the travel agency Thomas Cook.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to autonomous Balearic government representative Marc Pons on Friday, among the 25,000 holidaymakers who will not be able to take advantage of the October holiday in Majorca are also those who were due to travel with companies indirectly linked to Thomas Cook, such as Neckermann.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pons explained that 80% of the expected holidaymakers who have had to cancel their holidays in Majorca next month due to the bankruptcy of a British company are German and Scandinavian nationals.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, according to Mr Pons, as Thomas Cook did not direct tourists to the balearian island in November-April, the losses to the local economy will be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="6">He revealed that the government of the Balearic Islands had already started negotiations with international operators about "entering the market of Majorca" after the British operator went bankrupt.</seg>
<seg id="7">The newspaper Diario de Mallorca estimates that more than 1,000 people will lose their jobs in Mallorca in October due to the tourism crisis.</seg>
<seg id="8">Around 800 were made redundant at the Thomas Cook office in Palma.</seg>
<seg id="9">The remaining people will lose their jobs mainly in the hospitality sector.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Monday, along with the bankruptcy filing by Thomas Cook in a number of Majorca hotels, property owners demanded that guests pay an additional overnight fee.</seg>
<seg id="11">Dozens of tourists from Poland experienced this situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Balearic Islands government estimates that by Thursday dozens of hotels in Majorca had shut down their operations until at least the end of October following the bankruptcy filing by Thomas Cook and its affiliates.</seg>
<seg id="13">Friday's Diario de Ibiza reports that the majority of hotels in Ibiza that have worked with the Thomas Cook group have no intention of closing sites in the coming weeks.</seg>
<seg id="14">The paper recalls that on this balearian island the British bankrupt co-operated with 42 hotels.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Wednesday, the autonomous authorities of the Balearic Islands announced that they would ask the Spanish Government for €100 million in support of the region to cover losses caused by the bankruptcy filing of the travel agency Thomas Cook.</seg>
<seg id="16">They revealed that the largest number of tourists affected in the archipelago, some 36,000 people, is in Majorca.</seg>
<seg id="17">Government figures from the Balearic Islands show that Thomas Cook is owed around €5 million by local tourism companies, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of contracts for the period July-September 2019.</seg>

<seg id="3">"To date, within the Clean Air programme, 82,000 applications for funding worth a total of PLN 2 billion have been submitted, of which 48,000 decisions have been positive.</seg>
<seg id="4">The total amount of accepted applications amounts to more than 915 million zlotys”, reports Rz, citing data from a spokesman for the Minister of the Environment.</seg>

<seg id="2">Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered in the capital on Friday for the inauguration of the huge mosque, said to be the largest in West Africa.</seg>
<seg id="3">Muslims arrived by bus, car and on foot to the Bopp district, where a new mosque was erected with a capacity of 30,000 worshippers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The structure was built by the Mouride fraternity, a member of the Sufi Islam movement that dominates Senegal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Work on the mosque began ten years ago in a wetland area of six hectares donated by the government.</seg>
<seg id="6">The name of the mosque, Massalikul Jinan ("Paths to Paradise"), is derived from a poem by Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, a 19th-century founder of the brotherhood who was venerated as a saint by followers.</seg>
<seg id="7">The mosque is clad in Carrara marble and has five minarets.</seg>
<seg id="8">The highest is 78 metres.</seg>
<seg id="9">The mosque inside can hold 15,000 worshippers, and the other so many can stay on the outer esplanade.</seg>
<seg id="10">The lavishly finished interiors feature a gilded dome, giant chandeliers and hand-made decorations by Moroccan workers.</seg>
<seg id="11">The builders claim that the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but the edifice does not compare to mosques in other regions anyway.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Morocco, the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca has a capacity of 105,000.</seg>
<seg id="13">The construction of the mosque, which cost more than 30 million euros, was financed by private donations.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition to the land, the government funded lighting, sanitation and road works worth 10.5 million euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Coach Smyła: Our problem is not Silesia, but ourselves</seg>
<seg id="2">A streak of eight league matches without a win will be interrupted by the Crown players in Friday's meeting with the runner-up of Silesia.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Our problem is not the Brewers, but ourselves, we have to work on what we play," emphasized Chargers coach Mirosław Smyła.</seg>
<seg id="4">The club's last and so far only win in the league came in the first round, when they defeated the rival club Raków Częstochowa 1–0 on away goals.</seg>
<seg id="5">Later, the Chargers recorded two draws and six losses, and on Tuesday they lost 1-0 to Zagłębie Lubin in the round of 32 of the Polish Cup.</seg>
<seg id="6">"It makes me optimistic that in the last seconds of a cup match the players were fighting for a goal, they wanted to draw.</seg>
<seg id="7">Their fall on the turf after the final whistle was not due to the breakdown, it was just a fall of anger, because they were so close," said Smyła.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he pointed out, Silesia have very strong wings, which is why he will sensitize the team to playing in the side sectors of the pitch.</seg>
<seg id="9">"We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we also look at what we want to play," added the coach.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Friday's match in Korona, Ognjen Gnjatic will definitely not play for excess of yellow cards, the injured Jakub Żubrowski and Michael Gardawski will also be missing.</seg>
<seg id="11">What is encouraging, however, is the submission of several players with the desire to play in a knockout match.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We have a headache, recently it seemed to be gone, and now it is," said Smyła.</seg>
<seg id="13">Crown defender Daniel Dziwniel stressed that Silesia will not be an easy rival to break the streak of eight league games in a row without a win, while in the Premier League anyone can win against anyone.</seg>
<seg id="14">"We are a good team.</seg>
<seg id="15">In recent weeks we may not be showing it on the pitch, but the moment will come when we will be winning and we believe it will be on Friday," the footballer pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="16">After nine rounds, Crown takes 15th place with five points.</seg>
<seg id="17">Silesia accumulated 12 more and ranks second.</seg>
<seg id="18">Friday's game in Kielce starts at 8.30 pm.</seg>

<seg id="1">These trees may completely disappear from Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">"42% of tree species in Europe are threatened," warns the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in its "Red List of European Trees" published on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the top of the list are, among others, chestnuts and rowan.</seg>
<seg id="4">The IUCN, based in Gland, Switzerland, is publishing a list of endangered European tree species for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was drawn up by specialists who concluded on the basis of research that out of the 454 tree species found in Europe (as well as elsewhere in the world), 42% are 'highly endangered'.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Red Book cites rapid urban sprawl and global climate change among its causes.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, the most endangered are those trees and shrubs that are found only or mainly on our continent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As for the typically European tree stand, 58% of species are threatened, according to the IUCN Specialists, while 15% of tree and shrub species are threatened with extinction.</seg>
<seg id="9">Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Paper cites errors in the exploitation of trees, accelerated urbanisation, excessive logging, followed by forest fires and changes in the European ecosystem.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of shrubs, mosses and lichens is also strongly threatened.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The consequences of human activity lead to the gradual disappearance of European plant species and pose a risk in Europe of the extinction of important and underappreciated varieties that form the basis of European ecosystems and have an impact on the health of our planet," concluded the report by Luc Bas, who heads the European office of the IUCN.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grzegorz Schetyna: I don't promise 600+</seg>
<seg id="2">"Today the Law and Justice party wants to bribe Poles by offering them handouts for a loan that future generations will have to pay for their freedom," says Grzegorz Schetyna in an interview with Rzeczpospolita.</seg>
<seg id="3">In his opinion, "the whole politics of the Law and Justice party is a pic."</seg>
<seg id="4">At the same time, the politician promises that "what is given will not be taken away."</seg>
<seg id="5">Schetyna assures in an interview with Jacek Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea to defeat Law and Justice.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is about mobilising the electorate at the ballot box.</seg>
<seg id="7">In his opinion, the opposition has more potential in this respect than Kaczyński's party.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today, there are more conscious people who want to live in a normal state than there are supporters of the Law and Justice party, a party that has betrayed its proclaimed values of modesty, humility and transparency," says Schetyna.</seg>
<seg id="9">The leader of the Civic Coalition and the chairman of the Civic Platform also marked the basic assumptions of the KO electoral program.</seg>
<seg id="10">"First of all, nothing given will be taken away, but we need to set a direction for the future, because PiS is dealing only with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which can be seen even from dramatically low investments," he stated.</seg>
<seg id="11">Secondly, it is about "mobilising the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work diligently - and those who are enterprising."</seg>
<seg id="12">Schetyna explains that the KO programme includes, among others, a project which will give the lowest-earning Poles more by PLN 614 per hand, and higher earners - also a few hundred.</seg>
<seg id="13">The politician also indicated that he did not want to race for handouts.</seg>
<seg id="14">As he said, he will do as much as he can do, but not promise 600+.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I will never allow the Greek option, where the rulers were bidding against the opposition for handouts until the country's financial collapse finally took place," he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="16">Schetyna also stated in an interview with Rz that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid of debating with him and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We would expose their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Pride steps before a fall.</seg>
<seg id="19">Kaczyński is such a statesman as Banas is crystal", he added.</seg>
<seg id="20">The PO leader also said that he had not yet decided whether he would run for the chairmanship of the Platform.</seg>

<seg id="2">Six large condors have been found dead in the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, TVN24 reports.</seg>
<seg id="3">Specialists believe that human activity contributed to their deaths.</seg>
<seg id="4">The great condors are believed to have been poisoned by predators such as pumas, foxes and wild dogs.</seg>
<seg id="5">The animals may have eaten the toxic carcass.</seg>
<seg id="6">Apart from one young individual, the rest of the dead condors were adults.</seg>
<seg id="7">"This is a big loss for the environment, as a condor needs to reach 10-15 years to become fertile and capable of reproduction.</seg>
<seg id="8">So we are losing a protected species, an endangered species”, says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentinian environmental organisation.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I think the use of toxic bait and poison puts not only this species at risk, but all other life forms, including human health," he adds.</seg>

<seg id="1">"The Government": They want the jewel for the President</seg>
<seg id="2">Work has begun on granting the Head of State a precious chain.</seg>
<seg id="3">The idea was supported by Andrzej Duda's office, reads Rzeczpospolita.</seg>
<seg id="4">As the newspaper explains, it is the gold chain of the Order of the White Eagle, the royal insignia officially called the jewel of the Republic in the interwar period.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was probably used by President Ignacy Mościcki for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="6">„Rz” informs that soon such a chain could end up on the shoulders of Andrzej Duda.</seg>
<seg id="7">On Wednesday, the Senate Committee on Human Rights, the Rule of Law and Petitions passed a proposal to work on an amendment to the law on orders and decorations in order to reinstate it.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Journal writes that this is also not the first attempt to restore the chain to the head of state.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Senate had already proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it was lost by one vote.</seg>
<seg id="10">This time the work is rapid.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the beginning of August, senators devoted a few minutes to this matter, deciding that they would consult the Office of the President.</seg>
<seg id="12">This arrived in mid-September.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I kindly inform you that the Chancellery of the President of the Republic of Poland does not comment on the position presented in the petition," wrote then presidential minister Andrzej Dera.</seg>

<seg id="1">Police officers will teach drivers how to drive through the intersection</seg>
<seg id="2">The police action will be conducted, among others, at the intersection of ul. Cieplińskiego with al. Piłsudskiego.</seg>
<seg id="3">The actions of uniformed officers are somehow connected with the recent complaints of the city authorities about drivers who are not always able to behave properly at the intersection.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Friday, September 27, police officers begin preventive action in Rzeszów "Passable intersections."</seg>
<seg id="5">It is about eliminating traffic obstructions: entering an intersection without the possibility of exit, not following light signals or road signs.</seg>
<seg id="6">“We often think that we are alone at a crossroads, and in fact we make life difficult for other drivers”, said Marek Ustrobiński, vice-president of the city, a few days ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">His words were echoed at the City Hall press conference, where city authorities presented examples of inadequate car traffic at intersections, which in effect creates traffic jams.</seg>
<seg id="8">At the time, the president appealed to travelers for common sense on the road and, among other things, to move faster at traffic lights or not to write text messages while driving.</seg>
<seg id="9">The subject has somehow been taken over by Rzeszów police officers, who from today begin the "Passable intersections" action.</seg>
<seg id="10">What is the point?</seg>
<seg id="11">The aim of the measures is to eliminate the phenomenon of limiting crossovers at intersections by drivers entering them without being able to continue driving.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is a frequent offence which contributes to increasing traffic difficulties and creating traffic jams.</seg>
<seg id="13">It carries a fine of $300 and two penalty points.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, uniforms will pay attention to failure to follow traffic signals or signs and incorrect parking in the area of intersections.</seg>
<seg id="15">They will also observe a lack of smoothness in driving, late starting from signalling devices, slow crossing times and excessive distances between vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="16">What intersections will the activities take place at?</seg>
<seg id="17">On Lisa-Kuli Street with Jagiellońska Street; on Cieplińskiego Avenue with Piłsudski Avenue; on Targowa Street with Piłsudski Avenue; on Śreniawitów Square with Dabrowski Street; and on Hetmańska Street with Warsaw Insurgents Avenue.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Officials of the Department of Environmental Protection of the District of Wołomin and District Inspection of Building Control on Friday inspected the installation in Zielonka commune where waste from the sewage treatment plant "Czajka" in Warsaw is disposed of," said Karol Szyszko, a spokesman for the Wołomin starosty.</seg>
<seg id="3">Inspectors from the Wołomin starosty carried out an inspection at the plant located in the forests belonging to the Zielonka municipality.</seg>
<seg id="4">Dar-Trans, a private commercial and transport company, under an agreement with the Czajka sewage treatment plant in the capital, provides bedding waste management services.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The installation was inspected, and the entrepreneur was asked to provide documentation related to his business," Szyszko said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He added that the post-inspection report will be submitted to, among others, the Provincial Inspectorate of Environmental Protection in Warsaw.</seg>
<seg id="7">The last inspection in Dar-trance was carried out by the Voivodship Inspectorate of Environmental Protection in Warsaw between 29 December 2015 and 11 February 2016.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was determined at the time that the company did not take samples, measurements and groundwater tests, and did not have the results of stabilized municipal sewage sludge tests from the "Czajka" sewage treatment plant.</seg>
<seg id="9">After WIOŚ's review, Dariusz Sobota was ordered to cease violating the terms of the decision.</seg>
<seg id="10">DAR-TRANS is one of the companies collecting waste in the form of stabilized municipal sewage sludge from the Czajka treatment plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to the decision for waste disposal in the excavation area, waste up to 60,000 tons of waste per year is processed in the forests near Zielonka.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Warsaw City Water Supply and Sewerage Company reported last Thursday that STUOŚ was taken out of service at the turn of November and December 2018, which was related to damage to one of the incineration plant's equipment.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Senate passed, without amendment, a bill to reveal the assets of the families of top government officials and flights of the most important people in the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fifty-two senators voted in favor of the amendment to the Act on the estates of the families of government officials without amendments, 14 against, and three abstentions.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thus, senators decided to reject 12 amendments tabled during Wednesday's debate by senator of the Civic Platform Sławomir Rybicki.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to him, amendments were supposed to "civilize" the law and limit the scope of information provided in the statement about the financial situation of own children, children of the spouse, children adopted for cases in which children remain in a common household with the person obliged to submit the statement.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Act on the Disclosure of the Assets of Families of the Most Important Government Officials, a draft of which was drafted in the office of the Prime Minister, was passed by the Sejm on 11 September.</seg>
<seg id="7">The legislation stipulates that, among others, the Prime Minister, ministers, MPs, MEPs, senators, presidents of the Constitutional Tribunal, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as people at the head of other state institutions, will be required to include information about the personal assets of spouses, children and people living together in a financial statement.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Senate also did not propose amendments to the bill on flights of the most important people in the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">It regulates which flights have HEAD status and who can be on board government aircraft along with the most important people in the country.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Act also specifies who is responsible for maintaining the Central Register of Flights.</seg>
<seg id="11">Fifty-five senators voted in favor, 12 against, and four abstained.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the law, each flight of the president will be a flight "carried out in an official mission."</seg>
<seg id="13">The President will be able to be accompanied by family members and other people invited by the President.</seg>
<seg id="14">In contrast, a flight in the official mission of the Prime Minister and the Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate will only be a flight "for the purpose of carrying out tasks directly related to the function."</seg>
<seg id="15">The law also clarifies the list of people who can accompany the most important people in the country during the flight.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the regulations, members of the delegation – invited deputies, senators, representatives of public authorities and experts; persons providing technical, medical or organizational services; as well as journalists – may be on board the aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the Act, in the event of any doubts related to the flights of the Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate, the head of the Chancellery of the Prime Minister will apply for their explanation.</seg>
<seg id="18">If such doubts are not clarified in time, the head of the Chancellery will be obliged to notify the heads of the Chancellery of the Sejm or the Senate about the inability to organise such a flight.</seg>

<seg id="4">There was a lot of talk about their troubles with the journey to this duel.</seg>

<seg id="7">As Heynen's assistant Michał Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not just to exercise the volleyball elements.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We went to the hall, but for the most part it was the time for the band.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was about spending it together more than training.</seg>
<seg id="10">Talk about it, think about how to rebuild it all as a team," he reported.</seg>

<seg id="14">We still believed that we would be back for this match.</seg>
<seg id="15">We discussed this game among ourselves in the staff, the coach talked a lot with the players.</seg>
<seg id="16">I would point to ineffectiveness in attack and much worse handling of situational balls than usual as the two main reasons for failure.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Slovenians were much better than us in this respect”, he analyzed.</seg>
<seg id="18">In his opinion, "White and Red" did not stand in the way of stress, related to the performance against supported by a loud and large audience of the co-hosts of the tournament.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead, he admitted that the world champions could somewhat shake a smooth road to the semi-finals.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Perhaps if we had a similar type of defeat in the group stage, we would have studied the lesson quicker and played it differently later in the tournament.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that's only if," he cautioned.</seg>
<seg id="22">Gogol hopes that the anger of Thursday's defeat will be turned into aggression in the bronze medal match.</seg>

<seg id="24">There's a lot to fight for.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Australian tennis player received a 16-week ban and a $25,000 fine, six months suspension, for reprehensible words, gestures and actions at recent ATP tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="3">ATP World Tour officials are losing patience with Kyrgios, but still give him a chance to improve.</seg>
<seg id="4">The summary of the misdeeds of the most uncouth professional tennis player in recent years looks dangerous - 16 weeks off plus a large fine, but both penalties are suspended for half a year - a trial period in which the recalcitrant athlete will be able to improve.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he has been troubling for a long time and has earned a kind of tennis world record - he had to pay the highest single financial penalty in the history of the discipline for breaking the rules of behavior on and beside the court.</seg>
<seg id="6">High-profile swearing, strange gestures, unsportsmanlike behavior, insulting the referee and spectators, breaking two rackets during a loss to Karen Khachanov - all of this after the August ATP Masters 1000 in Cincinnati paid $113,000.</seg>
<seg id="7">He also did not play long in the 2019 US Open, but he managed to publicly say that ATP officials "are corrupt," which hurt the governing body so much that they implemented a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and after a few weeks they gave the aforementioned verdict of suspension and another fine.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, he was forgiven for having listened to the blame and learned the context of the speech.</seg>
<seg id="9">In a statement of reasons, however, tennis officials said that the investigation found that Kyrgios' conduct throughout the past 12 months had in many cases raised serious objections and constituted a near-continuous violation of the rules, that he had continually insulted players and spectators in a vulgar manner, hence the heavy punishment.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately postponed the execution of the sentence, ordering several conditions to be met in the next six months: in the ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour tournaments, Kyrgios can no longer violate the rules of the Code of Conduct applicable to professional tennis players, in particular, he can no longer curse, destroy rackets, argue with judges and the public, or otherwise behave indecently and vulgarly.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was also advised to seek "continuous support" from mental coaches during tournaments and also consulted people who specialised in solving problems of athletes who could not cope with proper behaviour during the off-season.</seg>
<seg id="12">The first comment (on social media) from Nick Kyrgios to the verdict was: "Hey everybody, I can still play.</seg>
<seg id="13">I just have to control my behavior, that's all."</seg>
<seg id="14">In practice, the Australian will still have at least a two-week break, having been aggravated by a shoulder injury in the Laver Cup, so he had to abandon his upcoming starts in Beijing (30 September - 6 October) and Shanghai (6-13 October).</seg>
<seg id="15">In the ATP rankings, Kyrgios is ranked 27th.</seg>
<seg id="16">This year he won two tournaments - in Washington and Acapulco, he earned over $1.3 million, so even after the fines he will have a lot left.</seg>

<seg id="1">Central Statistical Office: Life is getting better in Poland</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the report on household budgets published by CSO on Friday, as much as 44% of them assessed as good or rather good their material situation last year.</seg>
<seg id="3">The figure was 37.2% the year before, 33.5% in 2016, and has never exceeded 30% since 2009, when the statistical office first examined subjective assessments of households' situation.</seg>
<seg id="4">A total of 8.1% of households considered their material situation to be bad or rather bad last year, compared to 11.2% the year before and more than 20% in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="5">The material situation of the households of self-employed workers is best.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this group, more than 70% of respondents consider it good or rather good.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the other extreme are pensioner households, where the percentage of such responses was only 18%.</seg>
<seg id="8">The subjective assessment of the material situation of households is also strongly influenced by the number of children.</seg>
<seg id="9">The worst situation is among single-parent parents, among whom 32 percent declare a good or rather good material situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among couples with children, the figure varies (depending on the number of children) from 55 to 60 percent, and among childless households it is 48.8 percent.</seg>
<seg id="11">In these statistics, the effect of the 500+ program is clearly visible.</seg>
<seg id="12">Before it was launched (in 2016), single parents and large families (with at least three children) evaluated the worst their material situation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The improvement of subjective assessments of the material situation of Poles is a reflection of the rapid growth of income, mainly from work.</seg>
<seg id="14">That is not all, however, because the percentage of households that consider their situation good is increasing faster than real incomes.</seg>
<seg id="15">Moreover, at the level of voivodships there is no clear relationship between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households.</seg>
<seg id="16">The best ratings are formulated by the residents of Opolskie Voivodship, where 48.9% of the respondents consider their situation as good or rather good.</seg>
<seg id="17">This is followed by Lubuskie (47.7%), Silesia (47.6%), Mazowieckie (47.3%) and West Pomerania (47.1%).</seg>
<seg id="18">Meanwhile, in Opole disposable income (i.e. after paying taxes and contributions) was less than 94 per cent of the national average last year, and in Lubuskie it was 98 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="19">The highest incomes were for residents of Mazowieckie (120 per cent of the national average) and Silesia (104 per cent).</seg>
<seg id="20">On average, per capita disposable income in Poland was PLN 1,693 in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="21">In real terms (after adjusting for the impact of price changes), it increased by 4.3% compared to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="22">Compared to previous years, this result is quite low.</seg>
<seg id="23">Income per person increased by 7% in 2016 and 6.3% the year after.</seg>
<seg id="24">While revenue growth is slowing, it is also holding back spending growth.</seg>
<seg id="25">Those per person amounted to 1187 PLN last year, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7%.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is the first time this has happened since 2013.</seg>
<seg id="27">Spending per person increased by 1.9% in real terms in 2017 and by 4.3% in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="28">Household budget surveys suggest that a statistical household now spends 70.1% of its disposable income, compared to 80% in 2014 and 90% by 2006.</seg>

<seg id="1">He is critical of the pope.</seg>
<seg id="2">John Paul II did nothing</seg>
<seg id="3">In an interview with Piotr Lekszycki, Stefan Niesiołowski emphasized that in 1981 John Paul II was a great authority for opposition activists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"In fact, every one of his opinions was accepted."</seg>
<seg id="5">Later, there was criticism of some of his actions.</seg>
<seg id="6">"For me, the fact that John Paul II could not abolish Rydzyk's harmful activities casts a great shadow over his pontificate.</seg>
<seg id="7">After all, this Redemptorist – a pest of the Church and Poland – was developing his media into the best ones during the life of the Polish pope,' he explained.</seg>
<seg id="8">The former Civic Platform politician admitted: 'there were murmurs of discontent, the pope said something, once Rydzyka did not accept but he had power and as a politician he could simply throw him out of the Church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji, so that he would collect money for the poor there.</seg>
<seg id="9">But John Paul II did not do it, neither did his successors”, explained Niesiołowski.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Besides, there was this fatal issue of pedophilia and the actions of the Church, or rather the lack of them.</seg>
<seg id="11">I thought a little bit ahead, but I wanted to pay attention to his whole life.</seg>
<seg id="12">We have known about the scale of pedophilia in the Church for a relatively recent time.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question arises as to how it is possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting matters”, Niesiołowski says in an interview with a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the opinion of the former PO politician, the Polish Church is an ally of the Law and Justice party.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It must be admitted that during the Solidarity period the Church was our most important ally.</seg>
<seg id="16">All ceremonies started with mass, with crosses hanging everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now these crosses are Pisa, they have become a symbol of dictatorship - a sign of the Pisa regime.</seg>
<seg id="18">I repeat: one of the biggest unpleasant surprises is that such people as Rydzyk are shaking the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing in this matter and that today the Church is an ally of the Law and Justice party.</seg>
<seg id="19">This is a black chapter of the Polish Church, for which he will pay dearly”, argued Niesiołowski.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I hope that Pope Francis will chase Jędraszewski, Rydzyk and a few more of this kind," he concluded.</seg>

<seg id="1">Gowin: "we must boost Polish small trade"</seg>
<seg id="2">“Effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will be necessary to consider whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade”, said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, Leader of the Agreement Jarosław Gowin on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">During an interview in “Signals of the Day” on Radio Jedynka, Gowin stated that trade is controlled by international networks, which impose such low margins on Polish producers that Polish companies cannot actually grow.</seg>
<seg id="4">Noting that it is very difficult to fight against this problem, the deputy prime minister reminded that the government of the Law and Justice party tried to face it at the very beginning of its term, but got a 'counter from the EC'.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We won before the court of justice and I hope that if Unite the Right wins the next election and forms a government, we will return to this topic," he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He also noted that "effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish, and therefore small trade."</seg>
<seg id="7">"This will have to be considered if the government, the state, has any instruments to boost Polish trade," said Gowin.</seg>
<seg id="8">In May, an EU court found that the European Commission had made a mistake in finding that the Polish retail tax was an illicit public aid.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Retail Sales Tax Act envisaged the introduction of two rates of trade tax: 0.8 per cent on revenue between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4 per cent on revenue above PLN 170 million per month.</seg>
<seg id="10">The tax had been in force since September 2016.</seg>
<seg id="11">In September 2016, the European Commission initiated proceedings for violation of EU law by Poland.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the time, Brussels argued that the design of the tax could favour smaller shops, which could be considered public aid.</seg>
<seg id="13">It subsequently concluded that the levy had been implemented in an unlawful manner.</seg>
<seg id="14">It also ordered the application of the tax to be suspended until officials in Brussels had completed their analysis of the tax.</seg>
<seg id="15">Poland disagreed, but tax collection was suspended.</seg>
<seg id="16">The EU court decision in May cleared the way for the tax to be reintroduced, but it did not end the case.</seg>
<seg id="17">On 24 July, the Commission lodged an appeal with the Court of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="18">On Thursday, the press service of the CJEU told PAP that the case is currently at the written stage, in which both the European Commission and the Polish government present their arguments in writing.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not yet known whether or when the oral procedure, i.e. the hearing of the parties and a possible hearing, will start.</seg>
<seg id="20">It takes a good few to several months from appeal to pronounce a verdict.</seg>

<seg id="1">How to dress a baby for a baptism?</seg>
<seg id="2">We suggest some practical solutions</seg>
<seg id="3">Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of an infant and his parents.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is often the first occasion when the whole family gathers around a child, celebrating his appearance in the world together.</seg>
<seg id="5">No wonder, then, that the newly minted mum and dad want their little one to look their best on the day.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, before you too make a final decision on your child's outfit, consider whether it will also be comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="7">You can find many outfits in stores that do not provide your little one with proper comfort.</seg>
<seg id="8">So what should you look for?</seg>
<seg id="9">The basic criterion for choosing clothes for baptism is the age of the child</seg>
<seg id="10">Until recently, a few-week-old baby was being baptized, secluded in white sets and put in the same barrels or big pillows.</seg>
<seg id="11">Today, children attending the sacrament are often older: several months, one year old, and even larger.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is not hard to guess that such a big comfort needs a slightly different clothes for baptism.</seg>
<seg id="13">Therefore, if your child is 3-4 months old on the day of baptism, the celebration will probably be spent in a pushchair or in the hands of parents or godparents.</seg>
<seg id="14">The best way forward will be to decorate it in comfortable cotton sleepers or sets.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although this item of clothing is considered a daily item, just look for its festive variants, such as frill or lace.</seg>
<seg id="16">For a boy, a bodysuit with a print of a bow tie and suspenders will be perfect.</seg>
<seg id="17">For older children, you can afford to be more fantasy about clothing.</seg>
<seg id="18">The little girl will look lovely in a simple tulle dress</seg>
<seg id="19">Many of the girls' parents look longingly towards the richly decorated frilled dresses for the christening complete with coats, headbands and hats.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers use artificial, non-breathable materials in which the child is simply uncomfortable.</seg>
<seg id="21">When looking for suitable clothes, you'd better check out the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant outfits with cotton lining.</seg>
<seg id="22">Delicate tulle skirts, satin dresses, lace, appliques and cute ensembles will make your baby girl look lovely and feel comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="23">The perfect dress for a little gentleman: a cotton suit</seg>
<seg id="24">Until recently, parents of boys used to fashion suits that were copies of "adult" models.</seg>
<seg id="25">Polyester blazers and trousers, stiff collars or knuckle dusters often made the young elegant demonstrate their dissatisfaction loudly.</seg>
<seg id="26">Today, fortunately, they have been supplanted by comfortable, cotton ensembles.</seg>
<seg id="27">Just look at the sets available in Asanti for Kids, which are soft, tracksuit shorts, and a blouse emblazoned on the front to resemble a vest.</seg>
<seg id="28">These costumes look extremely festive, and at the same time do not restrict movements exploring the world of a toddler.</seg>

<seg id="1">Conservative Party Conference recess vote</seg>
<seg id="2">British MPs voted against a three-day recess in the House of Commons for the duration of the Conservative Party's annual policy conference, as requested by the government.</seg>
<seg id="3">The vote was 289 in favour, 306 against.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is customary for the House of Commons not to meet at party conferences, so that MPs do not have to resign from attending them or from parliamentary meetings.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, opposition parties decided that, at such a crucial time as the last few weeks before the UK's departure from the European Union on 31 October, Parliament should not interrupt the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="6">There were 289 votes in favour of the motion, 306 against.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two opposition parties after the conventions</seg>
<seg id="8">Failure to allow the recess to take place can be seen as political revenge against Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday the decision was declared illegal and not legal by the Supreme Court) and for refusing to apologise for it following a ruling by judges.</seg>
<seg id="9">Following the ruling, the House of Commons resumed its session on Wednesday, with the highlight of the day being Mr Johnson's speech and the heated debate that followed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Johnson accused the opposition of blocking Brexit and avoiding early elections.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It is time to deliver on Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="12">It has to be implemented in order to respect the result of the referendum.</seg>
<seg id="13">Brexit must come so that we can deal with the agreement on citizens' priorities, on health care, on the cost of living.</seg>
<seg id="14">Brexit must be realised so that we can unite the country", said Johnson.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Conservative Party conference is due to start in Manchester next Sunday and run until Wednesday 2 October.</seg>
<seg id="16">The conferences of the two main opposition parties, the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats, have already taken place.</seg>
<seg id="17">One of the justifications given by Johnson when explaining such a long suspension of parliament was party conferences.</seg>

<seg id="2">"President Andrzej Duda believes that anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders," writes foreign media.</seg>
<seg id="3">The president's spokesman strongly denied these reports.</seg>
<seg id="4">"This is simply not true," tweeted Blazej Spychalski.</seg>
<seg id="5">Israeli media, including Haaretz and the Jerusalem Post, citing Jewish Insider, write that Andrzej Duda, during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora at the Polish consulate in New York, declared that Israel was to blame for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="6">The president said that the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland is a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.</seg>
<seg id="7">He referred to the words of Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, who stated in February that "Poles have sucked up anti-Semitism with their mothers' milk."</seg>
<seg id="8">Andrzej Duda said he regretted that Israel had not apologised for the humiliating statements made by its politicians.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also mentioned the act of aggression against the Polish ambassador in Israel, Marek Magierowski.</seg>
<seg id="10">In May, he was attacked by an attacker who shouted "Pole, Pole".</seg>
<seg id="11">"A quote is not only inaccurate.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is simply not true," tweeted Blazej Spychalski.</seg>
<seg id="13">He stressed that Duda "never said Israel was responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland."</seg>
<seg id="14">According to Spychalski, the website "invented it."</seg>
<seg id="15">According to "JI" interviewees, the meeting was also marked by a dispute between Holocaust survivor Edward Mosberg, a Commander of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland, and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mosberg is said to have agreed with President Duda's words and said that Jews from Israel "such as Israel Katz" are responsible for the rise in anti-Semitism.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to Boteach's source, he interrupted Mosberg's remarks.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who is Banas and what is at fault?</seg>
<seg id="2">The tenement rented by the suitors led the journalist to discover the negligence in Marian Banasi's property declarations.</seg>
<seg id="3">We conclude another scandal that has shaken the ruling camp.</seg>
<seg id="4">Journalists from TVN's "Superwizjera" revealed that Marian Banaś, the chairman of the Supreme Chamber of Control, had not written to the financial statement of the 400-square-metre house, which is located in Kraków's Podgórze, in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="5">What's more, his sub-tenant was supposed to run the sexbiznes in the aforementioned tenement house (and thus rent rooms for hours).</seg>
<seg id="6">In turn, the building itself was allegedly collateral against the repayment of the loan since 2016.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was noted by Bertold Kittel in the program "Supervisor".</seg>
<seg id="8">The journalist revealed that the tenement was rented from Banasi by people connected to the criminal world to use as a place for "erotic encounters."</seg>
<seg id="9">The clients were supposed to be men using prostitutes.</seg>
<seg id="10">Banas responded vaguely and muddledly to the allegations.</seg>
<seg id="11">Interestingly, the tenement rented by the suzerains led the journalist to discover negligence in Banasi's property statements.</seg>
<seg id="12">The house itself was described vaguely, and its rental income was said to be undervalued.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The assets of Marian Banasi and his wife may be worth between PLN 6 million and PLN 8 million.</seg>
<seg id="14">In total, the couple boasts two houses, three apartments, savings[...]”, writes Money.pl.</seg>
<seg id="15">And according to the analysis of the portal, the Banasia townhouse alone was already worth about PLN 3 million.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Central Anti-Corruption Bureau is currently reviewing Marian Banasi's financial statements for the period 2015-2019.</seg>
<seg id="17">Banaś announced that until its completion he would suspend his activities at the Supreme Chamber of Control. “I will apply to the Marshal for a leave of absence”, he assured.</seg>
<seg id="18">The opposition demands an explanation.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We do not hear CBA expanding its investigation or stepping up its investigation of Marian Banasi's financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="20">Therefore, we are forced to hand over the organs of the state and give notice of the possibility of committing a crime [...]”- said the MP of PO-KO Mariusz Witczak.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If a normal Pole so grossly low-priced the rental of his properties, he would already have 10 inspections, plus tax and criminal-fiscal proceedings," he added.</seg>
<seg id="22">He went high, fell low</seg>
<seg id="23">Marian Banaś is the new president of the Supreme Chamber of Control.</seg>
<seg id="24">He was appointed to that position on 30 August 2019, for a six-year term.</seg>
<seg id="25">His candidacy was submitted by the Law and Justice party and accepted by the votes of the politicians of the party.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before that, Banaś was associated with the National Control Chamber in 1992-2005, he was active in this institution as an associate of Lech Kaczyński.</seg>
<seg id="27">During the first government of PiS (2005-2008) Banaś held the position of the president of the Customs Service, and also undersecretary of state in the Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="28">Since 2015, he has again sat on the chair of the head of the Customs Service, and since 2017 he has managed the National Revenue Administration.</seg>
<seg id="29">Banas served as Minister of Finance in Mateusz Morawiecki's government for three months.</seg>

<seg id="1">"The police officer's order to ignore the police officer's order will be punished"</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the paper, disregarding an order for certain behaviour issued by a police officer is to be a new type of offence, punishable by a fine, arrest or restriction of liberty.</seg>
<seg id="3">Police unionists want to introduce such a change.</seg>
<seg id="4">The idea was submitted to the Parliamentary Committee on Petitions.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The case is serious, because already every year more than half a million misdemeanor cases come to Polish courts," it reads.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rzeczpospolita found that a petition which the Independent Police Trade Union is writing to MPs on amending the Code of Offences has a chance of success.</seg>
<seg id="7">The petitioners propose a new wording of Article 54a of the Offences Code.</seg>
<seg id="8">It would read: "Anyone who fails to comply with the demand or order of a public official, issued within the limits and pursuant to the provisions of the Act, shall be punished by arrest, fine or restriction of liberty."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Para. 3 of this provision speaks of identical punishment for those who, by not following orders, will prevent or hinder the performance of official duties," the daily says.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski told Rzeczpospolita that although he agreed with the main thrust of the rule proposal, he feared that if implemented, it could be used in matters of political manifestation.</seg>
<seg id="11">"In situations of freedom demonstrations, this would be unfavorable and instead of mitigating the situation, it would exacerbate it," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="12">Statistics reported by the newspaper show that 86% of citizens have a positive view of police interventions in 2018 and that 1.5 million interventions are made by the services every month in the city.</seg>

<seg id="1">Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancels 105 flights due to Thomas Cook bankruptcy</seg>
<seg id="2">Although British travel agent Thomas Cook has collapsed, its Belgian subsidiary Neckermann is functioning.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the company has problems.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to VRT, Brussels Airlines announced that it would cancel 105 flights in October due to problems related to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook.</seg>
<seg id="5">Neckermann also laid off 75 employees.</seg>
<seg id="6">All trips with the agency that have been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but holidaymakers will be able to get a refund.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Ghent Court also declared bankruptcy for the three Belgian subsidiaries Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.</seg>
<seg id="8">Currently, around 12,000 Belgians are abroad on trips bought from Thomas Cook.</seg>
<seg id="9">Another 40,000 people were expected to leave by the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later on Monday, Thomas Cook Belgium spokeswoman Leen Segers said that the company was now "fully operational" despite the British parent company's bankruptcy filing, which caused concern among employees and customers.</seg>
<seg id="11">The bureau was reassured that customers who bought trips there would go on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thomas Cook – the oldest and one of the largest travel agents in the world – filed for bankruptcy on Sunday night.</seg>
<seg id="13">The immediate cause of the bankruptcy was the collapse of last-ditch talks with creditors and potential investors on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="14">Creditors demanded that in addition to the £900m rescue plan agreed in August, the company should win an extra £200m as collateral for the winter, when travel agents tend to have lower turnover.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, the company's problems had been mounting for several years, resulting in a debt of £1.6bn.</seg>

<seg id="1">Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for your opinion</seg>
<seg id="2">Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – this is the unusual offer prepared by German Görlitz for newcomers.</seg>
<seg id="3">The measures are intended to help combat the ongoing decline in the city's population.</seg>
<seg id="4">Görlitz is Germany's easternmost city.</seg>
<seg id="5">The beautiful pastel old town attracts 140,000 tourists every year.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, according to The Guardian, the city is facing significant problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Görlitz has the lowest wages in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">The city is also facing a steady decline in population.</seg>
<seg id="9">After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them moved to the west of the country, resulting in a 25% decline in the city's population.</seg>
<seg id="10">In 2013, it had a population of 54,000.</seg>
<seg id="11">In order to combat the depopulation, officials came up with the idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.</seg>
<seg id="12">So far the programme has received 150 applications.</seg>
<seg id="13">Two thirds of them were made up of people living in large cities.</seg>
<seg id="14">People from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom were also interested in the programme.</seg>
<seg id="15">"When we applied, we thought the programme was to convince people to move to Görlitz," said one project participant.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Now we feel it doesn't matter if we stay here after four weeks or not," he added.</seg>
<seg id="17">The city has seven thousand vacant apartments, and unemployment is three times higher than the national average.</seg>
<seg id="18">Although the city authorities hope that some will move permanently, the main aim of the program is to get the opinions of the participants.</seg>
<seg id="19">The information gathered from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revive smaller German cities.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We want to know more about what people need and, if they decide to move, what their motivation was," said Robert Knippschild, who is responsible for the program.</seg>
<seg id="21">Other cities have already experimented with ideas to lure new residents by offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first was Detroit, which introduced a program to pay promising young professionals to live and work in the city for a year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy, or in the American state of Tulsa, Oklahoma.</seg>
