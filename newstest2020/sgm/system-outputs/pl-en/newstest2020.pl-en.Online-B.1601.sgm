<seg id="8">It was to be operated.</seg>
<seg id="9">Father Józef Witko prayed for him.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the same day the boy was taken to hospital for surgery.</seg>

<seg id="12">Parents were crying with happiness.</seg>
<seg id="13">After another Franciscan prayer, the hole disappeared completely.</seg>
<seg id="14">He began to experience the extraordinary activities of the Creator as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="15">In his dreams, purgatory souls came to him asking for help.</seg>
<seg id="16">I was awakened at night and urged to pray for the dead and those who were dying at the moment - he recalls.</seg>
<seg id="17">He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.</seg>
<seg id="18">And he had a vision of what was happening to a man who commits a mortal sin.</seg>
<seg id="19">"My body started to change.</seg>
<seg id="20">I lost human qualities and began to take on the appearance of an animal, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="21">An invisible force lifted him up, he couldn't speak.</seg>
<seg id="22">He felt lost.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then God showed him help.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Immersed in the waters of the river symbolizing baptism, I was released and returned to human form ...", he says.</seg>
<seg id="25">He didn't tell anyone about these strange experiences.</seg>
<seg id="26">A vocation matured in him.</seg>
<seg id="27">He was 16 years old when he joined the Franciscans.</seg>

<seg id="2">This afternoon (September 26) this year the Kolping FRAC team has deservedly succumbed to their current Polish champion Dartom Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki as part of the 3rd round of the LOTTO Table Tennis Superliga.</seg>
<seg id="3">Jarosław in such a personal statement, which they presented with the city residents, have little chance of winning with league sovereigns.</seg>
<seg id="4">This duel was clearly demonstrated by the duel with Bogomia.</seg>
<seg id="5">The team still lacks a team leader Chen Jingqi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Perhaps with Jarosław's team they would reach for the third consecutive triumph in the new season.</seg>
<seg id="7">Young Asian Qiyao Han has not yet grown up to win with such big men as Greek Panagiotis Gionis or Czech Pavel Sirucek.</seg>
<seg id="8">Not even with one of the most promising Poles, namely Marek Badowski.</seg>
<seg id="9">The player from Hellas was the biggest star of the duel in the MOSiR hall at ul. Sikorski in Jaroslaw.</seg>
<seg id="10">Both in the clash with Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei was in a class of their own.</seg>
<seg id="11">After three matches Kolping FRAC led 2: 1.</seg>
<seg id="12">Kou Lei probably outpaced Marek Badowski, and Daniel Górak after an exciting five-hundred battle - Pavel Siruck.</seg>
<seg id="13">But then it got worse.</seg>
<seg id="14">Gionis gave Lea no chance.</seg>
<seg id="15">You could still hope for a win for two points, but Qiyao Han did not match Badowski.</seg>

<seg id="1">There will be no additional tests for seniors.</seg>
<seg id="2">Why?</seg>
<seg id="3">As announced by Rafał Trzaskowski, a program of free preventive examinations for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not been approved by the Ministry of Health and its Agency for the Protection of Medical Technologies and Tariffs.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the justification, the agency explained that the target group was chosen incorrectly.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The above actions may even result in the detection of individual disease entities, which may contribute to deepening difficulties in accessing NHF services and adversely affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with false positive test results," it was written.</seg>
<seg id="7">The ministry's decision does not understand the capital's president.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Money is ours, we have anticipated it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only the government is afraid that if people get examined, they will go to the doctor later, which is absurd, because the point is to lead to a situation in which prevention can be carried out faster.</seg>
<seg id="10">All specialists know that it helps when it comes to burdening the health system, because it helps in quick detection of diseases and a reliable approach to health.</seg>
<seg id="11">The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand, "said Rafał Trzaskowski.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It's hard for me to imagine that expert specialists say: Let's not study, because there will be longer queues at the doctor, and if such specialists advise the government, I'm not surprised that this is the state of health care," added PO politician.</seg>

<seg id="1">Palestine responds to Israel: We will break all existing agreements</seg>
<seg id="2">Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas announced on Thursday at a UN General Assembly session that he would break all agreements with Israel if the country's future government attempted to fulfill Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement of the annexation of the occupied Palestinian lands.</seg>
<seg id="3">"If the future Israeli government that begins arises to implement this plan, we will revoke all signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all commitments made," he announced.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We'll reject the plan completely and completely," Abbas threatened.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It is our duty to defend all our rights by all possible means - no matter what the consequences will be - by fully engaging in the application of international law and the fight against terrorism," said the President of the Palestinian Authority, who had already made similar declarations in July.</seg>
<seg id="6">Netanyahu, former prime minister of Israel, again received the mission of forming a government after the September 17 elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">A week before the election, he announced that if he won, he would announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and intend to include all Jewish settlements throughout Israel across the West Bank.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, led by Jaser Arafat at the time, signed a series of peace agreements under the patronage of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="9">84-year-old Abbas also promised to hold general elections in Palestinian territories during the UN General Assembly session.</seg>
<seg id="10">The last took place in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Upon returning to the country, I will call in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem local elections and everyone who opposes them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community," declared the Palestinian president solemnly.</seg>
<seg id="12">In his speech, Abbas defended the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer at the UN, to exercise the rights of "full members of the UN and all its organs and institutions."</seg>
<seg id="13">The Palestinian leader ended his speech with a call to the international community to "force Israel to comply with all respect for United Nations".</seg>
<seg id="14">Israeli ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas's speech, saying that the Palestinian leader "prefers to focus at the UN on the efforts of the Palestinian Authority against Israel rather than fight against calls to terrorism in the Authority under his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="15">However, according to agencies, Danon did not refer to Netanyahu's announced annexation of the occupied Palestinian territories.</seg>

<seg id="1">PLN 105 million for companies from the video game industry from the National Center for Research and Development</seg>
<seg id="2">Almost 105 million PLN of funding will go to gaming companies creating innovative solutions.</seg>
<seg id="3">The National Center for Research and Development announced on Friday the results of the third edition of the GameINN program.</seg>
<seg id="4">Among the nearly 30 projects supported by the National Center for Research and Development, among others developing a platform for creating field games based on an AR game engine that creates a map of the real world together with an application that allows data to be sent by users; testing and training platform for verifying practical skills in the workplace and professional development using VR and AI technologies; an innovative game that simulates the management of real production processes using an innovative gameplay model based on the interaction of the virtual world with the real world using the concept of industry 4.0 - stated in the NCBR message sent on Friday PAP.</seg>
<seg id="5">The goal of the GameINN sector program is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game producers sector on the global market by 2023.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the National Center for Research and Development, the Polish video game sector is already growing at a rate of 10% annually.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 was PLN 1.85 billion, while the forecast for 2019 is 2.23 billion.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Specially prepared GameINN research agenda and already supporting PLN 300 million support for entrepreneurs under this sector program are an important impulse for further dynamic growth of Polish gamedev", reads the communiqué.</seg>
<seg id="9">The video game industry is an excellent example of the effective use of the potential that we have in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Incentives introduced by the government for entrepreneurs focusing on innovation, such as R&amp;D reliefs, competence improvement programs, IP boxes or support programs implemented by the National Center for Research and Development drive the innovative activity of companies and allow them to compete more effectively in a very competitive market", assesses the deputy prime minister science and higher education Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the communiqué.</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of the Ministry of Science notes that money for innovation not only goes to innovators in the form of project co-financing, but also stays in their pockets - three-quarters more entrepreneurs benefited from R&amp;D relief in 2018 than a year earlier.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The amount of deducted costs related to R&amp;D activities amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, which resulted in savings of over PLN 300 million for companies benefiting from this discount.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is equivalent to the support provided by the National Center for Research and Development in three editions of GameINN, ”emphasizes the deputy prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="14">NCBR Director dr inż. Wojciech Kamieniecki reminds that in the previous two competitions, funding with a total value of over PLN 211.2 million was awarded to 78 innovative projects.</seg>
<seg id="15">The huge interest in the III competition and the diversity of submitted applications show that the video game industry has ideas and competences to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Particularly pleased is the fact that among the selected projects - as in previous editions - there are projects for solutions not only for entertainment, but also related to industry 4.0," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the third GameINN competition, entrepreneurs, consortia of entrepreneurs and consortia of entrepreneurs with scientific units could apply for funding of up to PLN 20 million.</seg>
<seg id="18">The NCBR received 87 applications for the total co-financing amount of approx. PLN 317 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">The budget of the competition at the time the competition was announced was PLN 100 million, but it was increased, thanks to which 27 projects were awarded nearly PLN 105 million in funding.</seg>
<seg id="20">Detailed information on the results of the III GameINN competition is available at ncbr.gov.pl.</seg>
<seg id="21">The GameINN sectoral program is implemented under the Intelligent Development Operational Program.</seg>
<seg id="22">NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to an initiative of associated entrepreneurs in the Polish Games Agreement, which includes, among others companies such as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team and 11 bit studios.</seg>

<seg id="9">The 18-year-old has already apologized to Dolberg and the other teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.</seg>
<seg id="10">He also promised the Danish money back for the watch.</seg>
<seg id="11">Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising players of the young generation in France.</seg>

<seg id="13">He appeared in seven games this season.</seg>
<seg id="14">He recently signed a professional contract, but, according to the L'Equipe newspaper, the club will probably terminate it with immediate effect.</seg>

<seg id="2">Tehran did not enter into talks with the American side during the UN General Assembly in New York, despite Americans' offer to lift sanctions, said Iranian President Hasan Rowhani on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">US President Donald Trump commented that the Iranian side asked for lifting the restrictions, which he did not agree to.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Iranian president Hasan Rowhani, the Americans proposed lifting all sanctions on Tehran in exchange for negotiating a new international agreement.</seg>
<seg id="5">It would regulate both the Iranian nuclear program and the ballistic missile program.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rowhani: Iran will not talk in an atmosphere of maximum pressure</seg>
<seg id="7">The Iranian president stated that he did not agree to enter into these talks because of the "toxic atmosphere".</seg>
<seg id="8">He stated that he met with American diplomats because he was persuaded by France, Germany and Great Britain.</seg>
<seg id="9">He emphasized, however, that Iran would not start talks in an atmosphere of "maximum pressure".</seg>
<seg id="10">"And even if we want to negotiate with Americans in the 5 + 1 format, no one can predict what the end result will be," said Rowhani.</seg>
<seg id="11">The day before, the Iranian leader said that he did not rule out talks with the US, and that the European parties to the nuclear agreement accused of favoring US sanctions on Iran.</seg>
<seg id="12">He added that sanctions imposed on Iran after the US withdrawal from the nuclear agreement "are a prerequisite that does not allow" to establish a dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="13">If we can withstand this pre-condition and if America lifts sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America, ”he declared.</seg>
<seg id="14">He added that he did not rule out a meeting with US President Donald Trump, even though he did not agree to such a conversation last week during the UN General Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="15">Trump: "Iran asked, I said no"</seg>
<seg id="16">Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that he rejected the Iranian request.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.</seg>
<seg id="18">Of course, I said 'no!', The US president tweeted.</seg>
<seg id="19">Tension with atomic agreement in the background</seg>
<seg id="20">France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to ease tensions between Washington and Tehran, to somehow save the 2015 deal with Iran, of which they were signatories.</seg>
<seg id="21">It stated that in exchange for lifting the economic sanctions, Iran would abandon the nuclear weapons program and the nuclear sector would be under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).</seg>
<seg id="22">Since the U.S. withdrawal from the agreement in May 2015, other signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to maintain the agreement in force.</seg>
<seg id="23">For now, nothing came of it.</seg>
<seg id="24">Washington uses tactics to put maximum pressure on Iran, and the sanctions also include a full embargo on Iranian oil.</seg>
<seg id="25">Tehran announced that if it does not receive permission to export the raw material, it will limit its obligations under the agreement every 60 days.</seg>

<seg id="1">Judge at the Voivodship Administrative Court in Warsaw and husband of hatter Emilia, who - according to her words and screens from WhatsAppa - participated in stalking against judges, on Wednesday he was reinstated by the Supreme Administrative Court.</seg>
<seg id="2">Reason: no disciplinary proceedings were instituted against him, so there is no basis for upholding the order of the President of the Provincial Administrative Court Wojciech Mazur about removing him from his duties.</seg>
<seg id="3">Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary spokesman at the Supreme Administrative Court, opened an investigation against Szmydt at the end of August, but it has not yet evolved into proceedings against him.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although the Supreme Administrative Court, which acts as a disciplinary court in such cases, must deal with the decision of the President of the Provincial Administrative Court within a month of its issuing.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this situation, a judge who publicly talked about his wife's psychological problems in order to discredit her, who because of suspected participation in a hate group was removed from the KRS office, will return to adjudication and will issue judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.</seg>
<seg id="6">Judge Szmydt denies his participation in the haters' group.</seg>
<seg id="7">He claims that there is no evidence of this except fake screenshots and the words of his wife, whom she divorces with.</seg>
<seg id="8">Exactly the same say the other judges associated with "Caste": all are innocent, there is no evidence.</seg>
<seg id="9">And it is quite possible that they will bet on their own.</seg>
<seg id="10">Because the prosecutor's office did not lift a finger to secure evidence from their electronic media, it is also silent about the contents of Emilia Szmydt's phone, which she stopped in another case in June.</seg>
<seg id="11">The police did not lift a finger to secure the devices of people whom Judge Waldemar Żurek indicated in the February report.</seg>
<seg id="12">There is no evidence - no Szmydt case, no "Caste" case.</seg>
<seg id="13">There is also no case of the head of the Supreme Audit Office Marian Banasia about renting a tenement house to pimps and concealing income.</seg>
<seg id="14">The CBA checks its property declarations.</seg>
<seg id="15">And he'll check when he checks.</seg>
<seg id="16">And the Deputy Ethics Committee will not take care of Banas, because the Sejm is suspended (but the State Control Committee somehow gathered to make a bizarre decision to dismiss Banas's deputies and appoint as his lawyer, although the law does not provide for such a strange combination).</seg>
<seg id="17">The whole reminds me of a film novel, probably American, about how the wife returns home and finds her husband with her lover in bed.</seg>
<seg id="18">She is so amazed and devastated that she cannot speak a word.</seg>
<seg id="19">She stands in the doorway dumbfounded, and at this time the mistress quickly jumps out of bed, gets dressed and goes out.</seg>
<seg id="20">And my husband makes the bed.</seg>
<seg id="21">When the wife regains her voice and screams: what is it supposed to be?</seg>
<seg id="22">Who is this woman</seg>
<seg id="23">The husband calmly asks: what woman, honey?</seg>
<seg id="24">Only that the case of "Caste" or Banasia is a parody of the state.</seg>
<seg id="25">And it's not funny at all.</seg>

<seg id="10">It turned out that I have jaundice.</seg>
<seg id="11">But the worst was ahead of me.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the CT scan was done, it was found that I have a pancreatic cancer ... ", said the Prime Minister's father.</seg>
<seg id="13">A few days later, at the Ministry of Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Kornel Morawiecki underwent major surgery.</seg>
<seg id="14">As Morawiecki said, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain Father Zbigniew Kras to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="15">The operation lasted about three hours and was successful.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I know that many people have prayed for me, for which I thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="17">Fortunately, I don't have metastases.</seg>
<seg id="18">I don't know yet if I will be undergoing chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="19">I entrust myself to specialists who are rather of good cheer.</seg>
<seg id="20">For now, after this heavy surgery, I need to get back to a state of use.</seg>
<seg id="21">I hope everything is going to be all right, "Kornel Morawiecki pointed out in an interview with" SE "in January.</seg>

<seg id="1">The power of Olga jumping.</seg>
<seg id="2">The title of the coverage of amateur sports competitions held on Sunday afternoon of September 15 at the hippodrome at Oleandry Street in Oława may be misleading for some.</seg>
<seg id="3">The road is a long way to real power, but this is how one of the types of horse rivalry is defined ...</seg>
<seg id="4">The competition of the power of jumping consists in overcoming by the rider and horse increasingly higher obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed even two meters.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is worth adding that the long-standing and still unbeatable world record, set in 1949 by Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on the horse "Huaso", is 247 cm.</seg>
<seg id="6">Of course, no one jumped so high in Oława, but the result of the best local amazons at 135 cm is also not the worst ...</seg>
<seg id="7">The competition organized by the tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other activists of JKS "In the Saddle" constituted a demonstration part of the "Rainbow Riding Competition", which was previously held there, which we describe in more detail in this issue of the newspaper on page 22.</seg>
<seg id="8">Eight amazons who competed in horse riding in OKS in JKS entered the competition.</seg>
<seg id="9">Four competed on kuckach, and four on large horses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Nikola Szołdra did the best in the first group, riding the crazy "Sprinter".</seg>
<seg id="11">This small, but very dynamic steed began by overcoming obstacles distributed at a height of 40 cm, and ended only at the station with the upper beam 125 cm away from the ground.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he did not give up easily and only after three subsequent refusals was he removed from further competition by the jury.</seg>
<seg id="13">Amelia Pawlak, who rides "Famy", came second in pony jumps, and Lena Boruń on "Harmider".</seg>
<seg id="14">The youngest participant of the tournament - Inga Aksman, was galloping ambitiously, galloping and jumping over obstacles on the little mare "Carmen".</seg>
<seg id="15">Even greater emotions accompanied the competing amazons and spectators during the competition with the participation of large horses.</seg>
<seg id="16">Paulina Szewczyk, who mounted the "Declaration" and Anastazja Abramenko, who rode "Lotka", scored terrible-looking falls.</seg>
<seg id="17">Fortunately, apart from minor bruises, neither amazons nor horses did anything wrong, so they continued to participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="18">Weronika Łuczkiewicz riding her had many problems with introducing the young mare "Wineta".</seg>
<seg id="19">You needed either the assistance of a trainer or another horse to pair, followed by a crazy "Wineta".</seg>
<seg id="20">After completing the obstacle from the parking she was also riding full gallop, so at times it was dangerous in the boxes and the expansion room. "Everything is under control!", Assured Jan Sienkiewicz a bit of those scared viewers, especially the youngest ones.</seg>
<seg id="21">From the beginning of the big horses competition, Marta Masalska, who sits on a beautifully presenting "Whiskey", did a great job on the park.</seg>
<seg id="22">This dignified mare, in tandem with the experienced Amazon, jumped 135 cm first in the final stage and it was the best competition result at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="23">After a while, however, Paulina Szewczyk attended the same height at the Declaration, Weronika Łuczkiewicz at the Wineta and Anastazja Abramenko at the Lotka.</seg>
<seg id="24">To flo decoration and to receive prizes in the form of equestrian equipment, all these competitors went together, and finally together with the Amazons on ponies in time to Radecki's march made a spectacular honor round, ending this interesting and exciting competition.</seg>
<seg id="25">thanks</seg>
<seg id="26">The Equestrian Sports Club "In Siodło" would like to thank the sponsors of the competition for the power of the jump during the 16th "Rainbow Equestrian Competition": the City Hall in Oława, the Water Supply and Sewerage Plant in Oława, the Poviat Starosty and the "Mustang" company.</seg>

<seg id="3">The revolution addressed its proposal especially to young voters with right-wing views.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the election, Kolonko announced cooperation with Marek Jakubiak or Paweł Kukiz, but none of these coalitions occurred, and the KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko did not even manage to collect enough signatures to list in any constituency in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now Kolonko has announced on Twitter that he has ended cooperation with KWW Max Kolonko's Patriotic Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I will expect the abovementioned KWW to delete my name from the name.</seg>
<seg id="7">I am kindly asking you not to connect my person with the above mentioned entity ”, he added and announced that he will give more information soon.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is not yet known whether the journalist will continue his activity or whether the end of the #R Revolution formation.</seg>
<seg id="9">On July 4, American Independence Day, journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko, who was in the US, announced the creation of a new political formation - #R Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="10">In recent years, Kolonko has become famous for running the Max TV channel on YouTube, where he comments on events in Poland and around the world.</seg>
<seg id="11">"We have enough politicians, enough of your stupid games, enough of your amateur rule.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is time for the nation to take over the government and rule for the good of the Nation, "Kolonko said at the time.</seg>
<seg id="13">The party's program includes issues related to the judiciary (should be chosen in general elections), tax changes (equalization of the tax-free amount for everyone), war reparations (in the form of military assistance to NATO's eastern flank countries, with particular emphasis on Poland), holding a referendum on the possession of weapons, restrictions on the number of deputies or the introduction of single-mandate constituencies.</seg>
<seg id="14">A few days after the announcement of a new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko began talks with Marek Jakubiak.</seg>

<seg id="2">"The euro exchange rate will remain in the coming months around the 4.35 PLN ceiling, which will be accompanied by a weak economic situation on global markets", announces Michael Bolliger from the UBS Wealth Management company.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Expectations of maintaining a solid pace of economic growth and stable monetary policy speak for stabilization of the zloty at the current ceiling," says the specialist in an interview with Bankier.pl.</seg>
<seg id="4">In his opinion, despite clear inflationary pressure, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide to raise rates in an environment in which the vast majority of central banks relax their policies.</seg>
<seg id="5">"While the zloty is priced properly - the euro should remain around the 4.35 PLN ceiling in the coming months - according to him, Polish bonds are not very attractive.</seg>
<seg id="6">Emerging market bonds offer much more favorable yields than Polish securities, ”says Michael Bolliger, head of asset allocation to emerging markets in the company of UBS Wealth Management.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the global downturn.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The global slowdown may further deepen, but there should not be a severe recession, but at most a decline in GDP dynamics slightly below zero," announces Michael Bolliger.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Investors should underweight global stocks that may be harmed by the lack of prospects for resolving the US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including Donald Trump's impeachment procedure and Brexit."</seg>
<seg id="10">Among the stock markets, Europe should behave relatively poorly, ”according to the latest letter to investors by the main manager of UBS Wealth Management, Mark Haefele.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Shares from eurozone countries should behave worse than US ones, because they are more susceptible in conditions of increased uncertainty around global trade and fear of slowdown," the document reads.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to Michael Bolliger, after the bull market in the bond markets of the safest countries pushed the yields of German 10-year-olds even to minus 0.74%, it is possible to deepen the fall in yields.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the long run, however, long-term yields should no longer fall, but only short-term ones, due to easing of monetary policy of banks.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Fed has the greatest room for rate cuts, which should lead to a weakening of the US currency over the next few years.</seg>
<seg id="15">The long-term equilibrium for the euro is the $ 1.29 ceiling, which would mean 19% potential for strengthening the single currency against the dollar.</seg>
<seg id="16">We expect further cuts in the Fed's rates, which will result in narrowing the differences in monetary policy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Current and budget deficits may not allow the dollar to stay strong in the long run," says Michael Bolliger.</seg>

<seg id="2">Confidential report of the German Ministry of National Defense</seg>
<seg id="3">The Bundeswehr from the beginning of 2014 noted the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and 19 445 pieces of ammunition - according to a confidential summary drawn up in the defense ministry of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="4">The information was provided by the press belonging to the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND) media group.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to a document from the office of the Parliamentary Secretary of State at the Ministry of National Defense Peter Tauber (CDU), so far two weapons, one part of the weapon and 3474 pieces of ammunition have been traced again.</seg>

<seg id="7">In addition, 30 barrels for MG3 machine guns are missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">Martin Renner, vice president of the Left party, expressed concern about the situation.</seg>
<seg id="9">As she told RND journalists, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is "alarming."</seg>

<seg id="11">Martina Renner summarized the effects of these activities as a "miserable balance sheet".</seg>
<seg id="12">She also criticized the fact that the statement does not indicate whether there is also a weapon that was found during the investigation against the lieutenant of the Bundeswehr Franco A. In December 2017, the federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a violent act threatening the security of the state and violating the provisions of the law regulating access to firearms.</seg>
<seg id="13">The officer was accused of preparing assassinations of leading German politicians for extreme-right and racist reasons.</seg>
<seg id="14">His "black list" of goals, which fell into the hands of the prosecutor's office, included then Minister of Justice Heiko Maas from the SPD, Claudia Roth from the Green Party and Anetta Kahane, human rights defender and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung foundation in Berlin.</seg>

<seg id="4">Japan Airlines has recently been using a feature developed for people for whom traveling with a crying child is a nightmare.</seg>

<seg id="6">If a particular minor travels up to the age of two, then the "child icon" appears on the specific seat reserved by parents or guardians.</seg>

<seg id="8">The BBC reports that the airlines have already reported the imperfections of this solution.</seg>
<seg id="9">The "child icon" will not appear if the ticket has been booked by a third party or if there was a change of aircraft at the last minute.</seg>
<seg id="10">As expected, the idea divided the Internet users.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some Twitter users indicate that the problem of traveling with crying children can be solved with the help of headphones that reduce noise.</seg>

<seg id="1">Majorca counts losses after the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook travel agency</seg>
<seg id="2">Over 25,000 Foreign tourists will not come to Majorca on holiday in October as a result of the bankruptcy announced on Monday by travel agency Thomas Cook.</seg>
<seg id="3">As the representative of the Balearic autonomous government Marc Pons said on Friday, among 25,000 vacationers who will not be able to take advantage of October holidays in Majorca, there are also people who were to travel with companies indirectly associated with Thomas Cook, such as the company Neckermann.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pons explained that 80 percent expected vacationers who, due to the bankruptcy of the British company had to give up vacation in Majorca next month are citizens of Germany and the Scandinavian countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, according to Pons, due to the fact that Thomas Cook did not direct tourists to the Balearic island in November-April, losses for the local economy will be lower.</seg>
<seg id="6">He revealed that the Balearic government has already begun negotiations with international operators on "entering Majorca's market" after the British operator's bankruptcy.</seg>
<seg id="7">Estimates of the newspaper "Diario de Mallorca" show that in October due to the tourist crisis in Majorca, more than 1,000 people will lose their jobs.</seg>
<seg id="8">About 800 are dismissed employees of the Thomas Cook office in Palma.</seg>
<seg id="9">Other people will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Monday, along with the declaration of bankruptcy by Thomas Cook in many Mallorca hotels, the owners of the property demanded that guests pay an additional fee.</seg>
<seg id="11">This situation has been experienced by, among others dozens of tourists from Poland.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Balearic government estimates that by Thursday, several dozen Majorca hotels had ceased operations at least until the end of October due to the declaration of bankruptcy by Thomas Cook and the cooperating companies.</seg>
<seg id="13">In turn, the Friday daily "Diario de Ibiza" indicates that the majority of hotels operating in Ibiza, which cooperated with the Thomas Cook group, do not intend to close their facilities in the coming weeks.</seg>
<seg id="14">The newspaper reminds that on this Balearic island the British bankrupt cooperated with 42 hotels.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Wednesday, the Balearic autonomous authorities announced that they would ask the Spanish government to support the region with EUR 100 million to cover the losses caused by bankruptcy declared by the travel agency Thomas Cook.</seg>
<seg id="16">They revealed that the most affected tourists in this archipelago, about 36,000 people, located in Mallorca.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to data from the Balearic government, Thomas Cook is in arrears with local travel companies, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of contracts for the July-September 2019 period of around EUR 5 million.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grzegorz Schetyna: I don't promise 600+</seg>
<seg id="2">"Today, PiS wants to bribe Poles by offering them a loan deal that will have to be repaid by future generations," says Grzegorz Schetyna in an interview with Rzeczpospolita.</seg>
<seg id="3">In his opinion, "the entire PiS policy is pic".</seg>
<seg id="4">At the same time, the politician promises that "what is given will not be taken away."</seg>
<seg id="5">Schetyna assures in an interview with Jacek Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea to defeat Law and Justice.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is about mobilizing the electorate at the ballot boxes.</seg>
<seg id="7">In his opinion, the opposition has greater potential in this respect than Kaczyński's party.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today, there are more conscious people who want to live in a normal state than supporters of PiS, a party that has embarked on preached values ​​such as modesty, humility, transparency," says Schetyna.</seg>
<seg id="9">The leader of the Civic Coalition and the chairman of the Civic Platform also pointed out the basic assumptions of the KO election program.</seg>
<seg id="10">"First, nothing given will be received, but you need to set a direction for the future, because PiS deals only with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which can be seen even after dramatically low investments," he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Secondly, it is about "mobilizing the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work reliably - and those who are entrepreneurial."</seg>
<seg id="12">Schetyna explains that the KO program includes a project that will give the least-paid Poles PLN 614 more on hand, and more for those who earn - a few hundred each.</seg>
<seg id="13">The politician also noted that he did not want to race for distribution.</seg>
<seg id="14">He said he would do as much as he could do, but he wouldn't promise 600+.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I will never allow the Greek variant, where the rulers bid with the opposition to give away, and finally the country's financial collapse," he emphasized.</seg>
<seg id="16">In an interview with Rzeczpospolita, Schetyna also stated that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.</seg>

<seg id="2">The police action will be conducted, among others at the intersection of al. Ciepliński from al. Pilsudski.</seg>
<seg id="3">The uniformed actions are in a way related to the recent complaints of the city authorities about drivers who are not always able to behave properly at the intersection.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Friday, September 27, police officers in Rzeszów are starting preventive actions for "Mobile intersections".</seg>
<seg id="5">It is about eliminating traffic jams: entering an intersection without the possibility of exiting, non-compliance with traffic lights or road signs.</seg>

<seg id="7">His words resounded at the town hall press conference, at which the city authorities presented examples of inappropriate car traffic at intersections, which in effect creates traffic jams.</seg>

<seg id="9">The subject was taken over by Rzeszów police officers, who are starting the "Passing intersections" campaign from today.</seg>
<seg id="10">What is going on?</seg>
<seg id="11">The aim of the actions is to eliminate the phenomenon of limiting passability at intersections by drivers entering them without being able to continue driving.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is a frequent offense that adds to traffic congestion and traffic jams.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is threatened with a fine of PLN 300 and 2 penalty points.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, uniforms will pay attention to non-compliance with traffic lights or road signs, and incorrect parking in the area of ​​intersections.</seg>
<seg id="15">They will also observe a lack of smooth driving, late driving from under the signals, slow crossing of intersections and leaving too large distances between vehicles.</seg>

<seg id="8">"We went to the hall, but for the most part it was time for the band.</seg>
<seg id="9">The idea was to spend it together rather than train.</seg>

<seg id="16">As two main reasons for failure I would point out ineffectiveness in attack and much worse than usual handling of situation balls.</seg>
<seg id="17">Slovenians were much better than us in this respect, "he analyzed.</seg>
<seg id="18">In his opinion, the "White-Red" did not stand in the way of stress related to the performance against the co-hosts of the tournament supported by loud and numerous audience.</seg>
<seg id="19">He admitted that the world champions could have been somewhat put to sleep by the smooth way to the semi-final.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Perhaps, if in the group stage we had a similar failure, then we would analyze this lesson faster and then play differently later in the tournament.</seg>

<seg id="4">A summary of the performances of the most uncouth professional tennis player of recent years looks scary - 16 weeks break plus a large fine, but both punishments are suspended for half a year - a trial period during which the wayward athlete will be able to improve.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he has been breaking up for a long time and has made a peculiar tennis world record - he had to pay the highest single fine in the history of the discipline for violating the rules of conduct on and next to the court.</seg>
<seg id="6">Loud curses, strange gestures, unsportsmanlike behavior, insulting the referee and spectators, breaking two rockets during a lost match against Karen Khachanov - all this after the August ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati he paid $ 113,000.</seg>
<seg id="7">He did not play in the US Open 2019 for long, but he managed to publicly say that ATP activists "are corrupt", which hurt the organization's authorities so much that they implemented a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and after a few weeks they gave the said verdict on suspension of starts and another fine.</seg>
<seg id="8">Words of corruption, however, were forgiven after hearing the accused and learning the context of the statement.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, in the justification, tennis activists stated that the investigation showed that Kyrgios' behavior throughout the past 12 months in many cases raised serious reservations and constituted an almost constant violation of the rules, that he continually insulted vulgar players and spectators insultingly, hence the high penalty.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, ATP gave him five days to file an appeal and immediately postponed the execution of the judgment, ordering the fulfillment of several conditions within the next six months: in ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour tournaments, Kyrgios can no longer violate the rules of code of conduct applicable to professional tennis players, in in particular, he may no longer swear, destroy rockets, quarrel with the judges and the public, or otherwise act indecently or vulgarly.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was also advised to seek "continuous support" from mental trainers during tournaments and also during the off-season consulted with persons specializing in solving problems of athletes who could not cope with proper behavior.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nick Kyrgios's first comment (on social media) to the verdict was: "Hey everyone, I can still play.</seg>
<seg id="13">I just have to control my behavior, that's all. "</seg>
<seg id="14">In practice, the Australian will have a break of at least two weeks, because in the Lavera Cup his shoulder injury got worse, so he had to give up his next starts in Beijing (September 30 - October 6) and Shanghai (October 6–13).</seg>
<seg id="15">Kyrgios ranks 27th in the ATP ranking.</seg>
<seg id="16">This year he won two tournaments - in Washington and Acapulco, he earned over $ 1.3 million, so even after fines he will have a lot.</seg>

<seg id="1">Niesiołowski critically about the Pope.</seg>
<seg id="2">John Paul II did nothing</seg>
<seg id="3">In an interview with Piotr Lekszycki, Stefan Niesiołowski emphasized that in 1981 John Paul II was a great authority for opposition activists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"In fact, his every sentence was accepted."</seg>
<seg id="5">Later, critics of some of his actions appeared.</seg>
<seg id="6">"For me, the fact that John Paul II could not eliminate Rydzyk's harmful activities puts a great shadow on his pontificate.</seg>
<seg id="7">After all, this Redemptorist - a pest of the Church and Poland - developed his media into the best in the lifetime of the Polish Pope, "he explained.</seg>
<seg id="8">A former PO politician admitted: "there were murmurs of discontent, the pope said something, once Rydzyka did not accept, but he had power and for politics he could simply expel him from the Church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, John Paul II did not do this, neither did his successors, "explained Niesiolowski.</seg>
<seg id="10">"In addition, this fatal matter of pedophilia and the Church's activities has come, or rather their lack.</seg>
<seg id="11">I thought a little bit ahead, but I wanted to draw attention to the whole of his life.</seg>
<seg id="12">We have known relatively recently about the scale of pedophilia in the Church.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question arises how it is possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these abominable matters, "he says in an interview with journalist Niesiołowski.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the opinion of the former PO politician, the Polish Church is an ally of PiS.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I must admit that during the Solidarity period, the Church was our most important ally.</seg>
<seg id="16">All ceremonies began with the Holy Mass, crosses hung everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now these crosses are Pisz, they have become a symbol of dictatorship - a sign of the Pisz regime.</seg>
<seg id="18">I repeat: one of the biggest unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk shake the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing about it and that today the Church is an ally of PiS.</seg>
<seg id="19">This is a black chapter of the Polish Church, for which he will pay dearly ", argued Niesiołowski.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I hope that Pope Francis chases Jędraszewski, Rydzyk and a few others of this type," he concluded.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, you will have to consider whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade," said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, leader of the Alliance Jarosław Gowin on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Gowin during a conversation in "Sygnały Dnia" on radio Jedynka stated that trade is controlled by international networks, which impose such low margins on Polish producers that actually Polish companies cannot grow.</seg>
<seg id="4">To the remark that this problem is very difficult to fight, the deputy prime minister reminded that the PiS government had tried to deal with it at the very beginning of the term, but got "a counterattack by the EC".</seg>
<seg id="5">"We won before the court of justice and I hope that if the United Right wins the next election and formulates a government, we will return to this topic," he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He also noted that "effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish, and thus small trade".</seg>
<seg id="7">"It will be necessary to think about whether the government or the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade," said Gowin.</seg>
<seg id="8">In May, an EU court ruled that the European Commission had made a mistake in considering that the Polish retail tax was unlawful state aid.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Act on retail sales tax assumed the introduction of two rates of trade tax: 0.8 percent. from revenues between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4 percent from revenues above PLN 170 million per month.</seg>
<seg id="10">The tax was to apply from September 2016.</seg>
<seg id="11">In September 2016, the EC initiated proceedings for violation of EU law by Poland.</seg>
<seg id="12">Brussels argued at the time that the tax design could favor smaller stores, which could be considered as state aid.</seg>
<seg id="13">She further stated that the tribute had been implemented unlawfully.</seg>
<seg id="14">It also issued an order to suspend the application of the tax until its analysis was completed by officials in Brussels.</seg>
<seg id="15">Poland disagreed with this position, but tax collection was suspended.</seg>
<seg id="16">An EU court decision in May paved the way for a tax re-introduction, but it did not end the case.</seg>
<seg id="17">On 24 July, the Commission lodged an appeal with the Court of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="18">On Thursday, the CJEU's press service informed PAP that the case is currently at the written stage, in which both the European Commission and the Polish government present their arguments in writing.</seg>
<seg id="19">For now, it is not known if and when the oral procedure will start, i.e. hearing the parties and a possible hearing.</seg>
<seg id="20">It takes a good few to several months from an appeal to the announcement of the judgment.</seg>

<seg id="1">How to dress a child for baptism?</seg>
<seg id="2">We suggest some practical solutions</seg>
<seg id="3">Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of an infant and his parents.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is often the first occasion where the whole family gathers around the child, celebrating his appearance in the world together.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is no wonder then that the newly baked mom and dad want their child to look its best on this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, before you make the final decision about your child's outfit, think about whether it will also be comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="7">In stores you can find many fancy sets that do not provide the child with adequate comfort.</seg>
<seg id="8">So what should you pay attention to?</seg>
<seg id="9">The basic criterion for choosing a baptismal clothing is the age of the child</seg>
<seg id="10">Until recently, babies baptized for several weeks, dressed up in white sets and put into the same becks or big cushions.</seg>
<seg id="11">Today, children entering the sacrament are often older: several months, one year old and even larger.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is not difficult to guess that such a big baby needs a slightly different baptism clothes.</seg>
<seg id="13">Therefore, if your child is 3–4 months old on the day of baptism, he will probably spend the ceremony in a pram or on the hands of his parents or godparents.</seg>
<seg id="14">The best solution will be to dress it with comfortable, cotton rompers or sets.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although this item of clothing is considered a casual outfit, you only need to look for its festive variants, for example with a frill or lace.</seg>
<seg id="16">A boy with a bow tie and suspenders print will be perfect for the boy.</seg>
<seg id="17">For older children, you can afford more fantasy in clothing.</seg>
<seg id="18">The girl will look beautiful in a simple tulle dress</seg>
<seg id="19">Many girls' parents look forward to richly decorated, frilly dresses for baptism complete with coats, headbands and hats.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers use artificial, breathable materials for their products, in which the child is simply uncomfortable.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the search for the right clothes, it will be better to look at the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant outfits with cotton lining.</seg>
<seg id="22">Delicate, tulle skirts, satin dresses, laces, applications and charming sets will make your daughter look gorgeous and feel comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="23">The perfect outfit for a little gentleman: a cotton suit</seg>
<seg id="24">Until recently, boys' fashion was in fashion for suits that were copies of 'adult' models.</seg>
<seg id="25">Polyester jackets and trousers, stiff collars or flat caps often made young elegance loudly show their dissatisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="26">Today, fortunately, they have been supplanted by comfortable, cotton sets.</seg>
<seg id="27">Just look at the sets available in Asanti for Kids, i.e. soft, sweat shorts, plus a blouse decorated on the front with a vest pattern.</seg>
<seg id="28">These outfits look very festive, and at the same time do not restrict the movements of the child who knows the world.</seg>

<seg id="1">Voting on a break in the proceedings during the Conservative Party conference</seg>
<seg id="2">British parliamentarians voted against a three-day break in the House of Commons for the Conservative Party's annual conference conference, as requested by the government.</seg>
<seg id="3">289 MPs were in favor, 306 against.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is customary for the House of Commons not to meet at party conferences so that Members do not have to resign from participation in them or from parliamentary meetings.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, opposition parties have recognized that in such a crucial time as the last weeks before Britain's exit from the European Union scheduled for October 31st, parliament should not stop the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="6">289 MPs were in favor of the government's request for a break, 306 were against.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two opposition parties after conventions</seg>
<seg id="8">Lack of consent for a break may be perceived as the political revenge of the opposition at Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday the decision was declared unlawful and illegal by the Supreme Court) and that after the judges' decision I want to apologize for her.</seg>
<seg id="9">Following this ruling, the House of Commons resumed its session on Wednesday, with Johnson's speech followed by a heated debate following it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Johnson accused the opposition of blocking Brexit and avoiding early elections.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The time has come to realize Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="12">It must be implemented to respect the result of the referendum.</seg>
<seg id="13">Brexit must come so that we can deal with the agreement on citizens' priorities, health care, and the cost of living.</seg>
<seg id="14">Brexit must be realized so that we can unite this country, "said Johnson.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Conservative Party conference is scheduled to start in Manchester this Sunday and last until Wednesday, October 2nd.</seg>
<seg id="16">Conferences of two main opposition groups - the Labor Party and Liberal Democrats - have already taken place.</seg>
<seg id="17">One of the justifications Johnson gave in explaining such a long suspension of parliament was party conferences.</seg>

<seg id="5">What's more, his sub-tenant was supposed to run sex business in the building (hence, rent rooms for hours).</seg>

<seg id="7">Bertold Kittel pointed out the irregularities in the program "Supervisor".</seg>
<seg id="8">The journalist revealed that the house was rented from Banasia by people associated with the criminal world to use it as a place of "erotic meetings."</seg>
<seg id="9">The clients were to be men using the services of prostitutes.</seg>
<seg id="10">Banaś responded vaguely and vaguely to the allegations.</seg>
<seg id="11">Interestingly, the tenement rented by the pimps led the journalist to discover negligence in Banasia's property declarations.</seg>
<seg id="12">The house itself was described in them vaguely, and the income from its rental was to be underestimated.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The property of Marian Banas and his wife can be worth from PLN 6 to 8 million.</seg>
<seg id="14">In total, the spouses can boast of two houses, three apartments, savings [...] ", writes Money.pl.</seg>

<seg id="17">Banaś announced that he would suspend his activities at the Supreme Audit Office until its completion. "I will ask the marshal for unpaid leave," he assured.</seg>
<seg id="18">The opposition is demanding clarification.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We don't hear that the CBA would extend its investigation or accelerate the examination of Marian Banas' property declarations.</seg>
<seg id="20">Therefore, we are forced to remove the state authorities and submit a notification about the possibility of committing a crime [...], "said PO-KO MP Mariusz Witczak.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If a normal Pole so grossly priced rental of his property, he would already have 10 controls, tax addiction and criminal and tax proceedings," he added.</seg>
<seg id="22">He went high, he fell low</seg>
<seg id="23">Marian Banaś is the new president of the Supreme Audit Office.</seg>
<seg id="24">He was appointed to this position on August 30, 2019, for a 6-year term.</seg>
<seg id="25">His candidacy was proposed by Law and Justice and accepted by the votes of politicians from this party.</seg>
<seg id="26">Earlier, Banaś was associated with the Supreme Audit Office in 1992–2005, he was active in this institution as a collaborator of Lech Kaczyński.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Rzeczpospolita": Ignoring the policeman's orders will be punished</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the newspaper, disregarding the order of specific behavior issued by a police officer is to be a new type of offense, threatened with a fine, arrest or restriction of liberty.</seg>
<seg id="3">Police trade unionists want this change.</seg>
<seg id="4">The idea went to the parliamentary Committee on Petitions.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The case is serious, because already every year over half a million misdemeanors are brought to Polish courts," we read.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rzeczpospolita has determined that the petition that the Independent Trade Union of Policemen is writing to MPs regarding the amendment of the Code of Offenses has a chance of success.</seg>
<seg id="7">The authors of the petition propose a new wording for Art. 54a of the Code of Offenses.</seg>
<seg id="8">It would read: "Whoever does not comply with the request or order of a public official, issued within the limits and on the basis of the provisions of the Act, is subject to the arrest, fine or restriction of liberty."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Par. 3 of this provision speaks of an identical punishment for those who, by not following orders, will prevent or hinder the performance of official duties, "reports the diary.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski told Rzeczpospolita that, although he agrees with the main message of the recipe proposal, he is afraid that if implemented, it may be used in political manifestations.</seg>
<seg id="11">"In situations of freedom demonstrations it would be unfavorable and instead of mitigating the situation, they would even exacerbate it," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="12">The statistics provided by the newspaper show that 86 percent. citizens positively assessed police interventions in 2018 and that the services undertake 1.5 million city interventions every month.</seg>

<seg id="1">Belgium: Brussels Airlines canceled 105 flights due to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook</seg>
<seg id="2">Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook has collapsed, its Belgian branch Neckermann is operational.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the company has problems.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to VRT, Brussels Airlines announced that they will cancel 105 flights in October due to bankruptcy problems with Thomas Cook.</seg>
<seg id="5">Neckermann also laid off 75 employees.</seg>
<seg id="6">All trips with the office that have been booked in Belgium will be canceled, but vacationers will be able to get a refund.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Ghent court also declared bankruptcy of three Belgian daughter companies: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.</seg>
<seg id="8">Currently, approx. 12 thousand Belgians travel abroad on trips bought at Thomas Cook.</seg>
<seg id="9">Another 40 thousand people were to leave the office by the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">As late as Monday, spokeswoman Thomas Cook Belgium Leen Segers said the company is now "fully operational" despite the bankruptcy of the British parent, which caused concern among employees and customers.</seg>
<seg id="11">The office reassured then that customers who bought trips in it, would go on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thomas Cook - the oldest and one of the largest travel agencies in the world - went bankrupt on the night of Sunday to Monday.</seg>
<seg id="13">The immediate reason for the bankruptcy was the collapse of last-minute talks with creditors and potential investors on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="14">Creditors demanded that, in addition to the £ 900m rescue plan already agreed in August, the company earn an additional $ 200m as collateral for the winter, when travel agents usually have lower turnover.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, the company's problems have been growing for several years, resulting in a debt of up to 1.6 billion pounds.</seg>

<seg id="1">Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for your review</seg>
<seg id="2">Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion - German Görlitz has prepared such an amazing offer for newcomers.</seg>
<seg id="3">The activities are to help combat the progressive decline in the city's population.</seg>
<seg id="4">Görlitz is Germany's easternmost city.</seg>
<seg id="5">The beautiful pastel old town attracts 140,000 annually. tourists.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, as the Guardian writes, the city is facing significant problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Görlitz has the lowest wages in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">The city is also struggling with a permanent decrease in the number of inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="9">After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them went to the west of the country, which translated into a decrease of the city's population by 25 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">In 2013, it amounted to 54,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="11">To combat depopulation, officials came up with the idea of ​​starting to offer free monthly accommodation in the city.</seg>
<seg id="12">So far, 150 applications have been submitted to the program.</seg>
<seg id="13">Two-thirds of them were made by residents of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="14">People from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and Great Britain have also become interested in the program.</seg>
<seg id="15">"When we applied, we thought the program would convince people to move to Görlitz," said one of the project participants.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Now we feel it doesn't matter whether we stay here after four weeks or not," he added.</seg>
<seg id="17">The city has seven thousand free apartments, and unemployment is three times higher than the average for the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="18">Although the city authorities hope that some will move permanently, the main goal of the program is to get feedback from program participants.</seg>
<seg id="19">Information collected from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revive smaller German cities.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We want to learn more about what people need, and if they decide to move - how motivated they were," said program manager Robert Knippschild.</seg>
<seg id="21">Other cities have already experimented with ideas to lure new residents, offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first was Detroit, which introduced a program to pay promising young professionals for living and working in the city for a year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy, or in American Tulsa, Oklahoma.</seg>
