<seg id="1">Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in a white robe</seg>
<seg id="2">He is a charismatic.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Holy Masses celebrated by him for release and healing attract crowds.</seg>
<seg id="4">He was several years old when inexplicable things began to happen in his life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Today, through the Franciscan, others experience it.</seg>
<seg id="6">Holy Masses celebrated by Fr Witko for release and healing attract crowds</seg>
<seg id="7">Once the parents of a 7-month-old child came to him, who had a 7.5 mm hole in his heart.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was to be operated on.</seg>
<seg id="9">Father Józef Witko prayed over him.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the same day, the boy was taken to the hospital for surgery.</seg>
<seg id="11">Astonished doctors ruled: "Surgery is not needed, the loss is only 1.5 mm."</seg>
<seg id="12">His parents cried with happiness.</seg>
<seg id="13">After another prayer, the Franciscan hole disappeared completely.</seg>
<seg id="14">The clergyman's extraordinary actions of the Creator began to experience as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="15">In his dreams, souls of purgatory came to him asking for help.</seg>
<seg id="16">I was awakened at night and urged to pray for the dead and those who died at the moment, "he recalls.</seg>
<seg id="17">He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.</seg>
<seg id="18">And he had a vision of what happens to a man who commits mortal sin.</seg>
<seg id="19">"My body started to change.</seg>
<seg id="20">I lost human characteristics and started to take on the appearance of an animal, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="21">The invisible force lifted him up, he could not extract his voice.</seg>
<seg id="22">He felt he was lost.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then God pointed to his rescue.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Immersed in the waters of the river symbolizing holy baptism, I was released and returned to human form...," he says.</seg>
<seg id="25">He did not speak to anyone about these strange experiences.</seg>
<seg id="26">His vocation matured.</seg>
<seg id="27">He was 16 years old when he joined the Franciscans.</seg>
<seg id="28">In his sermons he wanted not only to talk about Jesus.</seg>
<seg id="29">He wanted people to experience Him alive.</seg>
<seg id="30">Members of the charismatic community of Renewal in the Holy Spirit</seg>
<seg id="31">Masses for healing celebrated by Father Witko are attended by many people who hope to get rid of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="32">The priest emphasizes, however, that their main purpose is spiritual healing, not bodily healing.</seg>

<seg id="2">Today (26 September this year) afternoon Kolping FRAC team deservedly succumbed to the current Polish champion Dartom Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki as part of the 3rd round of LOTTO Superliga Table Tennis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Yaroslavs, in such a personal combination as they presented with grodziszczany, have little chance of winning against the sovereigns of the league.</seg>

<seg id="10">Both in the clash with Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei was a class for himself.</seg>
<seg id="11">After three matches, Kolping FRAC led 2-1.</seg>
<seg id="12">Kou Lei probably beat Marek Badowski, and Daniel Górak after a thrilling, five-set battle - Pavel Siruck.</seg>

<seg id="1">There will be no additional tests for seniors.</seg>
<seg id="2">Why?</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Rafał Trzaskowski's announcements, a program of free preventive tests for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not been approved by the Ministry of Health and its subordinate Agency for Health Technology Protection and Tariff System.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the justification, the agency explained that the target group was poorly selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The above actions may even result in the detection of individual disease units, which may contribute to the deepening of difficulties in accessing NHF services and negatively affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with a false positive test result," it says.</seg>
<seg id="7">The decision of the ministry does not understand the president of the capital.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The money is ours, we have provided the money for it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only the government is afraid that if people examine themselves, they will go to the doctor later, which is absurd, because it is precisely about bringing about a situation in which prevention can be done more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="10">All specialists know that this helps when it comes to the burden on the health system, because it helps in the rapid detection of diseases and in a reliable approach to health.</seg>
<seg id="11">The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand, "said Rafał Trzaskowski.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It is hard for me to imagine that expert specialists say: Let's not examine ourselves, because there will be longer queues at the doctor, and if such specialists advise the government, I am not surprised that the health service is in such a state," added the Civic Platform politician.</seg>

<seg id="1">Palestine answers Israel: We will break all existing agreements</seg>
<seg id="2">Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced at a session of the UN General Assembly on Thursday that he would break all agreements reached with Israel if the country's future government tried to meet Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement to annex occupied Palestinian lands.</seg>
<seg id="3">"If the future government of Israel, which will be formed, proceeds to implement this plan, we will cancel all signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all commitments made," he announced.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We will reject the whole plan completely and completely," Abbas threatened with pressure.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It is our duty to defend all our rights by all possible means - little matter what the consequences will be - by committing ourselves completely to the application of international law and to the fight against terrorism," declared the President of the Palestinian Authority, who had already made similar declarations in July.</seg>
<seg id="6">Netanyahu, the former Prime Minister of Israel, was again given a mission to form a government after the September 17 elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">A week before the election, he announced that if he won, he would announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and incorporate all Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank into Israel.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, led by Yasser Arafat, signed a series of peace agreements under the patronage of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="9">The 84-year-old Abbas also promised during the session of the UN General Assembly to hold general elections on Palestinian soil.</seg>
<seg id="10">The last one took place in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="11">"After returning home, I will convene local elections in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, and all those who oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community," the Palestinian president solemnly declared.</seg>
<seg id="12">Abbas also defended in his speech the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer at the United Nations, to exercise the powers of "full members of the United Nations and all its bodies and institutions."</seg>
<seg id="13">The Palestinian leader concluded his speech with a call to the international community to "force Israel to comply with the provisions of the United Nations in all respect."</seg>
<seg id="14">Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas' speech, declaring that the Palestinian leader "prefers to focus at the UN on the Palestinian Authority's efforts against Israel rather than fight against calls for terrorism in the Autonomy under his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="15">Danon, as the agencies note, did not refer to Netanyahu's announced annexation of occupied Palestinian lands.</seg>

<seg id="1">PLN 105 million for video game companies from the National Centre for Research and Development</seg>
<seg id="2">Almost PLN 105 million of funding will go to companies from the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Friday, the National Centre for Research and Development announced the results of the third edition of GameINN.</seg>
<seg id="4">Among the nearly 30 projects supported by the National Centre for Research and Development (NCBR) were the development of a platform for developing field games based on an AR game engine creating a map of the real world with an application enabling the transfer of data by users; a test and training platform for verifying practical skills in the workplace and professional development using VR and AI technologies; an innovative game simulating the management of real production processes using an innovative gameplay model based on the interaction of the virtual world with the real world using the concept of Industry 4.0 - reported the NCBR release sent to PAP on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="5">The aim of the GameINN sector programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish sector of video game producers on the global market in the perspective of 2023.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the National Centre for Research and Development (NCBR), the Polish video game sector is already growing at an annual rate of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 amounted to PLN 1.85 billion, and the forecast for 2019 was 2.23 billion.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The specially prepared GameINN research agenda and already reaching PLN 300 million support for entrepreneurs under this sector program constitute a significant impetus for further, dynamic growth of the Polish gamedev," reads the release.</seg>
<seg id="9">The video game industry is an excellent example of effective use of the potential at our disposal in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The incentives introduced by the government for entrepreneurs focusing on innovation, such as R &amp; D relief, competence improvement programmes, IP box or support programmes implemented by the National Centre for Research and Development (NCBR) drive innovative activities of companies and allow them to compete more effectively in a very competitive market," says Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the release.</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of the Ministry of Science points out that money for innovation not only goes to innovators in the form of financing projects, but also stays in their pockets - three quarters more entrepreneurs benefited from R &amp; D relief in 2018 than a year earlier.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The amount of deducted costs concerning R &amp; D activities amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, which resulted in over PLN 300 million in savings for companies benefiting from this relief.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is the equivalent of the support provided by the NCBR in three editions of GameINN, "emphasizes the Deputy Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Director of the National Centre for Research and Development, Dr. Wojciech Kamieniecki, reminds that 78 innovative projects were awarded in two previous competitions with a total value of over PLN 211.2 million.</seg>
<seg id="15">The huge interest in the 3rd competition and the variety of applications submitted show that the video game industry has ideas and competences to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It is particularly pleasing that among the selected projects - as in previous editions - there are projects concerning solutions not only for entertainment, but also related to industry 4.0," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the third GameINN competition, entrepreneurs, consortia of entrepreneurs and consortia of entrepreneurs with scientific units could apply for funding of up to PLN 20 million.</seg>
<seg id="18">The NCBR received 87 applications for the total amount of co-financing approx. PLN 317 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">The budget of the competition at the time of the announcement of the competition was PLN 100 million, but was increased, thanks to which 27 projects were awarded almost PLN 105 million in funding.</seg>
<seg id="20">Detailed information about the results of the 3rd GameINN competition is available at ncbr.gov.pl.</seg>
<seg id="21">The GameINN sector programme is implemented under the Smart Growth Operational Programme.</seg>
<seg id="22">NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs associated in the Polish Games Agreement, which includes such companies as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team and 11 bit studios.</seg>

<seg id="3">Dolberg, who arrived in Nice from Ajax at the end of August, realized after training that his watch had disappeared from the dressing room.</seg>
<seg id="4">Not just any, because it is worth EUR 70 000.</seg>
<seg id="5">An angry Danish man did not attend classes the next day, explaining his stomach problems.</seg>
<seg id="6">The matter was mysterious from the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="7">Footballers in the locker room have private safes at their disposal and the club area is monitored.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to AFP, Diaby-Fadiga eventually confessed to the theft.</seg>
<seg id="9">The 18-year-old has already apologized to Dolberg and other teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.</seg>
<seg id="10">He also promised to return the money for his watch.</seg>
<seg id="11">Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising players of the young generation in France.</seg>

<seg id="14">He recently signed a professional contract, but - according to the newspaper L'Equipe - the club will probably terminate him with immediate effect.</seg>

<seg id="2">Tehran did not enter into talks with the American side during the UN General Assembly in New York, despite the American offer to lift sanctions, Iranian President Hassan Rowhani said on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">US President Donald Trump commented that it was the Iranian side that asked for the restrictions to be lifted, which he did not agree to.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Iranian President Hassan Rowhani, the Americans proposed lifting all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for negotiations on a new international agreement.</seg>
<seg id="5">It would regulate both Iran's nuclear program and its ballistic missile program.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rowhani: Iran will not engage in maximum pressure talks</seg>
<seg id="7">The Iranian president stated that he did not agree to these talks because of the "toxic atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="8">He stated that he met with American diplomats because he succumbed to the urging of France, Germany and Great Britain.</seg>
<seg id="9">He stressed, however, that Iran would not engage in talks in an atmosphere of "maximum pressure."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in the 5 + 1 format, nobody can predict what the end result will be," Rowhani said.</seg>
<seg id="11">A day earlier, the Iranian leader said he did not rule out talks with the US, and the European parties to the nuclear agreement accused him of favouring US sanctions on Iran.</seg>
<seg id="12">He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran after the US withdrawal from the nuclear agreement "are a precondition that does not allow" the establishment of dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="13">If we can lift this precondition and if America lifts sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America, "he declared.</seg>
<seg id="14">He added that he did not rule out meeting with US President Donald Trump, despite the fact that he did not agree to such a conversation last week during the UN General Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="15">Trump: "Iran asked, I said no"</seg>
<seg id="16">Donald Trump tweeted that he had rejected the Iranian request.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.</seg>
<seg id="18">Of course, I said 'no!' vetoed the US President.</seg>
<seg id="19">Tension with nuclear agreement in the background</seg>
<seg id="20">France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to ease tensions between Washington and Tehran in some form to save the 2015 agreement with Iran, of which they were signatories.</seg>
<seg id="21">It stated that in return for the lifting of economic sanctions, Iran would abandon its nuclear weapons programme and put the nuclear sector under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).</seg>
<seg id="22">Since the US withdrawal from the agreement in May 2015, the remaining signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to keep the agreement in force.</seg>
<seg id="23">Nothing has come of it yet.</seg>
<seg id="24">Washington is using tactics to exert maximum pressure on Iran, and sanctions also include a full embargo on Iranian oil.</seg>
<seg id="25">Tehran has announced that if it does not receive a permit to export raw materials, it will limit its obligations under the agreement every 60 days.</seg>

<seg id="1">A judge of the Provincial Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of hejterka Emilia, who - according to her words and screenshots from WhatsApp - participated in stalking against the judges, was reinstated on Wednesday by the Supreme Administrative Court.</seg>
<seg id="2">The reason: disciplinary proceedings have not been initiated against him, so there is no basis for upholding the order of the president of the Provincial Administrative Court Wojciech Mazur to remove him from his duties.</seg>
<seg id="3">Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary spokesman at the Supreme Administrative Court, opened an investigation against Szmydt at the end of August, but it has not yet turned into proceedings against him.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although the Supreme Administrative Court, which in such cases acts as a disciplinary court, must deal with the decision of the president of the Provincial Administrative Court within one month of its issuance.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this situation, the judge, who publicly talked about his wife's mental problems in order to discredit her, who due to suspicions of participating in the hejter group was removed from the office of the National Court Register, will return to adjudication and will pass judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.</seg>
<seg id="6">Judge Szmydt denies his involvement in the hejter group.</seg>
<seg id="7">He claims that there is no evidence of this except falsified screenshots and the words of his wife, with whom he is divorced.</seg>
<seg id="8">Exactly the same is claimed by the other judges associated with 'Caste': everyone is innocent, there is no evidence.</seg>
<seg id="9">And quite possibly they will bet on their own.</seg>
<seg id="10">Because the prosecution did not nodd its finger to secure evidence from their electronic media, it is also silent about the contents of the phone of Emilia Szmydt, who stopped the phone in June in another case.</seg>
<seg id="11">The police did not nodd their finger to secure the devices of people whom Judge Waldemar Żurek pointed out as persecutors in a February report.</seg>
<seg id="12">There is no evidence - there is no Szmydt case, there is no "Caste" case.</seg>
<seg id="13">There is also no case of the head of NIK Marian Banasia about renting a tenement house to pimps and hiding income.</seg>
<seg id="14">CBA checks his property declarations.</seg>
<seg id="15">And he will check when he checks.</seg>
<seg id="16">Whereas the Committee on Parliamentary Ethics will not deal with Banas, because the Sejm is suspended (but the Committee of State Control somehow met to make a bizarre decision to dismiss Banasia's deputies and appoint him as acting lawyer, although the law does not provide for such a strange combination).</seg>
<seg id="17">The whole thing reminds me of a film novella, American probably, about how the wife comes home and finds her husband with her lover in bed.</seg>
<seg id="18">She is so amazed and devastated that she cannot choke out a word.</seg>
<seg id="19">She stands in the door speechless, and during this time her lover quickly jumps out of bed, dresses and leaves.</seg>
<seg id="20">And the husband cuts the bed.</seg>
<seg id="21">When the wife regains her voice and shouts: what is it supposed to be?</seg>
<seg id="22">Who is this woman?</seg>
<seg id="23">Her husband calmly asks: what kind of woman, darling?</seg>
<seg id="24">Only that in the case of "Caste" or Banasia there is a parody of the state.</seg>
<seg id="25">And that's not funny at all.</seg>

<seg id="8">In January, Super Express reported that 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki was examined at the Military Hospital in Wrocław.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I experienced strange, disturbing symptoms and reported to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="10">It turned out that I had jaundice.</seg>
<seg id="11">But the worst thing was before me.</seg>
<seg id="12">When a CT scan was performed, it was stated that I had pancreatic cancer..., "said the Prime Minister's father.</seg>
<seg id="13">A few days later, in the hospital of the Ministry of Interior and Administration in Warsaw, Kornel Morawiecki underwent a major operation.</seg>
<seg id="14">As Morawiecki said, president Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain priest Zbigniew Kras to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="15">The operation lasted about three hours and was successful.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I know that many people have prayed for me, for which I thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="17">Fortunately, I have no metastasis.</seg>
<seg id="18">I do not yet know if I will undergo chemotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="20">For now, after this difficult operation, I have to return to some state of use.</seg>
<seg id="21">I hope that everything will be fine, "said Kornel Morawiecki in an interview with" SE "in January.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Power of Oława Jumps.</seg>
<seg id="2">The title of coverage of amateur sports competitions, held on the Sunday afternoon of 15 September on the hippodrome at Oleandry Street in Oława, may be misleading for some.</seg>
<seg id="3">The road to true power is far away, but this is what one of the types of horse rivalry is called...</seg>
<seg id="4">The power of jumping competition consists in overcoming higher and higher obstacles by the rider and horse, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed even two meters.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is worth mentioning that the long-standing and still unbeaten world record, set in 1949 by the Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on horse "Huaso," is 247 cm.</seg>
<seg id="6">Of course, nobody jumped so high in Oława, but the result of the best local amazons at the level of 135 cm is also not the worst...</seg>
<seg id="7">The competition organized by the tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other activists of JKS "W siodle," constituted a demonstration part of the slightly earlier "Rainbow equestrian competition," about which we write more broadly in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.</seg>
<seg id="8">Eight amazons entered the competition, training horse riding in Oława JKS.</seg>
<seg id="9">Four competed on squatting and four on large horses.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the first group the best performed was Nikola Szołdra, riding the crazy "Sprinter."</seg>
<seg id="11">This small but very dynamic steed started by overcoming obstacles spread at a height of 40 cm, and finished only at the station with the upper beam 125 cm away from the ground.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he did not surrender easily and only after three consecutive refusals was he removed from the competition by the jury.</seg>
<seg id="13">Second place in pony jumping was taken by Amelia Pawlak, riding "Famy," and third by Lena Boruń on "Harmider."</seg>
<seg id="14">Ambitiously fought the youngest participant of the tournament - Inga Aksman, galloping and jumping over obstacles on the little mare "Carmen."</seg>
<seg id="15">Even greater emotions accompanied the starting amazons and spectators during the competition with the participation of large horses.</seg>
<seg id="16">Dangerous looking falls included Paulina Szewczyk, riding the "Declaration" and Anastasia Abramenko, who was riding on "Lotka."</seg>
<seg id="17">Fortunately, apart from minor bruises, nothing bad happened to the amazons or horses, so they continued to participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="18">A lot of problems with introducing the young mare "Wineta" to the parkur had Weronika Łuczkiewicz riding her.</seg>
<seg id="19">You needed either an assistance from a trainer or another horse for a couple, behind which a little crazy "Wineta" slipped.</seg>
<seg id="20">After passing the obstacle from the parkour she also went full shaft, so at times in the boxes and on the expansion plant it was dangerous. "Everything is under control!," reassured Jan Sienkiewicz a little frightened spectators, especially the youngest ones.</seg>
<seg id="21">From the beginning of the competition big horses did a great job on the parkour Marta Masalska, sitting down beautifully presenting "Whisky."</seg>
<seg id="22">This dignified mare, paired with an experienced amazon, after the second attempt in the final stage was the first to jump 135 cm and it was the best result of the competition at that moment.</seg>
<seg id="23">After a while, however, the same height was also included by Paulina Szewczyk on "Declaration," Weronika Łuczkiewicz on "Wineta" and Anastasia Abramenko on "Lotka."</seg>
<seg id="24">To decorate the flo and after receiving prizes in the form of equestrian equipment all these competitors left together, and finally together with the amazons on the ponies in the tact of Radecki's march made an impressive round of honour, ending it with these interesting and exciting competitions.</seg>
<seg id="25">Thanks</seg>
<seg id="26">Equestrian Sports Club "W Siodle" would like to thank the sponsors of the powerful jump competition during the 16th "Rainbow Equestrian Competition": the Municipal Office in Oława, the Water Supply and Sewerage Plant in Oława, the District Office and the company "Mustang."</seg>

<seg id="2">KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko is the name of the electoral committee under which the political formation # R Revolution of Mariusz Max Kolonka was to go to the October parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="3">The revolution directed its proposal especially to young voters with right-wing views.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the election Kolonko announced cooperation with Marek Jakubiak or Paweł Kukiz, but none of these coalitions took place, and KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko himself did not even manage to collect enough signatures to issue lists in any constituency in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now Kolonko announced on Twitter that he has ended his cooperation with KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I will expect the above-mentioned KWW to remove my name from the name.</seg>
<seg id="7">I kindly ask you not to connect my person with the above-mentioned entity, "he added and announced that more information will be provided soon.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is not yet known whether the journalist will continue his activities, or whether this is the end of the # R Revolution formation.</seg>
<seg id="9">On July 4, American Independence Day, journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko announced the creation of a new political formation - # R Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="10">In recent years, Kolonko has become famous for hosting the Max TV channel on YouTube, where he comments on events in Poland and around the world.</seg>
<seg id="11">"We have had enough of politicians, enough of your foolish games, enough of your amateur governments.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is time for the authorities in the country to take over the Nation and rule for the good of the Nation, "Kolonko said then.</seg>
<seg id="13">The party's agenda included issues concerning the judiciary (it should be elected in general elections), tax changes (equating the tax-free amount for all), war reparations (in the form of military aid to the countries of the eastern flank of NATO, with particular emphasis on Poland), holding a referendum on gun ownership, limiting the number of deputies or introducing single-member constituencies.</seg>
<seg id="14">A few days after the announcement of the new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko entered talks with Marek Jakubiak.</seg>
<seg id="15">At the end of July, Kolonko posted on his social media page suggesting that # R would join forces with the Kukiz '15 movement.</seg>

<seg id="2">"The euro exchange rate will remain around the ceiling of PLN 4.35 in the coming months, accompanied by a weak economic situation in global markets," announces Michael Bolliger from UBS Wealth Management.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Expectations of maintaining a solid pace of economic growth and stable monetary policy speak in favour of stabilization of the zloty at the current ceiling," says the specialist in an interview with Bankier.pl.</seg>
<seg id="4">In his opinion, despite clear inflationary pressure, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide to increase rates in an environment in which the vast majority of central banks soften policy.</seg>
<seg id="5">"While the zloty is properly valued - the euro quotations should remain around the ceiling of PLN 4.35 in the coming months - according to him, Polish bonds are not very attractive.</seg>
<seg id="6">Emerging market bonds offer much more favourable yields than Polish securities, "says Michael Bolliger, head of emerging market asset allocation at UBS Wealth Management.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the downturn in the world.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The global slowdown may deepen further, but there should be no severe recession, and at most GDP growth slightly below zero," announces Michael Bolliger.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Investors should underweight global equities, which may be harmed by the lack of prospects for resolving the US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including the impeachment procedure of Donald Trump and Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among equity markets, Europe should behave relatively weakly, "according to a recent letter to investors by UBS Wealth Management Chief Executive Mark Haefele.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Shares from euro area countries should behave worse than American ones, because they are more susceptible amid heightened uncertainty around global trade and fears of a slowdown," the document reads.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to Michael Bolliger, after the boom in the bond markets of the safest countries pushed the yields of the German 10-year-old to minus 0.74%, it is still possible to deepen the decline in profitability.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, in the long term, the profitability of long-term securities should no longer fall, but only short-term securities, thanks to the easing of banks' monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Fed has the biggest room for rate cuts, which should lead to a weakening of the US currency in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="15">The long-term equilibrium point for the euro is the ceiling of USD 1.29, which would mean a 19% potential for strengthening the single currency to the dollar.</seg>
<seg id="16">We expect further Fed rate cuts, which will result in a narrowing of monetary policy differences around the world.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Current and budget deficits may not allow the dollar to maintain its strength in the long term," announces Michael Bolliger.</seg>

<seg id="4">The news was reported by the media group RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).</seg>

<seg id="7">In addition, 30 barrels are missing for MG3 machine guns.</seg>
<seg id="8">Vice-President of the Left Party, Martina Renner, expressed concern about the situation.</seg>
<seg id="9">As the RND told reporters, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is "alarming."</seg>

<seg id="11">Martina Renner summarized the effects of these actions as a "miserable balance sheet."</seg>

<seg id="4">Japan Airlines has recently used a feature designed for people for whom travelling in the company of a crying child is a nightmare.</seg>

<seg id="8">The BBC reports that the airline has already reported imperfections in this solution.</seg>
<seg id="9">The "child icon" will not appear when the ticket has been booked by a third party or if the aircraft has been changed at the last minute.</seg>
<seg id="10">As you might expect, the idea divided Internet users.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some Twitter users point out that the problem of travelling with crying children can be solved with noise-cancelling headphones.</seg>

<seg id="2">More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not arrive on holiday to Majorca in October as a result of the bankruptcy declared on Monday by the travel agency Thomas Cook.</seg>
<seg id="3">As the representative of the autonomous government of the Balearic Islands, Marc Pons, said on Friday, among the 25,000 holidaymakers who will not be able to take their October holiday in Majorca, there are also people who were supposed to travel with companies indirectly linked to Thomas Cook, such as Neckermann.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pons explained that 80% of expected holidaymakers who had to give up their holiday in Majorca next month due to the bankruptcy of the British company are citizens of Germany and the Scandinavian countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, according to Pons, due to the fact that Thomas Cook did not direct tourists to the Balearic island between November and April, the losses to the local economy will be smaller.</seg>
<seg id="6">He revealed that the Balearic government had already started negotiations with international operators about "entering the Majorca market" after the bankruptcy of the British operator.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to estimates by the Diario de Mallorca newspaper, more than 1,000 people will lose their jobs in October due to the tourism crisis in Majorca.</seg>
<seg id="8">About 800 were made redundant employees of the Thomas Cook office in Palma.</seg>
<seg id="9">Other people will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Monday, with Thomas Cook declaring bankruptcy in many Majorca hotels, the owners of the properties demanded that guests pay an additional fee for the accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="11">This situation was experienced, among others, by several dozen tourists from Poland.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Balearic government estimates that by Thursday, dozens of hotels in Majorca had suspended operations until at least the end of October due to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook and its cooperating companies.</seg>
<seg id="13">Friday's Diario de Ibiza newspaper indicates that the majority of hotels operating in Ibiza that have worked with the Thomas Cook group do not intend to close outlets in the coming weeks.</seg>
<seg id="14">The newspaper reminds us that on this Balearic island the British bankrupt cooperated with 42 hotels.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Wednesday, the autonomous Balearic authorities announced that they would ask the Spanish government to support the region with €100 million to cover the losses caused by the declaration of bankruptcy by the travel agency Thomas Cook.</seg>
<seg id="16">They revealed that the largest number of tourists affected in the archipelago, about 36,000 people, are in Majorca.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to data from the Balearic government, Thomas Cook is in arrears with local tourism companies, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of contracts for the July-September 2019 period of approximately €5 million.</seg>

<seg id="2">Tens of thousands of people from across Senegal gathered in the capital on Friday for the inauguration of a huge mosque, considered the largest in West Africa.</seg>
<seg id="3">Muslims arrived by buses, cars and on foot to the Bopp district, where a new mosque was erected, which could hold 30,000 worshippers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The facility was built by the Mouride Brotherhood, belonging to the Sufi trend of Islam, which dominates Senegal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Work on the mosque began ten years ago in a wetland area of six hectares, donated by the government.</seg>
<seg id="6">The name of the mosque Massalikul Jinan ("Paths to Paradise") comes from the title of a poem by Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the 19th-century founder of the fraternity, revered by followers as a saint.</seg>
<seg id="7">The mosque is covered with Carrara marble and has five minarets.</seg>
<seg id="8">The highest point is 78 meters.</seg>
<seg id="9">The mosque in the middle holds 15,000 worshippers, and the second one can stay on the outer esplanade.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the richly finished interiors you can admire the gilded dome, giant chandeliers and decorations handmade by workers from Morocco.</seg>
<seg id="11">Builders claim that the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but the building has no comparison to mosques in other regions anyway.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Morocco, the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca can hold 105,000 worshippers.</seg>
<seg id="13">The construction of the mosque, which cost more than 30 million euros, was financed by private donations.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition to the land, the government funded lighting, sanitation and financed road works worth €10.5 million.</seg>

<seg id="1">Coach Smyła: Our problem is not Silesia, but ourselves</seg>
<seg id="2">Passa of eight league matches without a win Crown players will try to break in Friday's meeting with the vice-leader of the Silesian Ekstraklasa.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Our problem is not Wrocław, but ourselves, we have to work on what we play," emphasized chalice coach Mirosław Smyła.</seg>
<seg id="4">Crown players last and so far the only victory in the league recorded in the first round, when away they beat Benjamin Raków Częstochowa 1-0.</seg>
<seg id="5">Later, they recorded two draws and six defeats, and on Tuesday they lost 1-0 to Zagłębie Lubin in the 1 / 32 final of the Polish Cup.</seg>
<seg id="6">"It makes me optimistic that in the last seconds of the knockout match the players fought for the goal, they wanted to draw.</seg>
<seg id="7">Their fall to the pitch after the final whistle did not result from the breakdown, but it was a fall of anger because they were so close, "said Smyła.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he pointed out, Silesia has very strong wings, so he will sensitize the team to playing in the side sectors of the pitch.</seg>
<seg id="9">"We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we also look at what we want to play," added the coach.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Friday's match in the Crown will definitely not play pausing for excess yellow cards Ognjen Gnjatic, the squad will also miss injured Jakub Żubrowski and Michael Gardawski.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, it is encouraging to register in a knockout match several players with the desire to play.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We have a headache, recently it seemed that it would not be, and now it is," said Smyła.</seg>
<seg id="13">Defender of the Crown Daniel Dziwniel emphasized that Silesia will not be an easy rival to break the streak of eight league matches in a row without a win, while in the Ekstraklasa everyone can win against anyone.</seg>
<seg id="14">"We are a good team.</seg>
<seg id="15">In recent weeks we may not show it on the pitch, but the moment will come that we will win and we believe that it will be on Friday, "said the player.</seg>
<seg id="16">After nine rounds of the Ekstraklasa, the Crown with five points takes 15th position.</seg>
<seg id="17">Silesia accumulated 12 more and placed second.</seg>
<seg id="18">Friday's match in Kielce starts at 8: 30 p.m.</seg>

<seg id="1">These trees can completely disappear from Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">"42% of tree species that make up Europe's stands are threatened," warns the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in its Red List of European Trees published on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the top of the list are, among others, chestnuts and rowan.</seg>
<seg id="4">The IUCN, an organisation based in Gland, Switzerland, publishes a list of endangered European tree species for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was drawn up by specialists who concluded that of the 454 tree species found in Europe (as well as elsewhere in the world), 42% are "highly threatened."</seg>
<seg id="6">Among the reasons, the Red Paper mentions the rapid growth of urban agglomerations and global climate change.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, the most threatened are those trees and shrubs that occur only or mainly on our continent.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to IUCN specialists, 58% of species are threatened and 15%, i.e. 66 species of trees and shrubs, are threatened with extinction.</seg>
<seg id="9">Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red List lists errors in the exploitation of stands, accelerated urbanisation, too intense logging, followed by forest fires and changes in the European ecostystem.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of shrubs, mosses and lichens is also strongly threatened.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The consequences of human activity lead to the gradual disappearance of European plant species and pose a danger in Europe of extinction of important and underestimated varieties that underpin European ecosystems and affect the health of our planet," concluded the report by Luc Bas, who heads the European office of the IUCN.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grzegorz Schetyna: I do not promise 600 +</seg>
<seg id="2">"Today the Law and Justice party wants to bribe Poles by offering them for freedom distribution on credit, which will have to pay off future generations," says Grzegorz Schetyna in an interview for "Rzeczpospolita."</seg>
<seg id="3">In his opinion, "the whole politics of the Law and Justice party is pic."</seg>
<seg id="4">At the same time, the politician promises that 'what is given will not be taken away'.</seg>
<seg id="5">Schetyna assures in an interview with Jacek Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea to defeat Law and Justice.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is about mobilising the electorate at the ballot box.</seg>
<seg id="7">In his opinion, the opposition has more potential in this respect than Kaczynski's party.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today, conscious people who want to live in a normal country are more than supporters of the Law and Justice party, a party which betrayed the proclaimed values, such as modesty, humility, transparency," says Schetyna.</seg>
<seg id="9">The leader of the Civic Coalition and the chairman of the Civic Platform also emphasized the basic assumptions of the electoral program KO.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Firstly, nothing given will be received, but it is necessary to set a direction for the future, because the Law and Justice party deals only with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which can be seen even after dramatically low investments," he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Secondly, it is about 'launching the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work reliably - and those who are entrepreneurial'.</seg>
<seg id="12">Schetyna explains that the KO program included, among others, a project which will give the least earning Poles more by 614 zlotys per hand, and more earners - also several hundred.</seg>
<seg id="13">The politician also stated that he did not want to race for distribution.</seg>
<seg id="14">As he said, he will do as much as he can do, but he does not promise 600 +.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I will never allow the Greek option, where the rulers bid with the opposition for distribution, until the financial collapse of the country finally occurred," he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="16">Schetyna also stated in an interview with Rz that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We would expose their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Pride walks before the fall.</seg>
<seg id="19">Kaczynski is such a statesman as Banaś is crystal, "he added.</seg>

<seg id="2">Six dead great condors have been found in the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, TVN24 reports.</seg>
<seg id="3">Specialists believe that human activity contributed to their deaths.</seg>
<seg id="4">Great condors were probably poisoned to kill predators such as cougars, foxes and wild dogs.</seg>
<seg id="5">Animals may have eaten toxic carcasses.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition to one young individual, the rest of the dead condors were adults.</seg>
<seg id="7">"This is a big loss for the environment, because the condor must reach 10-15 years to become fertile and able to reproduce.</seg>
<seg id="8">So we are losing a protected species, an endangered species, "says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentine environmental organisation.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I think the use of toxic bait and poison puts not only this species in danger, but all other forms of life, including human health," he adds.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Rz": They want a jewel for the President</seg>
<seg id="2">Work has begun on granting the head of state a precious chain.</seg>
<seg id="3">The idea was supported by the office of Andrzej Duda - we read in 'Rzeczpospolita'.</seg>
<seg id="4">As the newspaper explains, it concerns the golden chain of the Order of the White Eagle, the royal insignia officially called in the interwar period the jewel of the Republic of Poland.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was last used by President Ignacy Mościcki.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Rz" says that soon such a chain may hit the shoulders of Andrzej Duda.</seg>
<seg id="7">On Wednesday, the Senate Committee on Human Rights, the Rule of Law and Petitions voted to work on an amendment to the Orders and Decorations Act in order to reinstate it.</seg>
<seg id="8">The newspaper writes that this is not the first attempt to restore this chain to the head of state.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Senate had already proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it was lost by one vote.</seg>
<seg id="10">This time the work is rapid.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the beginning of August, the senators devoted a few minutes to the matter, acknowledging that they would consult the Chancellery of the President.</seg>

<seg id="2">The police action will be carried out, among others, at the intersection of Cieplińskiego Avenue with Piłsudskiego Avenue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Uniformed actions are somehow connected with recent complaints of the city authorities about drivers who are not always able to behave properly at the intersection.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Friday, 27 September, police officers begin preventive actions in Rzeszów "Passable intersections."</seg>
<seg id="5">The aim is to eliminate traffic congestion: entering an intersection without the possibility of exiting, not following traffic signals or road signs.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We often think that we are alone at the intersection, and in fact we make life difficult for other drivers," said Marek Ustrobiński, the vice-president of the city a few days ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">His words were echoed at a press conference of the town hall, where the city authorities presented examples of inadequate movement of cars at intersections, which in effect creates traffic jams.</seg>
<seg id="8">At that time, the president appealed to travellers for reason on the road and, among others, moving faster at traffic lights or not writing text messages while driving.</seg>
<seg id="9">The subject was somehow taken over by Rzeszów police officers, who from today begin the action "Passable intersections."</seg>
<seg id="10">What is the point?</seg>
<seg id="11">The aim of the measures is to eliminate the phenomenon of reducing passability at intersections by drivers entering them without the possibility of continuing driving.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is a common offence that contributes to the intensification of traffic congestion and the creation of traffic jams.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is threatened with a fine of 300 PLN and 2 penalty points.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, uniforms will pay attention to non-compliance with traffic lights or signs and incorrect parking in the area of intersections.</seg>
<seg id="15">They will also observe a lack of driving smoothness, late movement from under signalling devices, slow passage of intersections and leaving too long distances between vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="16">At what intersections will activities be carried out?</seg>
<seg id="17">Among others, on Lisa-Kuli Street from Jagiellońska Street; Cieplińskiego Avenue from Piłsudskiego Avenue; Targowa Street from Piłsudskiego Avenue; Śreniawitów Square from Dąbrowskiego Street or Hetmańska Street from Powstańców Warszawy Avenue.</seg>

<seg id="7">The last inspection in "Dar-Trans" was carried out by the Provincial Environmental Protection Inspectorate in Warsaw between 29 December 2015 and 11 February 2016.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was established at that time that the company did not perform sampling, measurement and testing of groundwater, and did not have the results of tests of stabilized municipal sewage sludge from the sewage treatment plant "Czajka."</seg>

<seg id="4">Thus, the senators decided to reject 12 amendments tabled during Wednesday's debate by the Civic Platform senator Sławomir Rybicki.</seg>

<seg id="17">Slovenians were much better than us in this respect, "he analysed.</seg>
<seg id="18">In his opinion, the "White and Red" did not stand in the way of the stress associated with the performance against the co-hosts of the tournament supported by a loud and large audience.</seg>
<seg id="19">He admitted that the world champions could sleep a smooth way to the semi-finals.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Perhaps if we had failed in a similar style in the group stage, we would have analysed this lesson more quickly and then played differently in the later stages of the tournament.</seg>

<seg id="7">He did not play long at the 2019 US Open, but managed to publicly say that ATP activists "are corrupt," which hurt the organization's authorities so much that they implemented a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and after a few weeks gave the verdict about the suspension of starts and another fine.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, words about corruption were forgiven, after listening to the blamed person and getting to know the context of the statement.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the justification, however, tennis activists stated that the investigation showed that Kyrgios' behaviour throughout the past 12 months in many cases raised serious objections and constituted an almost constant violation of the rules that he constantly insulted people associated with tournaments and spectators in a vulgar manner, hence the high penalty.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately postponed the execution of his sentence, ordering several conditions to be met within the next six months: in ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour tournaments, Kyrgios can no longer violate the rules of the code of conduct of professional tennis players, in particular he can no longer curse, destroy rackets, argue with judges and the public, or any other way to behave indecently and vulgar.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was also advised to seek "continuous support" from mental coaches during tournaments and also in the off-season to consult people specializing in solving problems of athletes not coping with proper behavior.</seg>
<seg id="12">The first comment (on social media) by Nick Kyrgios to the verdict was: "Hey everybody, I can still play.</seg>
<seg id="13">I just have to control my behavior, that's all. "</seg>
<seg id="14">In practice, the Australian will have at least a two-week break anyway, as he was exacerbated by a shoulder injury in the Laver Cup, so he had to abandon his next starts in Beijing (30 September - 6 October) and Shanghai (6-13 October).</seg>
<seg id="15">Kyrgios is ranked 27th in the ATP rankings.</seg>
<seg id="16">This year he won two tournaments - in Washington and Acapulco, he earned over $1.3 million, so even after fines he will stay a lot.</seg>

<seg id="1">GUS: Living better and better in Poland</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the report on household budgets published by the Central Statistical Office on Friday, as many as 44% of them assessed their material situation as good or rather good last year.</seg>
<seg id="3">A year earlier, this figure was 37.2%, 33.5% in 2016 and earlier, since 2009, when the statistical office first examined subjective assessments of the situation of households, it has never exceeded 30%.</seg>
<seg id="4">A total of 8.1% of households considered their material situation to be bad or rather bad last year, compared to 11.2% a year earlier and more than 20% in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="5">The material situation of self-employed households is best.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this group, more than 70% of respondents consider it good or rather good.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the other extreme are pensioner households, where the percentage of such responses was only 18%.</seg>
<seg id="8">The subjective assessment of the material situation of households is also strongly influenced by the number of children.</seg>
<seg id="9">The worst is for single parents, of whom 32% declare a good or rather good material situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among couples with children, this figure varies (depending on the number of children) from 55% to 60%, and among childless households it is 48.8%.</seg>
<seg id="11">The effect of the 500 + programme is clearly visible in these statistics.</seg>
<seg id="12">Before it was launched (in 2016), the worst material situation was assessed by single parents and families with many children (with at least three children).</seg>
<seg id="13">The improvement of subjective assessments of the material situation of Poles is a reflection of the rapid growth of income, mainly from work.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, this is not all, because the percentage of households that consider their situation to be good is increasing faster than real incomes.</seg>
<seg id="15">Moreover, at the level of voivodships there is no clear relationship between the level of income and the assessment of material conditions of households.</seg>
<seg id="16">The best assessments are formulated by residents of the Opolskie Voivodeship, where 48.9% of respondents consider their situation to be good or rather good.</seg>
<seg id="17">Next are Lubuskie (47.7%), Śląskie (47.6%), Mazowieckie (47.3%) and Zachodniopomorskie (47.1%).</seg>
<seg id="18">Meanwhile, in Opole, disposable income (i.e. after paying taxes and contributions) was less than 94% of the national average last year, and in Lubuskie 98%.</seg>
<seg id="19">The highest incomes were inhabitants of Mazowiecki (120% of the national average) and Silesia (104%).</seg>
<seg id="20">On average, the disposable income per person in Poland was PLN 1,693 in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="21">In real terms (after adjusting for the impact of price changes) it increased by 4.3% compared to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="22">Compared to previous years, this result is quite low.</seg>
<seg id="23">In 2016, per capita income increased by 7% and a year later by 6.3%.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although revenue growth is slowing down, it also hinders expenditure growth.</seg>
<seg id="25">Those per person amounted to PLN 1187 last year, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7%.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is the first such case since 2013.</seg>
<seg id="27">Expenditure per person increased by 1.9% in real terms in 2017 and by 4.3% in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="28">Surveys of household budgets suggest that a statistical household currently spends 70.1% of its disposable income, compared to 80% in 2014 and above 90% by 2006.</seg>

<seg id="1">Niesiołowski is critical of the pope.</seg>
<seg id="2">John Paul II did nothing</seg>
<seg id="3">In an interview with Piotr Lekszycki, Stefan Niesiołowski emphasized that in 1981 John Paul II was a great authority for opposition activists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Actually, his every opinion was accepted."</seg>
<seg id="5">Some of his actions were subsequently criticized.</seg>
<seg id="6">"For me, the fact that John Paul II could not liquidate the harmful activity of Rydzyk casts a great shadow over his pontificate.</seg>
<seg id="7">After all, this Redemptorist - a pest of the Church and Poland - developed his media into the best during the lifetime of the Polish pope ', he explained.</seg>
<seg id="8">The former politician of the Civic Platform admitted: 'there were murmurs of dissatisfaction, the pope said something, once Rydzyk did not accept, but he had power and for politics he could simply expel him from the Church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor there.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, John Paul II did not do it, similarly his successors, "explained Niesiołowski.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Besides, there was this terrible matter of pedophilia and the actions of the Church, or rather their lack.</seg>
<seg id="11">I ran forward a little bit, but I wanted to draw attention to the whole of his life.</seg>
<seg id="12">We have known about the scale of pedophilia in the Church relatively recently.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question arises as to how it is possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting matters', says Niesiołowski in an interview with a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the opinion of the former politician of the Civic Platform, the Polish Church is an ally of the Law and Justice party.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We must admit that during the period of Solidarity the Church was our most important ally.</seg>
<seg id="16">All celebrations started with Holy Mass, crosses hung everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now these crosses are spelling, they have become a symbol of dictatorship - a sign of the spelling regime.</seg>
<seg id="18">I repeat: one of the biggest unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk are shaking the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing in this matter and that today the Church is an ally of the Law and Justice party.</seg>
<seg id="19">This is a black chapter of the Polish Church, for which he will pay dearly, "Niesiołowski argued.</seg>

<seg id="5">For example, "Lions" will appear next to "L'viv."</seg>
<seg id="6">In our province, changes will be introduced on 94 road signs placed at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.</seg>
<seg id="7">As we hear, it is supposed to be easier, clearer and simpler.</seg>
<seg id="8">The new guidelines result from an amendment to the regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure on detailed technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety equipment.</seg>
<seg id="9">"We should remember that the names of towns in neighbouring countries often have a Polish sound.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thanks to the change in the law prepared by us, they will finally appear on signposts near our roads.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will be necessary to consider whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade," said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, leader of the Agreement Jarosław Gowin on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">During an interview in "Signals of the Day" on Radio Jedynka, Gowin stated that trade is overrun by international networks, which impose such low margins on Polish producers that actually Polish companies cannot develop.</seg>
<seg id="4">Noting that it is very difficult to fight this problem, the deputy prime minister reminded that the government of the Law and Justice party tried to face it at the very beginning of the term of office, but got a 'counter-attack from the EC'.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We have won before the Court of Justice and I hope that if the United Right wins the next elections and forms a government, we will come back to this subject," he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He also noted that "effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish, i.e. small trade."</seg>
<seg id="7">"We will have to consider whether the government, the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade," said Gowin.</seg>
<seg id="8">In May, an EU court found that the European Commission had made a mistake in finding that the Polish retail tax was unauthorised state aid.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Retail Sales Tax Act assumed the introduction of two trade tax rates: 0.8% on revenue between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4% on revenue above PLN 170 million per month.</seg>
<seg id="10">The tax has been in force since September 2016.</seg>
<seg id="11">In September 2016, the European Commission launched infringement proceedings against Poland.</seg>
<seg id="12">Brussels argued at the time that the construction of the tax could favour smaller shops, which could be considered public aid.</seg>
<seg id="13">It subsequently stated that the tribute was implemented in an unlawful manner.</seg>
<seg id="14">It also issued an order suspending the application of the tax pending the completion of its analysis by officials in Brussels.</seg>
<seg id="15">Poland did not agree with this position, but the tax collection was suspended.</seg>
<seg id="16">The decision of the EU court in May opened the way for the reintroduction of the tax, but did not finish the case.</seg>
<seg id="17">On 24 July, the Commission appealed to the Court of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="18">On Thursday, the CJEU press service told PAP that the case is currently at a written stage in which both the European Commission and the Polish government present their arguments in writing.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not yet known whether or when the oral procedure will start, i.e. hearing the parties and a possible hearing.</seg>
<seg id="20">It takes a good few to several months from filing an appeal to the announcement of the judgment.</seg>

<seg id="1">How to dress a child for baptism?</seg>
<seg id="2">We suggest some practical solutions</seg>
<seg id="3">Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of an infant and his parents.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is often the first occasion on which the whole family focuses around the child, celebrating his appearance in the world together.</seg>
<seg id="5">No wonder, then, that newly baked mother and dad want their comfort to look the best on this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, before you make the final decision about your child's costume, consider whether it will also be comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="7">In shops you can find many outfit sets that do not provide the toddler with proper comfort.</seg>
<seg id="8">So what should be noted?</seg>
<seg id="9">The basic criterion for choosing clothes for baptism is the age of the child</seg>
<seg id="10">Until recently, several weeks old toddlers were baptized, arranged in white sets and put into the same barrels or big pillows.</seg>
<seg id="11">Today, children joining the sacrament are often older: several months, one year or even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is not difficult to guess that such a big comfort needs a slightly different clothes for baptism.</seg>
<seg id="13">Therefore, if your child is 3-4 months old on the day of baptism, he will probably spend the ceremony in a wheelchair or in the hands of his parents or godparents.</seg>
<seg id="14">The best solution will be to decorate it in comfortable, cotton sleeping bags or sets.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although this wardrobe element is considered an everyday outfit, it is enough to search for its festive variants, for example with a frill or lace.</seg>
<seg id="16">For the boy, a body printed with flies and braces will prove ideal.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the case of older children, you can afford more fantasy in clothing.</seg>
<seg id="18">The little girl will look lovely in a simple, tulle dress</seg>
<seg id="19">Many parents of girls longingly look towards richly decorated, falbaniastic baptism dresses complete with coats, armbands and hats.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers use artificial, non-breathable materials in which the child is simply uncomfortable.</seg>
<seg id="21">In search of the right clothes, it will be better to look at the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant outfits on cotton linings.</seg>
<seg id="22">Delicate tulle skirts, satin dresses, lace, apps and charming sets will make your daughter look beautiful and feel comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="23">Perfect outfit for a little gentleman: cotton suit</seg>
<seg id="24">Until recently, among parents of boys there was a fashion for suits being a copy of "adult" models.</seg>
<seg id="25">Polyester jackets and trousers, rigid collars or coughs often made young elegants loudly demonstrate their dissatisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="26">Today, fortunately, they have been replaced by comfortable, cotton sets.</seg>
<seg id="27">Just look at the sets available in Asanti for Kids, i.e. soft, tracksuit shorts, and a blouse decorated at the front in the pattern of a vest.</seg>
<seg id="28">These costumes look extremely festive, and at the same time do not hinder the movements of the toddler getting to know the world.</seg>

<seg id="2">British MPs voted against a three-day break in the House of Commons for the Conservative Party's annual programme conference, as requested by the government.</seg>
<seg id="3">There were 289 votes in favour, 306 against.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is customary for the House of Commons not to meet during party conferences so that Members do not have to resign either from them or from parliamentary sessions.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, the opposition parties considered that at such a crucial time as the last weeks before the planned exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 31 October, the parliament should not interrupt the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="6">There were 289 votes in favour of the government's request for a break, 306 against.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two opposition parties after the conventions</seg>
<seg id="8">The lack of consent to the break may be perceived as political revenge of the opposition on Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday the decision was declared unlawful and non-existent by the Supreme Court) and for not wanting to apologize for it after the judges' ruling.</seg>
<seg id="9">Following this ruling, the House of Commons resumed its session on Wednesday, and the most important event of the day was Johnson's speech and the subsequent heated debate.</seg>
<seg id="10">Johnson accused the opposition of blocking Brexit and avoiding early elections.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It is time to deliver Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="12">It must be implemented in order to respect the outcome of the referendum.</seg>
<seg id="13">Brexit must come so that we can deal with an agreement on citizens' priorities, on health care, on the cost of living.</seg>
<seg id="14">Brexit must be delivered so that we can unite this country, "Johnson said.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Conservative Party Conference is due to start in Manchester this Sunday and run until Wednesday 2 October.</seg>
<seg id="16">The conferences of the two main opposition groups - Labour and the Liberal Democrats - have already taken place.</seg>
<seg id="17">One of the justifications given by Johnson in explaining such a long suspension of parliament was precisely party conferences.</seg>

<seg id="5">Moreover, his subtenant was to run a sex business in the aforementioned tenement house (i.e. rent rooms for hours).</seg>

<seg id="7">Bertold Kittel pointed out irregularities in the program "Superwizjer."</seg>

<seg id="9">The clients were to be men using the services of prostitutes.</seg>
<seg id="10">Banaś answered the allegations vaguely and vaguely.</seg>
<seg id="11">Interestingly, the tenement rented by the pimps led the journalist to discover negligence in the property declarations of Banasia.</seg>
<seg id="12">The building itself was described in them vaguely, and the income from its rental was to be underestimated.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The estate of Marian Banasia and his wife may be worth between 6 and 8 million zlotys.</seg>
<seg id="14">In total, the spouses can boast two houses, three apartments, savings [...], "writes Money.pl.</seg>

<seg id="17">Banaś announced that he would suspend his activities in the National Control Chamber until its completion. "I will apply to the Marshal for unpaid leave," he assured.</seg>
<seg id="18">The opposition demands an explanation.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We do not hear that the CBA has expanded its investigation or accelerated the examination of Marian Banasia's property declarations.</seg>
<seg id="20">Therefore, we are forced to hand out the organs of the state and submit a notification about the possibility of committing a crime [...], "said the Civic Platform MP Mariusz Witczak.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If a normal Pole valued the rental of his properties so grossly low, he would already have 10 checks, tax adjustments and criminal-fiscal proceedings," he added.</seg>
<seg id="22">He went high, fell low</seg>
<seg id="23">Marian Banaś is the new president of the Supreme Chamber of Control.</seg>
<seg id="24">He was appointed to this position on 30 August 2019 for a six-year term.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the newspaper, disregard for a certain behaviour order issued by a police officer is to be a new type of offence, threatened with a fine, arrest or restriction of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="3">Police trade unionists want such a change.</seg>
<seg id="4">The idea went to the Sejm Committee on Petitions.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The case is serious, because already every year more than half a million misdemeanor cases are brought before Polish courts," we read.</seg>
<seg id="6">'Rzeczpospolita 'has established that the petition which the Independent Trade Union of Police Officers writes to MPs concerning the amendment of the code of offences has a chance of success.</seg>
<seg id="7">The petitioners propose a new wording of Article 54a of the Code of Misconduct.</seg>
<seg id="8">It would read: 'Whoever does not comply with the request or order of a public official, issued within the limits and on the basis of the provisions of the Act, shall be punishable by arrest, fine or restriction of freedom'.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Paragraph 3 of this provision speaks of an identical punishment for those who, without executing orders, will prevent or hinder the performance of a business activity," the journal says.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski told "Rzeczpospolita" that although he agrees with the main message of the proposal of the provision, he fears that if implemented, it could be used in matters of political demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="11">"In situations of freedom demonstrations, it would be disadvantageous and instead of alleviating the situation, it would even exacerbate it," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to statistics provided by the newspaper, 86% of citizens welcomed police interventions in 2018 and 1.5 million interventions in the city each month.</seg>

<seg id="2">Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook has collapsed, its Belgian subsidiary Neckermann operates.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the company has problems.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to VRT, Brussels Airlines announced that it would cancel 105 flights in October due to Thomas Cook's bankruptcy problems.</seg>
<seg id="5">Neckermann also laid off 75 employees.</seg>
<seg id="6">All trips with the office that have been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but holidaymakers will be able to receive a refund.</seg>
<seg id="7">The court in Ghent also declared the bankruptcy of three Belgian subsidiaries: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.</seg>
<seg id="8">Currently, approximately 12 thousand Belgians are abroad on trips bought from Thomas Cook.</seg>
<seg id="9">Another 40,000 people were expected to leave the office by the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later on Monday, Thomas Cook Belgium spokeswoman Leen Segers said the company was now "fully operational" despite being declared bankrupt by its British parent company, which caused concern among employees and customers.</seg>
<seg id="11">The office reassured that customers who bought trips in it would go on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thomas Cook - the oldest and one of the largest travel agencies in the world - declared bankruptcy on Sunday night.</seg>
<seg id="13">The immediate cause of the bankruptcy was the collapse of last-chance talks with creditors and potential investors on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="14">The creditors demanded that, in addition to the £900 million rescue plan already agreed in August, the company gain an additional 200 million as collateral for the winter, when travel agencies tend to have lower turnover.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, the company's problems have been growing for several years, resulting in a debt of up to £1.6 billion.</seg>

<seg id="2">Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion - such an unusual offer was prepared for the newcomers of the German Görlitz.</seg>
<seg id="3">The measures are intended to help combat the ongoing decline in the number of inhabitants of the city.</seg>
<seg id="4">Görlitz is the easternmost city in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="5">The beautiful pastel old town attracts 140 thousand tourists every year.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, according to The Guardian, the city is struggling with significant problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Görlitz has the lowest wages in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">The city is also struggling with a steady loss of population.</seg>
<seg id="9">After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them left for the west of the country, resulting in a 25% decline in the city's population.</seg>
<seg id="10">In 2013, it had a population of 54,000.</seg>
<seg id="11">In order to combat the depopulation, officials came up with the idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.</seg>
<seg id="12">So far, 150 proposals have been submitted to the programme.</seg>
<seg id="13">Two-thirds of them were inhabitants of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="14">People from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom were also interested in the programme.</seg>
<seg id="15">"When we applied, we thought the program was to convince people to move to Görlitz," said one of the project participants.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Now we feel it doesn't matter if we stay here after four weeks or not," he added.</seg>
<seg id="17">The city has seven thousand vacant apartments, and unemployment is three times higher than the average in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="18">Although the city authorities hope that some will move permanently, the main objective of the programme is to obtain the opinions of the participants.</seg>
<seg id="19">Information gathered from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revive smaller German cities.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We want to know more about what people need and, if they decide to move, what their motivation was," said Robert Knippschild, responsible for the program.</seg>
<seg id="21">Other cities have already experimented with ideas to lure new residents, offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first was Detroit, which introduced a program to pay promising young professionals to live and work in the city for a year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy, or in the American Tulsa, Oklahoma.</seg>
