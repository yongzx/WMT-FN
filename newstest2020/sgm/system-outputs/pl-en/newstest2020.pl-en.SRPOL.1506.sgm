<seg id="1">Father Józef Witko: I saw Jesus in a white robe</seg>
<seg id="2">He is charismatic.</seg>
<seg id="3">Masses celebrated by him for liberation and healing attract crowds.</seg>
<seg id="4">He was a teenager when inexplicable things began to happen in his life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Today, through the Franciscan, others are experiencing it.</seg>
<seg id="6">Masses celebrated by Fr. Witko for liberation and healing attract crowds</seg>
<seg id="7">Once the parents of a 7-month-old child came to him, who had a 7.5 mm hole in his heart.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was to be operated on.</seg>
<seg id="9">Father Józef Witko prayed over him.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the same day, the boy was taken to the hospital for surgery.</seg>
<seg id="11">Astonished doctors said: "The operation is not needed, the loss is only 1.5 mm."</seg>
<seg id="12">My parents were crying with happiness.</seg>
<seg id="13">After another prayer of the Franciscan, the hole disappeared completely.</seg>
<seg id="14">The clergyman began experiencing the extraordinary actions of the Creator as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="15">In his dreams, the souls of purgatory came to him asking for help.</seg>
<seg id="16">I was woken up at night and urged to pray for the dead and those who were dying at the moment," he recalls.</seg>
<seg id="17">He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.</seg>
<seg id="18">And he had a vision of what happens to a man who commits a mortal sin.</seg>
<seg id="19">"My body started to change.</seg>
<seg id="20">I lost my human qualities and started to take on the appearance of an animal," he says.</seg>
<seg id="21">An invisible force was lifting him up, he couldn't get his voice out.</seg>
<seg id="22">He felt he was lost.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then God told him to save himself.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Immersed in the waters of the river symbolizing Baptism, I was freed and returned to human form...," he says.</seg>
<seg id="25">He told no one about these strange experiences.</seg>
<seg id="26">His calling was ripe.</seg>
<seg id="27">He was 16 years old when he joined the Franciscans.</seg>
<seg id="28">In his sermons he wanted not only to talk about Jesus.</seg>
<seg id="29">He wanted people to experience him alive.</seg>
<seg id="30">Members of the Charismatic Community of Renewal in the Holy Spirit</seg>
<seg id="31">Masses for healing celebrated by Witko's father are attended by many people who hope to get rid of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="32">The cleric emphasizes, however, that their main goal is spiritual healing, not physical healing.</seg>

<seg id="1">First defeat of Kolping FRAC Jarosław</seg>
<seg id="2">This afternoon (September 26th) Kolping FRAC team deservedly succumbed at home to the current Polish champion Dartom Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki as part of the 3rd round of LOTTO Table Tennis Super League.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Jaroslawians, in such a personal combination, which they presented with the Grodziszczans, have little chance of victories against the league's sovereigns.</seg>
<seg id="4">The match against Dartom Bogoria clearly showed that.</seg>
<seg id="5">The team's leader, Chen Jingqi, is still missing.</seg>
<seg id="6">Perhaps with him in the squad, the Jaroslawians would reach for a third consecutive triumph in the new season.</seg>
<seg id="7">The young Asian Qiyao Han has probably not yet grown up to win against the likes of the Greek Panagiotis Gionis and the Czech Pavel Sirucek.</seg>
<seg id="8">Not even with one of the most promising Poles, that is, Marek Badowski.</seg>
<seg id="9">The player from Hellada was the biggest star of the duel in the MOSiR hall at Sikorskiego Street in Jarosław.</seg>
<seg id="10">Against both Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei, he was a class of his own.</seg>
<seg id="11">After three bouts, Kolping FRAC led 2-1.</seg>
<seg id="12">Kou Lei confidently outplayed Marek Badowski and Daniel Górak after a thrilling five-set fight – Pavel Siruck.</seg>
<seg id="13">But then it got worse.</seg>
<seg id="14">Gionis gave Lea no chance.</seg>
<seg id="15">One could still hope for a two-point win, but Qiyao Han fell short of Badowski.</seg>

<seg id="1">There will be no additional testing for seniors.</seg>
<seg id="2">Why?</seg>
<seg id="3">As announced by Rafał Trzaskowski, a program of free preventive examinations for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not received the approval of the Ministry of Health and its subordinate Agency for the Protection of Health Technology and Tariff System.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the justification, the agency explained that the target group had been poorly selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The above actions may even result in the detection of individual disease units, which may contribute to exacerbating difficulties in accessing NHF services and negatively affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with a false positive test result," it says.</seg>
<seg id="7">The decision of the ministry is not understood by the president of the capital.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The money is ours, we've provided the money for it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only the government is afraid that if people get tested, they will go to a doctor later, which is absurd, because it is all about leading to a situation in which prophylaxis can be done faster.</seg>
<seg id="10">All specialists know that this helps in terms of the burden on the health system, because it helps in the rapid detection of diseases and in a reliable approach to health.</seg>
<seg id="11">The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand," said Rafał Trzaskowski.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It is difficult for me to imagine that experts say: Let's not examine ourselves, because there will be longer queues at the doctor's, and if such specialists advise the government, I am not surprised that the health service is in such a state," added the Civic Platform politician.</seg>

<seg id="1">Palestine responds to Israel: We will tear up all existing agreements</seg>
<seg id="2">Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas told a session of the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday that he would tear up any agreements reached with Israel if the country's incoming government tried to fulfill Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement to annex occupied Palestinian lands.</seg>
<seg id="3">"If the future Israeli government proceeds to implement this plan, we will rescind all agreements signed (with Israel) and withdraw from all commitments made," he announced.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We will completely and completely reject the whole plan," Abbas threatened with emphasis.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It is our duty to defend all our rights by all possible means – no matter what the consequences – by committing ourselves fully to the application of international law and to the fight against terrorism," declared the President of the Palestinian Authority, who had already made similar declarations in July.</seg>
<seg id="6">Netanyahu, Israel's former prime minister, was again tasked with forming a government after the September 17 elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">A week before the election, he announced that if he won, he would announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and intended to include all Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank in Israel.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, then led by Yasser Arafat, signed a series of peace agreements sponsored by the United States.</seg>
<seg id="9">Abbas, 84, also promised during a session of the UN General Assembly to hold general elections in the Palestinian lands.</seg>
<seg id="10">The last was held in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Back home, I will call local elections in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, and all those who oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community," the Palestinian president solemnly declared.</seg>
<seg id="12">In his speech, Abbas defended the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer at the United Nations, to exercise the rights of "full members of the United Nations and all its bodies and institutions."</seg>
<seg id="13">The Palestinian leader ended the speech by calling on the international community to "force Israel to comply with the provisions of the United Nations with full respect."</seg>
<seg id="14">Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas' speech, declaring that the Palestinian leader "would rather focus at the United Nations on the Palestinian Authority's efforts against Israel than fight against calls for terrorism in the Authority under his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="15">But Danon, the agencies note, did not allude to Netanyahu's announced annexation of occupied Palestinian lands.</seg>

<seg id="1">PLN 105 million for video game companies from the National Centre for Research and Development</seg>
<seg id="2">Almost PLN 105 million of funding will go to companies from the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.</seg>
<seg id="3">The National Centre for Research and Development announced on Friday the results of the third edition of the GameINN program.</seg>
<seg id="4">Among the nearly 30 projects supported by the National Centre for Research and Development, there is the development of a platform for creating field games based on the AR game engine that creates a map of the real world with an application that allows users to send data; a test and training platform for verifying practical skills at the workplace and professional development using VR and AI technologies; an innovative game that simulates the management of real production processes using an innovative gameplay model based on the interaction of the virtual world with the real world using the industry 4.0 concept, according to the NCBR release sent to PAP on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="5">The aim of the GameINN sectoral program is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish sector of video game producers on the global market in the perspective of 2023.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the National Centre for Research and Development, the Polish video game sector is already growing at a rate of 10 percent per year.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 amounted to PLN 1.85 billion, while the forecast for 2019 is PLN 2.23 billion.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Specially prepared research agenda of GameINN and already reaching 300 million PLN support for entrepreneurs under this sectoral program are an important impulse for further, dynamic growth of Polish gamedevu," reads the release.</seg>
<seg id="9">The video game industry is an excellent example of effective use of the potential we have in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Incentives introduced by the government for entrepreneurs who focus on innovation, such as R&amp;D incentives, competence improvement programs, IP box or support programs implemented by the National Centre for Research and Development drive innovative activity of companies and allow them to compete more effectively in a very competitive market," says Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the release.</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of the Ministry of Science points out that money for innovation not only goes to innovators in the form of co-financing projects, but also stays in their pockets – three quarters more entrepreneurs benefited from the R&amp;D relief in 2018 than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The amount of deducted costs related to R&amp;D activities amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, which resulted in over PLN 300 million in savings for companies benefiting from this relief.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is the equivalent of the support provided by the National Centre for Research and Development in three editions of GameINN," emphasises the Deputy Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="14">Director of the National Centre for Research and Development Dr. Wojciech Kamieniecki reminds that in two previous co-financing competitions with a total value of over PLN 211.2 million, 78 innovative projects were awarded.</seg>
<seg id="15">Huge interest in the 3rd competition and the diversity of applications show that the video game industry has ideas and competences to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It is particularly pleasing that among the selected projects – as in previous editions – there are projects concerning solutions for not only entertainment, but also related to Industry 4.0," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="17">Entrepreneurs, consortia of entrepreneurs and consortia of entrepreneurs with scientific units could apply for funding of up to PLN 20 million in the third GameINN competition.</seg>
<seg id="18">The National Centre for Research and Development received 87 applications for a total amount of PLN 317 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">The budget of the competition at the time of the announcement of the competition was PLN 100 million, but it was increased, thanks to which 27 projects were granted almost PLN 105 million in funding.</seg>
<seg id="20">Detailed information about the results of the 3rd GameINN competition is available on the website ncbr.gov.pl.</seg>
<seg id="21">The GameINN sectoral programme is implemented under the Smart Growth Operational Programme.</seg>
<seg id="22">The National Centre for Research and Development launched the programme in 2016 in response to an initiative of entrepreneurs associated in the Polish Games Alliance, which includes such companies as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team and 11 bit studios.</seg>

<seg id="5">The furious Dane failed to show up for class the next day, explaining his stomach problems.</seg>

<seg id="1">Iranian president says he rejected offer of talks with US, Donald Trump denies</seg>
<seg id="2">Tehran has not entered into talks with the US side during the UN General Assembly in New York, despite an offer by the Americans to lift sanctions, Iranian President Hasan Rowhani said on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">US President Donald Trump commented that it was the Iranian side that asked for the restrictions to be lifted, which he did not agree to.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Iranian President Hassan Rowhani, the Americans have proposed lifting all sanctions on Tehran in exchange for negotiations on a new international agreement.</seg>
<seg id="5">It would regulate both Iran's nuclear program and its ballistic missile program.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rowhani: Iran will not engage in talks under maximum pressure</seg>
<seg id="7">The Iranian president said he had not agreed to enter into these talks because of the "toxic atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="8">He said he had met with American diplomats because he had succumbed to the urgings of France, Germany and Britain.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, he stressed that Iran would not enter into talks in an atmosphere of "maximum pressure."</seg>
<seg id="10">"And even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in the 5+1 format, nobody can predict what the end result will be," Rowhani said.</seg>
<seg id="11">The day before, the Iranian leader said he did not rule out talks with the US, and accused European parties to the nuclear deal of favoring US sanctions on Iran.</seg>
<seg id="12">He added that sanctions on Iran following the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal "are a precondition that does not allow" for dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="13">"If we can lift this precondition and if America lifts sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America," he declared.</seg>
<seg id="14">He added that he did not rule out a meeting with US President Donald Trump, even though he had not agreed to such a conversation in the past week during the UN General Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="15">Trump: "Iran asked, I said no"</seg>
<seg id="16">Donald Trump tweeted that he was the one who rejected the Iranian side's request.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions on them so that we could meet.</seg>
<seg id="18">Of course I said "no!'" tweeted the US president.</seg>
<seg id="19">Tension with the atomic agreement in the background</seg>
<seg id="20">France, Germany and Britain are trying to ease tensions between Washington and Tehran in order to salvage, in some form, the 2015 agreement with Iran, to which they were signatories.</seg>
<seg id="21">It stated that in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions, Iran would abandon its nuclear weapons program and bring the nuclear sector under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).</seg>
<seg id="22">Since the US withdrawal from the agreement in May 2015, the other signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to keep the agreement in place.</seg>
<seg id="23">Nothing has come of it yet.</seg>
<seg id="24">Washington is using tactics to exert maximum pressure on Iran, and sanctions also include a full embargo on Iranian oil.</seg>
<seg id="25">Tehran has said that if it is not allowed to export the crude, it will reduce its obligations under the agreement every 60 days.</seg>

<seg id="1">A judge of the Provincial Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of heiress Emilia, who – according to her words and screenshots from WhatsApp – participated in stalking towards judges, was on Wednesday reinstated for adjudication by the NSA.</seg>
<seg id="2">The reason: no disciplinary proceedings have been initiated against him, so there is no basis to uphold the order of the President of the Provincial Administrative Court Wojciech Mazur to remove him from his duties.</seg>
<seg id="3">Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary spokesman at the Supreme Administrative Court, opened an investigation against Szmydt at the end of August, but it has not turned into proceedings against him so far.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although the SAC, which acts as a disciplinary court in such cases, must deal with the decision of the president of the SAC within a month of its issuance.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this situation the judge who spoke publicly about his wife's mental problems in order to discredit her, who was removed from the office of the National Court Register because of suspicions of his participation in the group, will return to adjudication and will give verdicts on behalf of the Republic of Poland.</seg>
<seg id="6">Judge Szmydt denies his involvement in the helicopter group.</seg>
<seg id="7">He says there is no evidence of this other than spoof screenshots and the words of his wife, from whom he is divorcing.</seg>
<seg id="8">Exactly the same is claimed by the other judges associated with "Kasta': they are all innocent, there is no evidence.</seg>
<seg id="9">And quite possibly they will stand their ground.</seg>
<seg id="10">Because procurators did not lift a finger in order to secure evidences from their electronic media, they are also silent about the content of Emilia Szmydt's phone, which she stopped in June in another matter.</seg>
<seg id="11">The police did not lift a finger to secure the devices of people who were identified as persecutors in a report from February by judge Waldemar Żurek.</seg>
<seg id="12">There is no evidence – no Szmydt case, no "Kasta" case.</seg>
<seg id="13">There is also no case of the chief of the National Control Chamber Marian Banaś about renting a tenement house to pimps and hiding income.</seg>
<seg id="14">CBA checks his property statements.</seg>
<seg id="15">And he'll check when he checks.</seg>
<seg id="16">Whereas the Commission of Parliamentary Ethics will not deal with Banas because the Seym is suspended (but the Commission of State Control somehow got together to make a bizarre decision about dismissing Banas's deputies and appointing his lawyer as an acting one, although the law does not provide for such a strange combination).</seg>
<seg id="17">The whole thing reminds me of a film novella, American I think, about how a wife comes home and finds her husband with his mistress in bed.</seg>
<seg id="18">She is so amazed and devastated that she cannot cough up a word.</seg>
<seg id="19">She stands in the doorway speechless, and during this time the mistress quickly jumps out of bed, dresses and leaves.</seg>
<seg id="20">And the husband makes the bed.</seg>
<seg id="21">When the wife regains her voice and shouts: what is it?</seg>
<seg id="22">Who is this woman?</seg>
<seg id="23">Her husband calmly asks: what kind of woman, darling?</seg>
<seg id="24">But in the case of "Kasta" or Banaś it is all about a parody of the state.</seg>
<seg id="25">And it's not funny at all.</seg>

<seg id="7">"I am kept alive by my immediate family and politics," Kornel Morawiecki said in an interview he gave to reporters on the "Super Express" two weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="8">In January, Super Express reported that 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki had been admitted to the Military Hospital in Wrocław for tests.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I developed strange, worrying symptoms and went to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="10">It turned out that I had jaundice.</seg>
<seg id="11">But the worst was ahead of me.</seg>
<seg id="12">When a CT scan was performed, it was found that I had pancreatic cancer...," said the Prime Minister's father.</seg>
<seg id="13">A few days later, in the Ministry of Interior hospital in Warsaw, Kornel Morawiecki underwent a serious operation.</seg>
<seg id="14">As Morawiecki recounted, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain, Father Zbigniew Kras, to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="15">The operation took about three hours and went well.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I know that many people have prayed for me, for which I thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="17">Fortunately, I don't have metastases.</seg>
<seg id="18">I don't know yet if I will be undergoing chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="19">I put myself in the hands of specialist doctors who are rather good-natured.</seg>
<seg id="20">For now, after this hard operation, I need to get back to some sort of useable state.</seg>
<seg id="21">I hope that everything will be fine," said Kornel Morawiecki in an interview with "SE" in January.</seg>
<seg id="22">"If I had undergone the examination too late, the situation would have been tragic and I would have already said goodbye to this pit...," he added.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Power of Jumping.</seg>
<seg id="2">The title of the coverage of the amateur sports competition, played on the afternoon of Sunday 15 September at the hippodrome on Oleandry Street in Oława, may be misleading for some.</seg>
<seg id="3">The road to true power is a long one, but this is the name used to describe one of the types of horse competition...</seg>
<seg id="4">The power of jumping competition consists in the rider and horse overcoming higher and higher obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competition exceed even two meters.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is worth noting here that the long-standing and still unbeaten world record, set back in 1949 by the Chilean Albert Larraguibel on the horse "Huaso," amounts to 247 cm.</seg>
<seg id="6">Of course, nobody jumped so high in Oława, but the result of the best local amazons at 135 cm is not the worst either...</seg>
<seg id="7">The competition organized by the tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other activists of JKS "In the saddle" constituted a demonstration part of the "Rainbow equestrian competition" held there a little earlier, about which we write in more detail in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.</seg>
<seg id="8">Eight amazons, training in horse riding at JKS in Oława, joined the competition.</seg>
<seg id="9">Four competed on the Ducks and four on the big horses.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the first group the best was Nikola Szołdra, riding the crazy "Sprinter."</seg>
<seg id="11">This small, but very dynamic steed started from overcoming obstacles spread at the height of 40 cm, and ended only at the straight rail with the upper beam 125 cm away from the ground.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he did not give up easily and only after three further refusals was he removed from further competition by the competition jury.</seg>
<seg id="13">The second place in pony jumping was taken by Amelia Pawlak, riding "Fama," and the third by Lena Boruń on "Harmider."</seg>
<seg id="14">Ambitiously competed the youngest participant of the tournament - Inga Aksman, galloping and jumping over obstacles on the small mare "Carmen."</seg>
<seg id="15">Even greater emotions accompanied the competing amazons and spectators during the competition with the participation of large horses.</seg>
<seg id="16">Threatening-looking falls were scored by Paulina Szewczyk, riding the "Declaration" and Anastasia Abramenko, who rode the "Lotka."</seg>
<seg id="17">Fortunately, apart from minor bruises, neither the amazons nor the horses were hurt, so they continued to participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="18">A lot of problems with introducing the young mare "Wineta" to the parkour had Weronika Łuczkiewicz riding her.</seg>
<seg id="19">Either the trainer's assistance or another horse to the pair was needed, followed by a little crazy "Wineta."</seg>
<seg id="20">After passing the obstacle, she also rode down the parkour at full speed, so sometimes it got dangerous in the boxes and on the warm-up arena. "Everything is under control!," Jan Sienkiewicz reassured the frightened spectators, especially the youngest ones.</seg>
<seg id="21">From the beginning of the large horse competition Marta Masalska, riding the beautifully presented "Whisky," performed great on the parkour.</seg>
<seg id="22">This dignified mare, paired with an experienced amazon, was the first to jump 135 cm during the second attempt in the final phase and it was the best result of the competition at that moment.</seg>
<seg id="23">After a while, however, the same height was also achieved by Paulina Szewczyk on "Deklaracja," Weronika Łuczkiewicz on "Wineta" and Anastazja Abramenko on "Lotka."</seg>
<seg id="24">For the decoration of the flo and for the receipt of prizes in the form of equestrian equipment, all these contestants went together and at the end, together with the amazons on ponies, they performed an impressive round of honour, ending this interesting and exciting competition.</seg>

<seg id="2">Max Kolonko's Patriotic Revolution is the name of the election committee under which the political formation #R Revolution of Mariusz Max Kolonka was to go to the October parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="3">The revolution addressed its proposal especially to young right-wing voters.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the elections, Kolonko announced cooperation with Marek Jakubiak or Paweł Kukiz, but none of these coalitions took place, and Max Kolonko's Patriotic Revolution did not even manage to collect enough signatures to put up lists in any constituency in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now Kolonko has announced on Twitter that he has ended his collaboration with Max Kolonko's KWW Patriotic Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I will expect the above-mentioned KWW to remove my name from the name.</seg>
<seg id="7">I kindly ask you not to connect my person with the above-mentioned entity," he added and announced that he will provide more information soon.</seg>
<seg id="8">For now it is not known whether the journalist will continue his activity or whether it is the end of the formation #R Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="9">On 4 July, American Independence Day, journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko, who was in the USA, informed about the formation of a new political formation - #R Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="10">In recent years, Kolonko has become famous for hosting the Max TV channel on YouTube, where he comments on events in Poland and around the world.</seg>
<seg id="11">"We're fed up with politicians, fed up with your stupid games, fed up with your amateur governments.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is time for the authorities in the country to take over the Nation and govern for the good of the Nation," Kolonko said then.</seg>
<seg id="13">The party's program included, among others, issues concerning the judiciary (it should be elected in general elections), tax changes (equalization of the tax-free amount for all), war reparations (in the form of military aid for the countries of the eastern flank of NATO, with particular emphasis on Poland), holding a referendum on gun ownership, limiting the number of deputies or introducing single-member constituencies.</seg>
<seg id="14">A few days after the announcement of the formation of a new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko entered into talks with Marek Jakubiak.</seg>
<seg id="15">In late July, Kolonko posted a message on his social media profile suggesting that #R would join forces with the Kukiz'15 movement.</seg>

<seg id="2">"The euro exchange rate will remain around PLN 4.35 in the coming months, which will be accompanied by a weak economic situation on global markets," says Michael Bolliger from UBS Wealth Management.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Expectations of maintaining a solid economic growth rate and a stable monetary policy speak in favour of stabilizing the zloty prices at the current level," the specialist says in an interview with Bankier.pl.</seg>
<seg id="4">In his opinion, despite the clear inflation pressure, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide to increase interest rates in an environment in which the vast majority of central banks are easing policy.</seg>
<seg id="5">"While the zloty is properly valued – euro prices should remain around PLN 4.35 in the coming months – according to him, Polish bonds are not very attractive.</seg>
<seg id="6">Emerging market bonds offer much more favorable yields than Polish stocks," says Michael Bolliger, head of asset allocation for emerging markets at UBS Wealth Management.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the expert, the main threat to the Polish economy is the global economic downturn.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The global slowdown could get even worse, but there should be no severe recession, and at most GDP growth should fall slightly below zero," Michael Bolliger announces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Investors should underweight global equities, which may be hurt by the lack of prospects for resolving the US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including Donald Trump's impeachment procedure and Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among stock markets, Europe should be relatively weakest," according to the latest letter to investors by UBS Wealth Management chief executive Mark Haefele.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Equities from eurozone countries should behave worse than American ones because they are more susceptible amid heightened uncertainty around global trade and fears of a slowdown," the document says.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to Michael Bolliger, after the boom in the bond markets of the safest countries pushed German 10-year yields as low as minus 0.74%, it is still possible to deepen the decline in yields.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, in the long term, long-term yields should no longer fall, but only short-term ones, due to the easing of banks' monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Fed has the most scope for rate cuts, which should lead to a weakening of the US currency in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="15">The long-term equilibrium point for the euro is the ceiling of USD 1.29, which would mean a 19% potential for strengthening the single currency against the dollar.</seg>
<seg id="16">We expect further Fed rate cuts, which will result in a narrowing of monetary policy differences around the world.</seg>
<seg id="17">"To maintain the strength of the dollar in the long term may not allow current account and budget deficits," announces Michael Bolliger.</seg>

<seg id="2">Confidential report of the German Ministry of Defense</seg>
<seg id="3">Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehr has recorded the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 weapons and 19,445 rounds of ammunition, according to a confidential list drawn up in the Federal Ministry of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="4">The news was reported by the press belonging to the media group RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).</seg>
<seg id="5">According to a document from the office of Parliamentary Secretary of State in the Ministry of Defense Peter Tauber (CDU), two weapons, one part of a weapon and 3,474 rounds of ammunition have so far been re-traced.</seg>
<seg id="6">Among the military equipment that is still missing are six MG3 universal machine guns, 11 G3 automatic rifles, four G36 automatic rifles, six signal pistols and two P8 pistols.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, 30 barrels for MG3 machine guns are missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">The vice-president of the Left party, Martina Renner, expressed concern about the situation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The number of missing weapons and ammunition is "alarming," she told RND reporters.</seg>
<seg id="10">All the more so because, as a result of the investigations, only a small part of the lost equipment was found.</seg>
<seg id="11">Martina Renner summed up the effects of these measures as a "miserable balance sheet."</seg>
<seg id="12">She also criticized the fact that it is not clear from the list whether there are also weapons found during the investigation against Bundeswehr lieutenant Franco A. In December 2017, the federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence threatening state security and violating the provisions of the law regulating access to firearms.</seg>
<seg id="13">The officer was accused of preparing assassinations of leading German politicians for far-right and racist reasons.</seg>
<seg id="14">His "blacklist" of targets, which fell into the hands of prosecutors, included the then Justice Minister Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green party, and Anetta Kahane, a human rights campaigner and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="15">Franco A. illegally came into possession of four firearms, more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition and more than 50 explosive devices.</seg>

<seg id="2">How to avoid them?</seg>
<seg id="3">There is a solution.</seg>
<seg id="4">Japan Airlines has recently introduced a feature designed for people who find it a nightmare to travel in the company of a crying child.</seg>
<seg id="5">Through the website, the airline allows you to check the plane's seat distribution.</seg>
<seg id="6">If a connection is used by a minor up to the age of two, the "child icon" appears on a specific seat reserved by parents or guardians.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thus, the person using the services of the carrier has the opportunity to choose a place far from the one occupied by the toddler.</seg>
<seg id="8">The BBC says the airline has already reported the inadequacies of the arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="9">The "child icon" will not appear if the ticket has been booked by a third party or if there has been a last-minute change of aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="10">As expected, the idea divided Internet users.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some Twitter users point out that the problem of travelling with crying children can be solved with noise-cancelling headphones.</seg>
<seg id="12">They're children, we used to be, too.</seg>

<seg id="2">More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not arrive on holiday in Majorca in October as a result of the bankruptcy announced by travel agency Thomas Cook on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the representative of the autonomous government of the Balearic Islands Marc Pons on Friday, among the 25,000 holidaymakers who will not be able to take their October holiday in Majorca, there are also people who were supposed to travel with companies indirectly associated with Thomas Cook, such as Neckermann.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pons explained that 80 percent of the expected holidaymakers who had to give up their holiday in Majorca next month due to the bankruptcy of the British company are citizens of Germany and Scandinavian countries.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, according to Pons, as Thomas Cook did not direct tourists to the Balearic island in November-April, the losses to the local economy will be smaller.</seg>
<seg id="6">He revealed that the Balearic government had already begun negotiations with international operators about "entering the Majorcan market" following the bankruptcy of the British operator.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to estimates by the Diario de Mallorca newspaper, more than 1,000 people will lose their jobs in October due to the tourist crisis in Majorca.</seg>
<seg id="8">About 800 are redundant workers at the Thomas Cook office in Palma.</seg>
<seg id="9">Other people will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Monday, with Thomas Cook declaring bankruptcy in a number of Majorca hotels, the owners of the properties demanded that guests pay an additional overnight fee.</seg>
<seg id="11">Dozens of tourists from Poland experienced this situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The government of the Balearic Islands estimates that by Thursday, dozens of hotels in Majorca had halted operations until at least the end of October as Thomas Cook and its affiliates filed for bankruptcy.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the other hand, Friday's Diario de Ibiza newspaper indicates that most of the hotels operating in Ibiza that have worked with the Thomas Cook group have no intention of closing in the coming weeks.</seg>
<seg id="14">The newspaper reminds us that on this Balearic island, the British bankrupt cooperated with 42 hotels.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Wednesday, the autonomous authorities of the Balearic Islands announced that they would ask the Spanish government to support the region with 100 million euros to cover losses caused by the bankruptcy of travel agency Thomas Cook.</seg>
<seg id="16">They revealed that the largest number of tourists affected in the archipelago, around 36,000 people, are in Majorca.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to data from the government of the Balearic Islands, Thomas Cook is in arrears with local tourism companies, mainly hotel operators, for the execution of contracts for the period July-September 2019.</seg>

<seg id="2">Asked on ZET radio how many candidates of his party could get to the Sejm from the lists of leftist groups (KW SLD from whose list the candidates for the Sejm of the Democratic Left Alliance, Spring and Left Together, starting with the common logo "Left"), Zandberg replied that it depends on the result of the committee.</seg>
<seg id="3">"I believe that the result of the Left will be very good, because we feel that people have hope that the Left is not only right, but also has strength," he noted.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Zandberg, it follows that the left can have 60-80 MPs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"This may mean that the circle or club Together will have a dozen MPs.</seg>

<seg id="2">Tens of thousands of people from across Senegal gathered in the capital on Friday for the inauguration of a huge mosque, believed to be the largest in West Africa.</seg>
<seg id="3">Muslims arrived in buses, cars and on foot to the Bopp district, where a new mosque was built that could accommodate 30,000 worshippers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The facility was built by the Mouride fraternity, part of the Sufi Islamic movement that dominates Senegal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Work on the mosque began a decade ago on a six-acre wetland donated by the government.</seg>
<seg id="6">The mosque's name Massalikul Jinan ("Paths to Paradise") comes from the title of a poem by Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the 19th-century founder of the fraternity, revered by followers as a saint.</seg>
<seg id="7">The mosque is clad in Carrara marble and has five minarets.</seg>
<seg id="8">The tallest is 78 metres.</seg>
<seg id="9">The mosque inside can accommodate 15,000 worshippers, and the same number can stay on the outer esplanade.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the richly finished interiors you can admire the gilded dome, giant chandeliers and decorations handmade by workers from Morocco.</seg>
<seg id="11">Builders say the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but the edifice has no comparison to mosques in other regions anyway.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Morocco, the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca can accommodate 105,000 worshippers.</seg>
<seg id="13">The construction of the mosque, which cost more than 30 million euros, was financed by private donations.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition to land, the government funded lighting, sanitation and road works worth EUR 10.5 million.</seg>

<seg id="1">Coach Smyła: Our problem is not Silesia, but ourselves</seg>
<seg id="2">The streak of eight league matches without a victory, the players of the Crown will try to break in Friday's meeting with the vice-leader of the Silesian Premier League.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Our problem is not the inhabitants of Wrocław, but ourselves, we have to work on what we play," emphasized the Kielce coach Mirosław Smyła.</seg>
<seg id="4">The players of the Crown last and so far the only victory in the league recorded in the first round, when away defeated 1-0 in the competition Raków Częstochowa.</seg>
<seg id="5">Later, Kielce recorded two draws and six losses, and on Tuesday lost 1-0 to Zagłębie Lubin in the 1/32 final of the Polish Cup.</seg>
<seg id="6">"It fills me with optimism that in the last seconds of the cup match the players were fighting for a goal, they wanted to draw.</seg>
<seg id="7">Their fall to the turf after the final whistle was not due to a breakdown, it was just a collapse of anger because they were so close," Smyla said.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he pointed out, Silesia has very strong wings, so he will sensitize the team to play in the side sectors of the pitch.</seg>
<seg id="9">"We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we also look at what we want to play," added the coach.</seg>
<seg id="10">Ognjen Gnjatic, who is out for a glut of yellow cards, will definitely not play in Friday's match in the Crown, while the injured Jakub Żubrowski and Michael Gardawski will also be missing from the squad.</seg>
<seg id="11">What is encouraging, however, is the participation of several players in the cup match with the desire to play.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We have a headache, recently it seemed that there would be none, and now there is," Smyla stated.</seg>
<seg id="13">Crown defender Daniel Dziwniel stressed that Silesia will not be an easy rival to break the streak of eight league matches in a row without a win, while in the Premier League everyone can win against anyone.</seg>
<seg id="14">"We're a good team.</seg>
<seg id="15">In recent weeks we may not show it on the pitch, but there will come a moment when we will win and we believe it will be on Friday," said the footballer.</seg>
<seg id="16">After nine rounds of the Premier League, the Crown with five points takes 15th position.</seg>
<seg id="17">Silesia has accumulated 12 more and is in second place.</seg>
<seg id="18">Friday's match in Kielce will start at 20.30.</seg>

<seg id="1">These trees could completely disappear from Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">"42% of the tree species that make up Europe's tree stand are endangered," warns the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in its "Red Book of European Trees" published on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Chestnuts and rowan are at the top of the list.</seg>
<seg id="4">The IUCN, an organisation based in Gland, Switzerland, publishes a list of endangered European tree species for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was prepared by specialists who, on the basis of research, came to the conclusion that out of 454 tree species found in Europe (as well as in other parts of the world), 42 percent are "highly endangered."</seg>
<seg id="6">Among the causes, the Red List lists the rapid growth of urban agglomerations and global climate change.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, the most endangered are those trees and shrubs that occur only or mainly on our continent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As for the typical European tree stand, 58% of species are threatened, according to IUCN specialists, and 15 percent, i.e. 66 species of trees and shrubs, are threatened with extinction.</seg>
<seg id="9">Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red List lists errors in the exploitation of forest stands, accelerated urbanisation, over-intensive felling of trees, followed by forest fires and changes in the European ecosystem.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of shrubs, mosses and lichens is also under serious threat.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The consequences of human activity are leading to the gradual disappearance of European plant species and pose a risk of extinction in Europe of important and underestimated varieties that form the backbone of European ecosystems and affect the health of our planet," concluded the report by Luc Bas, who heads the IUCN's European office.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grzegorz Schetyna: I do not promise 600+</seg>
<seg id="2">"Today the Law and Justice party wants to bribe Poles, offering them a distribution for their freedom on credit which future generations will have to pay back', says Grzegorz Schetyna in an interview for "Rzeczpospolita".</seg>
<seg id="3">In his opinion, "the whole politics of the Law and Justice party is a pic".</seg>
<seg id="4">At the same time, the politician promises that "what is given will not be taken away."</seg>
<seg id="5">Schetyna assures in an interview with Jacek Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea to defeat Law and Justice.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is about mobilising the electorate at the ballot box.</seg>
<seg id="7">In his opinion, the opposition has a bigger potential in this sphere than the party of Kaczyński.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today there are more conscious people who want to live in a normal state than there are supporters of the Law and Justice party, a party that has betrayed proclaimed values such as modesty, humility, transparency," Schetyna says.</seg>
<seg id="9">The leader of the Civic Coalition and the chairman of the Civic Platform also emphasized the basic assumptions of the electoral program of the KO.</seg>
<seg id="10">"First of all, nothing given will be taken away, but it is necessary to set a direction for the future, because the Law and Justice party deals only with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which can be seen even from dramatically low investments," he stated.</seg>
<seg id="11">Secondly, it is about "launching the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work reliably - and those who are enterprising."</seg>
<seg id="12">Schetyna explains that the program of KO includes, among the others, a project which will give the least earning Poles more by 614 zlotys on hand, and more earners – also a few hundred.</seg>
<seg id="13">The politician also indicated that he did not want to race for the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="14">He will do as much as he can do, he said, but he won't promise 600+.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I will never allow the Greek variant, where the rulers bid against the opposition for a handout, until the country's financial collapse finally happened," he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="16">Schetyna also stated in an interview for "Rz" that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We would expose their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Pride treads before a fall.</seg>

<seg id="2">Six dead great condors have been found in Argentina's Santa Cruz province, TVN24 reports.</seg>
<seg id="3">Specialists believe human activity contributed to their deaths.</seg>
<seg id="4">Large condors were probably poisoned by a means of killing predators such as cougars, foxes, and wild dogs.</seg>
<seg id="5">The animals may have eaten the toxic carrion.</seg>
<seg id="6">Apart from one juvenile, the rest of the dead condors were adults.</seg>
<seg id="7">"This is a big loss for the environment, because the condor needs to reach 10-15 years to become fertile and able to reproduce.</seg>
<seg id="8">So we are losing a protected species, an endangered species," says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentine environmental organization.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I think the use of toxic bait and poison puts not only this species at risk, but all other forms of life, including human health," he adds.</seg>

<seg id="2">Work has begun on granting the head of state a precious chain.</seg>
<seg id="3">The idea was supported by the office of Andrzej Duda – we read in "Rzeczpospolita".</seg>
<seg id="4">As the newspaper explains, it is about the golden chain of the Order of the White Eagle, the royal insignia officially known in the interwar period as the jewel of the Republic of Poland.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was probably used by President Ignacy Mościcki for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Rz" informs that soon such a chain may get onto the arms of Andrzej Duda.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Senate Committee on Human Rights, the Rule of Law and Petitions voted Wednesday to move forward with an amendment to the Orders and Decorations Act to restore it.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Journal writes that this is also not the first attempt to restore this chain to the head of state.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Senate had already proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it was defeated by one vote.</seg>
<seg id="10">This time the work is lightning fast.</seg>
<seg id="11">In early August, senators spent a few minutes on the issue, recognizing that they would seek the opinion of the President's Office.</seg>
<seg id="12">This came in mid-September.</seg>

<seg id="2">The police action will be carried out, among others, at the intersection of Cieplińskiego Avenue and Piłsudskiego Avenue.</seg>
<seg id="3">The actions of uniformed officers are somehow related to the recent complaints of the city authorities about drivers who are not always able to behave appropriately at the intersection.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Friday, 27 September, police officers begin preventive actions in Rzeszów "Drivable intersections."</seg>
<seg id="5">The aim is to eliminate traffic obstacles: entering an intersection without the possibility of exiting, not following traffic signals or road signs.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We often think that we are alone at the intersection, and in fact we make life difficult for other drivers," said Marek Ustrobiński, vice-mayor of the city, a few days ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">His words resonated at a town hall press conference, where city officials presented examples of cars moving inappropriately around intersections, which in effect creates traffic jams.</seg>
<seg id="8">At the time, the president appealed to travelers to be sensible on the road and, among other things, to start faster at traffic lights or not to text while driving.</seg>
<seg id="9">The subject was somehow taken over by the policemen from Rzeszów, who from today begin the action "Transferable intersections."</seg>
<seg id="10">What's the point?</seg>
<seg id="11">The aim of the measures is to eliminate the phenomenon of limiting the passability at intersections by drivers entering them without the possibility to continue driving.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is a common offence that contributes to intensifying traffic difficulties and creating traffic jams.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is subject to a fine of PLN 300 and 2 penalty points.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, uniformed personnel will pay attention to non-compliance with traffic lights or signs and incorrect parking in the area of intersections.</seg>
<seg id="15">They will also observe the lack of smoothness of driving, late starting from the beacons, slow crossing of intersections and leaving too large distances between vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="16">At which intersections will the action take place?</seg>
<seg id="17">Among others, on Lisa-Kuli Street with Jagiellońska Street; Cieplińskiego Avenue with Piłsudskiego Avenue; Targowa Street with Piłsudskiego Avenue; Śreniawitów Square with Dąbrowskiego Street or Hetmańska Street with Powstańców Warszawy Avenue.</seg>

<seg id="3">52 senators voted in favour of the amendment to the Act on the Estates of the Families of State Officials – without amendments, 14 were against and three abstained.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thus, the senators decided to reject 12 amendments submitted during Wednesday's debate by the Civic Platform senator Sławomir Rybicki.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to him, the amendments were to "civilize" the law and limit the scope of information given in the statement about the financial situation of own children, children of the spouse, children adapted to cases in which children remain in a common household with a person obliged to make a statement.</seg>
<seg id="6">The act concerning the openness of property of families of the most important state officials, whose project was created in the office of the prime minister, was passed by the Seym on 11 September.</seg>
<seg id="7">The provisions assume that, inter alia, the Prime Minister, ministers, deputies, MEPs, senators, presidents of the Constitutional Tribunal, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as persons heading other state institutions, will be obliged to include information on the personal property of spouses, children and persons living together in a property declaration.</seg>

<seg id="12">According to the bill, each flight of the president will be a flight "performed on an official mission."</seg>
<seg id="13">On the flights, the president will be able to be accompanied by family members and other people invited by the president.</seg>
<seg id="14">Whereas the flight in the official mission of the prime minister and the marshals of the Sejm and the Senate will be only a flight "taken in order to carry out tasks directly connected with the function".</seg>

<seg id="2">The Polish volleyball players held their first practice in Paris on Friday, where they will compete in the bronze medal match on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Vital Heynen's charge closed the way to clinching the title with a 3-1 defeat to Slovenia in Ljubljana on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">There was a lot of talk about their troubles travelling to this match.</seg>
<seg id="5">This time there were no such problems – on Friday morning they went with the Slovenians on a charter to Paris, and a few hours later they had a training in the famous Bercy hall.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the accounts of those present, the coach of the world champions was nervous.</seg>
<seg id="7">As Heynen's assistant Michał Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not just to practice volleyball elements.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We went to the hall, but the vast majority of the time it was for the team.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was more about spending it together than training.</seg>
<seg id="10">To talk, to think about how to rebuild it all as a team," he reported.</seg>
<seg id="11">He confirmed that the semi-final defeat was a painful lesson for both the players and the coaching staff.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We've been brutally brought down to earth.</seg>
<seg id="13">Without a doubt, we are disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="14">We kept believing we would still get back into this game.</seg>
<seg id="15">We discussed that game among ourselves on the staff, the coach talked to the players quite a bit.</seg>
<seg id="16">As the two main reasons for the defeat, I would point to ineffectiveness in attack and much worse than usual handling of situational balls.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Slovenians were much better than us in this respect," he analysed.</seg>
<seg id="18">In his opinion, the "White and Red" did not stand in the way of the stress associated with the performance against the co-hosts of the tournament supported by a loud and large audience.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead, he admitted that the world champions may have been somewhat lulled by a smooth road to the semi-finals.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Maybe if we had a similar-style defeat in the group stage, we would have analysed the lesson more quickly and played differently later in the tournament.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that's just guessing," he cautioned.</seg>
<seg id="22">Gogol hopes the anger over Thursday's defeat can be turned into aggression by the Poles in the bronze match.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I hope that we will then show our true colours.</seg>
<seg id="24">There's a lot to fight about.</seg>
<seg id="25">The last time we won a medal was in 2011," he recalled.</seg>
<seg id="26">Paris is the fifth city and France is the third country visited by Poles during these championships.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the group stage, they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, went to Apeldoorn for the first two group stage matches, and moved to Ljubljana for the semi-finals.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nick Kyrgios: severe punishment but suspended</seg>
<seg id="2">The Australian tennis player received a 16-week ban and a $25,000 fine – suspended for six months – for reprehensible words, gestures and actions during recent ATP tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="3">ATP World Tour officials are losing patience with Kyrgios but are still giving him a chance to improve.</seg>
<seg id="4">A summary of the misdeeds of the most uncouth professional tennis player of recent years looks menacing – 16 weeks off plus a sizeable fine, but yet both penalties are withheld for six months – a probationary period in which the wayward athlete will be able to improve.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nick Kyrgios is only 24, but he has been roughing it for a long time and has earned a kind of tennis world record – he had to pay the highest single financial penalty in the sport's history for violating the rules of behaviour on and next to the court.</seg>
<seg id="6">Loud swearing, strange gestures, unsportsmanlike conduct, insulting the referee and spectators, breaking two rackets during a loss to Karen Khachanov – all for which he paid $113,000 after the ATP Masters 1000 in Cincinnati in August.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the 2019 US Open, he did not play for long either, but managed to publicly say that ATP officials "are corrupt," which hurt the organization's authorities so much that they implemented a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and after a few weeks gave the above-mentioned verdict of suspension and another fine.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, he was forgiven for his words about corruption, after hearing the accused and learning the context of the statement.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the statement of reasons, however, tennis officials stated that the investigation showed that Kyrgios' conduct throughout the past 12 months in many cases raised serious concerns and constituted an almost continuous violation of the rules that he constantly insulted people associated with tournaments and spectators in a vulgar manner, hence the high penalty.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately postponed his sentence, ordering him to meet several conditions within the next six months: in the ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour, Kyrgios can no longer violate the rules of the code of conduct for professional tennis players in any way, in particular, he can no longer swear, destroy rackets, argue with referees and the public, or otherwise behave indecently and vulgarly.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was also advised to seek "continuous support" from mental coaches during tournaments and also in the off-season to consult with people who specialize in solving problems of athletes who do not cope with proper behavior.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nick Kyrgios' first comment (on social media) on the verdict was: "Hey everyone, I can still play.</seg>
<seg id="13">I just have to control my behavior, that's all."</seg>
<seg id="14">In practice, the Australian will still have at least a two-week break, as his shoulder injury exacerbated in the Laver Cup, so he had to give up his next starts in Beijing (30 September – 6 October) and Shanghai (6-13 October).</seg>
<seg id="15">In the ATP rankings, Kyrgios is ranked 27th.</seg>
<seg id="16">This year he won two tournaments – in Washington and Acapulco, he earned over 1.3 million dollars, so even after the fines he will have a lot left.</seg>

<seg id="1">Central Statistical Office: Life in Poland is getting better</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the report on household budgets published by the Central Statistical Office (GUS) on Friday, as many as 44% of households assessed their financial situation as good or rather good last year.</seg>
<seg id="3">A year earlier, this percentage was 37.2%, in 2016 it was 33.5%, and earlier – since 2009, when the statistical office examined subjective assessments of the situation of households for the first time – it had never exceeded 30%.</seg>
<seg id="4">Last year, a total of 8.1% of households considered their financial situation to be bad or rather bad, as compared to 11.2% a year before and over 20% in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="5">The financial situation of self-employed households is the best.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this group, over 70 percent of respondents consider it to be good or rather good.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the other extreme are the households of pensioners, where the percentage of such responses was only 18 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">The subjective assessment of the financial situation of households is also strongly influenced by the number of children.</seg>
<seg id="9">The worst situation is for single parents, among whom 32 per cent declare a good or rather good financial situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among couples with children, this percentage varies (depending on the number of children) from 55 to 60%, and among childless households it is 48.8%.</seg>
<seg id="11">The effect of the 500+ programme is clearly visible in these statistics.</seg>
<seg id="12">Before it was launched (in 2016), the worst financial situation was assessed by single parents and families with many children (with at least three children).</seg>
<seg id="13">Improving subjective assessments of the material situation of Poles reflects a rapid increase in income, especially from work.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, that is not all, because the percentage of households that consider their situation to be good is increasing faster than real incomes.</seg>
<seg id="15">Moreover, at the level of voivodships, there is no clear correlation between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households.</seg>
<seg id="16">The best marks are formulated by the inhabitants of the Opolskie voivodship, where 48.9% of the respondents consider their situation to be good or rather good.</seg>
<seg id="17">Next are Lubuskie (47.7%), Śląskie (47.6%), Mazowieckie (47.3%) and Zachodniopomorskie (47.1%).</seg>
<seg id="18">Meanwhile, in Opole the disposable income (i.e. after paying taxes and contributions) last year amounted to less than 94% of the national average, and in Lubuskie 98%.</seg>
<seg id="19">The highest incomes were in Mazowieckie (120 per cent of the national average) and Śląskie (104 per cent).</seg>
<seg id="20">In Poland, the average disposable income per capita was PLN 1,693 in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="21">In real terms (after adjusting for the impact of price changes), it increased by 4.3% as compared to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="22">Compared to previous years, this result is quite low.</seg>
<seg id="23">In 2016, per capita income increased by 7% and a year later by 6.3%.</seg>
<seg id="24">While income growth is slowing, it is also holding back spending growth.</seg>
<seg id="25">These per capita amounted to PLN 1,187 last year, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7%.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is the first time this has happened since 2013.</seg>
<seg id="27">In 2017, expenditure per capita increased by 1.9% in real terms, and by 4.3% in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="28">Household budget surveys suggest that a statistical household now spends 70.1% of its disposable income, compared to over 80% in 2014 and over 90% by 2006.</seg>

<seg id="1">Niesiolowski was critical of the pope.</seg>
<seg id="2">John Paul II did nothing</seg>
<seg id="3">In an interview with Piotr Lekszycki, Stefan Niesiołowski emphasized that in 1981 John Paul II was a great authority for opposition activists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Actually, his every opinion was accepted."</seg>
<seg id="5">There was later criticism of some of his actions.</seg>
<seg id="6">"For me the fact that John Paul II could not liquidate the harmful activity of Rydzyk casts a great shadow on his pontificate.</seg>
<seg id="7">After all, this Redemptorist – a pest of the Church and Poland – was developing his media in the best way during the life of the Polish pope', he explained.</seg>
<seg id="8">The former politician of the Civic Platform admitted: "there were murmurs of discontent, the pope said something, once he did not accept Rydzyk, but he had authority and for politicking he could simply throw him out of the Church or send him to a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji, so that he would collect money for the poor there.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, John Paul II did not do it, nor did his successors," explained Niesiołowski.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Besides, there was this fatal matter of pedophilia and actions of the Church, and, in fact, their lack.</seg>
<seg id="11">I looked forward a little, but I wanted to draw attention to his whole life.</seg>
<seg id="12">We have known about the scale of pedophilia in the Church for a relatively recent time.</seg>
<seg id="13">There appears a question how it is possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting matters', says Niesiołowski in an interview with a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the opinion of the former politician of the Civic Platform the Polish Church is an ally of the Law and Justice party.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It must be admitted that during the period of Solidarity the Church was our most important ally.</seg>
<seg id="16">All celebrations began with mass, crosses hung everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now these crosses are written, they have become a symbol of dictatorship – a sign of the Pisan regime.</seg>
<seg id="18">I repeat: one of the biggest unpleasant surprises is the fact that such people as Rydzyk are shaking the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing about it and that today the Church is an ally of the Law and Justice party.</seg>
<seg id="19">This is a black chapter of the Polish Church, for which it will have to pay dearly," Niesiołowski argued.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I hope that Pope Francis will chase Jędraszewski, Rydzyk and a few others of this type," he concluded.</seg>

<seg id="2">Disqualified griffin</seg>
<seg id="3">The clash within the Polish Cup between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechia Gdańsk nearly ended tragically, when the flare fired by the fans from Wejherowo by millimeters missed the goalkeeper of the opposing team, Zlatan Alomerovic.</seg>
<seg id="4">The match was suspended for 20 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="5">The PZPN commission investigating this case imposed a severe punishment on Gryf, excluding him from future games.</seg>
<seg id="6">The club will not be able to compete in the Polish Cup in the 2020/2021 season.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, fans will not be allowed in the next match to their own stadium.</seg>
<seg id="8">They will also not be allowed to travel in groups for league matches until 31 December.</seg>
<seg id="9">Brawls at the Widzew Łódź stadium were also caused by fans of Śląsk Wrocław.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here, however, the verdict of the Polish Football Association was more lenient, because Silesia warned that similar events could happen and alerted the relevant organs in this issue.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite this, the services allowed flares to be thrown at the sector of Łódź fans, chairs to be set on fire and the host sector to be pushed.</seg>
<seg id="12">This match was stopped for eight minutes and the intervening police had to use a water cannon.</seg>
<seg id="13">PZPN punished Silesia with a one-time stadium ban in the next match in the Polish Cup and forbade to organize trips to matches in this and the next edition of the PP.</seg>

<seg id="2">GDDKiA plans to replace the signage on the entire managed road network by the end of 2020.</seg>
<seg id="3">GDDKiA Rzeszów</seg>
<seg id="4">In Podkarpacie, the implementation of the amendment to the regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on, among others, writing the names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish has begun.</seg>
<seg id="5">For example, "Lviv" will appear next to "L'viv."</seg>
<seg id="6">In our province the changes will be introduced on 94 road signs placed at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.</seg>
<seg id="7">As we can hear, it should be easier, clearer and simpler.</seg>
<seg id="8">The new guidelines result from the amendment of the Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure on detailed technical requirements for road signs and signals and road safety equipment.</seg>
<seg id="9">"We should remember that the names of towns in neighbouring countries often also have a Polish sound.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thanks to the change in the law that we have prepared, they will finally appear on the signposts on our roads.</seg>
<seg id="11">The introduction of the new signage starts from the Podkarpackie section of the A4 motorway," informed the Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Podkarpacie changes will be introduced on 94 road signs set up at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.</seg>
<seg id="13">Total cost of investment?</seg>
<seg id="14">200,000 zlotys.</seg>
<seg id="15">As a first step, the new signage will be implemented on the A4 motorway, which is planned by 1 November 2019.</seg>
<seg id="16">What should the implementation of the idea look like?</seg>
<seg id="17">It will take place without replacing the boards, on the principle of stickers.</seg>
<seg id="18">They will replace the currently existing place names with new ones written in Polish on already existing signs.</seg>
<seg id="19">Both names will be written in one line – first in Polish, then in the original, in parentheses.</seg>
<seg id="20">This will make it much easier for people who do not know the spelling of the names of foreign cities in the language of the country in which they are located.</seg>

<seg id="1">Gowin: "we must stimulate Polish small trade"</seg>
<seg id="2">"Effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, we will have to consider whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade," said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, leader of the Agreement Jarosław Gowin.</seg>
<seg id="3">During an interview in "Signals of the Day" in radio Jedynka, Gowin stated that trade is dominated by international networks, which impose such low margins on Polish producers that Polish companies cannot actually develop.</seg>
<seg id="4">Noting that it is very difficult to fight this problem, the vice-prime minister reminded that the government of the Law and Justice party was trying to face it at the very beginning of the cadency, but it got "a counter-attack from the European Commission".</seg>
<seg id="5">"We won before the court of justice and I hope that if the United Right wins the next elections and forms a government, we will return to this subject," he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the same time, he noted that "effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the Polish problem, i.e. small trade."</seg>
<seg id="7">"On this we will have to consider whether the government, the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade," said Gowin.</seg>
<seg id="8">In May, an EU court found that the European Commission had erred in finding that the Polish retail tax was illicit state aid.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Retail Sales Tax Act provided for the introduction of two rates of trade tax: 0.8% on revenue between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4% on revenue over PLN 170 million per month.</seg>
<seg id="10">The tax was to apply from September 2016.</seg>
<seg id="11">In September 2016, the European Commission initiated proceedings for violation of EU law by Poland.</seg>
<seg id="12">Brussels argued then that the design of the tax could favour smaller shops, which could be considered state aid.</seg>
<seg id="13">It then found that the levy had been implemented unlawfully.</seg>
<seg id="14">It also issued an order suspending the application of the tax until officials in Brussels have completed their analysis of it.</seg>
<seg id="15">Poland did not agree with this position, but the tax collection was suspended.</seg>
<seg id="16">An EU court decision in May opened the way for the tax to be reintroduced, but it did not end the case.</seg>
<seg id="17">On 24 July, the Commission appealed to the Court of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="18">On Thursday, the press service of the CJEU informed PAP that the case is currently at the written stage, in which both the European Commission and the Polish government present their arguments in writing.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not yet known whether or when the oral procedure will start, i.e. the hearing of the parties and a possible hearing.</seg>
<seg id="20">It takes a good few to several months from the filing of an appeal to the announcement of the verdict.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Such proceedings take an average of a year," a source at the Luxembourg Court told PAP.</seg>

<seg id="1">How to dress a child for baptism?</seg>
<seg id="2">We suggest a few practical solutions</seg>
<seg id="3">Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of a baby and its parents.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is often the first occasion when the whole family gathers around the child, celebrating his appearance in the world.</seg>
<seg id="5">No wonder, then, that the newly minted mum and dad want their child to look their best on this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, before you make the final decision about your child's outfit, consider whether it will also be comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the shops you can find many outfitted sets that do not provide the child with adequate comfort.</seg>
<seg id="8">So what should you look out for?</seg>
<seg id="9">The basic criterion for choosing clothes for baptism is the age of the child</seg>
<seg id="10">Until recently, a few-week-old toddlers were baptized, dressed in white sets and put into the same beciks or big pillows.</seg>
<seg id="11">Today children who receive the sacrament are often older: a few months old, one year old and even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is not difficult to guess that such a big comfort needs a slightly different clothes for baptism.</seg>
<seg id="13">So, if your child is 3-4 months old on the day of baptism, he will surely spend the ceremony in a pram or in the hands of parents or godparents.</seg>
<seg id="14">The best solution will be to decorate it in comfortable cotton sleeping bags or sets.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although this piece of clothing is considered an everyday outfit, it is enough to search for its festive variants, for example with a frill or lace.</seg>
<seg id="16">For a boy, a body with a printed bow tie and braces will be perfect.</seg>
<seg id="17">For older children, you can afford more fantasy in dress.</seg>
<seg id="18">The girl will look lovely in a simple tulle dress</seg>
<seg id="19">Many parents of girls look longingly towards richly decorated, ruffled dresses for baptism complete with coats, headbands and caps.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers use artificial, non-breathing materials, in which the child is simply uncomfortable.</seg>
<seg id="21">In search of the right clothes, it is better to visit the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant outfits on cotton linings.</seg>
<seg id="22">Delicate tulle skirts, satin dresses, lace, appliques and charming sets will make your daughter look beautiful and feel comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="23">The perfect outfit for the little gentleman: a cotton suit</seg>
<seg id="24">Until recently, there was a trend among boys' parents for suits that were copies of "adult" models.</seg>
<seg id="25">Polyester jackets and trousers, stiff collars or caskets often made young elegances loudly demonstrate their dissatisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="26">Today, fortunately, they have been displaced by comfortable, cotton sets.</seg>
<seg id="27">Just look at the sets available in Asanti for Kids, which are soft, sweatpants, and a blouse decorated on the front in the pattern of a vest.</seg>
<seg id="28">These outfits look extremely festive, and at the same time do not restrict the movements of a toddler exploring the world.</seg>

<seg id="2">British MPs have voted against a three-day recess in the House of Commons in time for the Conservative Party's annual policy conference, as requested by the government.</seg>
<seg id="3">289 deputies voted in favour and 306 against.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is customary for the House of Commons not to meet during party conferences, so that MPs do not have to resign from attending them or from sittings of parliament.</seg>
<seg id="5">But opposition parties decided that, at such a crucial time as the final weeks before Britain's scheduled departure from the European Union on October 31, parliament should not interrupt proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="6">289 MPs voted in favour of the government's request for a recess, with 306 against.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two opposition parties after the conventions</seg>
<seg id="8">Failure to agree to a break can be perceived as political revenge of the opposition against Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday the decision was declared illegal and non-existent by the Supreme Court) and for the fact that after the judges' ruling he does not want to apologise for it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Following the ruling, the House of Commons resumed its session on Wednesday, with the highlight of the day being Johnson's speech and the heated debate that followed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Johnson accused the opposition of blocking Brexit and avoiding early elections.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It's time to deliver Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="12">It must be implemented in order to respect the result of the referendum.</seg>
<seg id="13">Brexit must come so that we can deal with a deal about citizens' priorities, about the health service, about the cost of living.</seg>
<seg id="14">Brexit must be delivered so that we can unite this country," Johnson said.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Conservative Party conference is due to start in Manchester next Sunday and run until Wednesday 2 October.</seg>
<seg id="16">The conferences of the two main opposition groups – Labour and the Liberal Democrats – have already taken place.</seg>
<seg id="17">One of the justifications Johnson gave in explaining such a long suspension of parliament was precisely party conferences.</seg>

<seg id="2">"President Andrzej Duda believes that anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders," write foreign media.</seg>
<seg id="3">The president's spokesman strongly denied the reports.</seg>
<seg id="4">"This is simply not true," Blazej Spychalski tweeted.</seg>
<seg id="5">Israeli media, including "Haaretz" and "Jerusalem Post', citing "Jewish Insider', write that during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora in the Polish consulate in New York, Andrzej Duda stated that it was Israel which was to blame for the last anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="6">The president said the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland was a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.</seg>
<seg id="7">He referred to the words of Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, who claimed in February that "Poles sucked up anti-Semitism with their mothers' milk."</seg>
<seg id="8">Andrzej Duda said he regretted that Israel had not apologized for the humiliating statements of its politicians.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also mentioned the act of aggression against the Polish ambassador in Israel Marek Magierowski.</seg>
<seg id="10">In May, he was attacked by a gunman who shouted: "Pole, Pole."</seg>
<seg id="11">"The quote is not only inaccurate.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's just not true," Blazej Spychalski tweeted.</seg>
<seg id="13">He stressed that Duda "never said that Israel was responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland."</seg>
<seg id="14">According to Spychalski, the portal "invented it."</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the interviewees of "JI," during the meeting there was also a dispute between a Holocaust survivor, awarded the Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mosberg is said to have agreed with President Duda's words and said that it was the Jews of Israel "such as Israel Katz" who were responsible for the rise of anti-Semitism.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the website's sources, Boteach had interrupted Mosberg's statement.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who is Banas and what is his fault?</seg>
<seg id="2">The tenement rented by the pimps led the journalist to discover negligence in Marian Banaś's property statements.</seg>
<seg id="3">We take stock of another scandal that has rocked the ruling camp.</seg>
<seg id="4">Journalists of TVN Supervisor revealed that Marian Banaś, the chairman of the Supreme Chamber of Control, had not entered the 400-metre tenement house, which is located in Podgórze in Kraków, into the property statement in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="5">What is more, his subtenant was to run a sex business in the mentioned tenement house (i.e. rent rooms for hours).</seg>
<seg id="6">In turn, the building itself has allegedly been collateral for loan repayments since 2016.</seg>
<seg id="7">The irregularities were pointed out by Bertold Kittel in the program "Supervisor."</seg>
<seg id="8">The journalist revealed that from Banasia, the tenement house was rented by people with links to the criminal world to be used as a place for "erotic meetings."</seg>
<seg id="9">The clients were to be men using prostitutes.</seg>
<seg id="10">Banas responded vaguely and vaguely to the allegations.</seg>
<seg id="11">Interestingly, the tenement rented by the pimps led the journalist to discover negligence in Banasia's property statements.</seg>
<seg id="12">The building itself was described vaguely, and the income from its rental was to be underestimated.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The assets of Marian Banaś and his wife may be worth from 6 to 8 million zlotys.</seg>
<seg id="14">In total, the couple boast two houses, three apartments, savings[...]," writes Money.pl.</seg>
<seg id="15">And according to the analysis of the portal, the Banasia tenement itself was already worth about 3 million zlotys.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Central Anti-Corruption Bureau is currently auditing Marian Banaś's financial statements for the years 2015-2019.</seg>
<seg id="17">Banaś announced that he would suspend his activity in the Supreme Audit Office until its completion. "I will apply to the Marshal for unpaid leave," he assured.</seg>
<seg id="18">The opposition demands an explanation.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We don't hear that CBA has expanded its investigation or expedited its examination of Marian Banas' property statements.</seg>
<seg id="20">Therefore, we are forced to relieve the organs of the state and submit a notification about the possibility of committing a crime [...]," said PO-KO MP Mariusz Witczak.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If a normal Pole valued the rental of his properties so grossly low, he would already have 10 inspections, a tax allowance and criminal-treasure proceedings," he added.</seg>
<seg id="22">He went high, he fell low</seg>
<seg id="23">Marian Banaś is the new president of the Supreme Chamber of Control.</seg>
<seg id="24">He was appointed to this position on 30 August 2019, for a six-year term.</seg>
<seg id="25">His candidacy was proposed by the Law and Justice party and approved by the party's politicians.</seg>
<seg id="26">Earlier, Banaś was associated with the Supreme Audit Office in the years 1992-2005, he worked in this institution as a collaborator of Lech Kaczyński.</seg>
<seg id="27">During the first government of the Law and Justice party (2005-2008), Banaś held the position of the President of the Customs Service, and also the Undersecretary of State in the Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="28">Since 2015, he has again sat on the stool of the head of the Customs Service, and since 2017 he has managed the National Revenue Administration.</seg>
<seg id="29">Banaś served for three months as Minister of Finance in the government of Mateusz Morawiecki.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Rzeczpospolita": Ignoring a police officer's order will be punished</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the newspaper, disregard of a specific behaviour order issued by a police officer is to be a new type of offence, punishable by a fine, arrest or restriction of liberty.</seg>
<seg id="3">Police unionists want to see such a change.</seg>
<seg id="4">The idea went to the Sejm Committee on Petitions.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The case is serious, because already every year over half a million misdemeanor cases are submitted to Polish courts," we read.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Commonwealth has established that the petition, which the Independent Police Trade Union is writing to MPs to amend the offences code, has a chance of success.</seg>
<seg id="7">The authors of the petition propose a new wording of Article 54a of the Offences Code.</seg>
<seg id="8">It would read: "Whoever does not comply with a request or order of a public official, issued within the limits and on the basis of the provisions of the Act, shall be subject to arrest, fine or restriction of liberty."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Paragraph 3 of this provision provides for an identical penalty for those who, by failing to obey orders, make it impossible or difficult to perform an official activity," the daily says.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski told Rzeczpospolita that even though he agrees with the main message of the proposal of the provision, he fears that if implemented, it could be used in political matters of manifestation.</seg>
<seg id="11">"In situations of freedom demonstrations, this would be unfavourable and instead of mitigating the situation, they would even exacerbate it," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="12">Statistics provided by the newspaper show that 86% of citizens have a positive view of police interventions in 2018 and that 1.5 million police interventions are carried out in the city every month.</seg>

<seg id="2">Though British travel agent Thomas Cook has collapsed, its Belgian subsidiary Neckermann is functioning.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the company has problems.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to VRT, Brussels Airlines has announced that it will cancel 105 flights in October due to problems related to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook.</seg>
<seg id="5">Neckermann also laid off 75 employees.</seg>
<seg id="6">All trips with an office that have been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but holidaymakers will be able to get a refund.</seg>
<seg id="7">The court in Ghent also declared the bankruptcy of three Belgian subsidiaries: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.</seg>
<seg id="8">Currently, about 12,000 Belgians are abroad on trips purchased from Thomas Cook.</seg>
<seg id="9">Another 40,000 people were expected to leave with the office by the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">As recently as Monday, Thomas Cook Belgium spokeswoman Leen Segers said the company was now "fully operational" despite the British parent company's bankruptcy filing, which caused concern among employees and customers.</seg>
<seg id="11">The office then reassured that customers who had purchased trips in it would go on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thomas Cook – the oldest and one of the largest travel agencies in the world – declared bankruptcy overnight from Sunday to Monday.</seg>
<seg id="13">The immediate cause of the bankruptcy was the collapse of last-ditch talks with creditors and potential investors on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="14">The creditors demanded that, in addition to the £900 million rescue plan already agreed in August, the company secure an additional $200 million as collateral for the winter, when travel agents tend to have lower turnover.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, the company's problems had been growing for several years, resulting in a debt of £1.6 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1">Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for your review</seg>
<seg id="2">Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – such an unusual offer has been prepared for newcomers by the German Görlitz.</seg>
<seg id="3">The measures are intended to help combat the progressive decline in the city's population.</seg>
<seg id="4">Görlitz is Germany's easternmost city.</seg>
<seg id="5">The beautiful pastel old town attracts 140 thousand tourists annually.</seg>
<seg id="6">But as The Guardian writes, the city is facing significant problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Görlitz has the lowest wages in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">The city also faces a steady decline in population.</seg>
<seg id="9">After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them left for the west of the country, resulting in a 25 percent decline in the city's population.</seg>
<seg id="10">In 2013 it was 54,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="11">In an effort to combat depopulation, officials came up with the idea of starting to offer free monthly accommodation in the city.</seg>
<seg id="12">The programme has so far received 150 applications.</seg>
<seg id="13">Two-thirds of them were submitted by residents of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="14">People from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom were also interested in the programme.</seg>
<seg id="15">"When we applied, we thought that the programme was to convince people to move to Görlitz," said one of the project participants.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Now we feel it doesn't matter if we stay here after four weeks or not," he added.</seg>
<seg id="17">The city has seven thousand vacant apartments and unemployment is three times higher than the national average.</seg>
<seg id="18">Although the city authorities hope that some will move permanently, the main aim of the program is to get the opinions of the participants of the program.</seg>
<seg id="19">The information gathered from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revive smaller German cities.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We want to know more about what people need and, if they decide to move, what their motivation was," said Robert Knippschild, responsible for the programme.</seg>
<seg id="21">Other cities have already experimented with ideas to lure new residents by offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first was Detroit, which introduced a program to pay promising young professionals to live and work in the city for a year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy, or in the American Tulsa, Oklahoma.</seg>
