<seg id="1">Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in white clothes</seg>
<seg id="2">He is a charismatic.</seg>
<seg id="3">The masses of the Holy Mass for his release and healing draw the crowds to him.</seg>
<seg id="4">He was about a dozen years old when things were happening inexplicable in his life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Today, through the Franciscans, others are experiencing this.</seg>
<seg id="6">The masses of the Holy Mass, celebrated by Fr Vito Viko for their release and healing, draw the crowds</seg>
<seg id="7">In the past, parents of a 7-month-old child came to him, who had a 7.5 mm hole in his heart.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was to be operated.</seg>
<seg id="9">Father Joseph Vitko prayed over him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later that day, the boy was taken to hospital for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="11">The astonished doctors said: "Operation is not necessary, the loss is only 1.5 mm."</seg>
<seg id="12">Parents cried for happiness.</seg>
<seg id="13">After another prayer, the Franciscan hole disappeared completely.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Spiritual remarkable acts of the Creator began to be experienced as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="15">In his dreams, Purgatory souls came to him asking for help.</seg>
<seg id="16">I was awakened at night and brought to prayer for the dead and for those who died at the moment – he recalls.</seg>
<seg id="17">He also experienced the presence of the evil spirit.</seg>
<seg id="18">And he had a vision of what happens to a man who commits a mortal sin.</seg>
<seg id="19">“My body has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="20">I lost my human qualities and started to look like an animal,” she says.</seg>
<seg id="21">The invisible force pushed him up, and he could not get his voice out.</seg>
<seg id="22">He felt that he was lost.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then God indicated salvation to him.</seg>
<seg id="24">“I was immersed in the waters of the river, which symbolized the holy baptism, and I was released and returned to the human figure...,” she says.</seg>
<seg id="25">He did not tell anyone about these strange experiences.</seg>
<seg id="26">There was a calling in him.</seg>
<seg id="27">He was 16 when he joined the Franciscans.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the sermons he wanted not only to talk about Jesus.</seg>
<seg id="29">He wanted people to experience Him living.</seg>
<seg id="30">Members of the charismatic Renewal Community in the Holy Spirit</seg>
<seg id="31">Vitko’s father’s healing masses are attended by many people who hope to get rid of the illness.</seg>
<seg id="32">The priest emphasizes, however, that their main purpose is spiritual healing, not bodily healing.</seg>

<seg id="1">The first defeat of Kolping FRAC Jarosław</seg>
<seg id="2">This afternoon, the Kolping FRAC team earned the current Polish champion Dartom Bogory Grodzisk Mazowiecki as part of the 3rd LOTTO Superliga Tenołowy.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ironing in a personal combination, as presented with the GOYIM, has little chance of winning over the sovereignty of the League.</seg>
<seg id="4">The match with Dartom Bogory showed this well.</seg>
<seg id="5">The team still lacks Chen Jingqi, the team leader.</seg>
<seg id="6">Maybe with him the blazing would have reached the third consecutive triumph in the new season.</seg>
<seg id="7">The young Asian Qiyao Han probably has not yet won with the Greek Panagiotis Gionis or the Czech Pavel Sirucek.</seg>
<seg id="8">Not even one of the most prospective Poles, that is, Mark Badowski.</seg>
<seg id="9">Hellady player was the biggest star of the match in the MOSiR at Sikorski Street in Jaroslavl.</seg>
<seg id="10">In both the clash with Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei, he was the class of himself.</seg>
<seg id="11">After three sets, Kolping led the FRAC 2:1.</seg>
<seg id="12">Kou Lei was probably hired by Mark Badowski, and Daniel Górak, after an emotional five-metre battle with Pavl Siruck.</seg>
<seg id="13">Then, however, it was worse.</seg>
<seg id="14">Gionis did not give Lei a chance.</seg>
<seg id="15">There was still hope of winning two points, but Qiyao Han failed to win Badowski.</seg>

<seg id="1">There will be no additional research for seniors.</seg>
<seg id="2">Why?</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the announcements by Rafal Trzaskowski, a free preventive research programme for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the idea will not be put into practice because the Ministry of Health and the Agency for the Protection of Medical Technologies and Tariffs have not been approved.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the explanatory statement, the agency explained that the target group had been wrongly selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">“The above actions can even lead to the detection of individual disease units, which can increase the difficulty of accessing the NFZ services and have a negative impact on the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort related to the false positive outcome of the research,” it says.</seg>
<seg id="7">The decision of the Ministry does not understand the President of the capital.</seg>
<seg id="8">“The money is ours, we have anticipated the money for it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only the government is afraid that if people get the test, they will then go to the doctor, which is absurd, because it is precisely to bring about a situation where prevention can be done more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="10">All specialists know that this helps when it comes to the burden of the health system, because it helps in the rapid detection of diseases and in a reliable approach to health.</seg>
<seg id="11">The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand,” said Rafal Trzaskowski.</seg>
<seg id="12">“I find it hard to imagine that expert experts are saying, “Let’s not investigate, because there will be longer queues with the doctor, and if such specialists advise the government, then I am not surprised that the health service is in such a state,” he added.</seg>

<seg id="1">Palestine corresponds to Israel: We will break all existing agreements</seg>
<seg id="2">Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said at a UN General Assembly session on Thursday that he would break all agreements with Israel if the future government of that country tried to fulfil the announcement made by Benjamin Netanyahu that the occupied Palestinian lands were annexed.</seg>
<seg id="3">“If the future government of Israel, which will come into being, proceed to make this plan a reality, we will void all signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all commitments,” he announced.</seg>
<seg id="4">“We reject the whole plan completely and completely,” threatened Abbas with pressure.</seg>
<seg id="5">“It is our duty to defend all of our rights by all possible means – no matter what the consequences will be – by fully committing ourselves to promoting the application of international law and the fight against terrorism,” declared the President of the Palestinian Authority, who had already made similar declarations in July.</seg>
<seg id="6">After the 17 September elections, Netanyahu, the current prime minister of Israel, again received a mission to form the government.</seg>
<seg id="7">A week before the elections, he announced that if he would win, he would declare the annexation of the Jordan Valley and intend to include all Jewish settlements in Israel throughout the West Bank.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the early 1990s Israel and the Palestinians, led by Jaser Arafat at the time, signed a series of peace agreements, under the auspices of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="9">The 84-year-old Abbas also promised to hold general elections in Palestinian lands during the UN General Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="10">The last one took place in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="11">"After returning to the country, I will convene local elections in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, and all those who would oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community", the solemn Palestinian President declared.</seg>
<seg id="12">Abbas also defended in his speech the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer at the United Nations, to enjoy the rights of “fully-fledged members of the UN and all its bodies and institutions”.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Palestinian leader ended his speech by calling on the international community to “enforce Israel to comply with the United Nations in full.”</seg>
<seg id="14">Israel’s Ambassador Danny Danon briefly responded to Abbas, declaring that the Palestinian leader “will focus on the efforts of the Palestinian Authority against Israel, rather than fighting against the calls for terrorism in the Autonomy under his leadership”.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, as reported by the agencies, Danon made no reference to the annexation of occupied Palestinian lands announced by Netanyahu.</seg>

<seg id="1">PLN 105 million for video game companies from the National Centre for Research and Development</seg>
<seg id="2">Nearly PLN 105 million of funding will go to companies from the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.</seg>
<seg id="3">The National Research and Development Centre announced the results of the GameINN programme on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Among the nearly 30 projects supported by the NCBR were the development of a platform for development of field games based on the AR game engine, which created a real-world map with an application for data transmission by users; a testing and training platform for practical verification of the workplace skills and professional development using VR and AI technologies; an innovative simulation game for managing real production processes using a novel model of the game based on the interaction of the virtual world with the real world using the concept of industry 4.0 – a PAP communication from the NCBR.</seg>
<seg id="5">The aim of the GameINN sector programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game sector in the global market by 2023.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the NCBR, the Polish video game sector is already growing at a rate of 10% per year.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 amounted to PLN 1.85 billion, and the forecast for 2019 was PLN 2.23 billion.</seg>
<seg id="8">“The GameINN research agenda, which has already been specifically prepared and has been supporting entrepreneurs with a sectoral programme of 300 million PLN, is an important impetus for the further dynamic growth of the Polish gamedev”, we read in the communication.</seg>
<seg id="9">The video game industry is an excellent example of how we can make the most of the potential we have in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="10">“The government’s incentives for entrepreneurs to innovate, such as R&amp;D rebates, competence upgrading programmes, IP boxes and support programmes implemented by NCBR stimulates the innovative activities of companies and allows them to compete more effectively in a highly competitive market,” says the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister of Science and Higher Education, Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the communication.</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of the Science Department points out that innovation money not only goes to innovators in the form of project co-financing, but is also in their pockets – three quarters of more entrepreneurs have benefited from R&amp;D in 2018 than they did a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="12">“The amount of the deducted costs relating to R&amp;D activities amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, which resulted in over PLN 300 million savings for companies benefiting from this relief.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is the equivalent of the support provided by the NCBR in the three GameINN editions,” underlines the Deputy Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="14">Dr. Wojciech Kamieniecki, Director of the NCBR, recalls that in two previous co-financing competitions with a total value of more than 211.2 million PLN, 78 innovative projects were awarded.</seg>
<seg id="15">The huge interest in the third contest and the variety of applications submitted show that the video game industry has ideas and competences to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.</seg>
<seg id="16">“It is particularly pleasing that among the projects identified – as in previous editions – there are projects for solutions that not only serve entertainment, but also for industry 4.0,” he adds.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the third GameINN competition for funding of up to 20 million PLN could be applied by entrepreneurs, consortia of entrepreneurs and consortia of companies with scientific units.</seg>
<seg id="18">The NCBR received 87 applications for the total amount of PLN 317 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">The budget of the competition at the time of the announcement of the competition amounted to PLN 100 million, but was increased, making 27 projects awarded almost PLN 105 million.</seg>
<seg id="20">Detailed information about the results of the GameINN III competition is available on ncbr.gov.pl.</seg>
<seg id="21">The GameINN sectoral programme is implemented within the framework of the Intelligent Development Operational Programme.</seg>
<seg id="22">The NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs associated in the Polish Games Agreement, which includes companies such as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team and 11 bit studios.</seg>

<seg id="2">Tehran has not entered into talks with the US side during the UN General Assembly in New York, despite the US offer of lifting sanctions, declared Iranian President Hasan Rowhani on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">U.S. President Donald Trump commented that it was the Iranian side that asked for the restriction to be lifted, which he refused.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Iranian President Hasan Rowhani, the Americans have proposed lifting all the sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for negotiating a new international agreement.</seg>
<seg id="5">It would regulate both Iran's nuclear programme and the ballistic missiles programme.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rowhani: Iran will not engage in the atmosphere of maximum pressure</seg>
<seg id="7">The Iranian President said he did not agree to take these talks because of the “toxic atmosphere”.</seg>
<seg id="8">He declared that he had met American diplomats because he had been impressed by France, Germany and the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id="9">He stressed, however, that Iran will not engage in talks in an atmosphere of “maximum pressure”.</seg>
<seg id="10">“And even if we want to negotiate with Americans in 5+1 format, no one can predict what the end result will be,” Rowhani said.</seg>
<seg id="11">The day before, the Iranian leader said that he was not excluding talks with the US and that European parties were accused of favouring US sanctions against Iran.</seg>
<seg id="12">He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran after the US emerged from the nuclear agreement were “the preconditions that do not allow” to enter into dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="13">If we can lift this precondition and if America lifts the sanctions and the maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America,’ he declared.</seg>
<seg id="14">He added that he did not rule out a meeting with US President Donald Trump, even though he did not agree to such a discussion at the UN General Assembly last week.</seg>
<seg id="15">Trump: "Iran asked, I said no"</seg>
<seg id="16">Donald Trump tweeted that it was he who rejected the request from the Iranian website.</seg>
<seg id="17">“Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.</seg>
<seg id="18">Of course I said 'no!'' tweeted the President of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="19">Tensions with nuclear agreement in the background</seg>
<seg id="20">France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to alleviate the tensions between Washington and Tehran in some form to rescue the 2015 agreement with Iran, of which they were signatories.</seg>
<seg id="21">It stipulated that, in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions, Iran would abandon its nuclear weapons programme and that the nuclear sector would be subject to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) control.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since the withdrawal of the US from the agreement in May 2015, the other signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to keep the agreement in force.</seg>
<seg id="23">None of this has come out of it for now.</seg>
<seg id="24">Washington is applying the tactics of maximum pressure to Iran, and sanctions include the full embargo on Iran's oil.</seg>
<seg id="25">Tehran has announced that if he does not receive a licence to export the raw material, he will limit his commitments to the agreement every 60 days.</seg>

<seg id="1">The judge of the Voivodeship Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of the hejter of Emilia, who, according to her words and screenshots of WhatsAppa, participated in the stalking against judges on Wednesday, was restored to the NSA's ruling.</seg>
<seg id="2">Reason: disciplinary proceedings have not been initiated against him, so there is no reason to uphold the order of the President of the WSA Wojciech Mazura to remove him from his duties.</seg>
<seg id="3">Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary spokesman at the NSA, initiated investigations against Szmydt at the end of August, but it has not yet turned into proceedings against him.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although the NSA, which in such cases acts as a disciplinary court, has to deal with the decision of the President of the WSA within one month of its issue.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this situation, the judge who spoke publicly about the mental problems of his wife in order to discredit her, who, because of suspicions of participation in the Hejterski group, was removed from the KRS office, will return to his judgment and will pass judgment on behalf of the Republic of Poland.</seg>
<seg id="6">Judge Szmydt denies his participation in the group.</seg>
<seg id="7">He claims that there is no evidence for this, except for the falsified screenshots and the words of his wife, with whom he is divorcing.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is exactly what the other judges associated with the "Caste" claim: they are all innocent, there is no evidence.</seg>
<seg id="9">And quite possibly they will bet on theirs.</seg>
<seg id="10">Because the prosecution did not stick with its fingers to secure the evidence from their electronic carriers, it also remains silent about the content of Emilija Szmydt's phone, which it stopped in June in another case.</seg>
<seg id="11">The police did not stick with their fingers in order to secure the equipment of people whom, as persecutors, Judge Waldemar Żurek pointed out in a February report.</seg>
<seg id="12">There is no evidence: there is no case of Szmydta, there is no case of "Kasty."</seg>
<seg id="13">Neither is the case of the head of the NIK Marian Banasia for renting a building to suteneers and hiding incomes.</seg>
<seg id="14">The CBA checks his property statements.</seg>
<seg id="15">And he will check when he will check.</seg>
<seg id="16">But the Deputy Ethics Commission will not take care of Banas, because the Sejm is suspended (but the Committee of State Control has somehow gathered to take a bizarre decision to cancel Banasia’s deputies and appoint his lawyer, although the law of such a strange combination does not provide for it).</seg>
<seg id="17">The whole reminds me of an American film novelty, I guess, about how the wife returns home and finds her husband in bed with a lover.</seg>
<seg id="18">He is so astonished and crushed that he cannot throw out a word.</seg>
<seg id="19">She is standing in the door shut down, and during this time the lover quickly jumps out of bed, dresses up and goes out.</seg>
<seg id="20">And the husband had a bed.</seg>
<seg id="21">When a wife regains her voice and shouts: what is it to be?</seg>
<seg id="22">Who is this woman?</seg>
<seg id="23">The husband is quietly asking: what woman, what kind of love?</seg>
<seg id="24">Only that the case of Casta or Banasia is a parody of the state.</seg>
<seg id="25">And it is not ridiculous at all.</seg>

<seg id="6">In the forthcoming elections, the prime minister's father is standing for the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="7">“I have a family and a politician in my life,” said Kornel Morawiecki in an interview, which two weeks ago he gave to the journalists of the Super Express.</seg>
<seg id="8">In January, "Super Express" reported that a 7-8-year-old Morawiecki Cornel was researched at the Military Hospital in Wrocław.</seg>
<seg id="9">“I had some strange, disturbing symptoms and went to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="10">It turned out that I have a yellow lady.</seg>
<seg id="11">But the worst was before me.</seg>
<seg id="12">When a computer tomography study was carried out, it was found that I had a pancreatic tumor...”, the prime minister’s father said.</seg>
<seg id="13">A few days later, Moravia Cornel underwent serious surgery at the IMSWiA Hospital in Warsaw.</seg>
<seg id="14">As Morawiecki said, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain, priest Zbigniew Kras, to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="15">The operation lasted about three hours and was successful.</seg>
<seg id="16">“I know that many people prayed for me, and I thank you very much for that.</seg>
<seg id="17">Fortunately, I have no metastasis.</seg>
<seg id="18">I don’t know if I will be undergoing chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="19">I give myself to specialist doctors, who are rather good-minded.</seg>
<seg id="20">For now, after this severe operation, I have to return to some kind of utility state.</seg>
<seg id="21">I hope that everything will be good,’ said Kornel Morawiecki in January in an interview with the “SE”.</seg>
<seg id="22">“If I had been too late, the situation would have been tragic, and I would have said goodbye to this fate...”, he added.</seg>

<seg id="1">The power of the Olivian jumps.</seg>
<seg id="2">The title of the coverage of amateur sporting events held on the Sunday afternoon of September 15 on a hypodrome at Oleandra Street in Oława may be misleading for some.</seg>
<seg id="3">For the real power is a long way to go, but this is what is referred to as one of the types of the contest...</seg>
<seg id="4">The competition of the power of the jump consists in overcoming by the rider and horse increasingly higher obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed as much as two metres.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is worth to add here that the world record set by Chilean Albert Larraguibel on the "Huaso" horse was 247 cm long and still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="6">Of course, nobody jumped so high in Oławie, but the result of the best local amaze at the level of 135 cm is not one of the worst...</seg>
<seg id="7">The competition organized by the tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other JKS JKS activists “In the Sodle” was a demonstration part of the "Rainbow Hearing Competitions" which were held somewhat earlier, and which are described in more detail in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.</seg>
<seg id="8">Eight amazing men were competing in the JKS.</seg>
<seg id="9">Four of them competed on the stove, four on the big horses.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the first group, Nikola Sołdra was best known for his crazy "Sprinter".</seg>
<seg id="11">This small but very dynamic rumor started by overcoming obstacles spread over a height of 40 cm, and ended only at a station with a 125 cm distance from the ground.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, it was easy not to give up, and only after three consecutive refusions was the jury removed from the competition from further competition.</seg>
<seg id="13">The second place in the jump was taken by Amelia Pawlak, who possessed the "Famy" and the third place by Lena Boruń in the "Harmider".</seg>
<seg id="14">Inga Aksman, the youngest participant in the tournament, galloping and jumping through obstacles to a small mare of "Carmen", fought amazingly.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even more emotions were accompanied by the starters of the amazon and the audience during the competition with the big horses.</seg>
<seg id="16">The grostes of the collapse included Paulina Szewczyk, who possessed a "Declaration" and Anastasia Abramenko, who was driving on "Lot".</seg>
<seg id="17">Fortunately, apart from fine trimmings, neither amazon nor horse bad happened, so they continued to participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="18">There were many problems with the introduction of a young maiden “Wineta” to the park, which was hosted by Weronika Łuczkiewicz.</seg>
<seg id="19">They needed either an assistant trainer or another horse to pair, behind which a little crazy "Wineta" was mad.</seg>
<seg id="20">When the obstacle from the park was recognised, she also slipped with a full duty, so in moments in the boxes and in the detergent it became dangerous. “Everything is under control!,” reassured Jan Sienkiewicz a bit of this frightened audience, especially the youngest ones.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since the beginning of the contest, Marta Masalska has been performing excellently on the park, with a beautiful presentation of "Whisky".</seg>
<seg id="22">This dignified mare, along with an experienced amazon, followed the second approach in the final phase, which was the first to jump 135 cm and was the best result of the competition at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="23">After a while, however, Paulina Szewczyk also counted the same height on the “Declaration”, Weronika Łuczkiewicz on the “Winet” and Anastasia Abramenko on “Lot”.</seg>
<seg id="24">The decoration of the floors and after the reception of the riding equipment, all of these athletes went together, and finally, together with the amazons on the cousins in the tact of Radecki's march, they made a successful round of honours, ending those interesting and emotional competitions.</seg>
<seg id="25">Acknowledgements</seg>

<seg id="3">The revolution addressed its proposal to young voters with right-wing views in particular.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the elections, Kolonko had announced his cooperation with Mark Jakubiak or Paul Kukiz, but none of these coalitions took place, and the Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko itself failed to gather enough signatures to issue letters in any of the Polish constituencies.</seg>

<seg id="9">On July 4, American Independence Day, a US-based journalist, Mariusz Max Kolonko, announced the formation of a new political group, the #R Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="10">In recent years, Kolonko has been famous for running Max TV on YouTube, where he comments on events in Poland and around the world.</seg>
<seg id="11">“We have enough politicians, enough of your dirty games, enough of your amateur governments.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is time for the authorities in the country to take the Nation and rule for the good of the Nation,” said Kolonko.</seg>
<seg id="13">The party's program included issues relating to the judiciary (should be elected in general elections), tax changes (equalisation of a tax-free amount for all), war reparations (in the form of military aid for countries in the eastern flanka of NATO, with particular emphasis on Poland), holding a referendum on the possession of weapons, limiting the number of members of parliament and the introduction of single-member constituencies.</seg>
<seg id="14">A few days after the new political formation was announced, Mariusz Max Kolonko began talks with Mark Jakubiak.</seg>

<seg id="2">“The euro exchange rate will remain around PLN 4.35 in the coming months, accompanied by a weak economic situation in the global markets,” says Michael Bolliger of UBS Wealth Management.</seg>
<seg id="3">“The expectations of maintaining a strong growth rate and a stable monetary policy are inclined to stabilise the golden ratings at the current ceiling,” says the specialist in an interview with Bankier.pl.</seg>
<seg id="4">In his opinion, despite the clear inflationary pressures, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide to increase rates in an environment in which the vast majority of central banks ease policies.</seg>
<seg id="5">“As long as the gold is properly valued, the Euro quotations should remain in the next few months in the area of the ceiling of 4.35 PLN – Polish bonds are unattractive.</seg>
<seg id="6">“Michael Bolliger, head of asset allocation in emerging markets with UBS Wealth Management, said: “We believe that emerging market bonds are much more favourable for Polish securities.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the expert, the main threat to the Polish economy is the global economic downturn.</seg>
<seg id="8">“Global slowdown may get worse, but there should not be a severe recession, and at most the GDP dynamics should go down slightly below zero,” says Michael Bolliger.</seg>
<seg id="9">“Investors should be under-represented in global actions that may be detrimental to the lack of prospects for a solution to the trade conflict between the US-China and other geopolitical risk factors, including the Donald Trump impeachment and brexit.</seg>
<seg id="10">The most vulnerable stock markets should behave in Europe, according to a recent letter to investors by the head of UBS Wealth Management Mark Haefele.</seg>
<seg id="11">“Actions from eurozone countries should behave worse than the US, because they are more susceptible to increased uncertainty around global trade and fears of slowdown,” the document says.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to Michael Bolliger, after the hossa on the bond markets of the safest countries pushed the profitability of Germany's 10-year-olds to a minus of 0.74 percent, it is still possible to exacerbate the decline in profitability.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the long term, however, the profitability of long-term securities should no longer fall, but only in the short term, by easing banks' monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Fed has the largest scope for lowering rates, which should lead to a weakening of the US currency over the next few years.</seg>
<seg id="15">The long-term balance for the euro is the ceiling of USD 1.29, which would mean a 19% potential for strengthening the single currency to the dollar.</seg>
<seg id="16">We expect further reductions in Fed rates, which will result in a reduction in the differences in monetary policy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="17">“Continuing the strength of the dollar in the long term may not allow the current and budgetary deficits,” says Michael Bolliger.</seg>

<seg id="3">Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehra has recorded the disappearance of 39 guns, 39 armaments and 19,445 ammunition units, according to a confidential statement in the defense of the Federal Republic of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="4">The press reported the news to the media group EdaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).</seg>
<seg id="5">According to a document from the parliamentary office of the Secretary of State in MON Peter Tauber (CDU), two weapons, one part of arms and 3474 ammunition, have been once again targeted.</seg>

<seg id="7">In addition, 30 guns for MG3 machine guns are missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">The situation was expressed by the Vice-President of the Left, Martin Renner.</seg>
<seg id="9">As the RND journalists have said, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is ‘frightening’.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is all the more true as the investigations have managed to find only a small fraction of the lost equipment.</seg>
<seg id="11">Martin Renner summarised the effects of these measures as a “poor balance sheet”.</seg>
<seg id="12">She also criticised the fact that it is not clear from the table whether there were weapons found during the investigation of the Bundeswehr Franco A. In December 2017, the Federal Prosecutor's Office in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence that threatened the security of the state and violated the provisions of the law governing access to firearms.</seg>
<seg id="13">The officer was accused of preparing attacks on leading German politicians for extreme right-wing and racist reasons.</seg>
<seg id="14">Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Greens, and Anetta Kahane, a human rights defender and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung foundation in Berlin, were included on his “blacklist” of goals that came into the hands of prosecutors.</seg>

<seg id="2">Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered in the capital on Friday to inaugurate a huge mosque, considered the largest in West Africa.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Muslims arrived by bus, by car and on foot in the Bopp neighborhood, where a new mosque could accommodate 30,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="4">The building was built by the Mouride Brotherhood, owned by the Sophie of Islam, which dominates Senegal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Work on the mosque began ten years ago in a wet area of six hectares, handed over by the government.</seg>
<seg id="6">The name of Massalikul Jinan mosque comes from the title of a poem by Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the nineteenth-century founder of the brotherhood, worshiped by followers as a saint.</seg>
<seg id="7">The mosque is embedded in the marble and has five minarets.</seg>
<seg id="8">The tallest one is 78 metres.</seg>
<seg id="9">The mosque in the middle can accommodate 15 thousand believers, and the second one can be in the outer esplanade.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the richly finite interior, you can admire the drawn dome, the giant chandeliers and the decorations manually made by Moroccan workers.</seg>
<seg id="11">Builders claim that the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but the edifice still has no comparison to mosques in other regions.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Morocco, the Hassan II mosque in Casablanca can hold 105,000 faithful.</seg>
<seg id="13">The construction of the mosque, which cost more than 30 million euros, was financed by private donations.</seg>
<seg id="14">The government, in addition to the land, has fed lighting, sanitary facilities and financed road works worth EUR 10.5 million.</seg>

<seg id="1">Lying Coach: Our problem is not Silesia, it is only we ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2">Passa of eight league matches without winning the Crown players will try to break off in Friday's meeting with the Vice-President of the Extra-Class of Silesia.</seg>
<seg id="3">“Our problem is not conglomerating, we only need to work on what we play,” emphasised the coach of Mirosław Smyła.</seg>
<seg id="4">Footballers of the Crown last and so far the only win in the league was in the first line when they defeated the 1–0 league match at the end of the season.</seg>
<seg id="5">Later, the glasses recorded two draws and six failures, and on Tuesday they lost 0:1 to Zagłębie Lubin in 1/32 of the Polish Cup final.</seg>
<seg id="6">“I am optimistic that in the last few seconds of the cup game the players fought for a goal, they wanted to draw.</seg>
<seg id="7">Their downfall on the grassland after the last whistle was not a result of the collapse, but it was a fall of anger, for they were so close,” said the Light.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he pointed out, Silesia has very strong wings, which is why it will make the team more intense in the side sectors of the pitch.</seg>
<seg id="9">“We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we also look at what we want to play,” added the coach.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Friday's game in the Crown certainly will not be paused for the excess of the yellow cards Ognjen Gnjatic, and the frame will also run out of injured James Żubrowski and Michael Gardawski.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, it is encouraging to sign up in the cup game for a number of players who are willing to play.</seg>
<seg id="12">“We have a headache, and recently it seemed that he was not going to be, and now he is,” said the Blessed One.</seg>
<seg id="13">Crown defender Daniel Dziwniel emphasized that Silesia would not be an easy rival to break the leg of eight league games in a row without winning, but in extra-class everyone can win with everyone.</seg>
<seg id="14">“We are a good team.</seg>
<seg id="15">In recent weeks, we may not show it on the field, but the moment will come when we will win and we believe it will be on Friday.”</seg>
<seg id="16">After nine queues of extradition, the Crown, with five points, ranks 15.</seg>
<seg id="17">Silesia gathered 12 more and ranks second.</seg>
<seg id="18">Friday match in Kielce will start at 20.30.</seg>

<seg id="1">These trees can completely disappear from Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">“42% of European tree species are at risk,” warns the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in the “Red Book of European Trees” published on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The head of the lists are chestnut and yarzębina.</seg>
<seg id="4">IUCN, an organisation based in Gland, Switzerland, is publishing a list of threatened European trees species for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was drawn up by specialists who, based on the research, concluded that of the 454 species of trees found in Europe (and elsewhere in the world) 42 percent were “highly endangered”.</seg>
<seg id="6">Among the causes of the Red Paper is the rapid growth of urban agglomerations and global climate change.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, the most vulnerable are those trees and bushes that are found only or mainly on our continent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As for typically European trees, 58% of species are threatened by IUCN specialists, and 15 percent, 66 species of trees and bushes, are threatened with extinction.</seg>
<seg id="9">Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Paper mentions the errors in the exploitation of timber, accelerated urbanisation, over-exploitation of trees, and, subsequently, forest fires and changes in the European ecostry.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of bushes, mosses and lichens is also under serious threat.</seg>
<seg id="11">“The consequences of human activities lead to the gradual disappearance of European plant species and pose a danger in Europe of extinction of important and undervalued varieties, which are the cornerstone of European ecosystems and have an impact on the health of the planet,” said Luc Bas, head of the European IUCN.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grzegorz Schetyna: I do not promise 600+</seg>
<seg id="2">“Today, PiS wants to bribe Poles, offering them for their freedom to distribute to the credit they will have to pay to future generations,” says Grzegorz Schetyna in an interview for “Rzeczpospolita”.</seg>
<seg id="3">In his view, “the whole policy of PiS is drinking”.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the same time, the politician promises that “what is given will not be taken away”.</seg>
<seg id="5">Schethin asserts in a conversation with Jack Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea to defeat the Law and Justice.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is about mobilising the electorate at the ballot box.</seg>
<seg id="7">In his opinion, the opposition has more potential in this area than the Kaczyński party.</seg>
<seg id="8">“Today, conscious people who want to live in a normal state are more than supporters of the PiS, a party that has misbelieved the declared values, such as humility, humility, transparency,” Schetyna says.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Leader of the Citizens’ Coalition and the Chairman of the Civic Platform also emphasised the basic principles of the KO’s electoral programme.</seg>
<seg id="10">“First of all, nothing given will be received, but we need to set the course for the future, because PiS only deals with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which can be seen even after dramatically low investments,” he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Secondly, it is a matter of “motivating the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work honestly – and those who are entrepreneurial”.</seg>
<seg id="12">Schetyna explains that the KO program includes a project that will give the least earning Poles 614 zlotys on hand and more earning money – also a few hundred each.</seg>
<seg id="13">The politician also pointed out that he does not want to prosecute the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="14">As he said, he would do as much as he could do, but he did not promise 600+.</seg>
<seg id="15">“I will never allow the Greek variant, where the rulers bid with opposition to the distribution until the financial collapse of the country finally took place,” he emphasised.</seg>
<seg id="16">Schetyna in an interview for "Rz" also stated that Jarosław Kaczyński and Matthew Morawiecki were afraid to debate with him and Małgorzata Kidawą-Błońska.</seg>
<seg id="17">“We would see their hypocrisy and propaganda,” he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">“Pride is walking before the fall.</seg>
<seg id="19">Kaczyński is a statesman like Banaś is crystal,” he added.</seg>

<seg id="2">Six dead big containers have been found in Santa Cruz Province, Argentina, as TVN24 says.</seg>
<seg id="3">Specialists believe that human activity has contributed to their deaths.</seg>
<seg id="4">The large circles have probably been poisoned with a means of killing predators such as pumas, foxes, and wild dogs.</seg>
<seg id="5">The animals could eat toxic carrion.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition to one young individual, the rest of the dead tractors were grown up.</seg>
<seg id="7">“This is a big damage to the environment, because the horse has to be 10–15 years old to become fertile and able to reproduce.</seg>
<seg id="8">So we are losing a protected species, an endangered species,” says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an environmental organisation in Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="9">“I think that the use of toxic bait and poison not only puts the species at risk, but all other forms of life, including human health,” he adds.</seg>

<seg id="2">Work has begun on granting the Heads of State a precious chain.</seg>
<seg id="3">The idea was backed by Andrzej Duda, a law firm, and we read in the “Republic”.</seg>
<seg id="4">As the newspaper explains, it is a golden chain of the Order of the White Eagle, the royal insignium officially called the jewel of the Republic of Poland during the interwar period.</seg>

<seg id="6">"Rz" says that soon such a chain can hit Andrzej Dudy's arms.</seg>
<seg id="7">On Wednesday, the Senate Committee on Human Rights, the Rule of Law and Petitions voted in favour of a proposal to amend the Law on Orders and Declarations to restore it.</seg>
<seg id="8">The newspaper writes that this is not the first attempt to restore this chain to the heads of state.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Senate already proposed such an amendment as early as 1992, but it was lost with one voice.</seg>
<seg id="10">This time the work is instant.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the beginning of August, Senators spent a few minutes on the matter, considering that they would consult the President’s Chancellery.</seg>
<seg id="12">This came in mid-September.</seg>

<seg id="4">On Friday, September 27, police officers begin to prevent “Solidar intersections” in Rzeszów.</seg>
<seg id="5">The aim is to eliminate traffic obstacles: entering a crossroads without the possibility of a reunion, failing to follow traffic signals or road signs.</seg>
<seg id="6">“We often think that we are alone at the crossroads, and in fact we make life difficult for other drivers,” said Marek Ustrobiński, vice-president of the city, a few days ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">His words were picked up at the town hall press conference, where the city authorities presented examples of car traffic inadequate at crossroads, resulting in traffic jams.</seg>

<seg id="2">“The officials of the Environment Department of Wołomiński County County Environmental Protection and District Construction Supervision Inspectorate visited a plant in the municipality of Zielonka on Friday, where waste from the “Czajka” wastewater treatment plant in Warsaw is disposed of,” said the spokesman of the Italian-Volombian Karol Szyszko.</seg>
<seg id="3">The inspectors from Wołomiński’s old age carried out inspections at a plant in the forests in the Municipality of Zielonka.</seg>
<seg id="4">Under the contract with the ‘Czajka’s Capital Waste Treatment Site, the private commercial and transport unit ‘Dar-Trans’ provides services for the management of rainwater waste.</seg>

<seg id="6">He added that the audit report will be forwarded to, among others, the Provincial Inspectorate for Environmental Protection in Warsaw.</seg>
<seg id="7">The most recent audit in Dar-Transie was carried out by the Voivodship Inspectorate of Environmental Protection in Warsaw from 29 December 2015 to 11 February 2016.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was then determined that the company had not taken samples, measurements and groundwater testing and had no results of stabilised municipal sewage sludge from the ‘Czaika’ waste water treatment plant.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Senate passed without amendment the law on the disclosure of the family property of the most important civil servants and the flight of the most important people in the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">The amendment to the Act on the property of the families of civil servants - without amendments - voted for 52 senators, 14 against, three abstained.</seg>
<seg id="4">The senators therefore decided to reject the 12 amendments tabled by Senator Sławomir Rybicki during the debate on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to him, the amendments were to ‘civilise’ the law and limit the scope of information given in the declaration of the financial situation of children of their own, of the children of the spouse, of children who were fit for use in cases where children were in a common household with a person obliged to make a declaration.</seg>
<seg id="6">The law on the openness of the property of the families of the most important civil servants, whose draft was drafted in the Prime Minister’s office, was passed by the Sejm on 11 September.</seg>
<seg id="7">The provisions stipulate that, inter alia, prime ministers, ministers, MEPs, senators, presidents: the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as those heading other state institutions, will be obliged to include in the declaration of property information about personal property of spouses, children and persons who are in common use.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Senate also did not propose amendments to the Act on the flight of the most important people in the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">It regulates what HEAD flights are and who can be on board the government airplanes together with the most important people in the country.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Act also specifies who is responsible for running the Central Flight Register.</seg>
<seg id="11">In favour of the bill – without amendments – 55 senators voted in favour, 12 against, four abstained.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the Act, each flight of the president will be a flight "on the official mission".</seg>
<seg id="13">The president will be able to accompany the family members and others invited by the president.</seg>
<seg id="14">On the other hand, the flight in the mission of the official prime minister and the marshals of the Sejm and the Senate will be only a flight “awarded for tasks directly related to the function.”</seg>
<seg id="15">The Act also clarifies the list of persons who may accompany the most important persons in the country during the flight.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the rules, members of the delegation may be boarded on the plane – invited Members, senators, representatives of the public authorities and experts; persons providing technical, medical or organisational services, as well as journalists.</seg>
<seg id="17">In accordance with the Act, in the event of doubts arising from the flight of the Marshal of the Sejm and the Senate, the head of the NPRM will ask for their clarification.</seg>
<seg id="18">If such doubts are not clarified within the time limit, the head of the NRM will be obliged to notify the heads of the Chancellery of the Sejm or the Senate of the inability to organise such a flight.</seg>

<seg id="6">According to the students attending the classes, the world's champions trainer was upset.</seg>
<seg id="7">As Heynen's assistant Michał Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not just to exercise the volleyball elements.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We went to the hall, but the majority was the band's time.</seg>
<seg id="9">The idea was to spend it more together than to train.</seg>
<seg id="10">Talk, think about how to rebuild all this as a team”, he reported.</seg>
<seg id="11">He confirmed that the semi-final defeat was a painful lesson for both players and training staff.</seg>
<seg id="12">“We were brutally brought to the ground.</seg>
<seg id="13">Without two opinions, we are disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="14">We still believed that we would return to the match.</seg>
<seg id="15">We discussed this game with each other in the staff, the trainer talked to a lot of players.</seg>
<seg id="16">As two of the main reasons for the failure, I would point out ineffectiveness in the attack and, much worse than usual, the handling of balls.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Slovenians were much better than us in this respect,” he analysed.</seg>
<seg id="18">In his view, the ‘Bell and Red’ precluded the stress of a performance against the co-hosts of the tournament, supported by a loud and large audience.</seg>
<seg id="19">He admitted that the world's masters could sleep somewhat the smooth way to the semi-finals.</seg>
<seg id="20">“It may be that, if a similar style of failure had occurred in the group phase, we would have analysed the lesson more quickly and otherwise we would be playing in the later stages of the tournament.</seg>
<seg id="21">But it's just a while," he shot.</seg>
<seg id="22">Gogol hopes that the anger associated with the defeat of Poles on Thursday will manage to turn into aggression in the game for bronze.</seg>
<seg id="23">“I hope that we will show our true face then.</seg>
<seg id="24">There is something to beat about.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nick Kyrgios: a harsh punishment, but suspended</seg>
<seg id="2">The Australian tennis player received a $25,000 $25,000 ban on start-ups and a six-month suspension fine for reprehensible words, gestures and deeds during the last ATP tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="3">ATP World Tour activists are losing patience with Kyrgios, but still give him the chance to improve.</seg>
<seg id="4">Summary of the performances of the most unchallenged professional tennis player in recent years looks threatening – 16 weeks break plus a significant fine, but both fines are suspended for half a year – a trial period in which a recalcitrant athlete can improve.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he has long been breaking up and has made a world record of tennis – he has to pay the highest ever discipline single financial penalty for breaking the rules of behavior in and around the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="6">Loud curses, strange gestures, non-sport behaviour, offending the judge and spectators, breaking two rockets during a losing game against Karen Chaczanov – all after the August Masters 1000 in Cincinnati, he paid $113 000.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the US Open 2019 he also played a long time, but he was able to publicly say that ATP activists are "corrupt," which hurt the organization's authorities so much that they implemented a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and after a few weeks gave the verdict on suspension of the start and the next fine.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, he was forgiven to speak of corruption after hearing the guilty and knowing the context of his speech.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, in their explanatory statement, the tennis activists stated that the investigation had shown that Kyrgios’ behaviour over the past 12 months had in many cases raised serious objections and constituted an almost continuous violation of the rules, and that it had repeatedly insulted those involved in tournaments and spectators, hence a high penalty.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately deferred the enforcement of the judgment by ordering him to meet a number of conditions in the next six months: in the ATP Tour and the ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgios tournaments, he can no longer infringe the rules of the code of conduct of professional tennis players, in particular he can no longer curse, destroy rockets, argue with judges and the public, or behave indecently and in any other way.</seg>
<seg id="11">He also received a recommendation that he should seek “continuous support” from mentor coaches during the tournaments, and also consulted people specialising in dealing with the problems of athletes who did not cope with the correct behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="12">The first comment (on social media) Nick Kyrgios to the verdict was: "Hey, I can still play.</seg>
<seg id="13">I just have to control my behavior, that’s all.”</seg>
<seg id="14">In practice, the Australian will have a break of at least two weeks, as he was heavily injured in the Lavera Cup and had to give up the next races in Beijing (September 30–6 October) and Shanghai (6–13 October).</seg>
<seg id="15">In the ATP ranking, Kyrgios is ranked 27th.</seg>
<seg id="16">This year he won two tournaments – in Washington D.C. and Acapulco, he earned over $1.3 million, so even after fines he will be left to do so.</seg>

<seg id="1">GUS: In Poland you live better and better</seg>
<seg id="2">According to a report on household budgets published by the CSO on Friday, as many as 44 per cent of households were judged as good or rather good by their financial situation.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the previous year, the percentage was 37.2 percent, in 2016 it was 33.5 percent, and in 2009 it was never more than 30 percent since the statistical office first examined subjective assessments of the situation of households.</seg>
<seg id="4">The total of 8.1% of households considered their situation bad or rather bad, compared with 11.2% in the previous year and more than 20 percent in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="5">The best financial situation is for the households of the self-employed.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this group, more than 70 per cent of respondents think that it is good or rather good.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the other hand there are households with pensions, where the proportion of such responses was only 18%.</seg>
<seg id="8">The number of children also has a major influence on the subjective assessment of the financial situation of households.</seg>
<seg id="9">The worst way is for single-parent families, of which 32 percent declare a good or rather good material situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">The proportion of couples with children varies between 55 and 60 % (depending on the number of children) and 48.8 % among non-children.</seg>
<seg id="11">The effects of the 500+ programme are clearly visible in these statistics.</seg>
<seg id="12">Before its commencement (in 2016) the worst material situation was assessed by single-parent families and large families (with at least three children).</seg>
<seg id="13">Improving subjective evaluations of the financial situation of Poles is a reflection of the rapid growth in income, above all from work.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, that is not all, because the percentage of households that think their situation is good increases faster than real incomes.</seg>
<seg id="15">Moreover, at the level of the voivodships there is no clear relationship between the income level and the assessment of the material conditions of households.</seg>
<seg id="16">The best evaluations are made by the residents of the Opole region, where 48.9% of those surveyed believe their situation to be good or rather good.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Lubuskie voivodships (47.7%), Silesian voivodeships (47.6%), Mazowieckie (47.3%), and West Pomeranian voivodeships (47.1%).</seg>
<seg id="18">Meanwhile, in Opole, disposable income (i.e. after paying taxes and contributions) amounted to less than 94% of the national average, and in Lubusk, 98% of the total.</seg>
<seg id="19">The highest incomes were from residents of Mazowiecki (120 percent of the national average) and Silesian (104 percent).</seg>
<seg id="20">On average, in Poland, disposable income per person was PLN 1693.</seg>
<seg id="21">In real terms (after the adjustment on the impact of price changes) increased by 4.3% as compared to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="22">Against the background of previous years this is a fairly low result.</seg>
<seg id="23">In 2016, per capita income increased by 7 percent and a year later by 6.3 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24">While income growth slows down, it also hampers the increase in expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="25">These per capita amounts amounted to PLN 1,187 per person, which means that in real terms they fell by 0.7%.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is the first such case since 2013.</seg>
<seg id="27">In 2017, expenditure per head increased by 1.9% in real terms and by 4.3% in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="28">Household budget surveys suggest that a statistical household currently spends 70.1% of its disposable income, while in 2014, the share exceeded 80%, and by 2006 it exceeded 90%.</seg>

<seg id="1">Niesiolowski is critical of the Pope.</seg>
<seg id="2">John Paul II did nothing</seg>
<seg id="3">In a conversation with Piotr Lekszycki Stefan Niesiołowski stressed that in 1981 John Paul II was a great authority for opposition activists.</seg>
<seg id="4">‘Appropriately every one of his opinions were accepted.’</seg>
<seg id="5">Later, there was criticism of some of his actions.</seg>
<seg id="6">“For me, it is that John Paul II was not able to eliminate the harmful activities of Rydzyk that cast a big shadow over his pontificate.</seg>
<seg id="7">After all, this redemptorist – the pest of the Church and Poland – developed his media into the best in the lives of the pope Poles,” he explained.</seg>
<seg id="8">Former PO politician admitted: "There were statues of dissatisfaction, the Pope said something, at one time Rydzyk did not accept, but he had the power and politicianhip he could simply throw him out of the Church or send him to a mission to New Caledonia or to Fiji to raise money for the poor.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, John Paul II did not do this, just as his successor did,” explained Niesiolowski.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Furthermore, the fatal case of paedophilia and the Church's activities, or indeed their absence, has come to pass.</seg>
<seg id="11">I had a little thought forward, but I wanted to draw attention to the whole of his life.</seg>
<seg id="12">We have known about the scale of paedophilia in the Church since relatively recently.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question arises as to how it is possible that John Paul II, as the head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting matters,” he says in a conversation with journalist Niesiołowski.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Polish Church is an ally of PiS.</seg>
<seg id="15">“We must admit that during the period of Solidarity the Church was our most important ally.</seg>
<seg id="16">All the celebrations began with the Holy Mass, and crosses were hanging everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now these crosses are spelling, they have become a symbol of dictatorship – a sign of the regime in spelling.</seg>
<seg id="18">I repeat: one of the most unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk are shaking the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing about this and that the Church is today an ally of PiS.</seg>
<seg id="19">This is the black chapter of the Polish Church, for which he will pay dearly," argued Niesiołowski.</seg>
<seg id="20">“I hope that Pope Francis will pogrom Jędraszewski, Rydzyk and some others of this kind,” he concluded.</seg>

<seg id="2">“The effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small-scale trade, it will be necessary to consider whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade,” said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, leader of the Jarosław Gowin Alliance.</seg>
<seg id="3">Gowin, during a conversation in the “Signals of the Day” in Jedynka, stated that trade is controlled by international networks that impose such low margins on Polish producers that, in fact, Polish companies cannot grow.</seg>
<seg id="4">Noting that it is very difficult to fight this problem, Deputy Prime Minister reminded that the PiS government tried to tackle this at the very beginning of his term of office, but he got a “play from the EC”.</seg>
<seg id="5">“We have won a court of justice, and I hope that if the United Right wins the next elections and formulates a government, we will return to this subject,” he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He also pointed out that ‘the effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish, or small-scale, trade’.</seg>
<seg id="7">“We will have to consider whether the government, the state, has some instruments to stimulate Polish trade,” Gowin said.</seg>
<seg id="8">In May, the EU court ruled that the European Commission had made a mistake in recognising that the Polish retail tax was an unlawful state aid.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Law on Retail Tax stipulated the introduction of two tax rates on trade: 0.8% on revenues between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4% on revenues above PLN 170 million per month.</seg>
<seg id="10">The tax was to apply as of September 2016.</seg>
<seg id="11">In September 2016, the EC initiated infringement proceedings against Poland.</seg>
<seg id="12">Brussels argued at the time that the tax structure could favour smaller shops, which could be considered public aid.</seg>
<seg id="13">It then found that the manpower had been unlawfully implemented.</seg>
<seg id="14">It also issued an order to suspend the application of the tax until its examination by officials in Brussels.</seg>
<seg id="15">Poland disagreed with this position, but the tax collection was suspended.</seg>
<seg id="16">The decision of the EU court in May opened the way for the reintroduction of the tax, but it did not finish the case.</seg>
<seg id="17">On 24 July, the Commission lodged an appeal at the Court of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="18">On Thursday, the TSEU press services sent the PAP that the case is now in a written stage in which both the European Commission and the Polish Government put forward their arguments in writing.</seg>
<seg id="19">For the time being, it is not clear whether and when the oral procedure will start, that is to say, the parties' hearing and any hearing.</seg>
<seg id="20">It takes a good few to a dozen months from appeal to the judgment.</seg>

<seg id="1">How to dress up a baby for baptism?</seg>
<seg id="2">We offer some practical solutions</seg>
<seg id="3">Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of the infant and his parents.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is often the first time that the whole family focuses on a child, celebrating his or her appearance in the world.</seg>
<seg id="5">No wonder the freshly baked mothers and dad want their comfort to look as good as possible on this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, before you make the final decision as to whether your child's outfit will be comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the shops you can find a lot of flats that do not provide the little ones with the necessary comfort.</seg>
<seg id="8">So what is to be taken into consideration?</seg>
<seg id="9">The basic criterion for choosing baptism is the age of the child</seg>
<seg id="10">Until recently, baptisms of several weeks were carried out in white sets and inserted into the same bricks or great spirits.</seg>
<seg id="11">Today, children joining the sacrament are often older: several months, one year, and even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's not hard to guess that such a big comfort needs a little different dress for baptism.</seg>
<seg id="13">So if your child is 3-4 months old on the day of his baptism, he will probably spend the ceremony in the wheelchair either on the hands of his parents or godmothers.</seg>
<seg id="14">The best way to do this would be to decorate it in a comfortable, cotton-totalized sleep or compound.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although this element of the wardrobe is regarded as a daily dress, it is enough to look for its sacred variants, for example with a coron or a coroner.</seg>
<seg id="16">For the boy, the body with the printing of the shells and shrubs will prove to be the perfect one.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the case of older children, you can afford more fantasy in the dress.</seg>
<seg id="18">The girl will look beautifully in a simple dress dress.</seg>
<seg id="19">Many of the parents of girls with drowsiness look at the richly decorated, folding dresses at baptism complexes with plates, bandages and caps.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers are using artificial, unsuccessful materials in which the child is simply uncomfortable.</seg>

<seg id="2">British parliamentarians voted against a three-day break in the House of Commons' meeting for the Conservative Party's annual programme conference, as requested by the government.</seg>
<seg id="3">289 MEPs voted against 306.</seg>
<seg id="4">The House of Commons usually does not meet at party conferences, so that Members do not have to resign from either the party or the parliamentary meetings.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, opposition parties have recognised that during such a crucial time as the last few weeks before the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 31 October, Parliament should not be interrupted.</seg>
<seg id="6">289 MEPs voted in favour of the government requesting a break, 306 against.</seg>
<seg id="7">The two opposition parties after the conventions</seg>
<seg id="8">The disagreement with the interruption may be seen as a political vengeance by the opposition on Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend the parliament for five weeks (Tuesday, the decision was declared unlawful and unusual by the Supreme Court) and for the fact that he does not wish to apologise after the judgments of the judges.</seg>
<seg id="9">Following this ruling, the House of Commons resumed the session on Wednesday, and the most important event of the day was Johnson's speech and the subsequent turbulent debate.</seg>
<seg id="10">Johnson accused the opposition of blocking the brexitu and avoiding early elections.</seg>
<seg id="11">“The time has come to realize the brexit.</seg>
<seg id="12">It must be implemented in order to respect the outcome of the referendum.</seg>
<seg id="13">Brexit must come so that we can deal with the priorities of the citizens, the health service, the cost of life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Brexit must be realised so that we can unite the country,” Johnson said.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Conservative Party Conference is due to start in Manchester this Sunday and will run until Wednesday 2 October.</seg>
<seg id="16">The two main opposition groups, the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats, have already held their conferences.</seg>

<seg id="7">He referred to the words of Israeli Foreign Minister Israeli Israeli Katz, who stated in February that “Polish people have degraded anti-Semitism with maternal milk”.</seg>
<seg id="8">Andrzej Duda said that he regrets that Israel has not apologised for the humiliating statements of its politicians.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also mentioned the act of aggression at the Polish Ambassador to Israel, Marek Magierowski.</seg>

<seg id="2">Lent by the suters, the building has led the journalist to discover the negligence of Marian Banasia's asset statements.</seg>
<seg id="3">We summarise another scandal that has shaken the ruling camp.</seg>
<seg id="4">The TVN’s “Superviser” journalists have revealed that Marian Banaś, President of the Supreme Chamber of Control, has not entered into the property statement of a 400-meter building on the Krakow Podgórz.</seg>
<seg id="5">Moreover, the rider was supposed to lead him in this sex business building (and thus rent his rooms for hours).</seg>
<seg id="6">On the other hand, the building itself was supposed to have been a security for repayment of the loan since 2016.</seg>
<seg id="7">The irregularities were highlighted by Bertold Kittel in the ‘Superwizjer’ programme.</seg>
<seg id="8">Journalist revealed that Banasia had rented a building to people associated with the criminal world to use it as a place of ‘erotic meetings’.</seg>
<seg id="9">The clients were supposed to be men using the services of prostitutes.</seg>
<seg id="10">Banaś replied vaguely and vaguely to the allegations.</seg>
<seg id="11">Interestingly, the stonehouse hired by the suters led the journalist to discover negligence in the declarations of financial interests of Banasia.</seg>
<seg id="12">The building itself was described in them unclearly, and the income from the rent was to be underestimated.</seg>
<seg id="13">“The estate of Mariana Banasia and his wife can be worth between PLN 6 and 8 million.</seg>
<seg id="14">In total, spouses can boast of two houses, three flats, savings[...]", writes Money.pl.</seg>
<seg id="15">And, according to the analysis of the portal, the Banasia building itself was worth around PLN 3 million.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Central Anti-Corruption Anti-Corruption Office is currently in control of Marian Banasia's asset statements for the years 2015-2019.</seg>
<seg id="17">Banaś announced that he would suspend his activities in NIK by the time it was completed. “I will come to your Marshal for free leave,” he assured.</seg>
<seg id="18">The opposition demands clarification.</seg>
<seg id="19">“We do not hear that the CBA expands its investigation or accelerates the examination of Marian Banasia’s asset statements.</seg>
<seg id="20">That is why we are forced to cut out the state authorities and notify them of the possibility of committing a crime ...”, said Mr Mariusz Witczak, PO-KO.</seg>
<seg id="21">“If a normal Pole had blatantly low prices for renting their property, he would already have 10 checks, tax controls and criminal-tax procedures,” he added.</seg>
<seg id="22">It went up high, fell down low</seg>
<seg id="23">Marian Banaś is the new President of the Supreme Chamber of Control.</seg>
<seg id="24">He was appointed to this post on 30 August 2019, for a 6-year term.</seg>
<seg id="25">His candidacy was proposed by the Law and Justice and the votes of the politicians of that party adopted.</seg>
<seg id="26">Previously, Banaś was associated with the NIK between 1992 and 2005, and he worked as a co-worker with Lech Kaczyński.</seg>
<seg id="27">During the first PiS reigns (2005–08), Banaś held the post of President of the Customs Service and, in addition, a Undersecretary of State at the Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="28">Since 2015, he has once again been a member of the table of the head of the Customs Service, and since 2017 he has been managing the National Tax Administration.</seg>

<seg id="8">It would read as follows: ‘Whoever does not comply with the request or recommendation of a public official issued within the limits and under the provisions of the Law shall be subject to the imprisonment, fine or restriction of freedom’.</seg>

<seg id="1">Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for your review</seg>
<seg id="2">Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – such an unusual offer was made by Görlitz, a German visitor.</seg>
<seg id="3">The actions are intended to help combat the growing decline in the population of the city.</seg>
<seg id="4">Görlitz is Germany's easternmost city.</seg>
<seg id="5">The beautiful pastel old town attracts 140 000 tourists annually.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, as he writes, "The Guardian", the city faces considerable problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Görlitz there are the lowest wages in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">The city is also struggling with a permanent loss of population.</seg>
<seg id="9">After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them left for the west of the country, resulting in a 25% decline in the city's population.</seg>
<seg id="10">In 2013, the population was 54,000.</seg>
<seg id="11">In order to combat depopulation, officials came up with the idea of offering monthly accommodation in the city free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the time being, 150 applications have been submitted to the programme.</seg>
<seg id="13">Two thirds of them were laid down by the inhabitants of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="14">The programme also attracted interest from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id="15">“When we applied, we thought the programme was meant to get people to move to Görlitz,” said one of the project participants.</seg>
<seg id="16">“Now we feel that it doesn’t matter whether we stay here after four weeks or not,” he added.</seg>
<seg id="17">The city has seven thousand free apartments and unemployment is three times the average across the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">Although municipalities hope that some will move permanently, the main objective of the programme is to obtain the opinion of the programme participants.</seg>
<seg id="19">Information collected from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revitalise smaller German cities.</seg>
<seg id="20">“We want to learn more about what people need and if they decide to move – what motivated them,” said Robert Knippschild.</seg>
<seg id="21">Other cities have already experimented with ideas to lure new residents, offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first was Detroit, which introduced a program to pay promising young professionals for life and work in the city for a year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikyther to Candela in Italy, or Toulouse in Oklahoma.</seg>
