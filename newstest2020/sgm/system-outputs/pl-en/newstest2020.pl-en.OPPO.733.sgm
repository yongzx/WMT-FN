<seg id="1">Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in a white robe</seg>
<seg id="2">He is charismatic.</seg>
<seg id="3">Crowds gather for the Holy Mass for his release and healing.</seg>
<seg id="4">He was several years old when inexplicable things began to happen in his life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Today, through the Franciscan, others experience this.</seg>
<seg id="6">Crowds gather for the Holy Mass celebrated by Fr Witko for release and healing</seg>
<seg id="7">The parents of a 7-month-old baby who had a 7.5mm hole in his heart once came to see him.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was to be operated on.</seg>
<seg id="9">Father Joseph Witko prayed over him.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the same day, the boy was taken to the hospital for surgery.</seg>
<seg id="11">Astonished doctors ruled: "Surgery is not needed, the loss is only 1.5 mm."</seg>
<seg id="12">My parents cried with happiness.</seg>
<seg id="13">After another Franciscan prayer, the hole disappeared completely.</seg>
<seg id="14">The clergyman began to experience the extraordinary actions of the Creator as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="15">In his dreams, purgatory souls came to him asking for help.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I was awake at night and urged to pray for the dead and those who were dying at the moment," he recalls.</seg>
<seg id="17">He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.</seg>
<seg id="18">And he had a vision of what was happening to a man who was committing mortal sin.</seg>
<seg id="19">"My body started to change.</seg>
<seg id="20">I lost my human qualities and started to take on the appearance of an animal, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="21">The invisible force lifted him up, he couldn't get his voice out.</seg>
<seg id="22">He felt he was lost.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then God showed him salvation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Immersed in the waters of the river symbolizing baptism, I was released and returned to human form...," he says.</seg>
<seg id="25">He did not tell anyone about these strange experiences.</seg>
<seg id="26">His vocation matured in him.</seg>
<seg id="27">He was 16 years old when he joined the Franciscans.</seg>
<seg id="28">In his sermons he wanted not only to talk about Jesus.</seg>
<seg id="29">He wanted people to experience Him alive.</seg>
<seg id="30">Members of the Charismatic Community Renewal in the Holy Spirit</seg>
<seg id="31">Many people participate in the healing masses celebrated by Father Witko, who hope to get rid of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="32">The priest emphasizes, however, that their main purpose is spiritual healing, not bodily healing.</seg>

<seg id="2">This afternoon (26 September this year) Kolping frac team deservedly lost at home to the current Polish Dartom champion Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki as part of the third round of the LOTTO Super League Table Tennis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Jaroslavs, in the kind of personal combination they presented with the bulwarks, have little chance of winning against the league sovereigns.</seg>
<seg id="4">This was clearly shown by the duel with Dartom Bogoria.</seg>
<seg id="5">The team is still missing, hailed as the team's leader, Chen Jingqi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Perhaps with him in the lineup, the Jaroslavs would reach their third straight victory in the new season.</seg>
<seg id="7">The young Asian Qiyao Han has probably not yet grown up to win against the likes of the Greek Panagiotis Gionis or the Czech Pavel Sirucek.</seg>
<seg id="8">Not even with one of the most promising Poles, Marek Badowski.</seg>
<seg id="9">The player from Hellada was the biggest star of the match in the MOSiR hall at Sikorskiego Street in Jaroslaw.</seg>
<seg id="10">Against both Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei, he was a class unto himself.</seg>
<seg id="11">After three matches, Kolping frac led 2-1.</seg>
<seg id="12">Kou Lei probably outplayed Marek Badowski and Daniel Gorak after a thrilling five-set fight - Pavel Siruck.</seg>
<seg id="13">But then it got worse.</seg>
<seg id="14">Gionis did not give Leia a chance.</seg>
<seg id="15">One could still hope to win by two points, but Qiyao Han did not match Badowski.</seg>

<seg id="1">There will be no additional research for seniors.</seg>
<seg id="2">Why</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Rafal Trzaskowski, a program of free preventive examinations for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not been approved by the Ministry of Health and its subordinate Agency for Health Technology Protection and Tariff.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the explanatory statement, the agency explained that the target group was poorly selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The above actions may even result in the detection of individual disease units, which may exacerbate difficulties in accessing NHS services and adversely affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with a falsely positive test result," the authors wrote.</seg>
<seg id="7">The decision of the ministry is not understood by the president of the capital.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The money is ours, we've provided the money for that.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only the government is afraid that if people examine themselves, they will go to the doctor later, which is absurd, because it is about bringing about a situation where prevention can be done more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="10">All specialists know that this helps when it comes to the burden on the health system, because it helps in the rapid detection of diseases and in a reliable approach to health.</seg>
<seg id="11">The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand ", said Rafal Trzaskowski.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It is difficult for me to imagine that expert specialists say: Let us not examine ourselves, because there will be longer queues at the doctor, and if such specialists advise the government, I am not surprised that the health service is in such a state", added the politician of the Civic Platform.</seg>

<seg id="1">Palestine responds to Israel: We will break all existing agreements</seg>
<seg id="2">Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced at a session of the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday that he would tear up any agreements reached with Israel if the country's future government tried to meet Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement of annexation of occupied Palestinian lands.</seg>
<seg id="3">"If the future government of Israel, which will be formed, proceeds to make this plan a reality, we will cancel all signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all commitments made," he said.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We will reject the whole plan completely and completely," Abbas threatened with pressure.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It is our duty to defend all our rights by all possible means - no matter what the consequences - by fully engaging in the application of international law and in the fight against terrorism," said the Palestinian Authority president, who had already made similar declarations in July.</seg>
<seg id="6">Netanyahu, Israel's former prime minister, was again tasked with forming a government after the Sept. 17 election.</seg>
<seg id="7">A week before the election, he announced that if he won, he would annex the Jordan Valley and intend to include all Jewish settlements across the West Bank in Israel.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, led by Yasser Arafat at the time, signed a series of peace agreements sponsored by the United States.</seg>
<seg id="9">Abbas, 84, also promised to hold general elections on Palestinian soil during a session of the United Nations General Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="10">The last one took place in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="11">"When I return home, I will call local elections in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, and all those who oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community," the Palestinian president solemnly declared.</seg>
<seg id="12">Abbas also defended in his speech the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer at the United Nations, to exercise the rights of "full members of the United Nations and all its bodies and institutions."</seg>
<seg id="13">The Palestinian leader concluded his speech by calling on the international community to "force Israel to comply with the United Nations with all due respect."</seg>
<seg id="14">Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas' speech, stating that the Palestinian leader "prefers to focus at the United Nations on the Palestinian Authority's efforts against Israel rather than fight against calls for terrorism in the Authority under his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="15">But Danon, the agencies note, made no reference to Netanyahu's announced annexation of occupied Palestinian lands.</seg>

<seg id="1">PLN 105 million for video game companies from the National Centre for Research and Development</seg>
<seg id="2">Almost PLN 105 million of funding will go to companies from the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Friday, the National Centre for Research and Development announced the results of the third edition of GameINN.</seg>
<seg id="4">Among the nearly 30 projects supported by the National Centre for Research and Development were, among others, the development of a platform for creating field games based on the AR game engine creating a map of the real world with an application enabling data transmission by users; a test and training platform for verifying practical skills at the workplace and professional development using VR and AI technologies; an innovative game simulating the management of real production processes using an innovative gameplay model based on the interaction of the virtual world with the real world using the concept of Industry 4.0, according to a release from the National Centre for Research and Development sent to PAP on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="5">The aim of the GameINN sector programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish sector of video game producers on the global market in the perspective of 2023.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the National Centre for Research and Development (NCBR), the Polish video game sector is already growing at a rate of 10 percent per year.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 amounted to PLN 1.85 billion, while the forecast for 2019 is PLN 2.23 billion.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The specially prepared GameINN research agenda and support for entrepreneurs already reaching PLN 300 million under this sector programme are an important impetus for the further dynamic growth of the Polish gamedev", reads the release.</seg>
<seg id="9">The video game industry is an excellent example of effective use of the potential we have in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="10">"The incentives introduced by the government for entrepreneurs focusing on innovation, such as R &amp; D reliefs, competence improvement programmes, IP box and support programmes implemented by the National Centre for Research and Development, drive innovative activities of companies and allow them to compete more effectively in a very competitive market", says Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education Jaroslaw Gowin, quoted in the release.</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of the Ministry of Science points out that money for innovation not only goes to innovators in the form of financing projects, but also stays in their pockets - three-quarters more entrepreneurs benefited from the R &amp; D relief in 2018 than a year earlier.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The amount of deducted costs concerning R &amp; D activities amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, which resulted in over PLN 300 million in savings for companies benefiting from this relief.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is the equivalent of the support provided by the National Centre for Research and Development in three editions of GameINN ", emphasizes the Deputy Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Director of the National Centre for Research and Development, Dr. Wojciech Kamieniecki, reminds that in the previous two funding competitions with a total value of over PLN 211.2 million, 78 innovative projects were awarded.</seg>
<seg id="15">The huge interest in the third competition and the variety of applications show that the video game industry has ideas and competences to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It is particularly pleasing that among the selected projects - as in previous editions - there are projects concerning solutions not only for entertainment, but also related to industry 4.0", he adds.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the third GameINN competition, entrepreneurs, consortia of entrepreneurs and consortia of entrepreneurs with scientific units could apply for funding amounting to up to PLN 20 million.</seg>
<seg id="18">The National Centre for Research and Development received 87 applications for a total amount of funding of approx. PLN 317 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the time of the announcement of the competition, the budget of the competition was PLN 100 million, but it was increased, thanks to which 27 projects were awarded almost PLN 105 million in funding.</seg>
<seg id="20">Detailed information about the results of the 3rd GameINN competition is available at NCBR. Gov. pl.</seg>
<seg id="21">The GameINN sector programme is implemented within the framework of the Smart Growth Operational Programme.</seg>
<seg id="22">The National Centre for Research and Development (NCBR) launched the program in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs associated with the Polish Games Agreement, which includes companies such as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team and 11 bit studios.</seg>

<seg id="2">The incident took place on 16 September.</seg>
<seg id="3">Dolberg, who joined Nice from Ajax Amsterdam at the end of August, realised his watch had disappeared from the dressing room after training.</seg>
<seg id="4">Not just anything, because it is worth EUR 70 thousand.</seg>
<seg id="5">A furious Dane did not show up for class the next day, citing stomach problems.</seg>
<seg id="6">The case was mysterious from the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="7">Players in the dressing room have private safes at their disposal and the club area is monitored.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to AFP, Diaby-Fadig eventually confessed to the theft.</seg>
<seg id="9">The 18-year-old has already apologised to Dolberg and the rest of his team-mates and coach Patrick Vieira.</seg>
<seg id="10">He also promised to return the money for the watch to the Dane.</seg>
<seg id="11">Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising young footballers in France.</seg>

<seg id="2">Tehran did not engage in talks with the U. S. side at the U. N. General Assembly in New York despite an offer by the Americans to lift sanctions, Iranian President Hassan Rowhani said Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">U. S. President Donald Trump commented that it was the Iranian side that asked for the lifting of the restrictions, which he disagreed with.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Iranian President Hassan Rowhani, the United States has proposed lifting all sanctions on Tehran in exchange for negotiating a new international agreement.</seg>
<seg id="5">It would regulate both Iran's nuclear program and its ballistic missile program.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rowhani: Iran won't engage in talks amid maximum pressure</seg>
<seg id="7">Iran's president said he refused to engage in the talks because of the "toxic atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="8">He said he had met with American diplomats because he had succumbed to the urging of France, Germany and the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, he stressed that Iran would not engage in talks in an atmosphere of "maximum pressure".</seg>
<seg id="10">"And even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in the 5 + 1 format, no one can predict what the end result will be," Rowhani said.</seg>
<seg id="11">A day earlier, the Iranian leader said he did not rule out talks with the United States, and accused the European parties to the nuclear deal of favoring U. S. sanctions on Iran.</seg>
<seg id="12">He added that sanctions imposed on Iran after the U. S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal "are a precondition that does not allow" dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="13">"If we can lift this precondition and if America lifts sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America," he declared.</seg>
<seg id="14">He added that he did not rule out meeting with U. S. President Donald Trump, even though he did not agree to such a conversation in the past week at the U. N. General Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="15">Trump: 'Iran asked, I said not'</seg>
<seg id="16">Donald Trump tweeted that he was the one who rejected the Iranian side's request.</seg>
<seg id="17">'Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions on them so we could meet.</seg>
<seg id="18">Of course, I said 'no!' The US President slammed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Tension with nuclear agreement in the background</seg>
<seg id="20">France, Germany and Britain are trying to ease tensions between Washington and Tehran in some form to salvage the 2015 deal with Iran, to which they were signatories.</seg>
<seg id="21">It stated that in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions, Iran would abandon its nuclear weapons programme and put the nuclear sector under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).</seg>
<seg id="22">Since the U. S. withdrew from the agreement in May 2015, other signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to keep the agreement in place.</seg>
<seg id="23">So far, nothing has come of it.</seg>
<seg id="24">Washington has used tactics to exert maximum pressure on Iran, and sanctions also include a full embargo on Iranian oil.</seg>
<seg id="25">Tehran has said it will cut back on its commitments under the deal every 60 days if it is not allowed to export the material.</seg>

<seg id="1">A judge of the Provincial Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of heiress Emilia, who she said and screenshots from WhatsApp participated in stalking the judges, were reinstated by the NSW Supreme Court on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="2">Reason: No disciplinary proceedings have been initiated against him, so there is no basis to uphold the order of the President of the JSA Wojciech Mazur to remove him from his duties.</seg>
<seg id="3">Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary officer at the NSW Supreme Court, opened an investigation into Szmydt at the end of August, but it has not yet evolved into proceedings against him.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although the Supreme Court, which acts as a disciplinary court in such cases, must deal with the decision of the President of the JSA within a month of its release.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this situation, the judge, who publicly talked about his wife's mental problems in order to discredit her, who was removed from the office of the National Court Register due to suspicions of participation in the heist group, will return to adjudication and issue judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.</seg>
<seg id="6">Judge Shmydt denies his involvement in the hush money group.</seg>
<seg id="7">He says there is no evidence of this except for fake screenshots and the words of his wife, with whom he is divorcing.</seg>
<seg id="8">Exactly the same claim is made by other judges associated with the "caste": Everyone is innocent, there is no evidence.</seg>
<seg id="9">And it is quite possible that they will bet on their own.</seg>
<seg id="10">Because prosecutors did not nod their fingers to secure evidence from their electronic media, they are also silent about the contents of Emilia Szmydt's phone, which she stopped in June in another case.</seg>
<seg id="11">Police did not nod their fingers to secure the devices of people whom Judge Waldemar Zurek pointed out as persecutors in a February report.</seg>
<seg id="12">There is no evidence - there is no Szmydt case, there is no "Caste" case.</seg>
<seg id="13">There is also no case of the head of the National Audit Office Marian Banasia for renting a tenement house to pimps and hiding income.</seg>
<seg id="14">The CBA is reviewing his financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="15">And it will check when it checks.</seg>
<seg id="16">Whereas the Commission of Parliamentary Ethics will not deal with Banasi because the Seym is suspended (but the Commission of State Control somehow gathered to make a bizarre decision about dismissing Banasi's deputies and appointing him as acting lawyer, although the law does not provide for such a strange combination).</seg>
<seg id="17">The whole thing reminds me of a film novel, American I think, about how my wife comes home and finds her husband with his lover in bed.</seg>
<seg id="18">She is so astonished and devastated that she cannot expectorate the word.</seg>
<seg id="19">She stands in the door speechless, and during this time her lover quickly jumps out of bed, dresses up and leaves.</seg>
<seg id="20">And my husband rubs the bed.</seg>
<seg id="21">When his wife regains her voice and shouts, "What is it supposed to be"</seg>
<seg id="22">Who is this woman</seg>
<seg id="23">The husband calmly asks: What woman, darling</seg>
<seg id="24">Only that in the case of "Caste" or Banasia there is a parody of the state.</seg>
<seg id="25">And that's not funny at all.</seg>

<seg id="8">In January, Super Express reported that 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki had been admitted to the Military Hospital in Wroclaw for examination.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I developed strange, worrying symptoms and went to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="10">It turned out I had jaundice.</seg>
<seg id="11">But the worst was in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the CT scan was done, it was found that I had pancreatic cancer... ", the Prime Minister's father said.</seg>
<seg id="13">A few days later, Kornel Morawiecki underwent a major operation at the Ministry of Interior hospital in Warsaw.</seg>
<seg id="14">As Morawiecki told us, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain Father Zbigniew Kras to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="15">The operation lasted about three hours and was successful.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I know that many people prayed for me, for which I thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="17">Fortunately, I don't tend to metastasize.</seg>
<seg id="18">I don't know if I'm going to undergo chemotherapy yet.</seg>
<seg id="19">I put myself in the hands of specialist doctors who are rather good at it.</seg>
<seg id="20">For now, after this difficult operation, I have to return to some state of use.</seg>
<seg id="21">I hope that everything will be fine ", noted Kornel Morawiecki in an interview with SE in January.</seg>
<seg id="22">"If I had been tested too late, the situation would have been dire and I would have said goodbye to that paddock already..."</seg>

<seg id="1">The power of Olawski jumps.</seg>
<seg id="2">The title of the coverage of the amateur sports competition, held on the Sunday afternoon of September 15 at the Hippodrome on Oleandra Street in Olawa, may be misleading for some.</seg>
<seg id="3">For, the road to real power is a long way away, but this is the name of one of the types of horse competition...</seg>
<seg id="4">The competition of the power of jumping consists in the rider and horse overcoming higher and higher obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed even two meters.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is worth noting here that the long-term and still unbeaten world record, set back in 1949 by Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on the horse "Huaso", is 247 cm.</seg>
<seg id="6">Of course, nobody jumped so high in Olawa, but the result of the best local amazons at the level of 135 cm is also not one of the worst...</seg>
<seg id="7">The competition, organized by the tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other activists of JKS "In the saddle", was a demonstration part of the "Rainbow Equestrian Competition" held there a little earlier, about which we write more in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.</seg>
<seg id="8">Eight Amazons entered the competition, training in horse riding in Olawski JKS.</seg>
<seg id="9">Four competed on ponies and four on large horses.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the first group, Nikola Szoldra performed best, sitting on the crazy "Sprinter".</seg>
<seg id="11">This small but very dynamic steed started by overcoming obstacles spread at a height of 40 cm, and ended only at the station with the upper beam 125 cm away from the ground.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he did not give up easily and only after three consecutive refusals was he removed from the competition by the jury.</seg>
<seg id="13">The second place in the pony jumping was taken by Amelia Pawlak, sitting on "Fama", and the third place by Lena Borun on "Harmider".</seg>
<seg id="14">Ambitiously fought the youngest participant of the tournament - Inga Aksman, galloping and jumping over obstacles on the small mare "Carmen".</seg>
<seg id="15">Even more emotions accompanied the competing Amazons and spectators during the competition with the participation of large horses.</seg>
<seg id="16">Dangerous looking falls included Paulina Szewczyk, sitting on the "Declaration" and Anastasia Abramenko, who rode the "dart".</seg>
<seg id="17">Fortunately, apart from minor bruises, neither the Amazon nor the horses were harmed, so they continued to participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="18">Weronika Luczkiewicz had a lot of problems with introducing the young mare "Wineta" to the park.</seg>
<seg id="19">You needed either the assistance of a trainer or another horse for the pair, followed by a little crazy "Wineta".</seg>
<seg id="20">After passing the obstacle from the parkour, she also went down a full inch, so at times in the cubicles and in the expansion room it became dangerous. "Everything is under control!", reassured Jan Sienkiewicz a little scared viewers, especially the youngest ones.</seg>
<seg id="21">From the beginning of the big horse competition Marta Masalska did a great job on the park, sitting on the beautiful looking "Whisky".</seg>
<seg id="22">This dignified mare, paired with an experienced amazon, was the first to jump 135 cm after the second attempt in the final stage and that was the best result of the competition at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="23">After a while, however, Paulina Szewczyk on the "Declaration", Veronika Luczkiewicz on the "Wineta" and Anastasia Abramenko on the "lot" also scored the same height.</seg>
<seg id="24">To decorate the flo and to receive prizes in kind in the form of equestrian equipment, all these competitors left together, and finally, together with the Amazons on ponies in the rhythm of Radecki's march, they performed an impressive round of honor, ending this interesting and exciting competition.</seg>
<seg id="25">Thank you</seg>
<seg id="26">Equestrian Sports Club "W Siodle" would like to thank the sponsors of the power jump competition during the 16th "Rainbow Equestrian Competition": The Municipal Office in Olawa, the Water Supply and Sewerage Plant in Olawa, the District Office and the company "Mustang".</seg>

<seg id="2">KWW The Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko is the name of the electoral committee under which the political formation # R Revolution of Mariusz Max Kolonko was to go until the October parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="3">The revolution directed its proposal especially to young voters with right-wing views.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the elections, Kolonko announced cooperation with Marek Jakubiak or Paul Kukiz, but none of these coalitions took place, and the KWW Patriotic Revolution itself did not even manage to collect enough signatures to issue lists in any constituency in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now Kolonko has announced on Twitter that he has ended his cooperation with KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I will expect the abovementioned KWW to remove my name from the name.</seg>
<seg id="7">I kindly ask you not to connect me with the abovementioned entity, "he added and announced that he would provide more information soon.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is not yet known whether the journalist will continue his activities or whether this is the end of the # R Revolution formation.</seg>
<seg id="9">On July 4, American Independence Day, Mariusz Max Kolonko, a journalist in the United States, announced the formation of a new political formation - # R Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="10">In recent years, Kolonko has become famous for hosting the Max TV channel on YouTube, where he comments on events in Poland and around the world.</seg>
<seg id="11">"We are fed up with politicians, fed up with your fool's games, fed up with your amateur governments.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is time for the authorities in the state to take over the Nation and rule for the good of the Nation, "Kolonko said at the time.</seg>
<seg id="13">The party's agenda included issues such as the judiciary (it should be elected in general elections), tax changes (equalising the tax-free amount for all), war reparations (in the form of military aid to NATO eastern flank countries, with particular emphasis on Poland), holding a referendum on gun ownership, limiting the number of MPs and introducing single-member constituencies.</seg>
<seg id="14">A few days after the announcement of the formation of a new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko entered into talks with Marek Jakubiak.</seg>
<seg id="15">In late July, Kolonko posted a message on his social media page suggesting that # R would join forces with the Kukiz '15 movement.</seg>

<seg id="2">"The euro exchange rate will remain around the ceiling of PLN 4.35 in the coming months, accompanied by a weak economic situation on global markets", says Michael Bolliger from UBS Wealth Management.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Expectations of maintaining a solid pace of economic growth and stable monetary policy speak in favour of stabilising the zloty at the current ceiling", says the specialist in an interview with Bankier. PL.</seg>
<seg id="4">In his opinion, despite the clear inflationary pressure, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide to raise rates in an environment in which the vast majority of central banks are easing policy.</seg>
<seg id="5">"While the zloty is properly valued - euro prices should remain around the ceiling of PLN 4.35 in the coming months - according to him, Polish bonds are not very attractive.</seg>
<seg id="6">Bonds from emerging markets offer much more favorable yields than Polish stocks, "says Michael Bolliger, head of asset allocation for emerging markets with UBS Wealth Management.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the economic downturn in the world.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The global slowdown may get even worse, but there should be no severe recession, and at most GDP growth should go slightly below zero," predicts Michael Bolliger.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Investors should underweight global equities, which may be hurt by the lack of prospects for a resolution to the US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including the impeachment process of Donald Trump and Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among equity markets, Europe should be relatively the least behaved, "according to a recent letter to investors by UBS Wealth Management Chief Executive Mark Haefele.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Euro zone stocks should behave worse than U. S. stocks because they are more vulnerable amid heightened uncertainty around global trade and fears of a slowdown," the document said.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to Michael Bolliger, after a boom in bond markets in the safest countries pushed German 10-year yields as low as minus 0.74 percent, it is still possible to deepen the fall in yields.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the long term, however, the yields on long-term securities should no longer fall, but only on short-term securities, thanks to the easing of the banks' monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Fed has the biggest room to cut rates, which should lead to a weakening of the U. S. currency over the next few years.</seg>
<seg id="15">The long-term balance point for the euro is the ceiling of USD 1.29, which would mean a 19% potential to strengthen the single currency against the dollar.</seg>
<seg id="16">We expect further Fed rate cuts, which will result in a narrowing of monetary policy differences around the world.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Current and budget deficits may not allow the dollar to maintain its strength in the long term," says Michael Bolliger.</seg>

<seg id="2">Confidential report of the German Ministry of Defence</seg>
<seg id="3">Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehr has recorded the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and 19,445 rounds of ammunition, according to a confidential list compiled by the German Ministry of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="4">The information was reported by the press belonging to the media group RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).</seg>
<seg id="5">According to a document from the office of the Parliamentary Secretary of State in the Ministry of Defence Peter Tauber (CDU), two weapons, one part of a weapon and 3474 rounds of ammunition have so far been retraced.</seg>
<seg id="6">Among the military equipment still missing are six MG3 universal machine guns, 11 G3 automatic rifles, four G36 automatic rifles, six signal pistols and two P8 pistols.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, there are 30 barrels missing for MG3 machine guns.</seg>
<seg id="8">The situation was expressed by the vice-president of the Left Party, Martina Renner.</seg>
<seg id="9">She told RND journalists that the number of missing weapons and ammunition was "an alarming figure.</seg>
<seg id="10">All the more so because, as a result of the investigations, only a small part of the lost equipment was found.</seg>
<seg id="11">Martina Renner summed up the effects as a "paltry balance sheet."</seg>
<seg id="12">She also criticized the fact that the list does not show whether there are also weapons found during the investigation into Bundeswehr Lieutenant Franco A. In December 2017, federal prosecutors in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence that threatened national security and violating the provisions of the law governing access to firearms.</seg>
<seg id="13">The officer was accused of preparing attacks on leading German politicians for far-right and racist reasons.</seg>
<seg id="14">His "blacklist" of targets, which fell into the hands of prosecutors, included then-Justice Minister Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green Party and Anetta Kahane, a human rights activist and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung Foundation in Berlin.</seg>

<seg id="2">More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not be coming to Majorca in October after Thomas Cook declared bankruptcy on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Marc Pons, a representative of the autonomous Balearic Islands government, among the 25,000 holidaymakers who will not be able to take an October holiday in Majorca are also people who were supposed to travel with companies indirectly associated with Thomas Cook, such as Neckermann.</seg>
<seg id="4">PONS explained that 80% of the expected holidaymakers who had to give up their holiday in Majorca next month due to the collapse of the British company are German and Scandinavian nationals.</seg>
<seg id="5">But, Pons says, with Thomas Cook failing to divert tourists to the Balearic island between November and April, the damage to the local economy will be less.</seg>
<seg id="6">He revealed that the Balearic government had already begun negotiations with international operators to "enter the Majorca market" following the bankruptcy of the British operator.</seg>
<seg id="7">Estimates from the Diario de Mallorca newspaper show that more than 1,000 people will lose their jobs in October due to the tourism crisis in Majorca.</seg>
<seg id="8">About 800 are laid off employees at Thomas Cook's Palm Beach office.</seg>
<seg id="9">Other people will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Monday, with Thomas Cook filing for bankruptcy at many Majorca hotels, property owners demanded that guests pay an additional overnight fee.</seg>
<seg id="11">This situation was experienced, among others, by dozens of tourists from Poland.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Balearic government estimates that by Thursday, dozens of hotels in Majorca had ceased operations until at least the end of October after Thomas Cook and its affiliates filed for bankruptcy.</seg>
<seg id="13">And Friday's Diario de Ibiza newspaper points out that most of the hotels operating in Ibiza that have worked with the Thomas Cook group have no intention of closing in the coming weeks.</seg>
<seg id="14">The newspaper reminds us that on this Balearic island the British bankrupt cooperated with 42 hotels.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Wednesday, the autonomous Balearic Islands government announced that it would ask the Spanish government to support the region with 100 million euros to cover losses caused by Thomas Cook's bankruptcy.</seg>
<seg id="16">They revealed that the largest number of tourists affected in the archipelago, about 36,000 people, are in Majorca.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to Balearic government data, Thomas Cook is owed around 5 million euros by local travel companies, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of contracts for the July-September 2019 period.</seg>

<seg id="2">Asked on ZET radio how many of his party's candidates could enter the Sejm from the lists of leftist parties (KW SLD, whose list includes candidates for the SLD, Spring and Left Together Sejm, running with the common logo "Left"), Zandberg replied that it depended on the outcome of the committee.</seg>
<seg id="3">"I believe that the result of the Left will be very good because we feel that people have hope that the Left is not only right anymore, but also has strength," he said.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Zandberg, it follows that the left can have 60-80 members.</seg>
<seg id="5">"This could mean that the Circle or Club Together will have a dozen MPs.</seg>
<seg id="6">But it depends on Polish women and Poles.</seg>
<seg id="7">I'm not going to guess and tell you how it's going to happen, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Asked if Left Together would have a separate circle, Zandberg replied: "We are arranged to be diverse, and we are not going to pretend that diversity doesn't exist.</seg>

<seg id="2">Tens of thousands of people from across Senegal gathered in the capital on Friday for the inauguration of the huge mosque, believed to be the largest in West Africa.</seg>
<seg id="3">Muslims arrived by bus, car and on foot to the Bopp district, where a new mosque with a capacity of 30,000 worshippers stood.</seg>
<seg id="4">The building was built by the Mouride Brotherhood, part of the Sufi Islamic movement that dominates Senegal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Work on the mosque began a decade ago in a six-hectare wetland area donated by the government.</seg>
<seg id="6">The name Massalikul Jinan Mosque ("Paths to Paradise") comes from the title of a poem by Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the 19th century founder of the fraternity, revered by his followers as a saint.</seg>
<seg id="7">The mosque is covered with Carrara marble and has five minarets.</seg>
<seg id="8">The highest of them is 78 meters.</seg>
<seg id="9">The mosque inside will accommodate 15,000 worshippers, and the second so many can stay on the outer esplanade.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the richly finished interiors you can admire the gilded dome, giant chandeliers and decorations handmade by Moroccan workers.</seg>
<seg id="11">Builders say the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but the edifice still bears no comparison to mosques in other regions.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Morocco, the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca can accommodate 105,000 worshippers.</seg>
<seg id="13">The construction of the mosque, which cost more than EUR 30 million, was financed by private donations.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition to the land, the government has funded lighting, sanitation and road works worth EUR 10.5 million.</seg>

<seg id="1">Coach Smyla: Our problem is not Silesia, but ourselves</seg>
<seg id="2">The streak of eight league matches without a victory will be broken by the Crown players in Friday's meeting with the runners-up of the Silesian Premier League.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Our problem is not Wroclaw, but ourselves, we have to work on what we play," emphasized coach Miroslaw Smyla.</seg>
<seg id="4">The last and so far only victory in the league was recorded in the first round, when they defeated the Rams 1-0 on the road.</seg>
<seg id="5">Later, the trolls recorded two draws and six losses, and on Tuesday they lost 1-0 to the Lubin Basin in the first round of the Polish Cup.</seg>
<seg id="6">"It fills me with optimism that in the final seconds of the cup match the players were fighting for a goal, they wanted to draw.</seg>
<seg id="7">Their fall to the turf after the final whistle was not due to a breakdown, it was a fall of anger because they were so close, "Smyla said.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he noted, Silesia has very strong wings, so it will sensitize the team to playing in the side sectors of the pitch.</seg>
<seg id="9">"We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we are also looking at what we want to play."</seg>
<seg id="10">Ognjen Gnjatic, who is sidelined for excess yellow cards, will certainly not play in Friday's match at the Crown. Jakub Zhubrowski and Michael Gardawski will also be missing from the squad with injuries.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, it is encouraging to register in a cup match several players with a desire to play.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We have a headache, recently it seemed like it wasn't going to be there, and now it is," Smyth said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Crown defender Daniel Dziwniel stressed that Silesia will not be an easy rival to break the streak of eight league matches in a row without a win, while in the Premier League anyone can win against anyone.</seg>
<seg id="14">"We are a good team.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We may not be showing that on the pitch in recent weeks, but there will come a point where we will be winning and we believe it will be on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="16">After nine rounds of the Premier League, the Crown are in 15th place with five points.</seg>
<seg id="17">Silesia has accumulated 12 more and is in second place.</seg>
<seg id="18">Friday's game in Kielce starts at 8: 30 p.m.</seg>

<seg id="1">These trees could completely disappear from Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">"42 percent of the tree species that make up Europe's woodlands are threatened," the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) warns in its Red List of European Trees published on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the top of the list are chestnut and rowan.</seg>
<seg id="4">The IUCN, based in Gland, Switzerland, publishes a list of endangered European tree species for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was drawn up by experts who, based on the study, concluded that of the 454 tree species found in Europe (and elsewhere in the world), 42 percent are "highly endangered."</seg>
<seg id="6">Among the causes of the Red Paper are the rapid growth of urban agglomerations and global climate change.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, the most endangered are those trees and shrubs that occur only or mainly on our continent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As far as typical European trees are concerned, 58 percent of species are at risk, according to IUCN experts, and 15 percent, 66 species of trees and shrubs, are at risk of extinction.</seg>
<seg id="9">Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Paper lists errors in the exploitation of trees, accelerated urbanisation, excessive felling of trees, followed by forest fires and changes in the European ecosystem.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of shrubs, mosses and lichens is also under serious threat.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The consequences of human activity lead to the gradual disappearance of European plant species and pose a threat to the extinction of important and underestimated varieties in Europe, which form the basis of European ecosystems and affect the health of our planet," concluded the report by Luc Bas, who heads the IUCN's European office.</seg>

<seg id="1">Gregory Schetyna: I don't promise 600 +</seg>
<seg id="2">"Today the Law and Justice party wants to bribe Poles by offering them a handout for freedom on a loan that future generations will have to pay off", says Grzegorz Schetyna in an interview for "Rzeczpospolita".</seg>
<seg id="3">In his opinion, "the whole policy of the Law and Justice party is a pic."</seg>
<seg id="4">At the same time, the politician promises that "what is given will not be taken away."</seg>
<seg id="5">Schetyna assures Jack Nizinkevich that he has an idea to defeat Law and Justice.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is about mobilising the electorate at the ballot box.</seg>
<seg id="7">In his opinion, the opposition has more potential in this area than Kaczynski's party.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today, there are more conscious people who want to live in a normal state than supporters of the Law and Justice party, a party that has betrayed proclaimed values such as modesty, humility, transparency," says Schetyna.</seg>
<seg id="9">The leader of the Civic Coalition and the chairman of the Civic Platform also marked the basic assumptions of the KO electoral programme.</seg>
<seg id="10">"First of all, nothing that is given will be received, but we need to set the direction for the future, because the Law and Justice party deals only with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which can be seen even from dramatically low investments", he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Secondly, it is about 'mobilising the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work reliably - and those who are enterprising'.</seg>
<seg id="12">Schetyna explains that the KO program includes, among others, a project that will give the lowest earning Poles more money by 614 zlotys per hand, and more earners - also several hundred.</seg>
<seg id="13">The politician also indicated that he did not want to race for handouts.</seg>
<seg id="14">He will do as much as he can, he said, but he doesn't promise 600 +.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I will never allow the Greek option, where the rulers bid with the opposition for handouts, until the financial collapse of the country finally took place," he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="16">Schetyna also said in an interview that Jaroslaw Kaczynski and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Malgorzata Kidawa-Blonska.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We would expose their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Pride looms before the fall.</seg>
<seg id="19">Kaczynski is such a statesman as Banas is crystal clear, "he added.</seg>

<seg id="4">Large condors are thought to have been poisoned with a means of killing predators such as cougars, foxes and wild dogs.</seg>
<seg id="5">The animals may have eaten toxic carcasses.</seg>
<seg id="6">Apart from one young individual, the rest of the dead condors were adults.</seg>
<seg id="7">"This is a big loss to the environment because the condor needs to reach 10-15 years to become fertile and capable of reproduction.</seg>
<seg id="8">So we are losing a protected species, an endangered species, "says Luis Jaccome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentine environmental organization.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I think the use of toxic bait and poison puts not only this species at risk, but all other forms of life, including human health," he adds.</seg>

<seg id="2">Work has begun to grant the head of state a precious chain.</seg>
<seg id="3">The idea was supported by Andrzej Duda's office - we read in 'Rzeczpospolita'.</seg>
<seg id="4">As the newspaper explains, it is a gold chain of the Order of the White Eagle, the royal insignia officially called the jewel of the Republic of Poland in the interwar period.</seg>
<seg id="5">The last time it was used was probably by President Ignacy Moscicki.</seg>
<seg id="6">"ROS" states that soon such a chain may end up on the shoulders of Andrzej Duda.</seg>
<seg id="7">On Wednesday, the Senate Committee on Human Rights, the Rule of Law and Petitions passed a motion to amend the Orders and Distinctions Act to reinstate it.</seg>
<seg id="8">The newspaper writes that this is also not the first attempt to restore this chain to the head of state.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Senate had already proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it was defeated by one vote.</seg>
<seg id="10">This time the work is rapid.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the beginning of August, the senators devoted a few minutes to the matter, believing that they would consult the Chancellery of the President.</seg>
<seg id="12">This came in mid-September.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I kindly inform you that the Chancellery of the President of the Republic of Poland does not comment on the position presented in this petition", wrote the presidential minister Andrzej Dera at the time.</seg>

<seg id="1">Police officers will teach drivers how to drive through the intersection</seg>
<seg id="2">The police action will be carried out, among others, at the intersection of Cieplinski Avenue and Pilsudski Avenue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Uniformed actions are somehow related to recent complaints from the city authorities about drivers who are not always able to behave properly at the intersection.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Friday, September 27, police officers begin preventive actions in Rzeszow "passable intersections".</seg>
<seg id="5">The aim is to eliminate traffic congestion: Entering an intersection without the possibility of exit, not following traffic signals or road signs.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We often think that we are alone at the intersection, and in fact we make life difficult for other drivers," Marek Ustrobinski, the city's vice president, said a few days ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">His words resonated at a town hall press conference, where city officials presented examples of cars not moving properly at intersections, resulting in traffic jams.</seg>
<seg id="8">At that time, the president appealed to travelers to be sensible on the road and, among other things, to move faster at traffic lights or not write text messages while driving.</seg>
<seg id="9">The subject was somehow taken over by Rzeszow police officers, who from today begin the action of "passable intersections".</seg>
<seg id="10">What is the point</seg>
<seg id="11">The aim of the measures is to eliminate the phenomenon of limiting the passability at intersections by drivers entering them without the possibility of continuing driving.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is a common offence that contributes to increasing traffic congestion and creating traffic jams.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is punishable by a fine of PLN 300 and two penalty points.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, uniformed officers will pay attention to non-compliance with traffic signals or road signs and incorrect parking in the area of intersections.</seg>
<seg id="15">They will also observe a lack of fluidity of driving, late moving from under the sirens, slow crossing of intersections and leaving too long distances between vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="16">At which intersections will the activities be carried out</seg>
<seg id="17">Among others, on Lisa-Kuli Street from Jagiellonska Street; Cieplinskiego Avenue from Pilsudskiego Avenue; Targowa Street from Pilsudskiego Avenue; Sreniawit Square from Dabrowskiego Street or Hetmanska Street from Warsaw Insurgents Avenue.</seg>

<seg id="8">At that time, it was determined that the company did not take samples, measurements and tests of groundwater, and did not have the results of tests of stabilized municipal sewage sludge from the Czajka sewage treatment plant.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Senate passed, without amendment, a bill to disclose the assets of the families of top government officials and to fly the most important people in the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">52 senators voted in favour of the amendment to the Act on the Family Estate of State Officials - without amendments - 14 were against, three abstained.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thus, the senators decided to reject 12 amendments tabled during Wednesday's debate by Senator Slawomir Rybicki.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to him, the amendments were intended to "civilize" the law and limit the scope of information provided in the statement about the financial situation of own children, children of the spouse, children adapted to cases in which children remain in the same household with the person obliged to make a statement.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Act on the disclosure of the assets of the families of the most important state officials, the draft of which was created in the office of the Prime Minister, was passed by the Sejm on 11 September.</seg>
<seg id="7">The provisions stipulate that, among others, the Prime Minister, ministers, MPs, MEPs, senators, presidents of the Constitutional Tribunal, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as persons at the head of other state institutions, will be obliged to include information on the personal property of spouses, children and persons in common life in the declaration of assets.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Senate also did not propose amendments to the Flight of the Most Important People Act.</seg>
<seg id="9">It regulates which flights have HEAD status and who can be on board government aircraft along with the most important people in the country.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Act also specifies who is responsible for keeping the Central Register of Flights.</seg>
<seg id="11">The bill - without amendments - was supported by 55 senators, 12 were against and four abstained.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the law, every flight of the president will be a flight "performed on an official mission".</seg>
<seg id="13">On the flights, the president will be able to be accompanied by family members and other people invited by the president.</seg>
<seg id="14">On the other hand, the flight in the official mission of the Prime Minister and the Marshals of the Sejm and the Senate will only be a flight "for the purpose of carrying out tasks directly related to the function performed".</seg>
<seg id="15">The law also specifies a list of people who can accompany the most important people in the country on a flight.</seg>
<seg id="16">According to the regulations, on board the aircraft may be members of the delegation - invited deputies, senators, representatives of public authorities and experts; persons providing technical, medical or organizational services; as well as journalists.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the Act, in the event of doubts related to the flights of the marshals of the Sejm and the Senate, the head of the NPR will ask for their clarification.</seg>
<seg id="18">If such doubts are not clarified within the allotted time, the head of the NPR will be obliged to notify the heads of the Chancellery of the Sejm or the Senate of the impossibility of organizing such a flight.</seg>

<seg id="4">There was a lot of talk about their problems with travelling to this match.</seg>

<seg id="6">According to reports from those present, the world champion coach was upset.</seg>
<seg id="7">As Heynen's assistant Michal Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not just to practice volleyball elements.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We went to the arena, but for the most part it was a time for the team.</seg>
<seg id="9">The idea was to spend it together rather than train.</seg>
<seg id="10">Talk, think about how to rebuild it all as a team, "he recounted.</seg>

<seg id="16">I would point to inefficiency in attack and much worse than usual handling situational balls as the two main reasons for the defeat.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Slovenes were much better than us in this respect, "he analysed.</seg>
<seg id="18">In his opinion, the "red and white" did not stand in the way of the stress of performing against the co-hosts of the tournament, supported by a loud and large audience.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead, he conceded that the world champions might have put a bit of a smooth road to the semi-finals to bed.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Maybe if we had a similar defeat in the group stage, we would have analysed that lesson more quickly and then played differently later in the tournament.</seg>
<seg id="21">But it's just guessing, "he cautioned.</seg>

<seg id="5">Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he has been working out for a long time and has earned a kind of tennis world record - he has had to pay the highest single financial penalty in the history of the sport for violating the rules of conduct on and off the court.</seg>
<seg id="6">Loud curses, strange gestures, unsportsmanlike behavior, insulting the referee and spectators, breaking two rackets during his loss to Karen Khachanov - all of which he paid $113,000 for after the ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati in August.</seg>
<seg id="7">He didn't play long at the 2019 U. S. Open either, but he managed to say publicly that ATP officials were "corrupt," which hurt the organization so much that they implemented a disciplinary investigation into Kyrgios and gave the aforementioned verdict of suspension and another fine a few weeks later.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, he was forgiven for his words about corruption after listening to the accused and learning the context of the statement.</seg>
<seg id="9">In a statement, however, tennis officials said that the investigation found that Kyrgios' behavior over the past 12 months had raised serious concerns in many cases and was an almost constant violation of the rules that he constantly insulted tournament officials and spectators in a vulgar manner, hence the heavy punishment.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately postponed his sentence, ordering him to meet several conditions over the next six months. In ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour tournaments, Kyrgios can no longer violate the rules of the professional tennis code of conduct in any way, in particular, he can no longer curse, destroy rackets, argue with referees and the public, or otherwise behave obscenely and profanely.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was also advised to seek "ongoing support" from mental coaches during tournaments and also consult with people in the off-season who specialise in solving problems of athletes who cannot cope with the right behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nick Kyrgios' first comment (on social media) on the verdict was: "Hey everyone, I can still play.</seg>
<seg id="13">I just have to control my behaviour, that's all. '</seg>
<seg id="14">In practice, the Australian will still have at least a two-week break as his shoulder injury worsened in the Laver Cup, so he had to give up his next starts in Beijing (September 30-October 6) and Shanghai (October 6-13).</seg>
<seg id="15">Kyrgios is ranked 27th in the ATP rankings.</seg>
<seg id="16">This year he won two tournaments - in Washington and Acapulco, he made more than $1.3 million, so even after the fines he will have a lot left.</seg>

<seg id="1">GUS: Life is getting better in Poland</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the report on household budgets published by CSO on Friday, 44 percent of them assessed their material situation as good or rather good last year.</seg>
<seg id="3">A year earlier, this percentage was 37.2 percent, in 2016 33.5 percent, and before that - since 2009, when the statistical office first examined subjective assessments of the situation of households - it had never exceeded 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="4">A total of 8.1 percent of households considered their financial situation to be bad or rather bad last year, compared to 11.2 percent a year earlier and more than 20 percent in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="5">The best is the material situation of households of self-employed people.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this group, more than 70 percent of respondents consider it good or rather good.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the other extreme are pensioner households, where the percentage of such responses was only 18 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">The subjective assessment of the material situation of households is also strongly influenced by the number of children.</seg>
<seg id="9">Single parents are the worst off, of whom 32 percent declare a good or rather good material situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among couples with children, this percentage varies (depending on the number of children) from 55 to 60 percent, and among childless households it is 48.8 percent.</seg>
<seg id="11">These statistics clearly show the effect of the 500 + programme.</seg>
<seg id="12">Before it was launched (in 2016), the worst financial situation was assessed by single parents and large families (with at least three children).</seg>
<seg id="13">The improvement of subjective assessments of the material situation of Poles is a reflection of the rapid increase in income, especially from work.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, that is not all, because the percentage of households that consider their situation to be good is increasing faster than real incomes.</seg>
<seg id="15">What is more, at the level of voivodships there is no clear relationship between the level of income and the assessment of material conditions of households.</seg>
<seg id="16">The best ratings are formulated by the inhabitants of the Opolskie Voivodeship, where 48.9 percent of the respondents consider their situation to be good or rather good.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lubuskie (47.7 percent), Silesian (47.6 percent), Mazovian (47.3 percent) and Zachodniopomorskie (47.1 percent) voivodships are next.</seg>
<seg id="18">Meanwhile, in Opole disposable income (i.e. after paying taxes and contributions) amounted to less than 94% of the national average last year, and in Lubuskie 98%.</seg>
<seg id="19">The inhabitants of Mazowiecki (120 percent of the national average) and Silesia (104 percent) had the highest incomes.</seg>
<seg id="20">On average, disposable income per person in Poland amounted to PLN 1,693 in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="21">In real terms (after adjusting for the impact of price changes) it increased by 4.3% compared to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="22">Compared to previous years, this is quite a low result.</seg>
<seg id="23">Per capita income rose 7 percent in 2016 and 6.3 percent a year later.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although revenue growth is slowing, it is also hampering spending growth.</seg>
<seg id="25">Those per person amounted to PLN 1187 last year, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7 percent.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is the first such case since 2013.</seg>
<seg id="27">Spending per person increased by 1.9 percent in real terms in 2017 and 4.3 percent in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="28">Surveys of household budgets suggest that a statistical household now spends 70.1 percent of its disposable income, while as recently as 2014 the share exceeded 80 percent and by 2006 it was above 90 percent.</seg>

<seg id="1">Niesiolowski was critical of the Pope.</seg>
<seg id="2">John Paul II did nothing</seg>
<seg id="3">In an interview with Piotr Leksycki Stefan Niesiolowski emphasized that in 1981 John Paul II was a great authority for opposition activists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"In fact, his every opinion was accepted."</seg>
<seg id="5">There was later criticism of some of his actions.</seg>
<seg id="6">"For me, the fact that John Paul II could not liquidate the harmful activity of Rydzyk casts a great shadow over his pontificate.</seg>
<seg id="7">After all, this Redemptorist - a pest of the Church and Poland - developed his media in the best way during the life of the Polish pope ', he explained.</seg>
<seg id="8">The former politician of the Civic Platform admitted: 'There were murmurs of discontent, the pope said something, once Rydzyk did not accept it, but he had power and for politicking he could simply throw him out of the Church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to raise money for the poor there.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, John Paul II did not do it, nor did his successors', Niesiolowski explained.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Besides, there was this terrible issue of pedophilia and actions of the Church, or rather their lack.</seg>
<seg id="11">I ran out thinking a little bit ahead, but I wanted to draw attention to his whole life.</seg>
<seg id="12">We have known about the scale of pedophilia in the Church relatively recently.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question arises as to how it is possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting matters', says Niesiolowski in an interview with a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the opinion of the former politician of the Civic Platform, the Polish Church is an ally of the Law and Justice party.</seg>
<seg id="15">"It must be admitted that during the period of Solidarity the Church was our most important ally.</seg>
<seg id="16">All the celebrations began with Mass, crosses hung everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now these crosses are written, they have become a symbol of dictatorship - a sign of the writing regime.</seg>
<seg id="18">I repeat: One of the biggest unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk are shaking the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing about it and that today the Church is an ally of the Law and Justice party.</seg>
<seg id="19">This is a black chapter of the Polish Church, for which he will have to pay dearly ", argued Niesiolowski.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I hope that Pope Francis will chase Jedraszewski, Rydzyk and a few others of this kind," he concluded.</seg>

<seg id="3">The Polish Cup clash between griffin Wejherowo and Lechia Gdansk by a small hair did not end tragically, when a race fired by fans from Wejherowo by millimeters passed the goalkeeper of the opposing team, Zlatan Alomerovic.</seg>
<seg id="4">After this incident, the match was abandoned for 20 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="5">The CPSU committee investigating the case imposed a harsh penalty on Griffin, ruling him out of future games.</seg>
<seg id="6">The club will not be allowed to compete in the 2020 / 2021 Polish Cup.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, fans will not be allowed to enter their own stadium in the next match.</seg>
<seg id="8">They will also not be allowed to travel in groups for league matches until December 31.</seg>
<seg id="9">The brothels at the Widzew Lodz stadium were also caused by fans of Silesia Wroclaw.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here, however, the verdict of the Polish United Workers' Party was milder, because Silesia warned that similar events could occur and sensitized the relevant authorities in this matter.</seg>
<seg id="11">Nevertheless, the services allowed the sector of Lodz fans to be pelted with flares, chairs to be set on fire and the host sector to be pushed through.</seg>
<seg id="12">This match was abandoned for eight minutes and the intervening police had to use a water cannon.</seg>

<seg id="4">In Podkarpacie, the implementation of the amendment to the regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on, among others, writing the names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish has begun.</seg>
<seg id="5">For example, "Lviv" will appear next to "L'viv".</seg>
<seg id="6">In our province, the changes will be introduced on 94 road signs placed at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.</seg>
<seg id="7">As we hear, it is supposed to be easier, clearer and simpler.</seg>
<seg id="8">The new guidelines result from the amendment of the Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure on detailed technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety equipment.</seg>
<seg id="9">"We should remember that the names of towns in neighbouring countries often also have a Polish sound.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thanks to the change in the law that we have prepared, they will finally appear on the signposts on our roads.</seg>
<seg id="11">The introduction of the new signage begins with the Podkarpackie section of the A4 motorway ", informed the Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk.</seg>

<seg id="17">It will be done without replacing the boards, on the basis of stickers.</seg>
<seg id="18">They will replace the currently functioning place names with new ones written in Polish on already existing signs.</seg>
<seg id="19">Both names will be written in one line - first in Polish and then in the original, in parentheses.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will be necessary to consider whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade", said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, leader of the Agreement Jaroslaw Gowin.</seg>
<seg id="3">During an interview in "Signals of the Day" on Radio Jedynka, Gowin stated that trade is overrun by international networks that impose such low margins on Polish producers that Polish companies cannot actually develop.</seg>
<seg id="4">Noting that it is very difficult to fight this problem, the deputy prime minister reminded that the government of the Law and Justice party tried to face it at the very beginning of the term of office, but got a 'counter-attack from the European Commission'.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We have won before the court of justice and I hope that if the United Right wins the next election and formulates the government, we will come back to that subject," he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the same time, he noted that "effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish, i.e. small trade".</seg>
<seg id="7">"It will be necessary to consider whether the government, the state, has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade", said Gowin.</seg>
<seg id="8">In May, an EU court ruled that the European Commission had made a mistake in finding that the Polish retail tax was illegal public aid.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Retail Sales Tax Act provided for the introduction of two trade tax rates: 0.8% on revenue between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4% on revenue above PLN 170 million per month.</seg>
<seg id="10">The tax was due to take effect from September 2016.</seg>
<seg id="11">In September 2016, the European Commission opened an investigation into Poland's violation of EU law.</seg>
<seg id="12">Brussels argued at the time that the design of the tax could favour smaller shops, which could be seen as public aid.</seg>
<seg id="13">She went on to say that the levy was implemented unlawfully.</seg>
<seg id="14">It also issued an order suspending the use of the tax until officials in Brussels had completed their analysis.</seg>
<seg id="15">Poland did not agree with this position, but the tax collection was suspended.</seg>
<seg id="16">The EU court's decision in May paved the way for the reintroduction of the tax, but it did not end the case.</seg>
<seg id="17">On 24 July, the Commission appealed to the Court of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="18">On Thursday, the press services of the CJEU told PAP that the case is currently at a written stage, in which both the European Commission and the Polish government present their arguments in writing.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not yet known whether or when the oral procedure will begin, that is, the hearing of the parties and a possible hearing.</seg>
<seg id="20">It takes a good few to several months from the appeal to the announcement of the judgment.</seg>

<seg id="1">How to dress a child for baptism</seg>
<seg id="2">We suggest some practical solutions</seg>
<seg id="3">Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of an infant and his parents.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is often the first occasion when the whole family gathers around the child, celebrating his appearance in the world together.</seg>
<seg id="5">No wonder the fresh-faced mum and dad want their kids to look their best on the day.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, before you also make the final decision about your child's outfit, consider whether it will also be comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the shops you can find many steep sets that do not provide the toddler with adequate comfort.</seg>
<seg id="8">So what should I pay attention to</seg>
<seg id="9">The basic criterion for choosing clothes for baptism is the age of the child</seg>
<seg id="10">Until recently, several weeks old toddlers were baptized, dressed in white sets and inserted into the same barrels or large pillows.</seg>
<seg id="11">Today, children receiving the sacrament are often older: Several months, one year or even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is not difficult to guess that such a great comfort needs a slightly different dress for baptism.</seg>
<seg id="13">Therefore, if your child is 3-4 months old on the day of baptism, he will probably spend the ceremony in a pram or in the hands of his parents or godparents.</seg>
<seg id="14">The best solution will therefore be to decorate it with comfortable cotton sleeping bags or sets.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although this item of clothing is considered an everyday outfit, just search for its festive variants, for example with frill or lace.</seg>
<seg id="16">For the boy, a body printed with flies and braces will be ideal.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the case of older children, you can afford to have more fantasy in your clothes.</seg>
<seg id="18">The little girl will look cute in a simple tulle dress</seg>
<seg id="19">Many parents of girls look longingly at the richly decorated, frilly dresses for baptism complete with cloaks, headbands and hats.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers use artificial, non-breathable materials for their production, in which the child is simply uncomfortable.</seg>
<seg id="21">In search of the right clothes, it will be better to look at the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant outfits on cotton lining.</seg>
<seg id="22">Delicate tulle skirts, satin dresses, lace, applications and adorable sets will make your daughter look beautiful and comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="23">The perfect outfit for a little gentleman: A cotton suit</seg>
<seg id="24">Until recently, there was a fashion among the parents of boys for suits that were a copy of "adult" models.</seg>
<seg id="25">Polyester jackets and trousers, stiff collars and caskets often made young elegant people loudly demonstrate their discontent.</seg>
<seg id="26">Today, fortunately, they have been replaced by comfortable cotton sets.</seg>
<seg id="27">Just look at the sets available in Asanti for Kids, which are soft, tracksuit shorts, and a blouse decorated at the front on the pattern of a vest.</seg>
<seg id="28">These outfits look extremely festive, and at the same time do not restrict the movements of a toddler getting to know the world.</seg>

<seg id="1">Vote to adjourn for Conservative Party conference</seg>
<seg id="2">British MPs have voted against a three-day Commons recess in time for the Conservative Party's annual programme conference, as requested by the government.</seg>
<seg id="3">289 MPs voted in favour, 306 against.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is customary for the House of Commons not to sit at party conferences, so that MPs do not have to resign from them or from parliamentary sessions.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, opposition parties have decided that Parliament should not stop sitting at such a crucial time as the last few weeks before the UK is due to leave the European Union on 31 October.</seg>
<seg id="6">The government's motion for a recess was supported by 289 MPs and 306 against.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two opposition parties after the conventions</seg>
<seg id="8">The failure to agree to a recess could be seen as a political vendetta by the opposition against Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks (the decision was ruled unlawful and non-existent by the Supreme Court on Tuesday) and for refusing to apologise for it after the judges ruled.</seg>
<seg id="9">After that ruling, the House of Commons resumed its session on Wednesday, with the highlight of the day being Johnson's speech and the ensuing heated debate.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr Johnson accused the opposition of blocking Brexit and avoiding an early election.</seg>
<seg id="11">'it's time to deliver Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="12">It must be implemented in order to respect the result of the referendum.</seg>
<seg id="13">Brexit needs to come so we can get on with the deal on people's priorities, on the health service, on the cost of living.</seg>
<seg id="14">Brexit must be delivered so we can unite this country, "Mr Johnson said.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Conservative Party conference is due to start in Manchester next Sunday and run until Wednesday 2 October.</seg>
<seg id="16">The conferences of the two main opposition parties - Labour and the Liberal Democrats - have already taken place.</seg>
<seg id="17">One of the justifications given by Johnson in explaining such a long suspension of Parliament was party conferences.</seg>

<seg id="2">"President Andrzej Duda believes that anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders", write foreign media.</seg>
<seg id="3">A spokesman for the president strongly denied the reports.</seg>
<seg id="4">"That's just not true," Blaze Spychalski tweeted.</seg>
<seg id="5">Israeli media, including Haaretz and the Jerusalem Post, citing Jewish Insider, write that Andrzej Duda, during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora in the Polish consulate in New York, stated that Israel was to blame for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="6">The president said the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland was a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.</seg>
<seg id="7">He referred to Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, who said in February that "Poles will suck anti-Semitism with breast milk."</seg>
<seg id="8">Andrzej Duda said he regretted that Israel had not apologized for the humiliating statements of its politicians.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also mentioned the act of aggression against the Polish ambassador to Israel Marek Magierowski.</seg>
<seg id="10">In May, he was attacked by an attacker who shouted: "Pole, Pole."</seg>
<seg id="11">"The quote is not only inaccurate.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is simply not true, "Blazej Spychalski tweeted.</seg>
<seg id="13">He stressed that Duda "never said that Israel was responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland."</seg>
<seg id="14">According to Spychalski, the portal "invented it".</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the interviewees, during the meeting there was also a dispute between the Holocaust survivor, awarded the Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mosberg would agree with President Duda's words and say that Jews from Israel "like Israel Katz" are responsible for the rise of anti-Semitism.</seg>

<seg id="4">Journalists of TVN 'Supervisor' revealed that Marian Banas, the president of the Supreme Chamber of Control, has not entered into the property statement of the 400-metre tenement house, which is located in Krakow's Podgorze.</seg>
<seg id="5">What's more, his subtenant was supposed to run a sex business in the aforementioned tenement house (so rent rooms for hours).</seg>

<seg id="7">Bertold Kittel pointed out the irregularities in the "Supervisor" program.</seg>
<seg id="8">The journalist revealed that the tenement house was rented from Banas by people associated with the criminal world to use as a place of "erotic encounters".</seg>
<seg id="9">The clients were to be men using the services of prostitutes.</seg>
<seg id="10">Banas responded vaguely and murkily to the allegations.</seg>
<seg id="11">Interestingly, the tenement house rented by the pimps led the journalist to discover negligence in Banasia's property statements.</seg>
<seg id="12">The house itself was described vaguely in them, and the income from its rental was to be understated.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The estate of Marian Banasia and his wife can be worth between 6 and 8 million PLN.</seg>
<seg id="14">In total, spouses can boast two houses, three apartments, savings [...] ", writes Money. PL.</seg>

<seg id="17">Mr Banas said he would suspend his activities at the National Audit Office until it was completed. "I will apply to the Speaker for unpaid leave," he asserted.</seg>
<seg id="18">The opposition is demanding clarification.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We are not hearing from the CBA to expand its investigation or expedite the examination of Marian Banas' financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="20">Therefore, we are forced to replace the organs of the state and report on the possibility of committing a crime [...] "- said PO-KO MP Mariusz Witczak.</seg>
<seg id="21">"If a normal Pole valued the rental of his properties so grossly low, he would already have 10 inspections, tax additions and criminal and fiscal proceedings," he added.</seg>
<seg id="22">Went high, fell low</seg>
<seg id="23">Marian Banas is the new president of the Supreme Chamber of Control.</seg>
<seg id="24">He was appointed to the position on August 30, 2019, for a six-year term.</seg>
<seg id="25">His candidacy was submitted by the Law and Justice party and accepted by the votes of the party's politicians.</seg>

<seg id="1">'Rzeczpospolita ': Ignoring a police officer's order will be punished</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the newspaper, flouting an order of specific behaviour issued by a police officer is to be a new type of offence, punishable by a fine, arrest or restriction of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="3">Such a change is wanted by police trade unionists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The idea went to the Sejm Committee on Petitions.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The case is serious because already every year more than half a million misdemeanor cases are referred to Polish courts", we read.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Republic of Poland has established that the petition that the Independent Police Union is writing to MPs to amend the Code of Misdemeanors has a chance of success.</seg>
<seg id="7">The petitioners propose a new wording of Article 54a of the Code of Misdemeanors.</seg>
<seg id="8">It would read: "Anyone who does not comply with the request or order of a public official, issued within the limits and under the provisions of the Act, shall be subject to arrest, fine or restriction of liberty."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Paragraph 3 of this provision provides for an identical penalty for those who do not follow orders, prevent or impede the performance of business activities," the journal states.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski told Rzeczpospolita that although he agreed with the main message of the proposed provision, he feared that if it was implemented, it could be used in matters of political demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="11">"In situations of freedom demonstrations, this would be detrimental and, instead of mitigating the situation, would even exacerbate it," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="12">Statistics provided by the newspaper show that 86 percent of citizens gave a positive assessment of police interventions in 2018 and that services make 1.5 million interventions in the city each month.</seg>

<seg id="2">Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook collapsed, its Belgian subsidiary Neckermann operates.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the company has problems.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to VRT, Brussels Airlines announced that it would cancel 105 flights in October due to problems related to Thomas Cook's bankruptcy.</seg>
<seg id="5">Neckermann also laid off 75 workers.</seg>
<seg id="6">All trips with an office booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but holidaymakers will be able to receive a refund.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Ghent court also declared the bankruptcy of three Belgian subsidiaries: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.</seg>
<seg id="8">Currently, about 12,000 Belgians are abroad on trips bought from Thomas Cook.</seg>
<seg id="9">Another 40,000 people were expected to leave the office by the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later on Monday, Thomas Cook Belgium spokeswoman Leen Segers said the company was now "fully operational" despite the British parent company filing for bankruptcy, which caused concern among employees and customers.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the time, the office reassured customers who had bought trips there that they would go on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thomas Cook - the oldest and one of the largest travel agencies in the world - filed for bankruptcy on Sunday night.</seg>
<seg id="13">The immediate cause of the bankruptcy was the collapse of last-ditch talks with creditors and potential investors on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="14">Creditors have demanded that, in addition to the £900m rescue plan agreed in August, the company should raise an additional £200m as collateral for the winter period, when travel agents tend to have lower turnover.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, the company's problems have been growing for several years, resulting in debt amounting to £1.6 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1">Gjedrlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for your review</seg>
<seg id="2">Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion - such an unusual offer was prepared for German newcomers Gwierz rlitz.</seg>
<seg id="3">The measures are intended to help combat the ongoing decline in the city's population.</seg>
<seg id="4">Gjirlitz is the easternmost city in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="5">The beautiful pastel old town attracts 140,000 tourists every year.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, according to The Guardian, the city is facing significant problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Gjirlitz there are the lowest wages in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">The city is also struggling with a steady decline in population.</seg>
<seg id="9">After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them left for the west of the country, resulting in a 25 percent decline in the city's population.</seg>
<seg id="10">In 2013, it reached 54,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="11">In an attempt to combat depopulation, officials came up with the idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.</seg>
<seg id="12">So far, 150 applications have been submitted to the programme.</seg>
<seg id="13">Two-thirds of them were made up of residents of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="14">People from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom were also interested in the program.</seg>
<seg id="15">"When we applied, we thought the program was going to convince people to move to Gjrlitz," one of the project participants said.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Now we feel it doesn't matter if we stay here after four weeks or not," he added.</seg>
<seg id="17">The city has 7,000 vacant homes and unemployment is three times higher than the national average.</seg>
<seg id="18">While city officials hope some will move permanently, the main goal of the program is to get feedback from participants.</seg>
<seg id="19">The information gathered from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revive smaller German cities.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We want to know more about what people need and, if they decide to move, what their motivation was," said Robert Knippschild, who was in charge of the program.</seg>
<seg id="21">Other cities have already experimented with ideas to lure new residents by offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first was Detroit, which introduced a program to pay promising young professionals to live and work in the city for a year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy or in the American state of Tulsa in Oklahoma.</seg>
