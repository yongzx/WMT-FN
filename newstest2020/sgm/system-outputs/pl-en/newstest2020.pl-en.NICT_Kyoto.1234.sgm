<seg id="1">Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in a white robe</seg>
<seg id="2">He is charismatic.</seg>
<seg id="3">Crowds gather for his Holy Masses for deliverance and healing.</seg>
<seg id="4">He was several years old when inexplicable things began to happen in his life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Today, through the Franciscan, others experience it.</seg>
<seg id="6">Crowds gather for Fr Witko's Mass for deliverance and healing</seg>
<seg id="7">Once the parents of a 7-month old baby, who had a 7.5 mm hole in his heart, came to him.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was to be operated on.</seg>
<seg id="9">Father Józef Witko prayed over him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Later that day, the boy was taken to the hospital for a procedure.</seg>
<seg id="11">Astonished doctors ruled: "surgery is not needed, the cavity is only 1.5 mm."</seg>
<seg id="12">My parents cried with happiness.</seg>
<seg id="13">After another prayer the Franciscan hole disappeared completely.</seg>
<seg id="14">The clergyman began to experience the extraordinary actions of the Creator as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="15">In his dreams, the souls of purgatory came to him asking for help.</seg>
<seg id="16">I was woken up at night and urged to pray for the dead and those who were dying at the moment, "he recalls.</seg>
<seg id="17">He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.</seg>
<seg id="18">And he had a vision of what happens to a man who commits mortal sin.</seg>
<seg id="19">"my body started to change.</seg>
<seg id="20">I lost my human features and started to take on the appearance of an animal, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="21">An invisible force lifted him up, he couldn't get his voice out of him.</seg>
<seg id="22">He felt he was lost.</seg>
<seg id="23">Then God pointed to his rescue.</seg>
<seg id="24">"immersed in the waters of the river symbolizing holy baptism, I was freed and returned to human form...," he recounts.</seg>
<seg id="25">He did not tell anyone about these strange experiences.</seg>
<seg id="26">The vocation matured in him.</seg>
<seg id="27">He was 16 years old when he joined the Franciscans.</seg>
<seg id="28">In his sermons he wanted not only to speak about Jesus.</seg>
<seg id="29">He wanted people to experience Him alive.</seg>
<seg id="30">Members of the Charismatic Community of Renewal in the Holy Spirit</seg>
<seg id="31">The healing Masses celebrated by Father Witko are attended by many people who hope to get rid of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="32">The priest emphasizes, however, that their main goal is spiritual healing, not physical healing.</seg>

<seg id="1">First defeat of Kolping FRAC Yaroslavl</seg>
<seg id="2">This afternoon (September 26) Kolping FRAC team deservedly succumbed to the current Polish Darts Champion Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki in the third round of LOTTO Superliga Table Tennis.</seg>
<seg id="3">In terms of personnel, they have little chance of winning against the league's sovereigns.</seg>
<seg id="4">This was clearly demonstrated by the duel with Dartom Bogoria.</seg>
<seg id="5">Chen Jingqi, the team's leader, is still missing.</seg>
<seg id="6">Perhaps with him in the lineup, the Yaroslavl would reach for a third consecutive triumph in the new season.</seg>
<seg id="7">Young Asian Qiyao Han probably has not yet grown up to win against the likes of Greek Panagiotis Gionis and Czech Pavel Sirucek.</seg>
<seg id="8">Not even with one of the most promising Poles, Marek Badowski.</seg>
<seg id="9">The player from Hellada was the biggest star of the match in the MOSiR hall at Sikorski Street in Jarosław.</seg>
<seg id="10">Against both Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei, he was a class unto himself.</seg>
<seg id="11">After three matches Kolping FRAC led 2-1.</seg>
<seg id="12">Kou Lei probably beat Marek Badowski, and Daniel Górak after a thrilling five-set battle - Pavel Siruck.</seg>
<seg id="13">But then it got worse.</seg>
<seg id="14">Gionis gave Lea no chance.</seg>
<seg id="15">One could still hope to win by two points, but Qiyao Han failed to match Badowski.</seg>

<seg id="1">There will be no additional testing for seniors.</seg>
<seg id="2">Why?</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Rafał Trzaskowski, a program of free preventive examinations for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not been accepted by the Ministry of Health and the Agency for the Protection of Medical Technology and Tariffs.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the explanatory statement, the agency explained that the target group was poorly chosen.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the above actions may even result in the detection of individual diseases, which may contribute to deepening difficulties in accessing NHF services and negatively affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with a false positive test result," it said.</seg>
<seg id="7">The decision of the ministry is not understood by the president of the capital.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the money is ours, we have the money for it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only the government is afraid that if people get tested, they will go to the doctor later, which is absurd, because the aim is to bring about a situation in which prevention can be done faster.</seg>
<seg id="10">All specialists know that it helps when it comes to the burden on the health system, because it helps in the rapid detection of diseases and in a reliable approach to health.</seg>
<seg id="11">The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand, "said Rafał Trzaskowski.</seg>
<seg id="12">"it is hard for me to imagine that experts say: let's not examine ourselves, because there will be longer queues at the doctor, and if such specialists advise the government, I am not surprised that the health service is in such a state," added the Civic Platform politician.</seg>

<seg id="1">Palestine responds to Israel: we will break all existing agreements</seg>
<seg id="2">Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas told the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday that he would break all agreements made with Israel if the country's future government tries to fulfill Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement to annex occupied Palestinian lands.</seg>
<seg id="3">"if the future Israeli government begins to implement this plan, we will nullify all the agreements signed (with Israel) and withdraw from all the commitments made," he said.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we will completely and utterly reject the whole plan," Abbas threatened with pressure.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it is our duty to defend all our rights by all possible means - no matter what the consequences will be - fully committed to the application of international law and the fight against terrorism," declared the President of the Palestinian Authority, who had already made similar declarations in July.</seg>
<seg id="6">Netanyahu, Israel's current prime minister, was again tasked with forming a government after the September 17 election.</seg>
<seg id="7">A week before the election, he announced his intention to annex the Jordan Valley and incorporate all Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank into Israel if he won.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, then led by Yasser Arafat, signed a series of peace agreements under the auspices of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="9">Abbas also promised to hold general elections in the Palestinian territories during the session of the UN General Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="10">The last one took place in 2006.</seg>
<seg id="11">"when I return home, I will call for local elections in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, and all those who would oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community," declared the Palestinian president.</seg>
<seg id="12">In his speech, Abbas also defended the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer at the United Nations, to exercise the rights of "full members of the UN and all its bodies and institutions."</seg>
<seg id="13">The Palestinian leader concluded his speech by calling on the international community to "force Israel to comply with the provisions of the United Nations with all due respect."</seg>
<seg id="14">Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas' speech, stating that the Palestinian leader "prefers to focus at the UN on the Palestinian Authority's efforts against Israel rather than fighting against calls for terrorism in the Authority under his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="15">Danon, however, did not refer to Netanyahu's announced annexation of occupied Palestinian land, according to the agencies.</seg>

<seg id="1">PLN 105 million for video game companies from the National Centre for Research and Development</seg>
<seg id="2">Almost PLN 105 million of funding will go to companies in the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.</seg>
<seg id="3">The National Center for Research and Development announced on Friday the results of the third edition of the GameINN program.</seg>
<seg id="4">Among the nearly 30 projects that supported the NCBR were, among others, the development of a platform for creating field games based on an AR game engine that creates a map of the real world with an application enabling the transfer of data by users; a test and training platform for verification of practical skills at work and professional improvement with the use of VR and AI technologies.</seg>
<seg id="5">The aim of the GameINN sector program is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game industry on the global market by 2023.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the National Centre for Research and Development (NCBR), the Polish video games sector is already growing at an annual rate of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 amounted to PLN 1.85 billion, while the forecast for 2019 is PLN 2.23 billion.</seg>
<seg id="8">"GameINN's specially prepared research agenda and PLN 300 million of support for entrepreneurs in this sector programme are an important impetus for further dynamic growth of Polish gamedevu," reads the release.</seg>
<seg id="9">The video games industry is an excellent example of effective use of the potential we have in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="10">"incentives introduced by the government for entrepreneurs focusing on innovation, such as R and D incentives, competence improvement programs, IP box or support programs implemented by the National Centre for Research and Development (NCBR) drive innovative activities of companies and allow them to compete more effectively in a very competitive market," said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education Jarosław Gowin.</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of the Ministry of Science points out that the money for innovation not only goes to innovators in the form of co-financing projects, but also stays in their pockets - three quarters more entrepreneurs benefited from the R and D tax relief in 2018 than the year before.</seg>
<seg id="12">"the amount of deducted costs related to R and D activities amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, which resulted in over PLN 300 million of savings for companies benefiting from this relief.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is equivalent to the support provided by the National Centre for Research and Development (NCBR) in three editions of GameINN, "underlines the Deputy Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="14">Wojciech Kamieniecki, the director of the National Centre for Research and Development (NCBR), recalls that 78 innovative projects were awarded in two previous competitions with a total value of over PLN 211.2 million.</seg>
<seg id="15">The huge interest in the 3rd competition and the diversity of applications show that the video game industry has the ideas and competences to further develop and increase its competitive advantages.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it is particularly pleasing that among the selected projects, as in previous editions, there are projects concerning solutions not only for entertainment, but also related to Industry 4.0," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the third GameINN competition, entrepreneurs, consortia of entrepreneurs and consortia of entrepreneurs with scientific units could apply for funding of up to PLN 20 million.</seg>
<seg id="18">The National Centre for Research and Development received 87 applications for a total amount of approx. PLN 317 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">The budget of the competition at the time of the announcement was PLN 100 million, but it was increased, thanks to which 27 projects received almost PLN 105 million in funding.</seg>
<seg id="20">Detailed information about the results of the 3rd GameINN competition is available at ncbr.gov.pl.</seg>
<seg id="21">The GameINN sector programme is implemented under the Smart Growth Operational Programme.</seg>
<seg id="22">NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs associated in the Polish Games Alliance, which includes companies such as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team and 11 bit studios.</seg>

<seg id="3">Dolberg, who arrived in Nice from Ajax at the end of August, realised after training that his watch had disappeared from the dressing room.</seg>
<seg id="4">Not just any, because it is worth EUR 70 000.</seg>
<seg id="5">An angry Dane failed to show up for class the next day, citing stomach problems.</seg>
<seg id="6">The case was puzzling from the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="7">Players in the dressing room have private safes at their disposal and the club's grounds are monitored.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the AFP news agency, Diaby-Fadiga eventually confessed to the theft.</seg>
<seg id="9">The 18-year-old has already apologised to Dolberg and the rest of his teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.</seg>
<seg id="10">He also promised to reimburse the Dane for the watch.</seg>
<seg id="11">Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising young players in France.</seg>
<seg id="12">He moved to Nice at the age of 13 and made his first-team debut three years later.</seg>
<seg id="13">He appeared in seven games this season.</seg>
<seg id="14">He recently signed a professional contract, but according to L'Equipe newspaper, the club is likely to terminate it with immediate effect.</seg>

<seg id="1">Iran's president says he rejected offer of talks with US, Donald Trump denies</seg>
<seg id="2">Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Friday that Tehran had not entered into talks with the United States during the UN General Assembly in New York, despite an offer by the United States to lift sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Us President Donald Trump commented that it was the Iranian side that asked for the lifting of the restrictions, which he did not agree to.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, the Americans offered to lift all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for negotiations on a new international agreement.</seg>
<seg id="5">It would regulate both Iran's nuclear program and its ballistic missile program.</seg>
<seg id="6">Rouhani: Iran will not engage in talks in atmosphere of maximum pressure</seg>
<seg id="7">The Iranian president stated that he had not agreed to engage in these talks because of the "toxic atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="8">He said he had met with American diplomats because he had succumbed to the urging of France, Germany and the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, he stressed that Iran would not engage in talks in an atmosphere of "maximum pressure."</seg>
<seg id="10">"and even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in the 5 + 1 format, no one can predict what the end result will be," Rouhani said.</seg>
<seg id="11">A day earlier, the Iranian leader said he would not rule out talks with the US, and accused the European parties to the nuclear deal of favoring US sanctions on Iran.</seg>
<seg id="12">He added that sanctions imposed on Iran after the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal "are a precondition that does not allow for dialogue."</seg>
<seg id="13">If we can lift this precondition and if America lifts sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America, "he declared.</seg>
<seg id="14">He added that he did not rule out a meeting with US President Donald Trump, even though he had not agreed to such a conversation in the past week during the UN General Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="15">Trump: "Iran asked, I said no"</seg>
<seg id="16">Donald Trump tweeted that he was the one who turned down the request from the Iranian side.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.</seg>
<seg id="18">Of course I said 'no!' "the US president tweeted.</seg>
<seg id="19">Tension with the nuclear deal in the background</seg>
<seg id="20">France, Germany and Britain are trying to ease tensions between Washington and Tehran to somehow salvage the 2015 deal with Iran, to which they were signatories.</seg>
<seg id="21">It stipulated that in return for the lifting of economic sanctions, Iran would give up its nuclear weapons programme and the nuclear sector would come under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).</seg>
<seg id="22">Since the US withdrew from the agreement in May 2015, the remaining signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to keep the agreement in place.</seg>
<seg id="23">For now, nothing has come of it.</seg>
<seg id="24">Washington is using the tactic of exerting maximum pressure on Iran, and the sanctions also include a full embargo on Iranian oil.</seg>
<seg id="25">Tehran has said it will reduce its commitments under the deal every 60 days if it is not allowed to export the material.</seg>

<seg id="1">The judge of the Provincial Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of Emilia, who - according to her words and screenshots from WhatsApp - participated in the stalking of the judges, was reinstated on Wednesday by the Supreme Administrative Court.</seg>
<seg id="2">The reason: no disciplinary proceedings have been initiated against him, so there is no basis for upholding the order of WSA President Wojciech Mazur to remove him from his duties.</seg>
<seg id="3">Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a spokesman for the Supreme Administrative Court, opened an investigation into Szmydt at the end of August, but so far it has not turned into a case against him.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although the NSA, which acts as a disciplinary court in such cases, must deal with the decision of the WSA president within a month of its issuance.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this situation, the judge, who spoke publicly about his wife's mental problems in order to discredit her, who because of suspected involvement in the group was removed from the office of the National Court Register, will return to court and issue verdicts on behalf of the Republic of Poland.</seg>
<seg id="6">Judge Szmydt denies his involvement in the heist group.</seg>
<seg id="7">He claims there is no evidence of this except for doctored screenshots and the words of his wife, whom he is divorcing.</seg>
<seg id="8">The other "caste" judges say exactly the same thing: they are all innocent, there is no evidence.</seg>
<seg id="9">And it is quite possible that they will bet on their own.</seg>
<seg id="10">Because the prosecution did not shake a finger to secure evidence from their electronic media, it is also silent about the contents of Emilia Szmydt's phone, which she stopped in June in another case.</seg>
<seg id="11">The police did not shake a finger in order to secure the devices of people whom the judge Waldemar Żurek pointed out in a report from February.</seg>
<seg id="12">There is no evidence - there is no Shmydt case, there is no "caste" case.</seg>
<seg id="13">There is also no case of the head of the Supreme Chamber of Control Marian Banas about renting a tenement house to suteners and hiding income.</seg>
<seg id="14">CBA checks his property statements.</seg>
<seg id="15">And he will check when he checks.</seg>
<seg id="16">And the Commission of Parliamentary Ethics will not deal with Banas because the Seym is suspended (but the Commission of State Control somehow got together to make a bizarre decision about dismissing the deputies of Banas and appointing as acting his lawyer, although the law does not provide for such a strange combination).</seg>
<seg id="17">The whole thing reminds me of an American novella about how a wife comes home and finds her husband in bed with his mistress.</seg>
<seg id="18">She is so astonished and devastated that she cannot utter a word.</seg>
<seg id="19">She is standing in the doorway speechless, and during this time the mistress quickly jumps out of bed, gets dressed and leaves.</seg>
<seg id="20">And the husband bedding the bed.</seg>
<seg id="21">When the wife regains her voice and shouts: what is it supposed to be?</seg>
<seg id="22">Who is this woman?</seg>
<seg id="23">The husband calmly asks: what kind of woman, darling?</seg>
<seg id="24">But in the case of "caste" or Banas, it is a parody of the state.</seg>
<seg id="25">And it's not funny at all.</seg>

<seg id="1">The power of Oława jumps.</seg>
<seg id="2">The title of the coverage of the amateur sports competition, held on the afternoon of Sunday, September 15 at the Hippodrome on Oleandry Street in Oława, may be confusing for some.</seg>
<seg id="3">The road to true power is a long way away, but this is the name used to describe one of the types of horse competition...</seg>
<seg id="4">The power of jumping competition involves the rider and the horse overcoming higher and higher obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed even two meters.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is worth mentioning that the world record set in 1949 by the Chilean Albert Larraguibel on the horse "Huaso" is 247 cm.</seg>
<seg id="6">Nobody jumped so high in Oława, of course, but the result of the best local amazons at 135 cm is not the worst either...</seg>
<seg id="7">The competition, organized by the tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other activists of the JKS "In the Saddle," was a demonstration part of the "Rainbow Equestrian Competition," which we write about in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.</seg>
<seg id="8">Eight Amazons entered the competition, training equestrian in the Oława JKS.</seg>
<seg id="9">Four competed on ponies and four on big horses.</seg>
<seg id="10">The best in the first group was Nikola Szołdra, riding the crazy "Sprinter."</seg>
<seg id="11">This small but dynamic rump started by overcoming obstacles spread at a height of 40 cm, and ended only at the station with the top beam 125 cm away from the ground.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he did not give up easily and it was only after three consecutive refusals that he was removed from the competition by the jury.</seg>
<seg id="13">The second place was taken by Amelia Pawlak, riding "Famy," and the third by Lena Boruń on "Harmider."</seg>
<seg id="14">Ambitious was the youngest participant of the tournament - Inga Aksman, galloping and jumping over obstacles on the small mare "Carmen."</seg>
<seg id="15">Even greater emotions accompanied the competing Amazons and spectators during the competition with the participation of large horses.</seg>
<seg id="16">Dangerous looking falls included Paulina Szewczyk, riding on the "Declaration" and Anastasia Abramenko, who rode on the "Lotka."</seg>
<seg id="17">Fortunately, apart from minor bruises, nothing bad happened to the Amazons or the horses, so they continued to participate in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="18">A lot of problems with introducing the young mare "Wineta" to the parkour had Weronika Łuczkiewicz riding her.</seg>
<seg id="19">What was needed was either an assistant trainer or another horse to pair, followed by a little crazy "Wineta."</seg>
<seg id="20">"everything is under control!," Jan Sienkiewicz reassured the frightened spectators, especially the youngest ones.</seg>
<seg id="21">From the beginning of the competition Marta Masalska, riding the beautifully presented "Whisky," did a great job on the parkour.</seg>
<seg id="22">This dignified mare, together with the experienced Amazon, jumped 135 cm at the second attempt in the final stage and it was the best result of the competition at that moment.</seg>
<seg id="23">After a while, however, the same height also included Paulina Szewczyk on "Declaration," Veronika Łuczkiewicz on "Wineta" and Anastasia Abramenko on "Lotka."</seg>
<seg id="24">So all these riders left together to decorate Flo and receive prizes in the form of equestrian equipment, and at the end together with Amazons on ponies made an impressive round of honor, ending with this interesting and exciting competition.</seg>
<seg id="25">Thank you</seg>
<seg id="26">Equestrian Sports Club "In the Saddle" would like to thank the sponsors of the jumping power competition during the 16th "Rainbow Equestrian Competition": the Municipal Office in Oława, the Department of Water Supply and Sewerage in Oława, the District Office and the company "Mustang."</seg>

<seg id="6">"I will expect the abovementioned KWW to remove my name from the name.</seg>
<seg id="7">I kindly ask you not to connect my person with the above-mentioned entity, "he added and announced that he would provide more information soon.</seg>
<seg id="8">For now, it is not known whether the journalist will continue his work, or if this is the end of the # R Revolution formation.</seg>
<seg id="9">On July 4, American Independence Day, Mariusz Max Kolonko, a journalist in the United States, announced the formation of a new political formation - # R Revolution.</seg>
<seg id="10">In recent years, Kolonko has become famous for hosting the Max TV channel on YouTube, where he comments on events in Poland and around the world.</seg>
<seg id="11">"we are fed up with politicians, fed up with your stupid games, fed up with your amateur governments.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is time for the authorities in the state to take over the Nation and govern for the good of the Nation, "Kolonko said at the time.</seg>
<seg id="13">The party's agenda included issues such as the judiciary (it should be elected in general elections), tax changes (equalising the tax-free amount for all), war reparations (in the form of military aid to countries on NATO's eastern flank, with particular emphasis on Poland), holding a referendum on gun ownership, limiting the number of MPs or introducing single-member constituencies.</seg>
<seg id="14">A few days after the announcement of the new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko began talks with Marek Jakubiak.</seg>
<seg id="15">At the end of July, Kolonko posted a message on his social media profile suggesting that # R would join forces with the Kukiz '15 movement.</seg>

<seg id="2">"the euro will remain at around PLN 4.35 in the coming months, accompanied by weak global markets," says Michael Bolliger from UBS Wealth Management.</seg>
<seg id="3">"expectations of maintaining a solid pace of economic growth and a stable monetary policy support the stabilization of the zloty at the current level," the expert said in an interview with Bankier.pl.</seg>
<seg id="4">In his opinion, despite the clear inflationary pressure, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide to raise rates in an environment in which the vast majority of central banks are easing policy.</seg>
<seg id="5">"while the zloty is properly valued - the euro should remain around the level of PLN 4.35 in the coming months - according to him, Polish bonds are unattractive.</seg>
<seg id="6">Emerging market bonds offer much more favorable yields than Polish securities, "said Michael Bolliger, head of emerging market asset allocation at UBS Wealth Management.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the global downturn.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the global slowdown may deepen, but it should not lead to a severe recession, or at most to GDP growth falling slightly below zero," says Michael Bolliger.</seg>
<seg id="9">"investors should underweight global equities, which may be hurt by the lack of prospects for resolving the US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risks, including the impeachment of Donald Trump and Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among equity markets, Europe should behave relatively poorly, "according to a recent letter to investors by UBS Wealth Management's chief executive Mark Haefele.</seg>
<seg id="11">"euro zone equities should behave worse than U.S. equities, as they are more vulnerable amid heightened uncertainty around global trade and fears of a slowdown," the document reads.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to Michael Bolliger, after a rout in bond markets in the safest countries pushed German 10-year yields as low as minus 0.74 percent, it is still possible to deepen the decline in yields.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, in the long term, the profitability of long-term securities should no longer fall, but only in the short term, due to the easing of banks' monetary policy.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Fed has the most room for rate cuts, which should lead to a weakening of the US currency over the next few years.</seg>
<seg id="15">The long-term equilibrium point for euro notes is a ceiling of $1.29, which would represent a 19 percent potential for the common currency to strengthen against the dollar.</seg>
<seg id="16">We expect further Fed rate cuts, which will result in a narrowing of global monetary policy differences.</seg>
<seg id="17">"current account and budget deficits may not allow the dollar to remain strong in the long term," announces Michael Bolliger.</seg>

<seg id="2">How to avoid them?</seg>

<seg id="4">Japan Airlines has recently introduced a feature designed for people who find it a nightmare to travel with a crying baby.</seg>
<seg id="5">Through the website, the airline allows you to check the schedule of seats on the plane.</seg>
<seg id="6">If a connection is used by a minor under the age of two, the "child icon" appears on a specific seat reserved by parents or guardians.</seg>

<seg id="2">More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not travel to Majorca in October as a result of the bankruptcy of tour operator Thomas Cook announced on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Marc Pons, a representative of the autonomous government of the Balearic Islands, said on Friday that among the 25,000 holidaymakers who would not be able to take a holiday in Majorca in October, there were also people who were due to travel with companies indirectly linked to Thomas Cook, such as Neckermann.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pons explained that 80% of the expected holidaymakers who had to cancel their holiday in Majorca next month due to the collapse of the British company were German and Scandinavian nationals.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, Pons says that due to the fact that Thomas Cook did not direct tourists to the Balearic island between November and April, the losses to the local economy will be smaller.</seg>
<seg id="6">He revealed that the government of the Balearic Islands had already begun negotiations with international operators about "entering the Majorca market" after the British operator went bankrupt.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to estimates by the newspaper Diario de Mallorca, more than 1,000 people will lose their jobs due to the tourism crisis in Mallorca in October.</seg>
<seg id="8">Around 800 are redundant staff at the Thomas Cook office in Palma.</seg>
<seg id="9">Other people will lose their jobs mainly in the hospitality sector.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Monday, along with the bankruptcy of the company Thomas Cook in many hotels in Majorca, the owners of the properties demanded that guests pay an additional fee for accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="11">This situation was experienced by, among others, several dozen tourists from Poland.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Balearic Islands government estimates that dozens of hotels in Majorca have been put on hold until at least the end of October following the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook and its subsidiaries.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Friday, the newspaper Diario de Ibiza reported that most of the hotels operating in Ibiza, which have been working with the Thomas Cook group, had no intention of closing in the coming weeks.</seg>
<seg id="14">The newspaper recalls that on this Balearic island the British bankrupt cooperated with 42 hotels.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Wednesday, the autonomous government of the Balearic Islands announced it would ask the Spanish government to support the region with €100 million to cover losses caused by the bankruptcy of travel company Thomas Cook.</seg>
<seg id="16">They revealed that the most affected tourists in the archipelago, about 36,000 people, are in Majorca.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the Balearic government, Thomas Cook owes local travel companies, mainly hotel operators, around €5 million for the July-September 2019 period.</seg>

<seg id="8">The highest of them is 78 meters.</seg>
<seg id="9">The mosque can accommodate 15,000 worshippers, and the other number can stay on the outer esplanade.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the richly finished interiors you can admire the gilded dome, giant chandeliers and decorations handmade by workers from Morocco.</seg>
<seg id="11">Builders say the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but the edifice does not compare to mosques in other regions anyway.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Morocco, the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca can hold 105,000 worshippers.</seg>
<seg id="13">The construction of the mosque, which cost more than €30 million, was financed by private donations.</seg>

<seg id="1">Coach Smyła: our problem is not Silesia, but ourselves</seg>
<seg id="2">A streak of eight league games without a win will try to break in Friday's meeting with second-placed Silesia.</seg>
<seg id="3">"our problem is not Wroclaw, but ourselves, we have to work on what we play," said coach Mirosław Smyła.</seg>
<seg id="4">The last and so far only victory in the league was recorded in the first round, when they won 1-0 away from home against Raków Częstochowa.</seg>
<seg id="5">Later, they recorded two draws and six defeats, and on Tuesday they lost 1-0 to Zagłębie Lubin in the round of 32 of the Polish Cup.</seg>
<seg id="6">"it makes me optimistic that in the last seconds of the cup game the players were fighting for a goal, they wanted to draw.</seg>
<seg id="7">Their fall to the turf after the final whistle was not due to a breakdown, it was just a fall of anger because they were so close, "said Smyła.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he pointed out, Silesia has very strong wings, which is why he will sensitize the team to play in the side sectors of the pitch.</seg>
<seg id="9">"we are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we also look at what we want to play," added the coach.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Friday's match in Korona, Ognjen Gnjatic, sidelined for the excess of yellow cards, will also miss the injured Jakub Żubrowski and Michael Gardawski.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the other hand, it is heartening to report in a cup match several players with the desire to play.</seg>
<seg id="12">"we have a headache, not long ago it seemed to be gone, and now it is," stated Smyła.</seg>
<seg id="13">Defender Daniel Dziwniel stressed that Silesia will not be an easy opponent to break the streak of eight consecutive league games without a win, while in the Ekstraklasa anyone can win against anyone.</seg>
<seg id="14">"we are a good team.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the last few weeks, maybe we don't show it on the pitch, but the moment will come when we will win and we believe it will be on Friday," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">After nine rounds of the Ekstraklasa, the Crown is in 15th position with five points.</seg>
<seg id="17">Silesia has amassed 12 more and is in second place.</seg>
<seg id="18">Friday's game in Kielce will start at 8: 30 p.m.</seg>

<seg id="2">"42% of European tree species are threatened," warns the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).</seg>
<seg id="3">At the top of the list are, among others, chestnuts and rowan.</seg>
<seg id="4">The IUCN, an organisation based in Gland, Switzerland, is publishing a list of endangered species of European trees for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of the 454 tree species found in Europe (and elsewhere in the world), 42% are "at high risk," according to the study.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reasons for this include the rapid growth of urban agglomerations and global climate change.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, the trees and shrubs that are most at risk are those that occur only or mainly on our continent.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the IUCN, 58% of species are threatened and 15%, i.e. 66 species of trees and shrubs, are threatened with extinction.</seg>
<seg id="9">Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red List lists errors in logging, accelerated urbanisation, excessive logging, forest fires and changes in the European ecosystem.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of shrubs, mosses and lichens is also under serious threat.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the consequences of human activities lead to the gradual disappearance of European plant species and pose a danger of extinction in Europe for important and underappreciated varieties that underpin European ecosystems and affect the health of our planet," concluded the report by Luc Bas, who heads the IUCN's European office.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grzegorz Schetyna: I will not promise you 600 +</seg>
<seg id="2">"today the Law and Justice party wants to bribe Poles by offering them a loan for their freedom, which future generations will have to pay back," says Grzegorz Schetyna in an interview with Rzeczpospolita.</seg>
<seg id="3">In his opinion, "the whole policy of the Law and Justice party is a pic."</seg>
<seg id="4">At the same time, the politician promises that "whatever is given will not be taken away."</seg>
<seg id="5">Schetyna said in an interview with Jacek Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea to defeat Law and Justice.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is about mobilising the electorate at the ballot box.</seg>
<seg id="7">In his opinion, the opposition has more potential in this respect than Kaczynski's party.</seg>
<seg id="8">"today, there are more conscious people who want to live in a normal state than supporters of PiS, a party that has embezzled from proclaimed values such as modesty, humility, transparency," Schetyna says.</seg>
<seg id="9">The leader of the Civic Coalition and the chairman of the Civic Platform also emphasized the basic assumptions of the KO electoral program.</seg>
<seg id="10">"first of all, nothing that is given will be taken away, but we need to set the direction for the future, because the Law and Justice party only deals with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which can be seen even after dramatically low investments," he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Second, it is about "activating the energy of Poles, helping and investing in those who work diligently - and those who are entrepreneurial."</seg>
<seg id="12">Schetyna explains that the KO programme includes, among others, a project which will give the lowest earning Poles more than PLN 614 per hand, and the higher earners - also a few hundred.</seg>
<seg id="13">The politician also indicated that he did not want to race for the handout.</seg>
<seg id="14">He said he would do as much as he could do, but would not promise 600 +.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I will never allow the Greek variant, where the rulers bid with the opposition for handouts, until finally there was the financial collapse of the country," he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="16">Schetyna said in an interview that Jaroslaw Kaczynski and Mateusz Morawiecki were afraid to debate with him and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska.</seg>
<seg id="17">"we would expose their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.</seg>
<seg id="18">"pride steps before the fall.</seg>

<seg id="2">Six giant condors have been found dead in the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, reports TVN24.</seg>
<seg id="3">Experts believe that human activity contributed to their deaths.</seg>
<seg id="4">Great condors are likely to have been poisoned with a means of killing predators such as pumas, foxes or wild dogs.</seg>
<seg id="5">The animals may have eaten toxic carcasses.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition to one juvenile, the rest of the dead condor was an adult.</seg>
<seg id="7">"this is a big loss for the environment, because the condor needs to reach 10-15 years to become fertile and able to reproduce.</seg>
<seg id="8">So we are losing a protected species, an endangered species, "says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentine environmental organisation.</seg>

<seg id="2">Work has begun on giving the Head of State a precious chain.</seg>
<seg id="3">The idea was supported by the office of Andrzej Duda - we read in 'Rzeczpospolita'.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the newspaper, it is the golden chain of the Order of the White Eagle, the royal insignia officially called the jewel of the Republic of Poland in the interwar period.</seg>

<seg id="6">"RZ" reports that such a chain may soon end up on the shoulders of Andrzej Duda.</seg>

<seg id="8">The newspaper writes that this is also not the first attempt to restore the chain to the head of state.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Senate had already proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it was lost by one vote.</seg>

<seg id="2">The police action will be carried out, among others, at the intersection of Cieplińskiego Avenue and Piłsudskiego Avenue.</seg>
<seg id="3">The uniformed actions have something to do with recent complaints from city authorities about drivers not always being able to behave appropriately at the intersection.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Friday, September 27, police officers begin preventive actions in Rzeszów "passable intersections."</seg>
<seg id="5">The aim is to eliminate obstacles in traffic: entering the intersection without the possibility of exit, not following traffic signals or road signs.</seg>
<seg id="6">"we often think that we are alone at an intersection, and in fact we make life difficult for other drivers," said Marek Ustrobiński, deputy mayor of the city, a few days ago.</seg>

<seg id="13">It is threatened with a fine of PLN 300 and two penalty points.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, the uniform will pay attention to non-compliance with traffic lights or signs and incorrect parking in the area of intersections.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Australian tennis player received a 16-week ban and a fine of $25,000 - a six-month suspension - for his reprehensible words, gestures and actions during recent ATP tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="3">ATP World Tour officials are losing patience with Kyrgios, but are still giving him a chance to improve.</seg>
<seg id="4">A summary of the misdeeds of the most uncouth professional tennis player in recent years looks threatening - 16 weeks off plus a sizeable fine, but both penalties are suspended for six months - a probationary period in which the wayward athlete will be able to improve.</seg>
<seg id="5">Nick Kyrgios is still only 24 years old, but he has been racking up a kind of tennis world record - he had to pay the highest single financial penalty in the history of the discipline for breaking the rules of behavior on and off the court.</seg>
<seg id="6">There were loud curses, strange gestures, unsportsmanlike conduct, insulting the umpire and spectators, breaking two rackets during his loss to Karen Khachanov - all for which he paid $113,000 after the ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati in August.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the 2019 US Open, he also said publicly that ATP officials "are corrupt," which hurt the organization so much that they implemented a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios.</seg>
<seg id="8">But he was forgiven for his words about corruption, after listening to the guilty party and learning the context of the statement.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, tennis officials stated that the investigation found that Kyrgios' behaviour over the past 12 months in many cases raised serious concerns and constituted an almost constant violation of the rules that he continually insulted players and spectators in a vulgar manner, hence the high penalty.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the ATP gave him five days to file an appeal and immediately postponed the execution of the judgment, ordering the fulfillment of several conditions in the next six months: in ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour.</seg>

<seg id="1">Gus: life is getting better in Poland</seg>
<seg id="2">According to a report published on Friday by the Central Statistical Office (Gus), as many as 44% of households assessed their material situation as good or rather good last year.</seg>
<seg id="3">The figure was 37.2% a year earlier, 33.5% in 2016 and has never been higher than 30% since 2009, when the Office for National Statistics first examined subjective assessments of households.</seg>
<seg id="4">A total of 8.1% of households considered their material situation as bad or rather bad last year, compared to 11.2% a year earlier and more than 20% in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="5">The material situation of self-employed households is the best.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this group, more than 70% of respondents consider it good or rather good.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the other extreme are pensioners' households, where the proportion of such responses was just 18 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="8">The subjective assessment of the material situation of households is also influenced by the number of children.</seg>
<seg id="9">The worst situation is experienced by single parents, of whom 32% declare a good or rather good material situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among couples with children, the figure varies (depending on the number of children) from 55 to 60 percent, and among childless households it is 48.8 percent.</seg>
<seg id="11">The effect of the 500 + programme is clearly visible in these statistics.</seg>
<seg id="12">Before it was launched in 2016, the worst financial situation was assessed by single parents and large families (with at least three children).</seg>
<seg id="13">The improvement of subjective assessments of the material situation of Poles is a reflection of the rapid growth of income, mainly from work.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, this is not all, because the percentage of households that consider their situation to be good increases faster than real incomes.</seg>
<seg id="15">Moreover, at the level of voivodships, there is no clear relationship between the level of income and the assessment of material conditions of households.</seg>
<seg id="16">The best assessments are made by the inhabitants of the Opolskie Voivodeship, where 48.9% of respondents consider their situation to be good or rather good.</seg>
<seg id="17">This is followed by Lubuskie (47.7%), Śląskie (47.6%), Mazowieckie (47.3%) and Zachodniopomorskie (47.1%).</seg>
<seg id="18">Meanwhile, in Opole, disposable income (i.e. after paying taxes and contributions) amounted to less than 94% of the national average last year, and 98% in Lubuskie.</seg>
<seg id="19">Residents of Mazovia (120% of the national average) and Silesia (104%) had the highest incomes.</seg>
<seg id="20">On average, in Poland, disposable income per person was PLN 1693 in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="21">In real terms (after adjusting for the impact of price changes), it increased by 4.3% compared to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="22">Compared to previous years, this result is quite low.</seg>
<seg id="23">In 2016, income per person increased by 7 per cent and a year later by 6.3 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="24">While income growth is slowing, it is also holding back spending growth.</seg>
<seg id="25">Those per person amounted to PLN 1,187 last year, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7%.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is the first such case since 2013.</seg>
<seg id="27">Spending per person increased by 1.9% in real terms in 2017 and 4.3% in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="28">Household budget surveys suggest that a statistical household now spends 70.1% of its disposable income, compared to over 80% as recently as 2014 and above 90% by 2006.</seg>

<seg id="1">Niesiołowski was critical of the Pope.</seg>
<seg id="2">John Paul II did nothing</seg>
<seg id="3">In an interview with Piotr Lekszycki, Stefan Niesiołowski emphasized that in 1981 John Paul II was a great authority for opposition activists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in fact, his every sentence was accepted."</seg>
<seg id="5">Later, there was criticism of some of his actions.</seg>
<seg id="6">"for me, the fact that John Paul II could not liquidate Rydzyk's harmful activity casts a big shadow on his pontificate.</seg>
<seg id="7">After all, this Redemptorist - a pest of the Church and Poland - developed his media into the best during the life of the Polish pope, 'he explained.</seg>
<seg id="8">The former politician of the Civic Platform admitted: 'there were murmurs of discontent, the pope said something, he did not accept Rydzyk once but he had the authority and for politicking he could simply throw him out of the Church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, John Paul II did not do it, nor did his successors, "explained Niesiołowski.</seg>
<seg id="10">"besides, there was this fatal case of pedophilia and actions of the Church, or rather lack of them.</seg>
<seg id="11">I ran a little forward thinking, but I wanted to draw attention to the whole of his life.</seg>
<seg id="12">We have known about the scale of pedophilia in the Church since relatively recently.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question arises as to how it is possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting things, "says Niesiołowski in an interview with a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the opinion of the former politician of the Civic Platform, the Polish Church is an ally of the Law and Justice party.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we must admit that during the Solidarity period the Church was our most important ally.</seg>
<seg id="16">All the celebrations began with a mass, with crosses hanging everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now these crosses are written, they have become a symbol of the dictatorship - a sign of the written regime.</seg>
<seg id="18">I repeat: one of the biggest unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk are shaking the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing about it and that today the Church is an ally of the Law and Justice party.</seg>
<seg id="19">This is a black chapter of the Polish Church, for which he will pay dearly, "Niesiołowski argued.</seg>

<seg id="4">The match was suspended for 20 minutes after the incident.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Polish Football Association (PZPN), investigating this case, imposed a severe punishment on Gryf, excluding him from future games.</seg>

<seg id="5">For example, "Lviv" will appear next to "L'viv."</seg>
<seg id="6">In our province, the changes will be introduced on 94 road signs located at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.</seg>
<seg id="7">As we hear, it is supposed to be easier, clearer and simpler.</seg>
<seg id="8">The new guidelines are the result of an amendment to the Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure on detailed technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety equipment.</seg>
<seg id="9">"we should remember that place names in neighbouring countries often also have a Polish sound.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thanks to a change in the law that we have prepared, they will finally appear on signposts on our roads.</seg>

<seg id="16">What does the implementation of the idea look like?</seg>
<seg id="17">It will be done without changing the boards, on the basis of stickers.</seg>
<seg id="18">They will replace the existing town names with new ones, written in Polish on the already existing signs.</seg>
<seg id="19">Both names will be written in one line - first in Polish, then in the original, in parentheses.</seg>

<seg id="2">"effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will be necessary to consider whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade," said Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Science and Higher Education Jarosław Gowin.</seg>
<seg id="3">During an interview in "Signals of the Day" on radio Jedynka Gowin stated that trade is controlled by international networks, which impose such low margins on Polish producers that actually Polish companies cannot develop.</seg>
<seg id="4">Noting that it is very difficult to fight this problem, the Deputy Prime Minister reminded that the Law and Justice (PiS) government tried to deal with it at the very beginning of the term of office, but got a "counter-attack from the EC."</seg>
<seg id="5">"we won in the court of justice and I hope that if the United Right wins the next elections and forms a government, we will return to this subject," he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He also noted that "effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish small trade."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it will be necessary to consider whether the government, the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade," Gowin said.</seg>
<seg id="8">In May, an EU court ruled that the European Commission had erred in finding that the Polish retail tax was impermissible state aid.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Retail Sales Tax Act provided for the introduction of two tax rates on trade: 0.8 per cent on income between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1.4 per cent on income above PLN 170 million per month.</seg>
<seg id="10">The tax was due to take effect from September 2016.</seg>
<seg id="11">In September 2016, the European Commission launched an infringement procedure against Poland.</seg>
<seg id="12">Brussels argued at the time that the design of the tax could favour smaller shops, which could be considered public aid.</seg>
<seg id="13">She went on to say that the tribute had been implemented in an unlawful manner.</seg>
<seg id="14">It also issued an order suspending the application of the tax until its analysis has been completed by officials in Brussels.</seg>
<seg id="15">Poland disagreed, but tax collection was suspended.</seg>
<seg id="16">The EU court's decision in May opened the way for the reintroduction of the tax, but did not end the case.</seg>
<seg id="17">On 24 July, the Commission lodged an appeal with the Court of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="18">On Thursday, the CJEU's press service told PAP that the case is now at the written stage, in which both the European Commission and the Polish government present their arguments in writing.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not yet known if and when the oral procedure, the hearing of the parties and a possible hearing, will take place.</seg>

<seg id="1">How to dress a child for baptism?</seg>
<seg id="2">We suggest a few practical solutions</seg>
<seg id="3">Baptism is an extremely important celebration in the life of the infant and his parents.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is often the first occasion on which the whole family gathers around a child, celebrating their appearance in the world together.</seg>
<seg id="5">No wonder, then, that freshly baked mom and dad want their kids to look their best on this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, before you make a final decision about your child's outfit, consider whether it will also be comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the shops, you can find many costume sets that do not provide your child with proper comfort.</seg>
<seg id="8">So what should you pay attention to?</seg>
<seg id="9">The basic criterion for choosing clothes for baptism is the age of the child</seg>
<seg id="10">Until recently, a few weeks old babies were baptized, dressed in white sets and put in the same barrels or big spirits.</seg>
<seg id="11">Today, children who receive the sacrament are often older: a few months, a year, or even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is not difficult to guess that such a big comfort needs a slightly different clothes for baptism.</seg>
<seg id="13">Therefore, if your child is 3-4 months old on the day of baptism, they will probably spend the ceremony in a stroller or in the hands of their parents or godparents.</seg>
<seg id="14">The best way to do this is to decorate it in comfortable cotton sleeping bags or sets.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although this item of clothing is considered an everyday outfit, it is enough to search for its festive variants, for example with a frill or lace.</seg>
<seg id="16">For a boy, a body with a print of a fly and braces will be ideal.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the case of older children, you can afford more fancy dress.</seg>
<seg id="18">The little girl will look lovely in a simple tulle dress</seg>
<seg id="19">Many parents of girls look longingly towards the ornate, ruffled dresses for the christening, complete with coats, headbands and hats.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers use artificial, non-breathable materials in which the child is simply uncomfortable.</seg>
<seg id="21">In search of the right clothes, it is better to visit Asanti for Kids, which offers elegant outfits with cotton lining.</seg>
<seg id="22">Delicate tulle skirts, satin dresses, lace, appliques and charming sets will make your little girl look beautiful and feel comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="23">Perfect outfit for the little gentleman: cotton suit</seg>
<seg id="24">Until recently, there was a trend among parents of boys for suits that were copies of "adult" models.</seg>
<seg id="25">Polyester blazers and trousers, stiff collars or cuffs often made young elegants loudly demonstrate their displeasure.</seg>
<seg id="26">Today, thankfully, they have been superseded by comfortable cotton sets.</seg>
<seg id="27">Just look at the sets available in Asanti for Kids, which are soft, sweatpants, and a blouse decorated with a vest pattern on the front.</seg>
<seg id="28">These outfits look extremely festive, and at the same time do not restrict the movements of the child learning about the world.</seg>

<seg id="5">However, opposition parties decided that at such a crucial time as the last weeks before Britain's scheduled departure from the European Union on October 31, parliament should not interrupt the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="6">A total of 289 MPs voted in favour of the government's motion for a recess, while 306 voted against it.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two opposition parties already after conventions</seg>
<seg id="8">Prime Minister Boris Johnson's decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks, which was ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court on Tuesday, could be seen as a political vendetta against him.</seg>
<seg id="9">After the ruling, the House of Commons resumed its session on Wednesday, and the most important event of the day was Johnson's speech and the stormy debate that followed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Johnson accused the opposition of blocking Brexit and avoiding an early election.</seg>
<seg id="11">"it's time to deliver Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="12">It must be implemented in order to respect the result of the referendum.</seg>
<seg id="13">Brexit must come so that we can deal with the agreement on citizens' priorities, on the health service, on the cost of living.</seg>
<seg id="14">Brexit must be delivered so that we can unite this country, "said Johnson.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Conservative Party conference is due to start in Manchester next Sunday and run until Wednesday 2 October.</seg>
<seg id="16">The conferences of the two main opposition parties - Labour and the Liberal Democrats - have already taken place.</seg>
<seg id="17">One of the justifications given by Johnson in explaining such a long suspension of parliament was precisely the party conferences.</seg>

<seg id="2">"president Andrzej Duda believes that anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders," write foreign media.</seg>
<seg id="3">A spokesman for the president strongly denied the reports.</seg>
<seg id="4">"this is simply not true," Blazej Spychalski wrote on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="5">Israeli media, including Haaretz and the Jerusalem Post, reported that Andrzej Duda, during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora at the Polish consulate in New York, said that Israel was to blame for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.</seg>
<seg id="6">The president said that the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland is a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.</seg>
<seg id="7">He referred to the words of Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, who said in February that "Poles sucked anti-Semitism with their mothers' milk."</seg>
<seg id="8">Andrzej Duda said he regretted that Israel had not apologised for humiliating statements made by its politicians.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also mentioned the act of aggression against the Polish ambassador to Israel Marek Magierowski.</seg>
<seg id="10">In May, he was attacked by an assailant who shouted: "Pole, Pole."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the quote is not only inaccurate.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is simply not true, "Blazej Spychalski wrote on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="13">"he never said that Israel was responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland," Duda said.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to Spychalski, the portal "invented it."</seg>
<seg id="15">During the meeting, there was also a dispute between Holocaust survivor Edward Mosberg, awarded the Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland, and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mosberg was to agree with the words of President Duda and say that Jews from Israel "like Israel Kac" are responsible for the rise of anti-Semitism.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to sources, Boteach was supposed to interrupt Mosberg's speech.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who is Banaś and what did he blame?</seg>
<seg id="2">The house rented by the pimps led the journalist to discover the negligence in the property statements of Marian Banasia.</seg>
<seg id="3">We sum up another scandal that has rocked the ruling camp.</seg>
<seg id="4">Journalists from TVN Superwizjera revealed that Marian Banaś, the president of the Supreme Chamber of Control, had not entered the 400-metre tenement house, which is located in Kraków's Podgórze district, into the property declaration in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="5">What's more, his subtenant was supposed to run a sex business in the aforementioned tenement house (and thus rent rooms for hours).</seg>
<seg id="6">In turn, the building itself was allegedly the collateral for the loan repayment since 2016.</seg>
<seg id="7">The irregularities were pointed out by Bertold Kittel in the show "Supervisor."</seg>
<seg id="8">The journalist revealed that the house was rented by people connected with the criminal world, in order to use it as a place of "erotic meetings."</seg>
<seg id="9">The clients were said to be men using the services of prostitutes.</seg>
<seg id="10">Banaś responded vaguely and vaguely to the allegations.</seg>
<seg id="11">Interestingly, the tenement house rented by the pimps led the journalist to discover negligence in Banasia's property statements.</seg>
<seg id="12">The house itself was vaguely described in them, and the income from renting it was to be understated.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the assets of Marian Banas and his wife may be worth between 6 and 8 million zlotys.</seg>
<seg id="14">In total, the couple can boast of two houses, three flats, savings [...], "writes Money.pl.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the analysis of the portal, the house itself was worth about PLN 3 million.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Central Anti-Corruption Bureau is currently conducting an audit of Mariana Banasia's financial statements for the period 2015-2019.</seg>
<seg id="17">Banaś announced that he would suspend his activity in the Supreme Chamber of Control until its completion. "I will apply to the marshal for unpaid leave," he assured.</seg>
<seg id="18">The opposition is demanding an explanation.</seg>
<seg id="19">"we do not hear that CBA has expanded its investigation or accelerated its examination of Marian Banasia's financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="20">That is why we are forced to remove the organs of the state and submit a notification about the possibility of committing a crime [...], "said Mariusz Witczak.</seg>
<seg id="21">"if a normal Pole valued his rental properties so grossly low, he would already have 10 checks, tax impurities and penal-fiscal proceedings," he added.</seg>
<seg id="22">He went high, he fell low</seg>
<seg id="23">Marian Banaś is the new president of the Supreme Chamber of Control.</seg>
<seg id="24">He was appointed to the position on August 30, 2019, for a six-year term.</seg>
<seg id="25">His candidacy was put forward by the Law and Justice Party and the votes of the party's politicians were accepted.</seg>
<seg id="26">Previously, Banaś was associated with the Supreme Chamber of Control (NIK) between 1992 and 2005, and worked in this institution as an associate of Lech Kaczyński.</seg>
<seg id="27">During the first government of the Law and Justice party (2005-2008) Banaś held the position of the President of the Customs Service and the Undersecretary of State in the Ministry of Finance.</seg>
<seg id="28">Since 2015, he has again sat on the stool of the head of the Customs Service, and since 2017 he has managed the National Revenue Administration.</seg>
<seg id="29">Banaś served for three months as finance minister in the government of Mateusz Morawiecki.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the newspaper, flouting a specific behaviour order issued by a police officer is to be a new type of offence, punishable by a fine, arrest or restriction of liberty.</seg>
<seg id="3">Police unionists want such a change.</seg>
<seg id="4">The idea was submitted to the Sejm's Committee on Petitions.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the case is serious, because already every year more than half a million misdemeanor cases are sent to the Polish courts," it reads.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Rzeczpospolita" has established that the petition which the Independent Trade Union of Policemen is writing to MPs on the amendment of the code of offences has a chance of success.</seg>
<seg id="7">The petitioners propose a new wording of Article 54A of the Code of Offences.</seg>
<seg id="8">It would read: "anyone who does not comply with the request or order of a public officer, issued within the limits and on the basis of the provisions of the Act, shall be subject to arrest, fine or restriction of liberty."</seg>
<seg id="9">"par. 3 of this provision speaks of an identical punishment for those who, by disobeying orders, prevent or hinder the performance of a business activity," according to the Journal.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski told Rzeczpospolita that although he agrees with the main message of the proposal, he fears that if implemented, it could be used in political manifestations.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in situations of freedom demonstrations, it would be disadvantageous, and instead of alleviating the situation, it would even exacerbate it," he adds.</seg>
<seg id="12">Statistics reported by the newspaper showed that 86 percent of citizens had a positive view of police interventions in 2018, and that services make 1.5 million interventions in the city each month.</seg>

<seg id="2">Although the British travel company Thomas Cook has collapsed, its Belgian subsidiary Neckermann operates.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the company has problems.</seg>
<seg id="4">Brussels Airlines has announced it will cancel 105 flights in October due to problems related to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook, according to broadcaster VRT.</seg>
<seg id="5">Neckermann also laid off 75 employees.</seg>
<seg id="6">All trips with an office that have been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but holidaymakers will be able to get a refund.</seg>
<seg id="7">The court also declared the bankruptcy of three Belgian subsidiaries: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.</seg>
<seg id="8">Around 12,000 Belgians are currently abroad on Thomas Cook holidays.</seg>
<seg id="9">Another 40,000 people were expected to leave the office by the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">Thomas Cook Belgium spokeswoman Leen Segers said on Monday that the company was now "fully operational" despite the British parent company's bankruptcy filing, which caused concern among employees and customers.</seg>
<seg id="11">The office was reassuring then that customers who bought trips in it would go on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thomas Cook - one of the world's oldest and largest travel companies - filed for bankruptcy on Sunday night.</seg>
<seg id="13">The immediate cause of the bankruptcy was the collapse of last-ditch talks with creditors and potential investors on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="14">Creditors have been pushing for the company to secure an extra £200m as collateral for the winter period, when travel companies tend to have lower turnover, in addition to a £900m rescue plan already agreed in August.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, the company's problems have been mounting for several years, resulting in debts of up to £1.6bn.</seg>

<seg id="2">Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion - this is what the German city of Görlitz has prepared for visitors.</seg>
<seg id="3">The measures are intended to help combat the ongoing decline in the city's population.</seg>
<seg id="4">Görlitz is Germany's easternmost city.</seg>
<seg id="5">The beautiful pastel old town attracts 140,000 tourists a year.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, according to The Guardian, the city is struggling with significant problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Görlitz has the lowest wages in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">The city is also struggling with a steady decline in population.</seg>
<seg id="9">After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them left for the west of the country, resulting in a 25 percent decline in the city's population.</seg>
<seg id="10">In 2013, it had a population of 54,000.</seg>
<seg id="11">In an attempt to combat the depopulation, officials came up with the idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.</seg>
<seg id="12">So far, 150 proposals have been submitted to the programme.</seg>
<seg id="13">Two-thirds of them were submitted by residents of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="14">The programme also attracted people from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id="15">"when we applied, we thought the program was to convince people to move to Görlitz," said one of the project participants.</seg>
<seg id="16">"now we feel that it doesn't matter if we stay here after four weeks or not," he added.</seg>
<seg id="17">The city has seven thousand vacant dwellings, and unemployment is three times higher than the national average.</seg>
<seg id="18">Although city officials hope that some will move permanently, the main goal of the program is to get feedback from program participants.</seg>
<seg id="19">The information gathered from interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revive smaller German cities.</seg>
<seg id="20">"we want to know more about what people need, and if they decide to move, what their motivation was," said Robert Knippschild, responsible for the program.</seg>
<seg id="21">Other cities have already experimented with ideas to lure new residents by offering them incentives in the form of housing.</seg>
<seg id="22">The first was Detroit, which introduced a program to pay promising young professionals to live and work in the city for a year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy, or in the American city of Tulsa, Oklahoma.</seg>
