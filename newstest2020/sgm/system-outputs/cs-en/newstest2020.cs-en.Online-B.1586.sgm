<seg id="1">An unusually open and unique painting by Karel Gott in Olga Špátová's feature documentary</seg>
<seg id="2">This unique film from the workshop of Olga Špátová will have its premiere in Czech cinemas next spring.</seg>
<seg id="3">"In mid-September last year, Ivanka and Karel Gott called me and asked me if I would make a documentary about Karel's life with Karel again after ten years. I didn't hesitate for a minute! Thanks to my exceptional singing talent, artistic humility and immense diligence, it was and is a great honor for me, and I accepted the challenge to make a feature-length documentary about Karel Gott, which brings joy to three generations of listeners with its art, "director Olga Špátová describes her feelings.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thanks to a quick agreement and agreement, the first day of filming took place on October 22 last year, and the last shots with Karel Gott were filmed a few days ago. The goal was and is absolutely clear - to authentically capture Karel Gott as a phenomenal singer who distributes himself to his supporters, as a painter, but at the same time a loving husband and father of his children. A man who for sixty years has been distributing joy with his songs to several generations not only in our country, but also in Europe, and in fact all over the world. A man who enrolled in the hearts and souls of his listeners by simply being.</seg>
<seg id="5">The film is not intended to be a show of Karel Gott's undeniable fame and achievements. "That's why it's not even possible to compare my previous film The Gott Phenomenon with the present one. Everyone is different. At least by shooting them in a different stage of Karel Gott's life, and this is very evident in his personal, even intimate confession which confirmed us all in what kind of legend we have the opportunity to work with and spend time that is truly indescribable, "adds Olga Špátová.</seg>
<seg id="6">The creators captured Karel Gott during his performances, during meetings with his fans in our country and in Hamburg, but especially in his home environment, whether in Prague, in a cottage in Bohemian Switzerland, in a village where he spent his childhood, and in other places that played an important role in his life. Thanks to Karel Gott's sincere openness, the film will be completely authentic and unique.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Olga has a great gift for filming with her close team, so that we are often carried away by the spontaneous atmosphere and naturally let it into our privacy, thanks to which I talked about relatively confidential topics. With my husband, cameraman Jan Malíř, We originally wanted to release the film in 2019, when I celebrated my life anniversary, but because I had another beautiful summer with my family, I wanted us to shoot as long as possible. , my wish was that it would be released in cinemas in the spring of next year. This documentary is a thank you to my fans and all those who supported and accompanied me in my profession, "says Karel Gott himself about the film.</seg>

<seg id="1">Insects are up to sixty times less than 40 years ago</seg>
<seg id="2">No other animal class is represented in nature more than insects. Beetles, butterflies and other species make up more than half of life on Earth. But there are growing reports that the insect kingdom is shrinking radically. Another scientific study on the subject was published this week, and she said the situation was even more serious than humanity had ever realized.</seg>
<seg id="3">The study is based on field research in a tropical rainforest in Puerto Rico, in which American scientists copied a similar survey from 1976. As they write at the beginning of the report, insects are "ten to sixty times less" in the rainforest today. This is a decrease in the entire population, ie not the number of species, and the research concerned not only insects, but all arthropods. Due to the extinction of insects, the population of other fauna, which is dependent on insects in the food chain, such as birds, frogs or lizards, is also thinning.</seg>
<seg id="4">The authors of the research put their conclusions directly related to climate change. According to them, the average air temperature in the rainforest has risen by two degrees Celsius over the last thirty years, and warming has become the driving force behind the collapse of the food chain. According to the author's team, the study shows that the impact of climate change on tropical ecosystems may be much greater than previously thought.</seg>
<seg id="5">A major article about the report was published in the Washington Post on Monday, which reports the new findings as hyperalarmatic in the headline. "It's one of the most troubling articles I've ever read," entomologist David Wagner of the University of Connecticut told the paper, which he cites as an independent expert.</seg>
<seg id="6">Insect extinction also affects Europe. "In our country, the decrease is also an order of magnitude," points out Lukáš Čížek from the Institute of Entomology of the Academy of Sciences. According to him, however, in addition to climate change, it is also necessary to take into account the changes in the landscape, which play a significant role in Europe. "In our country, it only runs for a significantly longer time than in Puerto Rico," adds Čížek to the explanation of why scientists were able to measure such a rapid decline in the rainforest compared to the 1970s.</seg>

<seg id="1">Czechs in Europe by Ondřej Houska: Should Czechoslovakia reject the Munich Agreement in 1938 and go to war with Germany? NO three times</seg>
<seg id="2">The undated film depicts Adolf Hitler visiting the Czechoslovak border fortifications. The task of the forts was never to stop the German army, but to slow down its progress before the Allies joined.</seg>
<seg id="3">If, almost exactly 81 years ago, Czechoslovakia rejected the Munich Agreement and subsequently faced a German attack, what would exclude most Czechoslovak soldiers from the fight? German tanks, air force, or perhaps artillery? Quite possibly it would not be any of these weapons, even though the Germans had an overwhelming advantage over the Czechoslovaks. The Czechoslovak army would probably suffer the greatest losses - due to blisters.</seg>

<seg id="1">The chairman of the police unions, Štěpánek, resigned, he wants to live as a free man</seg>
<seg id="2">The chairman of the Independent Police Trade Union, Milan Štěpánek, has decided to resign. This was stated on Friday by Czech Radio - Radiožurnál. Štěpánek has been leading the unions since 2005. He will be the chairman of the unions for another two months. He will remain with the police even after leaving the head of the union.</seg>
<seg id="3">"I can confirm that I handed over my written resignation to the presidency this week, after which I will continue to hold office for another two months," Štěpánek told Radiožurnál. "I have decided as a free man who does not want to be attached to a trade union forever. And who wants to live a calmer life," he said of the reasons for leaving.</seg>
<seg id="4">The independent trade union of the Police of the Czech Republic associates members and employees of the security forces or employees of the Ministry of the Interior. Among other things, the union took part in police protests against budget cuts or petitions for better conditions for the security forces. In 2011, for example, he got into a dispute with the then Minister of the Interior, Radek John, and organized a petition for his resignation. The governing coalition leadership later agreed to John's departure.</seg>

<seg id="1">The museum in Semily with the exhibition returns to the Velvet Revolution</seg>
<seg id="2">Imitation of a normalization room with a television, in which footage from the brutal intervention of police officers against students on November 17, 1989 in Prague runs. This is also the case at the new exhibition of the museum in Semily, which is dedicated to the Velvet Revolution. "The basis is to present what happened in Semily after the events on Národní třída," said the curator of the exhibition, Tomáš Chvátal.</seg>
<seg id="3">"I would say that the atmosphere was basically the same everywhere, with the first demonstration in Semily on November 22, and then more people gradually packed up every day," he said. Among the most active were initially a group of local dissidents around Miroslav Matěcha, who was the only one from the city and the immediate vicinity to sign Charter 77, and the Dědečeks, who spread the Several Sentences petition. According to Chvátal, the Civic Forum was formed relatively quickly at that time. "One specificity is that there was a very strong group of local doctors in the Civic Forum," said the curator.</seg>
<seg id="4">About 50 photographs should draw visitors into what was happening in the city at that time, the images were taken 30 years ago by Karel Bárta. A video from the general strike on November 27, 1989, shot by František Tomíček, has also been preserved, which will be released in a loop throughout the exhibition. Ivan Hlas also spoke and sang at the demonstration. The Semily Archive also lent a number of preserved banners of the time to the exhibition. "They said: Let's not get drunk with a croissant, From riverbed to riverbed, We don't want violence," Chvátal said. Some changes in the city were very rapid at the time, for example, already in December, in an all-Sicilian vote, the people decided that the square would be Riegrovo and abolished the previous name Gottwaldovo.</seg>
<seg id="5">The exhibition also captures the events before the November events. "In the first part, we present to witnesses and students what was before such a late normalization. I think we managed to collect unique documents from Semily, whether they are banners with various communist slogans or a bronze plaque from the then museum of the workers' movement," said Chvátal . One room is supposed to evoke the feeling that it might have looked like in the living room of an ordinary household at the time.</seg>
<seg id="6">The last part of the exhibition focuses on what happened after the Velvet Revolution. It focuses on the first free elections. "We wallpapered one room with election posters. Those who have experienced it will remember the posters With us to Europe or there is Václav Klaus still under the heading OF with a beautiful motto Everyone for their community," added the curator.</seg>

<seg id="1">Let the fans be positive, Hašek wishes. A hit is waiting for Sparta in Pilsen</seg>
<seg id="2">"We will play at the limit of possibilities, we will do everything in our power to succeed. In order to manage the match in terms of games and results," the Spartan Martin Hašek promised in an interview for club television.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the week, the goal was decided by a cup duel in Jihlava (2: 1). Sparta advanced to the next round, which was her duty. She was relieved, but she continues to worry about the game.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though the season is slowly spilling over into the second period, football Sparta is still looking for the face that coach Václav Jílek talked about at the beginning of his engagement.</seg>
<seg id="5">"But it's still Sparta, which has very good players. We have a difficult match ahead of us," warns Roman Procházka from Pilsen.</seg>
<seg id="6">When the Spartans arrived in Štruncovy sady for the last time, in mid-May it was a clear matter in the superstructure. The guests left after a soulless performance with a beating of 0: 4, the largest in the history of the independent Czech league.</seg>
<seg id="7">While at that time the difference between the clubs in the table was eight points before the match, now Sparta is already losing nine points after ten games of the new season. It is experiencing one of the worst entries of the season ever.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It's not an easy situation for us or for the fans who would like to see their beloved club completely different from what it is at the moment," Hašek feels. "But we would like them to continue to support us, stay positive and stand behind us."</seg>
<seg id="9">Sparta does not know whether he will be able to use Tetteh in Pilsen, who received a two-match penalty for expulsion in Pilsen, but appealed against him on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="10">Costa, Dočkal, Drchal, Panák, Pulkrab, Zahustel, Krejčí and Kadlec remain on the numerous marauders, who are the only cadres to remember the last Spartan victory in Pilsen in 2011.</seg>
<seg id="11">The home team, who won the last five matches, including Wednesday's cup in Hlučín, should only miss midfielder Čermák. And as the captain, defender Jakub Brabec, a Spartan offspring, should lead them into the match.</seg>

<seg id="1">"A terrifying result of the study." Islam does not belong in the West, the vast majority of Austrians think</seg>
<seg id="2">1,200 respondents were interviewed, the survey shows considerable distrust of Islam in Austrian society.</seg>
<seg id="3">Nearly 60 percent of Austria's population fear that some Muslims are terrorists, and 48 percent would call for a ban on building mosques. 80 percent of respondents are in favor of greater monitoring of Islamic centers.</seg>
<seg id="4">Most Austrians also want Muslims to be restricted in their religious practices, arguing that they sometimes feel like foreigners in their own country because of the presence of Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The result of the study is frightening," says study author Wolfgang Aschauer, adding: "Such a tendency towards ethnocentrism could eventually lead to the adoption of discriminatory attitudes. There is a risk that the religious freedoms granted to Muslims will narrow."</seg>
<seg id="6">For believers, the critical attitude is less pronounced. Aschauer argues that in Austria this is not a conflict between religions, but between cultures. According to the sociologist, dialogue and education could help blunt polarization.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the study, extreme right-wing voters, people without a university degree or seniors over the age of 75 have the most hostile attitudes towards Muslims. On the other hand, the most friendly are the Green voters, people under the age of 30 and university students.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to estimates by the Austrian Ministry of the Interior, approximately 700,000 Muslims live in Austria, which has a population of around 8.7 million. The vast majority have Turkish roots. There are more than 400 Muslim prayer houses and mosques in the country, and Islam has been officially recognized as a religion since 1912.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Austrian, German and Polish divisions of the group also filed for insolvency during the week. The future of the Czech branch is currently being discussed, and a decision should be made by the end of September.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the vice-president of the Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic, Jan Papež, there are three variants of possible solutions at stake - liquidation will be announced, or the company will be sold, or a team from the Czech branch will set up a new travel agency. "Which of them it will be, but it cannot be predicted, will depend on the German owner," he told ČTK today.</seg>
<seg id="4">In addition to two prematurely terminated tours, the travel agency also solves cases where clients had to pay for their stay from their own, although the company tries to provide guarantees to hoteliers. The travel agency promised to make payments to its clients, according to the Pope, the company has sufficient security for this.</seg>
<seg id="5">Problems in hotels arose mainly in Mallorca, where the company also asked the Czech consulate for help. In this context, the Pope described to ČTK one of the cases in which the local hotel fired all the tourists from the office. "The hotelier could not determine who belongs to the German and who belongs to the Czech company. Therefore, he expelled everyone from the hotel, even though the domestic Neckermann provided guarantees," he said. According to Šrámek, the situation was finally resolved.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Czech branch of the bankrupt British group Thomas Cook last year increased its revenues to 995 million crowns, a year-on-year increase of almost 21 percent, according to the company's annual report. It covers the accounting period from October 2017 to the end of September 2018. On the other hand, the company's net profit decreased by approximately seven million to 15.3 million crowns. From previous years, however, the company was left with an unpaid loss of almost 103 million crowns. The branch includes two basic divisions - in addition to CK Neckermann, it is also the company Global Travel Lufthansa City Center.</seg>

<seg id="2">The administration of US President Donald Trump is considering revoking the license of Chinese companies to trade on the stock markets in the United States. An informed source told Reuters today. Such a move would be a radical escalation of trade tensions between the United States and China. The shares of the companies in question on the New York Stock Exchange immediately went down after the report and took the entire market with them.</seg>
<seg id="3">The withdrawal of shares would be part of a broader effort to limit US investment in China, the source added. He confirmed the Bloomberg report, which shortly before caused a shock on the financial markets. Shares of Chinese companies Alibaba Group Holding, JD.com, Pinduoduo, Baidu, Vipshop Holdings, Baozun and IQIYI lost two to four percent.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to government data from February, the shares of 156 Chinese companies are traded on the US stock exchanges Nasdaq and NYSE. There are also at least 11 state-owned enterprises among them.</seg>
<seg id="5">Bloomberg pointed out that a precise mechanism has not yet been developed to ensure the withdrawal of shares of Chinese companies from US stock exchanges. A possible plan would have to be approved by Trump, who, however, gave the green light to negotiations on the matter.</seg>
<seg id="6">China and the United States have been waging a trade war for more than a year, during which they impose tariffs on each other. The dispute between the two countries has negative effects on the world economy and raises fears of a recession in the global economy. Washington is using tariffs to force Beijing to change trade practices and reduce China's trade surplus with the United States.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the CNBC television server, trade negotiations between the USA and China should be resumed on October 10. Its goal is to end the trade war.</seg>

<seg id="2">The police accused the former manager of the state agency CzechTourism, Aleš Pangrác, about contracts for promotion. Pangrác of the SeznamZprávy server confirmed that he accepted the accusations this week. Czech Television (ČT) stated last year that the police are investigating contracts worth 38 million crowns in the case. According to the police, part of the money went back to Pangrác, the server writes. In the case, criminal investigators were also interested in the Minister for Regional Development Klára Dostálová (for YES), to whose department CzechTourism belongs. The investigation into the case according to the server continues.</seg>
<seg id="3">Detectives from the National Center against Organized Crime provided evidence in the case in the second half of last November. They were, for example, at the headquarters of the Ministry for Regional Development, at the headquarters of CzechTourism, at the autodrome in Most or at the Sport Invest agency. The minister's office computer was also taken from the apartment. In a court order for a house search near Dostálová, which was previously quoted by ČT, it was stated that in 2016, when she was a deputy, the Minister decided on CzechTourism's expenses in favor of the chosen persons indirectly and outside the standard official procedure. Dostálová then stated that she felt absolutely innocent, did not err, can document everything and fully cooperates with the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the agency, it was an individual's fault. The media has previously stated that he is a former director of the regional partnership department in CzechTourism, Aleš Pangrác, who was dismissed due to the results of the audit. As a result, the CzechTourism agency concluded 48 problematic contracts.</seg>

<seg id="2">Renowned French chef Marc Veyrat lost his third Michelin star in January this year, a year after winning it. He intends to try with the publisher of the Red Guide to obtain the exact reasons for the degradation. Veyrat also doubts the competencies of Michelin inspectors, who he said confused saffron with cheddar. The first trial is scheduled for November.</seg>
<seg id="3">The chef of the famous restaurant La Maison de Bois in the Alpine region of Haute-Savoie lost one of the three Michelin stars in January this year. He will be sued with the publisher of the prestigious Le Guide Michelin because, according to him, the commissioners' conclusion was not duly substantiated. In addition, according to him, the asterisk was removed without any notice. "I've been depressed for six months. How dare you play with the health of the chefs?" Veyrat told the commissioners.</seg>
<seg id="4">Michelin allegedly provided the chef with only vague reasons, such as the fact that the chef put cheddar in the souffle, which the inspection did not like. "I put saffron in it and the gentlemen thought it was cheddar because it was yellow. I've been lovingly working with Savoy ingredients from the beginning," Veyrat said against the decision. He is convinced of the strong incompetence of the Michelin commissioners: "You are fraudsters who only provoke disputes for commercial reasons." Outraged, Veyrat does not understand "how could they afford to say that we put cheddar in our souffle". "They also offended our region, my employees were crazy about it. We have eggs from our hens, milk from our own cows, gardeners collect fresh herbs every morning," he said angrily.</seg>
<seg id="5">The distinguished chef, always with a black hat on his head and dark glasses, is opposed to a new generation of Michelin commissioners, and therefore demands the removal of his restaurant from the red guide. However, the publisher refuses. "If the company remains open and our inspectors re-select it, we will continue to recommend it," said Gwendal Poullennec, Michelin's international director.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to Michelin, the chef's lawsuit shows that he has no meaningful accusations yet and that the lawyer will only help him to formulate it. "We regret that Mr. Veyrat is communicating rudely with us. But we will carefully examine his comments," he said.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition to La Maison de Bois, Marc Veyart owns two other three-star restaurants.</seg>

<seg id="2">Children's bank accounts are provided free of charge. However, you need to consider the offer because some additional account services are already charged. "The motivation of banks to offer accounts for children, whose basic management is usually free, is straightforward. Financial houses expect their forgiven fees to be refunded once. The small migration of Czechs between banks is probably not wrong," says Kristýna Kuncová from dTest.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to her, "small accounts" can do almost everything that adult accounts do. The child receives his own payment card, can enter payments, monitor account movements, and has his own electronic banking available somewhere. Banks will set up an account, but it is up to the parents to teach the children how to handle them and also to check their payments.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Quite flexibly, the parent can set weekly or monthly limits, turn on and off individual services, etc. But above all, they can monitor what is happening on the account, either by browsing the Internet or through information SMS. Please note that these may not be free." Kuncová adds and adds: "If a parent is considering an account for his child, he should consider his abilities and possibilities."</seg>

<seg id="1">Wife change: Ondra's parents were cruelly abused! He ended up in an institution</seg>
<seg id="2">It was about nerves. The allegedly problematic son Ondřej (9) was severely punished by his father at any moment. "He came from school and lied about a snack. Lukáš looked at me and said that he would kneel as a punishment," Lucie described in the Exchange. Dad Lukáš forced little Ondra to kneel in the corner for several hours! In addition to the cameras, he allegedly had to suffer like this on a wooden pad to massage his feet! "Ondřej came to me after the filming and told me - aunt, I'm making the trouble and remarks just so I wouldn't be here because I want to go to the institute," Lucie described the moment when she fully understood what was going on outside the studio door. And the boy's wish finally came true ...</seg>
<seg id="3">His condition was so serious that he was taken away from his family after filming and placed for a month in the Center for Educational Care in České Budějovice. He returned briefly to his father and surrogate mother Aneta (28), but then traveled to a diagnostic institute for problem children. "When I came home, Aneta immediately added me on Facebook, we wrote for a while. She was most interested in whether we got the money. I almost didn't react to it at all. But then she wrote me that the little one was in the institution, then they returned him, now he is in the diagnostic school. They are both out of work, "says mother Lucie from Plzeň.</seg>
<seg id="4">Of course, the lightning addressed the other side as well, but received only a vague answer. "I'm not in the mood, I'm sick, call later," Aneta said, hanging up.</seg>

<seg id="1">Berlin is responding to public pressure and addressing the housing crisis. He will buy 6,000 flats from a private company</seg>
<seg id="2">Berlin will buy 6,000 former social housing from the private Luxembourg company ADO Properties SA for 920 million euros (CZK 23.8 billion), which the city sold 15 years ago. It thus responds to public pressure, which is rebelling against rocketing rising rental prices. According to Berlin Senator Katrin Lompscher on behalf of the Left (Die Linke), this is the largest such buyout in the history of the German capital. The opposition criticizes the move.</seg>
<seg id="3">"The intention is to keep rents stable in Berlin and give tenants security," said Berlin Mayor Michael Müller (SPD) in a statement. "At the same time, we will continue to build new apartments and legally treat the rent freeze," he added. The municipal company Gewobag will take over thousands of flats located in the districts of Spandau and Reinickendorf in the western part of the city in December this year.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Jefferies analyst Thomas Rothäusler, the city bought too much. Rothäusler told Bloomberg that, according to his estimate, the housing unit overpaid about ten percent above their book value.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the German opposition party Liberals (FDP), the Berlin authorities are contributing to real estate speculation. The FDP stated this on Twitter on Friday. The protest party Alternative for Germany (AfD) called the move a "waste of money".</seg>
<seg id="6">Already in mid-July, Gewobag regained 670 flats on Berlin's Karl-Marx-Allee, the weekly Der Spiegel recalled on its website. The price was not published by the council at that time. The dispute over the flats on the former exhibition street from the times of the GDR was accompanied by protests and filled the front pages of the German press. It became a symbol of the difficult situation of tenants in large German cities, the paper wrote.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the same time, the German capital used to be famous for its low cost of living and low rents. In recent years, however, it has gained in attractiveness. According to the AFP agency, rental prices have doubled in the last ten years, making it difficult for some residents to find affordable housing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nokia is suing the Brno company for the name Lokia. People do not confuse us, the Moravians believe</seg>
<seg id="2">Nokia has filed an opposition against Lokia's application to the Industrial Property Office. However, according to the CCV, product substitution is unlikely.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Brno-based company developing CCV software is facing legal action from the Finnish telecommunications equipment manufacturer Nokia. Finns do not like the fact that the program of the Brno company for warehouse management is called Lokia WMS, wrote the daily E15. Nokia therefore objected to the Lokia brand's application to the Industrial Property Office. CCV considers that confusion is unlikely.</seg>
<seg id="4">Marketing Director Petr Ondrášek stated that the program is already used by two dozen customers, it has been on the market since last September.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The Nokia brand enjoys recognition and trust around the world. When someone tries to register a brand that we believe may lead to confusion or weakening of our brand, we take steps to protect our valuable asset," said Nokia spokesman Mark Durrant.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Brno developers claim that they did not think of a brand famous in the past for mobile phones when creating the stock program. The designation Lokia according to CCV is based on the Latin name for one species of dragonfly, the rapid movement of which is supposed to be an analogy of the movement of warehouse workers around the warehouse.</seg>
<seg id="7">"On the Czech market, the possibility of confusion is unlikely. We sell modern cloud software with which companies equip their warehouses, and we really do not aim for mobile phone production. CCV manager Tomáš Kormaňák.</seg>
<seg id="8">CCV applied for trademark protection in August before the program was launched at the Industrial Property Office. "It applied for protection for products and services in Classes 9, 35 and 42, as the software belongs to Class 9, the related warehouse management services belong to Class 35 and the development of computer software in Class 42 according to the international classification," said Ondrášek.</seg>
<seg id="9">Nokia's opposition is based on the fact that the earlier Nokia mark is valid in all classes of goods and services and thus covers the widest possible range of goods and services and therefore, of course, also overlaps in classes 9, 35 and 42. "CCV does not dispute the opponent in terms of agreement on these classes of products and services, but in reality they are completely different brands aimed at other target groups, "said Ondrášek.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to E15, a brand dispute can take months and can complicate the company's activities.</seg>

<seg id="2">Saber combines a classic aircraft engine with a rocket. It is designed to propel the aircraft at twice the speed of the Concordes. "Once the Saber engine is up and running, it could allow us to reach Australia in about four hours," Turnock said. And, for example, the distance between London and New York could be flown in one hour.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Independent server notes that so-called hypersonic flights, which exceed the speed of sound five times, are complicated by engine overheating. However, Saber (Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine) should deal with this problem thanks to the use of super-cold helium, which should prevent temperatures from rising.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The most important thing about the Saber is that it is a hybrid of a rocket and an aircraft engine that is powered by a stream of exhaust gases generated from the air," says Shaun Driscoll of Reaction Engines. "Rockets haven't undergone such a major development in the last 70 years, while aircraft rockets have. So when you combine engines, you can have a very light and efficient propulsion system and basically create a spacecraft," he added.</seg>
<seg id="5">The engine is currently being tested, with test flights expected to begin around mid-next year. Commercial flights around 2030.</seg>

<seg id="2">Due to restructuring, Kovosvit ended last year with a consolidated loss of 100 million crowns, consolidated turnover was 1.3 billion. Last year's main problems include Kuchař's lack of staff and shifts in subcontractors. This year, the demand for machine tools fell, by 10 to 20 percent year on year. "Related to this is the expected decline in turnover of the order of ten percent," said the CEO. In 2017, Kovosvit had sales of 1.3 billion crowns and a profit after tax of 40.1 million. The loss for 2016 was 719 million.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kovosvit now offers for sale several properties, halls and land, which it either does not use or only minimally. This also applies to the administrative building, where two of the five floors are used, and not yet completely. "Part of the long-term restructuring plan is to streamline Kovosvit, streamline its operations. The sale of assets is not part of any current solution, such as cash flow, but part of a long-term plan where we want to devote all resources to investment development," said the CEO.</seg>
<seg id="4">Kovosvit exports about half of its production. Its standard markets are the EU and Russia, to a lesser extent Asia last year. This year, Kuchař ranks among the most interesting in India, where Kovosvit won an order for machines enabling five-axis machining worth 100 million crowns. This year, the company also exported two five-axis machines for 30 million crowns to China. "Another order in the same volume is being negotiated, which we would like to fulfill by the end of the year," Kuchař said. In the Russian market and elsewhere, Kovosvit is facing restrictions due to sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Last year, the company sold two five-axis machining centers to France, an Airbus subcontractor. It delivered another machine to her in May this year, and another one should be delivered at the end of the year or the beginning of 2020.</seg>
<seg id="6">The main corporate investment this year was the transition of heating from steam to hot water for 20 million crowns. Kovosvit employs 500 people, the average working wage is 28,500 crowns. The company is looking for casting grinders for foundries, machine tools, lathes and electricians.</seg>
<seg id="7">The company has been owned by industrialist and armourer Jaroslav Strnad since September 2016. The company has a tradition in the production of machine tools. It was founded in 1939 by Tomáš Baťa. The company once had up to three thousand employees.</seg>

<seg id="1">Milan Jakubů: The army stole the funeral for itself! Says Andor Sandor</seg>
<seg id="2">There are still uncertainties surrounding the funeral of Brigadier General Milan Jakubů. The media speculated during the week that the army was planning the last farewell to the deputy director of Military Intelligence, despite the wishes of the bombastic family, as far as the soldiers can. There were also discrepancies regarding the date of the funeral. Jan Pejšek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, denied this.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It's nonsense! We have been in contact with the family from the beginning, the agreed Friday funeral date has been valid from the beginning, no one has changed it. Just as military honors are valid. The funeral will finally take place on Friday and it will not lack all military honors, including the flight of fighters.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, there is still a tense atmosphere around the last farewell to the popular general. The funeral ceremony will not be attended by the decision of the organizers people who have worked with the general in the past!</seg>
<seg id="5">For example, he is a former head of military intelligence, Andor Šándor (62), who met Milan Jakubů 17 years ago. Sandor remembers his former colleague as hardworking, intelligent and "good guy".</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition, he has met him regularly in recent years to celebrate the anniversary of the founding of Military Intelligence. That is why he would like to say goodbye to Milan Jakubů. "Personally, I would go to the funeral of Milan Jakubů," Šándor told Blesk. But he can't.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I also know of other people from the organization who would like to go, but they are unlucky because the potentates usurp the funeral for themselves. I think it is not right to privatize the funeral in this way," said a security expert. The allegedly considered closing of the ceremony to the public due to the secrecy of army leaders is not even playing for him.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The leadership of the army is not kept secret, nor are the leaders of military intelligence, because they need to be promoted at Prague Castle, we see them there. for the army to overthrow the family and its wishes, "concluded Šándor.</seg>
<seg id="9">Milan Jakubů died on Saturday in a car accident near Špindlerův Mlýn. The frontal collision of Milan's Rapid with the Ford Mustang was allegedly caused by the driver of the sports car, Vojtěch Ch. (31).</seg>
<seg id="10">The amateur racer in the turn was supposed to go in the opposite direction, Milan Jakubů apparently did not have a chance to prevent the collision. His wife (47) suffered serious injuries in the accident and may suffer the consequences for the rest of her life. Police heard the perpetrator of the accident on Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Commentary by Jan Šindelář: Managing railways as a company</seg>
<seg id="2">The heavenly election, though apparently not entirely smooth, is the culmination of the sad story of the state's inability to give the railways a clear direction. The board of directors has been incomplete for over a year and it does not change even after Wednesday evening, because one of the members resigned. The provisional period lasts.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the very beginning, the selection procedure itself was a farce because the requirements for candidates, especially in the field of practice, were significantly reduced. Compared to last year's selection, the requirements for the size of the company in which the candidate was to operate in the past have decreased. At first, the members of the selection committee and then the supervisory board played only the role of pimprlat.</seg>
<seg id="4">Nebeský probably submitted the weakest professional CV of the five finalists, yet without experience from a large company, he rubbed experienced fighters from the management of logistics giants and transport companies. It was the participation of interesting managers from the private sector that was probably the brightest aspect (and the greatest hope) of the whole process. Today, they know that they only played the role of narrative backdrops in the political game.</seg>
<seg id="5">Maybe Heavenly will surprise, show great talent and eventually prove to be the best railway boss of all time. At least in the beginning, however, he will be accompanied by the taste of political trafficking. Czech Railways does not have an easy period, they have to cope with competition in the liberalization of the market and the lack of employees in operation. Drivers, shunters and mechanics are missing. What motivation should they have for further work and respect for management when the state behaves in the top management like an elephant in porcelain?</seg>
<seg id="6">The second important group are creditors. We will see how the tracks at the head of the tracks will be unloaded next spring when the tracks defend their rating. What is certain is that creditors perceive instability. It is sad that someone else goes to Moody's to defend Czech Railways every year. The agency did not miss the frequent changes in railway management and political influence on the company, it criticized them this summer.</seg>
<seg id="7">The YES movement, among other things, carries out the motto that the state must be run as a company. For a start, it would be enough to run one large state-owned company as a firm, not as a state. Czech Railways is still one of the largest companies in the country and it would be good if the best led them. They reported, but the state despised them. It can certainly be argued that the post at the head of the railways has always been a political matter. But then we can forgive the pranksters with the tender.</seg>

It concluded that water, soil and food pollution in some industrial areas in the west of the country was associated with an increased incidence of cancer among local people.</seg>
<seg id="3">The researchers mentioned in particular the Dilovasi industrial zone, which is located about 80 kilometers from Istanbul and where a number of chemical and metallurgical plants are located. According to them, people living in its vicinity suffer from cancer far more often than the international average.</seg>
<seg id="4">Erdogan takes revenge for the coup, despite international criticism</seg>
<seg id="5">It seemed to Sik that, despite the clear conclusions of the study, the government was not taking any action. He therefore wrote several articles about the research in the opposition daily Cumhuriyet. Authorities then began to prosecute him for disclosing classified information.</seg>
<seg id="6">"The study clearly showed the extent to which water resources were contaminated with toxic substances," Sik told reporters after the verdict. "The court ruling shows that the results of studies that directly concern public health can be concealed. This is unacceptable," the scientist added.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The Turkish authorities should investigate this important public health problem instead of prosecuting people who sound the alarm," said Andrew Gardner of the Turkish branch of AI.</seg>

<seg id="1">The fastest man on the planet missed the tests. I'm not taking anything, he's defending himself</seg>
<seg id="2">Traditionally, the much-watched battle for the fastest man on the planet will be a hunt for Christian Coleman's silver defender at the World Cup. The 23-year-old American is the world leader in 9.81 seconds and has lost only once this year. However, his start at the peak of the season was threatened due to a case of missed doping tests.</seg>
<seg id="3">The US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) closed his case in early September without charge for formal reasons. Coleman did not pass three doping tests last year and this year, but not within 12 months. His first offense was dated back to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) on April 1, 2018, the beginning of the second quarter, but he did not miss the test until June 6. And because the third omission occurred on April 29, 2019, Coleman did not commit an offense in the form of three failed inspections within 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="4">Coleman argued that he only forgot to update the in-app data for athletes. "I don't take drugs or take anything legal. A lot of athletes use legal creatine or protein powder or various other supplements for faster regeneration. And I don't take anything, I work hard and that's what it's about," he said before the World Cup began.</seg>
<seg id="5">He suffered the only defeat out of six starts this year in a hundred at the start of the season at the Diamond League in Shanghai, where he was only six thousandths of a second ahead of his compatriot Noah Lyles. He used Coleman's absence to triumph in the finals of the Diamond League, but only two hundred will run at the World Championships.</seg>
<seg id="6">On paper, the second fastest competitor with a performance of 9.86 is the 22-year-old Nigerian Divine Oduduru, who has so far only succeeded in American university competitions.</seg>

<seg id="2">There were two people on the plane, a man († 63) and a woman († 38). "At half past eight in the evening, the plane applied for permission to land at Chaloupky Airport near Klatovy," said police spokeswoman Dana Ladmanová. This was also the last record, at that time according to GPS coordinates it was supposed to be located near Vojovice near Žinkov.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, it did not reach the Klatovy airport. The lost plane, which sent out an emergency signal, was immediately searched. "In addition to the police, a military helicopter also took part," said police spokeswoman Martina Korandová. But the search operation did not have a happy ending.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the forest near Petrovice near Měčín, which is about six kilometers from the place where the plane last reported, the helicopter crew noticed the wreckage before nine o'clock in the morning. "We found a plane and two bodies without signs of life," Korand confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="5">The crashed machine remained partially wedged in the branches of trees, the pieces fell to the ground in the vicinity. "We will find out the cause of the accident in cooperation with experts and employees of the Institute for the Professional Investigation of the Causes of Aircraft Accidents," Korandová added.</seg>

<seg id="1">Civilization in the best time</seg>
<seg id="2">Recently, I remembered a beautiful "message" from one of Šimek's and Grossmann's great stories, set in part in the cemetery, which reads as follows: "I warned her that she was crying well, but on a foreign grave!" It occurred to me that many of the world's politicians now engaged in a senseless fight against climate change are behaving very similarly now.</seg>
<seg id="3">They act as if people are ruling the planet Earth. In fact, we are just a speck on her surface that she can blow away with her gigantic powers like a gust of wind, the flame of a candle. Probably few of them look at the famous British and American science documents dealing with the destructive abilities of our blue ball. After all, it would be enough for some of the larger active volcanoes to "slip" properly and our advanced civilization will regret it.</seg>
<seg id="4">And it is highly likely that this will happen in the near future. According to leading volcanologists, many large volcanoes are "charged and unlocked" (for example, Katla in Iceland).</seg>
<seg id="5">In a way, it would be ideal if the eruption, if it had to happen once, happened as soon as possible. Even before trillions of dollars are wasted on measures to reduce carbon dioxide production, because any really angry volcano, along with dust and poisonous volcanic gases, can release it into the atmosphere at least a hundred times more than has been saved at the expense of Europe's population.</seg>
<seg id="6">Thus, there is no point in forcibly reducing CO2 production. In addition, it has been scientifically proven that with its significantly higher proportion in the air, plants form more biological matter and are also more resistant to drought. For humanity, possible warming is significantly more favorable than, for example, the rapid return of the Ice Age.</seg>
<seg id="7">If we realize the hitherto insufficiently researched effect of solar cycles on the Earth's climate, we must come to only one reasonable conclusion: Let us strive to keep the Earth as clean as possible, and let us adapt to other changes with which we cannot compete with the least possible costs!</seg>

<seg id="1">The repair of the Krkonoše Museum will be a year late</seg>
<seg id="2">The administration of the Krkonoše National Park (KRNAP) postponed by three weeks the deadline for submitting bids to the second tender for the repair of the Krkonoše Museum in Vrchlabí. The original date for opening the envelopes was September 20, said national park spokesman Radek Drahný. The reason for postponing the deadline for submission of bids is the reduction of the budget from 110 million crowns to 83 million crowns.</seg>
<seg id="3">"We are currently working with prices that are on the market. There has been a change in the budget, this is the price we expect to be offered. If someone submits an offer that will be acceptable, the work will start as soon as possible," said Drahný. .</seg>
<seg id="4">Compared to the original plans, the start of repairs to the museum is about a year late. KRNAP wanted to have a selected supplier of the construction part by the end of last year and to start construction work this spring. According to the management of the national park administration, European subsidies of 123 million crowns for the project are not endangered.</seg>
<seg id="5">The KRNAP administration is unable to select a construction company for the museum's repairs. The second competition was announced this summer, because in the previous tender all the companies' offers significantly exceeded the then estimated price of 65 million. The bids exceeded 100 million crowns.</seg>
<seg id="6">The museum, which is housed in a former Augustinian monastery and belongs to the KRNAP Administration, has been closed since autumn 2017. The selected company should provide the construction part of the project. The total costs, including the construction of a new exhibition, are estimated at 210 million crowns. The KRNAP visitor center should be established in the now vacated building by the end of 2021 after the transformation of the expositions.</seg>
<seg id="7">The renovated museum with a new interactive exhibition, which should be a story of nature and people settled in the mountains and build on the successful exhibition Stone and Life, should serve as a representative entrance gate for the Giant Mountains. The visitor center should provide information about the past and present of the Giant Mountains in the most comprehensible form possible and motivate people to discover the mountains and protect them. It should also take on the role of a traditional museum. The center will also offer opportunities for concerts, festivals, theater performances or open-air lectures. The plans are to build a new entrance to the building, create a research room or cafe.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Toyota Mirai should never be just a concept. Toyota took it so seriously that even though there was virtually no hydrogen infrastructure in the world, it still put it on offer. So not to a completely standard, the customer had to really go for this car on purpose, but no one else offered such a variant at the time.</seg>
<seg id="3">Toyota boss Takeshi Uchiyamada confirmed at an international conference on hydrogen that a new generation will come next year. Toyota still believes that these cars have a future and will match the price of hybrids within ten years. Of course, this is connected with the development of gas networks. However, the future is connected with hydrogen as well as electricity.</seg>
<seg id="4">The word hydrogen was often used at the conference with the needs of ecological operation not of passenger cars, but on the contrary of large tractors, ships, trains, etc. Simply those means of transport that need to overcome long distances in one refueling. Pure battery versions cannot offer this. Thanks to extensive experience and long development, Toyota could find new markets.</seg>

<seg id="1">Purposeful slander? The Ústí Zoo is looking for a new veterinarian, no one is interested</seg>
<seg id="2">Last at the end of this month. The city administration attributes this to the slander that erupted around the former director of the zoo and at the same time veterinarian Václav Poživil, that he purposefully killed the exotic animals he took care of. For example, it was a female rhinoceros Zamba, elephant Kalu or orangutan Ňuňák.</seg>
<seg id="3">The city council therefore announced a new contract. "For veterinary care for a zoo with an estimated value of 3.5 million crowns without VAT and for the City Center for Animals in Need with an estimated value of 2.8 million crowns without VAT," said city spokeswoman Romana Macová.</seg>
<seg id="4">Deputy Mayor Věra Nechybová (UFO) explained that the city is announcing a competition for veterinary services for the third time. "Dr. Poživil had to explain the unsubstantiated suspicions. I consider it a blatant dishonesty of such a quality expert," she remarked.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to her, there are very few experts specializing in exotic animals. "It's definitely not pleasant. The zoo so far provides veterinary care in the form of orders," she said. Orders and a contract cost the same money. "But the garden must comply with the Public Procurement Act in terms of financing," explained zoo spokeswoman Nikola Roštejnská.</seg>
<seg id="6">Václav Poživil himself is one of the recognized experts. For example, he took part in a unique operation in which the Ústí cheetah Jane was the first cheetah in the world to receive a total endoprosthesis. He held the position of director of the zoo from 2009 to 2012. He did not comment on anonymous slander against himself. He did not receive phone calls or respond to SMS text messages yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="7">As for the contract for the zoo, some veterinarians think that the zero interest in it does not necessarily have to be worries about similar accusations as in his case, but simply little information. For example, the Ústí veterinarian Jiří Král has not heard of her yet. "I hear it from you for the first time. No one has contacted us. I think such a thing will spread quickly," he added.</seg>

According to her, the metro cannot be seen only as a transport structure, traveling by underground should also bring an aesthetic experience.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Czech architect, who participated in, for example, the reconstruction of three London Underground stations, won a tender announced by the Prague Transport Company (DPP).</seg>
<seg id="4">In addition to the tender, another 14 applicants took part in the tender. "The selection process included a cover letter and a CV.

<seg id="5">The metro is not only perceived as a functional transport structure. Stations should also have aesthetic value.</seg>

<seg id="2">Nová Ves u Leštiny (Havlíčkobrodsko) - The farm in Nová Ves u Leštiny in Havlíčkobrodsko today opened the Pumpkin World for more than a month. Decorations made of thousands of freshly harvested pumpkins are dominated by massive orange pyramids in the garden. The autumn event, which is becoming a tradition, starts a week later this year, as pumpkins have matured longer on the surrounding seven hectares of fields of the Pipek family. There are still many of them in the field, Jaroslava Pipková told ČTK today.</seg>
<seg id="3">Pipek grows many types of pumpkins, but the weather has not been good for the last two years. This year's harvest was delayed and some species did not come out. "As usual, we have plenty of orange pumpkins for Halloween, but some species didn't work for connoisseurs," Pipková said. Nevertheless, you can choose from several types on the farm, from the already mentioned large pumpkins suitable for carving and carving decorations through pumpkins for cooking hokaido or elongated "spaghetti" to decorative pumpkins of various colors and shapes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Growing pumpkins is laborious. Farmers manually dig up plants and harvest their fruits, cutting them from the stem of the pumpkin with scissors. The Pumpkin World has been open to Pipek regularly since 2010, previous years have attracted thousands of people. The decoration of pumpkins is complemented by attractions made of straw or a maze of logs. Visitors will also see animals kept on the farm. It will be open daily until November 3.</seg>
<seg id="5">Details of the event can be found on the farm's website, where growers also offer some recipes for pumpkin dishes, such as pumpkin muffins or juice. Visitors themselves tell them about other possibilities of preparing pumpkins in the kitchen. "A lot of cookbooks have tried their own recipes, and we also get inspired," Pipková said. She noted that some housewives also treat pumpkins to pickles like cucumbers.</seg>

<seg id="5">The Income Tax Act allows companies to pay a maximum of 55 percent of the price of a meal voucher. The remaining part is paid by the employees, in some cases they are also paid by the employer, but without a tax rebate.

It's beautiful here all the time, nice races, the spectators came, so fine," he smiled.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sparkler was also satisfied. "In qualifying, you don't want to make an unnecessary mistake. I didn't do well in the first goals.

<seg id="1">Declaration of the end of the right in the Chamber of Deputies or How the "right-wing" coalition of ODS, TOP 09, STAN and KDU?</seg>
<seg id="2">There have been recent reports in the media and comments about the upcoming coalition of these parties. Many applaud that the "right" is finally coming together, but I rather wonder why these parties still call themselves right-wing.</seg>
<seg id="3">Leaving aside the new Tricolor movement, the Czech Chamber of Deputies no longer has a real right-wing party. And it doesn't matter how the subjects label themselves or what the mainstream media parrots label. The ODS is hardly central in its average of the top politicians of this party, TOP 09 is clearly a party of the city's pseudoliberal left (which is ashamed of its leftism, and so is hypocritically referred to as conservative or even right-wing). STAN is a party that basically merges with TOP 09 in its conception, ideology and electoral targeting (the reason for its existence is simply not clear to me). And KDU has even labeled itself as a centerpiece for a long time - but their political compass is much more to the left than they say.</seg>
<seg id="4">Do you feel like I've taken them all out of one water? No, I am based on the real political steps of these parties. If I consider myself a classically liberal right-wing voter, the highest value for me is the freedom of the individual, the free market and minimal state intervention in the lives of individuals and the economy. How do these parties fulfill this general presumption of rightness? How many laws slashing people's freedoms by the salami method, raising taxes, confirming new regulations and growing surveillance, increasing the bond with the socialist EU or promoting environmental and gender madness have supported it in recent years? A lot, a lot. Not custom stickers, but actions identify them. These parties, despite all sorts of declarations or partial concessions, want to strengthen the role of the state in our lives. And that has nothing to do with right-wingness.</seg>
<seg id="5">I would not be surprised at all by the coalition cooperation between TOP 09, STAN and KDU; However, the ODS has long been portrayed as "the only right-wing" and, by merging with these three entities, it already reveals its true political position.</seg>
<seg id="6">By the way, when I mentioned those stickers briefly. Have you noticed how often all these parties identify in a completely identical and cheap way the critics of dirigisme and socialism coming from the European Union as pro-Russian agents? Can't or just don't want to understand that there are many people who don't smell Eurosocialism and growing lack of freedom as strongly as the authoritarian regime in Russia? Do they not by any chance hide their utter argumentation incompetence and unreasonable or blind adoration of Euro-EU conditions?</seg>
<seg id="7">In short, it is possible that in the Czech Republic, non-central politics no longer have a chance of greater success. Maybe voters really want that kind of connection. Maybe they want a center-left policy under the guise of the "right" because they are ashamed (or can't even identify) of their political beliefs. I don't know. But I am definitely not one of those voters.</seg>

Criminalist Jiří Markovič was able to investigate the murder of two girls in Prague's Prokopské údolí valley, which was 12 years old at the time, in 1980. "The case of 1955?

There is always hope, but it would be really difficult," says Markovic.</seg>

<seg id="1">The launch of the new toll is not endangered, Kremlík reports. But the change of operator is at stake</seg>
<seg id="2">On Friday, the Ministry of Transport began preparations for a new tender for the operation of a new toll system. It is a contingency plan that the state would use in the event that the current toll contract was legally canceled. In addition, the state is preparing another temporary solution if it does not manage to complete the tender on time. This was stated on Facebook by the Minister of Transport Vladimír Kremlík (for YES).</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, the Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS) banned the fulfillment of the toll agreement between the state and the CzechToll / SkyToll consortium, with a one-year delay. The Ministry will file an appeal against this.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The launch of the new toll collection system is not endangered. Starting today, we are starting the preparation of a new transparent tender procedure, the subject of which will be the services of operating the new toll system, which is now being completed by the CzechToll and SkyToll consortium," the minister said.</seg>
<seg id="5">The state would thus look for the operator of the toll currently being prepared in the tender, which will be launched from December this year. It would therefore not be a competition for a completely new toll system, as was the case with the last tender, nor the use of the old system now operated by Kapsch.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, according to Kremlík, the ministry is also preparing for the fact that it would not be able to prepare a new tender in time. "Based on previous experience with the course of the toll tender, I am deeply convinced that the Office is wrong and that within the 12-month period it cannot objectively prepare and implement such a complex tender procedure and hand over the operation of the toll system to the new operator," he said.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thus, in addition to the new tender procedure, the resort will also prepare a temporary solution that would resolve the collection of tolls for a transitional period until the state finds a full-fledged form of solution.</seg>
<seg id="8">The state will probably not use the offer submitted to it in recent days by the current toll administrator Kapsch. The Austrian state company offered to operate the existing system in case the toll contract was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, the Kremlin reiterated that he believed that a backup plan would not be needed. The Ministry will therefore file an appeal against the decision of the Antimonopoly Office.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Thursday, the Office issued a decision banning the performance of the toll contract. However, the ban will not take effect until one year after the Office's decision has become final. It is not final and an appeal can be lodged against it with the President of the Office. The Ministry and CzechToll are therefore continuing to prepare a new toll, which should be launched in December.</seg>

"To like each other and to perceive problems as a challenge and a good thing to solve," he revealed, recalling the awarding of the Czech Lions when his friend fell on the steps.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Yes, it really happened. He had new slippery shoes and the red carpet was slippery too. So it didn't take long and he was lying on the ground. He could make it a priority. He had a workshop on Vančur's Stairs, where he taught how to fall down the stairs safely at VIP events. "</seg>

<seg id="2">In addition to West Nile fever, mosquitoes can also transmit malaria, for example.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Friday, Germany announced the first case in which a person became infected with West Nile fever in German territory after being bitten by an infected mosquito.

<seg id="1">And where are the spectators? Doha cannot be London</seg>
<seg id="2">At the same time, however, it is a step backwards, as the pilgrimage to Doha has voluntarily and consciously renounced the captivating atmosphere prevailing at the sold-out stadium in London in 2017 and last year at the European Championships in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="3">Giant banners on the walls of skyscrapers in Doha invite you to "the biggest sporting event of 2019". However, fears about how dignified her scenery will be are growing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Tickets for the finish line are sold out for all evenings," say the organizers.</seg>
<seg id="5">But that's too little.</seg>
<seg id="6">The upper gallery of the Khalifa stadium with a total capacity of 40,000 spectators is already covered with colorful sails, which also depict the flags of 209 participating countries. Athletics has set off in Qatar in a territory where, despite the annual meeting of the Diamond League, it has no roots.</seg>
<seg id="7">Not surprisingly, last week only a total of 50,000 tickets were sold for ten days of the championship, although their price started at 60 Qatari rials, ie less than 400 crowns.</seg>
<seg id="8">The organizers have now set themselves the goal of filling at least half of the uncovered parts of the stands. Therefore, according to sources in the British newspaper Giuardian, they allegedly (although the organizers themselves deny this) distribute free tickets to migrants who work here as workers, as well as to children. Which Sebastian Coe, head of the IAAF athletic association, can also comment positively: "In the same way, we can inspire future generations."</seg>
<seg id="9">In the past, rich Qatar won world championships in handball and cycling, after athletics in 2022 it will be football's turn. The financial offers of the oil power will always be lucrative even for rich sports federations. Such is the reality of today's sports world.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even if we approach it and ignore the absence of fans in the stadium, we can't help but feel a purely sporting sigh that the experiment with the first outdoor world championship of athletes in the Arabian Peninsula should have been timed better by IAAF leaders - and another year. The extremely late term, forced by the climate, disrupts the whole scheme of the season in the pre-Olympic year and thus the preparation for the key Olympic season, which would normally start for athletes in October.</seg>
<seg id="11">Perhaps Qatar will at least make up for it with technological innovations, with the help of which it promises an ultra-modern and attractive championship. That it's just 37 degrees? Already now the stadium area is artificially air-conditioned to twenty-four. And the advanced cameras, built directly into the blocks, are intended to show television viewers in detail what is happening to athletes in hundredths of a second before and just after the starter's shot.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bloomberg: Venezuela has hidden bitcoins and doesn't know what to do with them</seg>
<seg id="2">Venezuela's central bank is conducting internal tests to see if it can hold cryptocurrencies. It thus responds to an instruction from the state-owned Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), which seeks to send bitcoins and ethers to the central bank and then pay the cryptocurrencies to the oil company's suppliers. Employees are also studying a proposal for the central bank to include cryptocurrencies in foreign exchange reserves, which are now close to the 30-year low. Referring to information from four sources, Bloomberg reported.</seg>
<seg id="3">The sanctions imposed by the United States on the authoritarian regime of President Nicolas Madur largely cut Venezuela off from the global financial system. This has deepened the country's economic crisis. The current crisis is one of the most serious in the world, forcing officials to use a mix of different ways to move money. While Madur's efforts to launch the world's first cryptocurrency failed, ongoing efforts to use digital currencies show how desperately the government is trying to find ways to circumvent the restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="4">Neither the Venezuelan Central Bank nor PDVSA responded to the request for comments.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is not clear how PDVSA came up with its own bitcoins and ethers, or how much value these currencies own. The company has problems obtaining payments from customers through conventional channels because large banks are not willing to trade with entities that are subject to sanctions. Last month, the company received most of the payment of $ 700 million (CZK 16.6 billion) in Chinese yuan because the parties could not find financial institutions that would allow the transaction.</seg>
<seg id="6">PDVSA may not feel like selling cryptocurrencies on the open market, as this would require it to register on the stock exchange and undergo due diligence. Instead, he wants the cryptocurrency to be used by the central bank and paid with it to entities to which PDVSA owes. The oil company's representatives believe that the central bank is less exposed to possible obstacles that could arise from payment by cryptocurrencies.</seg>
<seg id="7">Bitcoins and ethers use a decentralized online ledger known as a blockchain to verify and record transactions. In some cases, relatively anonymous transfers are possible without the need for an intermediary. Few banks engage in digital currencies because of problems with money laundering and related client information that complicate compliance.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the debacle in 2018, cryptocurrencies are experiencing a return to prominence this year due to the expectation of their greater acceptance by institutions and Facebook's plan to come up with its own cryptocurrency. Even so, they remain unstable. Bitcoin has fallen by almost 20 percent in the last four days, but has made a profit of about 130 percent since the beginning of the year.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Kia XCeed is a relatively difficult model to classify. It is clearly a compact SUV, but does not offer all-wheel drive. He leaves this item to the larger sibling Sportage, which is such a direct response to cars like the Škoda Karoq, Opel Grandland X or Volkswagen Tiguan. Compared to them, the XCeed also relies on more dynamic body shapes, which by sloping the rear can remotely resemble the world of the SUV-coupe, popular in this part of the market, especially among premium brands Audi, BMW or Mercedes-Benz.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the other hand, the XCeed cannot be included only alongside the plastic-coated versions of classic compacts, such as the Ford Focus Active. Compared to him, the Koreans have made a much larger number of changes to the body, so those who do not want to see Ceed in the shape of a novelty may not even have to.</seg>
<seg id="4">Unlike the compact hatchback or Ceed station wagon, the XCeed is also offered exclusively with supercharged engines, so don't expect a basic atmospheric fourteen. XCeed starts with a supercharged liter and also offers a supercharged 16 kW with 150 kW, reserved for siblings of the GT version. Don't expect a sports degree here. Turbodiesels 1.6 CRDi is only available in a mild-hybrid version, which means that the internal combustion engine is assisted by an electrical system that helps reduce consumption and emissions. From 100 kW, it is also possible to pay extra for a seven-speed two-clutch machine in addition to the manual.</seg>

<seg id="1">The car tuner brought the voice of the digital soul</seg>
<seg id="2">Everything you know about obesity is wrong, according to the headline of a long text written by Michael Hobbes for the Huffington Post and photographed by Finlay Mackay. The provocative explanation says that the medical community for decades ignored the facts about obesity and waged a ruthless (and also useless) war against overweight people, which not only marked public opinion but also destroyed many lives. But now is the time for a new paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="3">What Hobbes states at the outset is the fact that there is often a very long and tedious journey from knowing the facts to putting them into practice. He mentions the case of scurvy, where some captains handed out lemons, limes and oranges to their crew in the seventeenth century, believing that they would prevent diseases. However, the British Navy withdrew from this practice due to fears of increased costs. The clear influence of the fruit in the prevention and treatment of the disease was then demonstrated in the middle of the 18th century, but it took another fifty years before the navy took this into account. Seat belts also existed long before the invention of the car, but became mandatory only in the 1960s, as well as the first confirmed death in connection with asbestos dates from 1906, yet its first ban came in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Every discovery in the field of public health - no matter how important - has always had to compete with traditions, prejudices and financial incentives within the society in which it was to be implemented," Hobbes writes. In American society today, nearly 80 percent of the adult population and about one-third of children meet the definition of overweight or obesity. More Americans today live with obesity than with breast cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and HIV combined.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the same time, obesity is seen as a sovereign personal failure of an individual, which is said to burden the health care system and reduce GDP. The fear of obesity is so great in the population that Americans today spend more money on diets than they spend on computer games and movies. However, the truth is that diets do not work. As early as 1959, research showed that 95 to 98% of attempts to lose weight end in failure, and two-thirds of people on a diet then gain more than they lose.</seg>
<seg id="6">Armed with statistics, Hobbes further describes the lifestyles and traumas of overweight people. The personal one encounters the systemic one, where, for example, at the faculties, when teaching future doctors, he devotes only 19 hours of the entire study to the issue of nutrition. Which, at a time when the 60 calorie process that Americans eat comes from ultra-processed food.</seg>
<seg id="7">How obesity is stigmatized is again illustrated by reports from surgeries, where overweight people usually experience shorter check-ups, doctors approach them with less empathy and consider them more problematic patients.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, being overweight is far from just an American problem, Hobbes writes. Since 1980, the proportion of obesity in 73 countries has doubled and has risen in 113. And during that time, no country has managed to reduce and stop this increase. Absolutely none.</seg>

<seg id="2">The most expensive item is the listing fee every year before the Grand Prix. This year it was about one hundred and fifteen million crowns. "The mass of people who come to Brno during the Grand Prix will spend money there on accommodation, food or entertainment, which should more or less offset the costs associated with organizing the event, including the listing fee," said economist Petr Pelc.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to him, the importance of the race is also in attracting tourists to the city. "Brno does not have so many world tourist attractions. The big price attracts visitors from abroad. It is as important for Brno as, for example, the Tuřany airport or the exhibition center. And these are projects that are supported from public money," added the economist.</seg>
<seg id="4">Grand Prix in Brno</seg>
<seg id="5">- costs for the past five years: 686 million crowns</seg>
<seg id="6">- profits from the past five years: 682 million crowns</seg>
<seg id="7">- problem: lack of money to organize, increasing listing fee for the promotional company Dorna</seg>
<seg id="8">- possible solutions: more money from the state, use of advertising space, increase in ticket prices</seg>
<seg id="9">- state of play: negotiations on a new contract for the next five years</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the director of the Institute of Public Administration, Filip Hrůza, the organizers must now evaluate whether the race is advantageous for Brno. "The Grand Prix sucks money out of public budgets for other matters. But to a certain extent, it's a political issue, not an economic one," he thinks.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the future, the cost of a motoring event may be even higher. In the game, there is a variant to increase the listing fee almost double.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The situation is not closed, we must try to negotiate the best possible conditions with Dorna. It also depends on the extent to which the state is ready to contribute to the race. If the worst-case scenarios come true, I am afraid it is not realistic the region paid the amount, "admitted the mayor of Brno Markéta Vaňková.</seg>
<seg id="13">As Deník Rovnost has already informed, representatives of the South Moravian Region and Brno are also discussing the possibility of using advertising due to difficulties in raising money for the Grand Prix. "Dorna's condition is that the advertisement must be placed in places that do not occupy the cameras. The selection of companies is also limited, because if Dorna has a general sponsor, then a company from the same area cannot be the second sponsor," Vaňková explained.</seg>
<seg id="14">Organizers can also get more money from tickets in the coming years. "We have to sit down and say what the costs will actually be. And we have to adjust the revaluation of tickets accordingly," said the Brno opposition representative for the ANO movement and former mayor Petr Vokřál.</seg>

<seg id="1">Accident on D5: A motorway crash closed the highway</seg>
<seg id="2">The event was reported around 08:00 at the 22nd kilometer in the direction of Prague. "The highway is closed, at least for freight transport. Cars can go through petrol," said police spokeswoman Michaela Richterová in the morning. The operation was resumed around 2:30 p.m. According to Richter, the preliminary damage is at least two million crowns, and the police are investigating the cause of the accident.</seg>
<seg id="3">Petr Svoboda, a spokesman for the Central Bohemian fire brigade, stated that one truck was transporting passenger cars and the other plastic granulate. "Due to the large impact, the transported vehicles were shifted, which the firefighters first had to secure against a possible fall," he added.</seg>
<seg id="4">One of the cars had a damaged fuel tank, from which about 200 liters of diesel leaked. The firefighters managed to drain another 200 liters. Employees of the Department of the Environment of Beroun Town Hall were called to the accident due to a fuel leak.

<seg id="1">Unsuccessful qualification. Czech athletes are not doing well in Doha yet</seg>
<seg id="2">The Doha World Championships began with qualifying setbacks for Czech athletics. Diana Mezuliáníková dropped out in the 800-meter run and the pole vaulter Romana Maláčová and the hammerhead Kateřina Šafránková, who defended the eighth place, which surprised her last year in London, did not pass the qualification.</seg>
<seg id="3">Hurdler Vít Müller will complete the start on Friday and Marcela Joglová will run the night marathon race.</seg>
<seg id="4">Šafránková threw 65.46 meters with her third attempt and fell almost six meters behind her maximum this year, which she would have to improve to advance. Maláčová jumped 435 cm, 450 cm was already beyond her strength. To participate in the finals, it was necessary to overcome the limit of 460 cm.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mezuliáníková, who got to the championship at the last minute thanks to an invitation from the IAAF, finished in the fourth run in the penultimate sixth place and not even 2: 03.48 minutes was enough for her to advance to the semifinals. It was one and a half seconds behind its maximum this year. "It was quite fast for me, unfortunately I fought with my opponent in the corner, which robbed me of my strength. It occurred to me that I still had strength, but it slowed me down. I almost stopped and had to start again, so in "It was a bit uncomfortable for this. I can't be completely satisfied," said the Czech national team member.</seg>
<seg id="6">She was glad that she overtook at least one opponent in the finish line. "She really wasn't doing well, so every losing opponent was good. But I think it was in fifth place. Unfortunately," she added. The fastest half-runner in the starts was Winnie Nanyond from Uganda in 2: 00.36.</seg>
<seg id="7">Doha lacks South Africa's top eight-year-old Caster Semenya, who has too high testosterone levels in her body but, like some other runners, is refusing treatment ordered by IAAF rules this year.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the 100-meter races, the American Christian Coleman, who was the only one to fall below ten seconds with a time of 9.98, confirmed his role as the number one favorite. His compatriot Justin Gatlin, who is trying to defend his title at the age of 37, also advanced to the semifinals. The Nigerian Divine Oduduru did not start, who is second in this year's performance with a performance of 9.86, and his duel with Coleman, who has a performance of 9.81 this season, was expected.</seg>
<seg id="9">The great form was shown in the qualification of long-distance Cuban Juan Miguel Echevarría, who flew to a distance of 840 cm with the first jump. No athlete has jumped that far in World Cup qualification in the last 20 years. The 21-year-old Cuban leads this year's tables with an output of 865 cm.</seg>

<seg id="1">Which cities will disappear under the sea?</seg>
<seg id="2">A vote by the upper house of the Canadian parliament has confirmed a rumor for several days now: Canada is taking away honorary citizenship from Nobel Peace Prize winner Do Aung San Suu Kyi, a former human rights legend. The current leader of Myanmar (Burma), who spent years under house arrest in an effort to bring freedom to her country, lost her honorary title due to her involvement in genocide against the Rohingya minority.</seg>
<seg id="3">The decision to take Suu Kyi's honorary citizenship was approved a week ago by the lower legislature, and the senators have now unanimously supported it. "This is the right message for her, for Myanmar and for the whole world," commented the decision of her colleagues by Independent Senator Ratna Omidvar. "We must make it clear that the accomplices to the genocide are not welcome here in Canada - all the more so as honorary citizens."</seg>
<seg id="4">Technically, the verdict of the Canadian parliament does not change anything for Suu Kyi, it is just an honorary title, but on a symbolic level it is a strong message for her. The silence of the long-standing human rights activist against the atrocities committed by the army of mostly Buddhist Myanmar for endless months on the Rohingya Muslim minority is unbearable.</seg>
<seg id="5">The fact that there is an officially organized genocide in Myanmar and that Suu Kyi - the de facto prime minister of the local government - has completely failed in its duty to protect its citizens, a UN report recently said. In particular, it mentions the names of several army commanders who, according to the investigation team, should stand trial for crimes against humanity committed in actions which, as the report says, "shock both with the horror of their actions and the enormous scale". According to the UN, Suu Kyi and her leadership administration committed complicity mainly by covering up the actions of soldiers and releasing a fog of lies around them - for example, that it was an "anti-terrorist operation".</seg>
<seg id="6">After the deletion of Suu Kyi, five personalities remain on the list of honorary citizens of Canada: Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, Nelson Mandela, Tenzin Gyamtso, the 14th Dalai Lama, Karim Aga Khan IV, the 49th Imam of Shiite Muslims and Malala Yousufzai.</seg>
<seg id="7">Developments around the former icon of the struggle for freedom and democracy were also reflected in the Canadian Museum of Human Rights, where information about atrocities against the Rohings and the parliamentary decision to take her the title of honorary citizen were added to Suu Kyi's profile. "We also dimmed the brightening of her photo on the human rights timeline and we are considering replacing her face with a portrait of a member of the Rohingya minority," Museum spokesman Rorie McLeod was quoted as saying by Canadian media.</seg>
<seg id="8">The only thing that will remain so in the current upheavals of Suu Kyi - at least for now - is the Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to her at the suggestion of Václav Havel in 1991 for a huge contribution to the struggle for democracy. "While Ms. Suu Kyi's current actions are regrettable, her award will not be overturned," said Nobel Foundation chief Lars Heikensten of Canada's CBS.</seg>

<seg id="1">Microplasts reached the human gut, the study confirmed for the first time</seg>
<seg id="2">Scientists have been confirmed for several years. A team led by Professor Philipp Schwabl, a professor at the University of Vienna, published a study that for the first time proves the presence of microplastics in human stool. Although the study is small, with eight participants from Europe, Japan and Russia - however, in the samples of all subjects, small particles of plastic with dimensions between 50 and 500 micrometers were found. None of the eight subjects were vegetarians, six of them did not avoid sea fish, all drank water from plastic bottles and food packed in plastic.</seg>
<seg id="3">And it would actually be a bit of a miracle if nothing was found. We already know that microplastics - which are produced either directly, for example for the cosmetics industry, or by the disintegration of larger pieces - are present in marine animals, insects, tap water and lemonades; in short, everywhere on the planet. Thus, their entry into the human digestive system has only been officially confirmed. There were about 20 microplast particles per ten grams of stool, and scientists estimate that more than half of the world's population will have them.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lay and scientific awareness, of course, suspects that it is not good. However, humanity still does not know how bad it is - and what effect microplastics have on "host" organisms. Small particles can enter the bloodstream or lymphatic system and end up in the liver, for example. "This is the first study of its kind to confirm what we have thought for a long time. Now that we have the first evidence of microplastics in the human body, we must continue to investigate what exactly this means for human health," says Schwabl.</seg>
<seg id="5">So far, it is known that microplastics in the intestines can negatively affect the immune reactions of the digestive system, and thus facilitate the absorption of toxic chemicals and other pathogens into the body. And so far no other known solution is to limit the use of plastics, especially polypropylene. However, this will be difficult - the first task facing governments and authorities will at least stop its sharp rise. As for plastic bottles alone, experts estimate that in three years, humanity will consume a fifth more than they do today. The current rate is captivating one million bottles bought per minute. About eight million tons of plastic end up in the seas and oceans each year. Waste threatens marine ecosystems and infects the digestive systems of marine animals.</seg>
<seg id="6">Some states have already adopted restrictions and other measures, for example, Kenya has banned plastic bags under the threat of draconian penalties. The European Commission is considering minor bans (well-known straws), and the domestic Ministry of the Environment is heading in the same direction. However, critics claim that such measures are nice, but completely inadequate.</seg>

<seg id="1">Harry in the footsteps of Princess Diana († 36)! Where is Meghan?</seg>
<seg id="2">Diana was unique in being able to grab people's hearts. In January 1997, it caused a stir when it visited Africa and especially the minefield. The pictures of him wearing a protective suit and a shield on his face have become iconic. And even then, no one could have guessed that a few months later, the princess of human hearts would exhale for the last time in a tragic car accident in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="3">Her younger son Harry was now scoring when, after 22 years, he went to the same place as her. He went to the demining station in Diric, Angola, also put on a special protective suit and looked very thoughtful. He certainly did not resist the memories of his beloved mother, whom he lost at the age of only 13.</seg>
<seg id="4">Harry gave a speech on the spot, praising the efforts of the Halo Trust, which is working to defuse minefields and other explosives in war-torn countries. "Minefields are the unhealed wounds of war. By clearing them, we can help the community find peace with opportunities," he said, calling for the rescue and preservation of wildlife and the local river as a source of water. After this visit, the Duke of Sussex moved to Huamba to rename the local orthopedic center after his famous mother, Princess Diana.</seg>
<seg id="5">He did not forget to mention her in his official Instagram account: "The Duke is honored to visit a place and community that were so important to his mother, to get acquainted with their tireless mission and to speak to all whom (Diana) felt most they needed to be heard, even though the problem wasn't exactly popular worldwide, "the Sussex Royal Instagram post appeared.</seg>
<seg id="6">Royal fans, however, may freeze that he did not take his wife Meghan (38) and their son Archie (4 months) on such an expedition to remember Diana. They both have a separate program from Harry since Wednesday, probably to protect them. After all, taking a little baby to a minefield doesn't sound very safe, and Harry doesn't want to endanger his beloved family at any cost.</seg>

<seg id="1">The only ones. We are not sure of reproduction, but we do not have to scare</seg>
<seg id="2">Some words have unfortunate connotations, even if they only state the state of affairs. They include the word only one. Indicates a child growing up without siblings, but does not sound neutral. "You know, single child," they say, without the need to add anything. Interestingly, this feature has been worn by the "only child" for a long time, even from times when terms such as the demographic crisis were not widely used.</seg>
<seg id="3">Today, even people outside the scientific community know that a fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman is necessary to ensure simple reproduction of the population. It is also widely known that no state in Europe today achieves this value. France and Sweden are the closest to it, but European countries do not have a simple level of population reproduction. (Within the West, only Israel stands out with a total fertility rate of 3.1 children per woman.) It's a situation made for alarmism. That's why it's no wonder that the Minister of Labor and Social Affairs, Maláčová, also fails: "There are almost as many single women as there are two-child families," she told LN in an interview. But she forgot the devil hidden in detail.</seg>
<seg id="4">Yes, it is good to point out a problem instead of downplaying or ideologizing. For example, as in Germany, where the campaign for more children easily gets the label of fascism (in the style of "Hitler also supported it"). It is good to remember that many couples plan to be single. It is good for politicians to show a willingness to remove the obstacles that lead to those decisions (for example, a slight increase in work from home discourages women from further pregnancies). But in spite of all this, let us point out one thing.</seg>
<seg id="5">If Minister Maláčová says that "there are almost so many only ones", there is a drop in demagoguery. That statement was appropriate twenty years ago. Let us recall that fertility in the Czech Republic last ensured simple reproduction in 1980 ("Husák's children"). Then it fell to a terrible 1.14 in 2000. But since then it has risen by almost fifty percent, to the current 1.70 children per woman, which is above the European average. This is not enough for simple reproduction, so the activity of politicians is appropriate. Only with that alarmism can they take a little.</seg>

<seg id="2">Costa Rica received the title for several reasons. To begin with, the plan to be carbon neutral by 2050 - however, many countries have committed to this under the Paris Agreement. The Central American state, with a population of about five million, produces only 0.4 percent of the world's emissions. Costa Rica has also committed to a full switch to renewable energy by 2030, with 70 percent of buses or taxis expected to run on electricity.</seg>
<seg id="3">The official tourism organization states that about 95 percent of energy already comes from renewable sources - in 2017, Costa Rica operated on them for a total of 300 days.</seg>
<seg id="4">Costa Rica boasts almost thirty national parks.</seg>
<seg id="5">The density of afforestation also contributes to the reduction of emissions. Rainforests with diverse fauna and flora, which cover more than half of the country, are also one of the main tourist attractions. "Costa Rica is a pioneer in nature conservation and sets an example for other countries in the region, but also around the world. Climate change requires urgent action from all of us," the UN said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="6">Costa Rica boasts almost thirty national parks, which is really a lot due to the small area of ​​the country (51,100 square kilometers). Rainforest or fog forests, coral reefs or mangrove swamps are home to five percent of the world's biodiversity. The country also has volcanoes, picturesque waterfalls and you would also find several rescue stations for sloths.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Attorney General, Pavel Zeman, does not agree with the release of a mother who has long manipulated her daughter and disrupted her relationship with her father. She faced charges of torturing and threatening upbringing. The regional court acquitted her, Zeman disagrees. According to his appeal to the Supreme Court, a similar act can be considered a criminal offense.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Supreme Court's decision could have a broader impact on other cases. "A more specific definition of such a specific form of abuse can be considered necessary in terms of directing further application practice," says Zeman's appeal.</seg>

<seg id="5">The result was pathological fixation on the mother and a markedly negative relationship with the father. The situation marked the emotional development of her daughter, who was even hospitalized. She threatened self-harm if she was handed over to her father's care.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Svitavy court sentenced the mother two years in prison with a two-year suspended sentence. However, the Pardubice branch of the regional court acquitted the woman in the appellate proceedings, it is not a criminal offense. The same verdict was repeated by the regional court even after the Supreme Court had once ordered it to decide again.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Regional Court stated that situations where one parent manipulates a child towards the other are by no means exceptional. It is resolved in custody proceedings, or with the help of psychologists or youth social protection bodies. Only in exceptional cases is criminal law the solution.</seg>

"The accused acted purposefully when she aroused negative feelings towards her father in her daughter, and purposefully strengthened these negative emotions. the sphere of minors will have negative consequences, "stands in the appeal.</seg>
<seg id="9">Zeman asked the Supreme Court to return the case to the regional court. It follows from the appeal that the child is now in the care of the father.</seg>

<seg id="2">The unfortunate accident occurred before half past seven in the evening in the top parts near Čertova mlýn.</seg>
<seg id="3">"It was a very complicated and inaccessible terrain, so we sent five of our rescuers with the appropriate equipment to the injured man. At the same time, we asked the Medical Rescue Service of the Moravian-Silesian Region for cooperation. Beskydy services.</seg>

<seg id="1">Zeman Monumentist - A man stretching the constitution calls for law enforcement</seg>
<seg id="2">Those who move in a camp-divided society and do not want to go completely crazy will welcome a situation where they do not have to support only their own. When he can admit pluses to someone he criticizes otherwise. Just so that he doesn't feel that he or she is orientating himself only according to pre-assigned stickers. Such situations include a list of severely damaged monuments that President Zeman is fencing on his favorite trips to the regions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Everyone knows what's going on. And those who occasionally travel through the Czech Republic see many of those devastated monuments - from the centers of historic towns to individual castles, monasteries, old houses, churches and estates - with their own eyes. Everyone suspects that the word demagoguery can come up here as well. That if we blame the town hall for not taking care of monuments or some horror in the zoning plan, it may be the work of former administrations. Or a privatized building whose owner is not traceable. The head of state local policy calls: "Section of the Monuments Act allows you to fine the owners of buildings who do not care about their property." But even if the owner is untouchable, it must be admitted that the president calls for law enforcement. Which even critics of his bending of the constitution should recognize as a plus.</seg>
<seg id="4">Of course, Milos Zeman would not be Milos Zeman if he considered all the details and formalities of a complex problem. But he stands for a good cause, similar to squatters, which he does not recognize himself. Two years ago, we wrote: "Despite all the insults, the squatters point out a problem that is outside the current interest. That this or that building is in a state of disrepair." And let's admit that the president does the de facto same thing.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you come to the historic center of Jáchymov, you will be amazed at how devastated it is - including houses with Renaissance cores. At a time when Jáchymov is celebrating 500 years of silver mining and tolar minting (dollars for Americans). Why? It is said that due to the rapidly fermented sale of houses in the 1990s, local officials say. But why is it that the seven kilometers distant Ostrov, the seat of the Šliks who minted the Jáchymov tolars, has its historical core nicely repaired? It is good for the President to draw attention to these matters.</seg>

<seg id="2">On September 27, 2019, Prime Minister Andrej Babiš and his wife Monika visited Ground Zero to commemorate the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.</seg>
<seg id="3">Terrorism is the main enemy that all countries in the world should fight together. At the end of his five-day visit to the United States, the Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš announced this today at the New York Memorial to the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001. On this occasion, the Prime Minister honored the memory of two victims of Czech origin.</seg>
<seg id="4">"It is a very moving place," the prime minister said, when accompanied by his wife Monika, he placed a white rose next to Lukáš Rambousek and the Czechoslovak emigrant Alena Sešínová. Both were among more than 2,750 dead killed by a hijacked plane attack on a former pair of World Trade Center (WTC) skyscrapers. The WTC towers collapsed after the crash, and in their place is now a memorial with a list of victims.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It is necessary to remember what happened here, the horror," Babiš said. The Prime Minister identified the attack on the USA on September 11 as the reason why the UN should cooperate in a united campaign against international terrorism. At that time, in addition to destroying the WTC skyscrapers, the terrorists crashed into the building of the Ministry of Defense in Washington and planned another strike on a target in Washington, probably the White House or Congress. However, this plane crashed when passengers confronted the hijackers.</seg>
<seg id="6">"This is our main enemy, there all the countries of the world should unite and fight international terrorism in a coordinated way," the Czech Prime Minister added.</seg>

<seg id="2">Francis Fukuyama's history is somewhat baked. In 1992, at the height of the wave of liberalism that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Iron Curtain, this political scientist wrote in his most famous book, The End of History and the Last Man: the universal acceptance of Western liberal democracy as the final form of government. "</seg>
<seg id="3">Twenty-six years later, we are witnessing more illiberal models from the United States to Russia, from Turkey to Poland, and from Hungary to Italy, and various forms of nationalism and radicalism thrive. Fukuyama's current ninth book, Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment, attempts to cope with the rise of these forces. As his interview with George Eaton shows for the New Statesman, he reconsiders many of his former views: he argues that the ideas of socialism should return to public space, and Marx was right in many ways. At the same time, he insists that his mental development is still in line with the position of the 1990s, and that critics have not understood the end of history and the last man correctly.</seg>
<seg id="4">"What I said then was that one of the problems of modern democracy is that while it provides peace and prosperity, people want more than that ... Liberal democracy does not even try to define what the good life is. It leaves it they do not see the point in individuals who feel alienated and therefore group themselves into identity groups that give them a sense of belonging. "</seg>
<seg id="5">At the time, the book The End of History and the Last Man was written as a strong argument against Marxists who saw communism as the final stage of history. Asked how he now perceives the rise of the Socialists in Britain and the United States, Fukuyama replies: "It all depends on what you mean by socialism. If we are talking about ownership of the means of production, then except when clear services to the public are in demand, I don't think it will work, but if you mean redistribution programs that are trying to solve the huge income and wealth imbalances we're already witnessing, then yes, I think not only could he come back, he should come back. the period started by President Reagan and Prime Minister Thatcher, in which certain types of ideas on the benefits of an unregulated market were discussed, had a catastrophic effect in many ways. "</seg>
<seg id="6">In the end, Fukuyama is trying to calm the current situation and warns all liberals that even the advent of new, not entirely democratic regimes will not mean the end of history.</seg>

<seg id="2">The military has been rehearsing the parade on recent weekends. Shops in central Beijing had to close and residents near the square were ordered to draw curtains. Military vehicles rolled down the empty streets to the square, and fighter jets circled in the sky.</seg>
<seg id="3">Several Chinese have told Reuters that they are proud that their country will show its military strength. But one woman said it was hard to deny that the celebrations would upset other states.</seg>

<seg id="5">The celebrations are also being prepared outside of Beijing. The South China port of Xiamen showed a special light show on Thursday night. Xiamen is located opposite the island of Taiwan and is one of the ten most innovative Chinese cities.</seg>
<seg id="6">Before the anniversary, the list of forbidden things grows. Drone, balloons, dragons, alcohol, radios and radio-wave equipment are already on it, The Guardian said. He added that the popular Chinese social network Weibo is erasing "harmful political information".</seg>
<seg id="7">"This is another milestone, another opportunity to show that the Chinese Communist Party remains (by the oar) despite all predictions," said Maura Cunningham, a historian who deals with China. "This is a time when a party can demonstrate order, control and power," she added.</seg>

<seg id="10">Since the late 1970s, China has increasingly taken over elements of the capitalist economy. According to critics, it is now a mixture of the worst of communism (one-party monopoly and persecution of the opposition) and (Dickensian) capitalism (labor exploitation).</seg>

<seg id="2">These included, for example, incorrect pricing and non-compliance with the principles of fair sales.</seg>
<seg id="3">In one case of discrimination, restaurants in Prague refuse to let smaller children into the business. According to the CTIA, it writes on its website that the device is not suitable for children under the age of eight. "When asked electronically if it was possible to order a table in the restaurant for four adults and one child aged four, the restaurant employee replied electronically that they did not accept the presence of children under the age of eight in the restaurant," Fröhlich added.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the second case, another Prague company did not want to let Czech-speaking people to the table, while allowing English-speaking people to do so. "Czech-speaking inspectors, as consumers, were not allowed to sit at a table in the restaurant and place an order. English-speaking consumers were allowed to do so," the CTIA spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="5">Both cases are now being resolved in administrative proceedings. As they have not yet been finalized, the spokesman for the inspectorate was unable to provide further information on these restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, discrimination occurred in only a very small proportion of restaurants inspected in the second quarter. In total, the CTIA performed 139 inspections. In addition to the two cases mentioned, discrimination revealed other errors in 64 cases. These were mostly shortcomings in compliance with the principles of fair sales and failure to inform the consumer about the prices of products and services in accordance with the regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Already on Wednesday, the inspectorate reported cases of discrimination against foreigners in two Prague restaurants, Clock Caffé and Café Restaurant. In both establishments, foreigners were charged higher amounts than Czech-speaking clients. In these cases, final fines of 60,000 crowns have already been imposed.</seg>

<seg id="1">On holiday only with a credit card? NEO account offers withdrawals from ATMs around the world for free!</seg>
<seg id="2">According to surveys, about half of all Czechs who go abroad have become accustomed to paying directly with a card. The main reasons include comfort, security, but also the opportunity to use travel insurance, which is often associated with a payment card.</seg>
<seg id="3">Travelers in almost every corner of the world can appreciate the convenience of paying by card. This is especially true in popular tourist destinations, but today credit cards are accepted almost everywhere. "People who travel more often, for example for work, do not have time to go to exchange offices repeatedly to exchange cash. And even 'holidaymakers' do not want to rely on cash being enough for them. In addition, some foreign currencies do not even have Czech banks or exchange offices. For the NEO account, we therefore solved this so that its users can withdraw cash from all ATMs free of charge, wherever they are, "says Kateřina Petko, Marketing and Communications Director and Spobank CZ Spokeswoman.</seg>
<seg id="4">In addition, a payment card is a much more reliable way to avoid losing your money than cash. When losing a full wallet, its owner no longer has to wait for the money he carried in it. However, if he loses only his payment card, he can easily block it immediately over the phone or via internet banking. He does not have to suffer any financial loss at all when acting quickly. "In addition to reliable protection, keeping money in a bank account has other advantages. For example, the NEO account has an interest rate of 1.6% per year, which is one of the highest among current and savings accounts. It is set up and managed completely online without having to visit a branch. In addition, the money in the bank account is insured up to 100,000 euros and account maintenance is completely free, "adds Kateřina Petko.</seg>
<seg id="5">Travel insurance should be a matter of course for anyone planning to go abroad. Thanks to the possibility of arranging it and paying with a card online, this can be done even at the last minute. However, the mere ownership of a payment card often means insurance protection when traveling. "For example, with embossed MasterCard Gold and MasterCard Business cards, travel insurance is an integral part of trips abroad to all countries of the world. Holders of these cards can also insure their family with whom they travel. This often eliminates any additional arrangements," adds Kateřina Petko from Expobank CZ. However, it is always advisable to check the scope of the insurance, ie whether it applies to all activities that travelers plan to undertake.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pike in a pond, or a relatively prosperous open-air museum?</seg>
<seg id="2">For his optimistic view, Babiš chose statistics such as good security (the Czech Republic is the seventh in the world), a low unemployment rate, and a low state debt. Or a statement that, according to a recent study, our country is the twenty-fourth in terms of quality of life out of 140 countries evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, developer Dušan Kunovský and architect Josef Pleskot presented other, far from "pink" data in a television interview on the occasion of the Summit of Architecture and Development. For example, that the Czech Republic ranks 154th in the world in terms of construction proceedings. It may be that the current economic "boom" will not leave any significant architectural heritage as it did in the past.</seg>
<seg id="4">The biggest obstacle is not only the current legislation, but also the slow, inefficient bureaucracy. This is also documented by comparative studies in which the Czech Republic lags significantly behind the developed countries in the overall quality and performance of public administration.</seg>
<seg id="5">Our country has simply not yet been able to make good use of the potential of the good economic situation of recent years to invest in the future. It is nice that salaries and pensions are rising, but people with a better standard of living will also want to have a place to live, to travel modernly and quickly, to have quality cultural stalls, to live without an unbearable environmental burden.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in the capital city of Prague, for example, it has not been possible to complete the internal and external circuit for years or to build a high-speed railway or metro to the airport. And Prague does not even have a modern, architecturally daring national library, concert hall or national gallery. The reason is not only absurd struggles for architectural competitions, zoning plans and building permits, but also a kind of specifically Czech conservatism, which adheres to the motto "every bolder change is for the worse".</seg>
<seg id="7">And when it seems that something more daring could be done, it will almost certainly be ruined by conservationists or other somewhat wretched associations, or politicians. In the absurd drama around Jan Kaplický's "blob" designed for the new building of the National Library, President Václav Klaus even wanted to attach himself to the excavators.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, the list does not end with Prague. The Czech Republic is not able to complete its backbone motorway network, nor to start building high-speed train tracks, so Germany eventually decided to run its tracks for super-fast trains from Berlin to Vienna by "detour" through Bavaria. In addition, repairs to the existing infrastructure are often drowned in Schlindrian. Getting from Prague to Brno quickly is a riddle now.</seg>
<seg id="9">Babiš came into politics with the promise that he would "arrange things". But not much has happened so far when it comes to meaningful investment and speeding up cumbersome bureaucratic procedures. Although an amendment to the Act on Accelerating the Construction of Transport Infrastructure has been in force since 2018, we will have to wait for the wider positive effects of, for example, easier land expropriation. And the new building law, approved by the government, which is supposed to reduce the current average length of construction proceedings from 5.4 years to one year, will, if we are lucky, start to apply from 2021. But many people would probably not bet on it. .</seg>

<seg id="2">According to Vladimír Řepka, a spokesman for the office, the Ministry of Justice has received six requests in this connection so far and is now analyzing them. The young man was imprisoned for two years for assaulting a woman, but the judiciary eventually acquitted him.</seg>
<seg id="3">The appeal in the case was not filed by both the Supreme State Attorney Pavel Zeman and the Minister of Justice Marie Benešová.</seg>
<seg id="4">An attempt to assassinate a hairdresser in Hořice took place in February 2013. The Hradec Králové Public Prosecutor's Office accused him of a then twenty-year-old student at the Nečesaný grammar school. The prosecution claimed that he hit a woman in the head several times with a log and then took over ten thousand crowns from her. Her son found a seriously injured woman, her life was saved by doctors from the Hradec Králové hospital.</seg>
<seg id="5">Uncombed from the beginning, he denied any guilt. "I am innocent and I swear. I sincerely regret what happened to the victim, but I am not the perpetrator," the young man said earlier in court, who did not deny that it was a fateful day at the hairdresser's. He said he wanted to get a haircut. But he left after the woman told him she was closing. He then reported to the police as a witness.</seg>
<seg id="6">At first, the hairdresser did not recognize him as the aggressor during the interrogation, but later described Nečesaný as an attacker. According to forensic experts, she suffered from memory loss after the attack.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Hradec Králové Regional Court gradually handed down five judgments in the case. He first found Nečesaný guilty twice and sentenced him to 16 years in prison, and the High Court of Appeal reduced his sentence to 13 years. Uncombed, he gradually headed for bars twice, but each time he was released after the intervention of the Supreme Court. Following the ordered replacement of the judicial panel, repeated acquittals were finally handed down, the last one being upheld by the High Court in March this year.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, the chairman of the Board of Appeal, Jiří Lněnička, also stated in the reasoning of his conclusions that this decision was wrong, but given the procedural situation, he allegedly did not have a better option. He said he had rejected the prosecutor's appeal against the acquittal, even though her objections were justified.</seg>
<seg id="9">"The problem with this case is not that there is a lack of evidence, but its evaluation. We believe that a sufficient amount of evidence has been gathered in the preparatory proceedings, which would be ample enough in other criminal cases to plead guilty," Lněnička stated.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, Hradec Králové and the Supreme Court looked at the case differently, and their opinion would probably not change the further annulment of the acquittal.</seg>

<seg id="2">For the first time, Honzík's parents noticed that something was wrong with him, in a year and a half. He always stared into space for a few minutes, motionless and unresponsive to anyone. The pediatrician therefore sent him to the pediatric neurology clinic, where the doctors diagnosed him with epilepsy after a series of examinations and immediately gave him medication, which did not work immediately.</seg>
<seg id="3">It took almost a year for doctors to find the ideal combination of drugs that completely stopped having seizures. At the age of five, doctors stopped his medication, and because the seizures did not return, his parents thought that Honza was healthy and began to lead him more into sports. He rode a bike, skied, played tennis and floorball, and spent his free time playing games with his sister and friends. At the age of eleven, however, he had another seizure and it all started again.</seg>
<seg id="4">Doctors tried different combinations of drugs again, but this time nothing worked, seizures in the form of absences kept recurring. Since Honza always lost sight of it during the attack, his parents were terrified that he would get it during sports and get injured. Gradually, Honza stopped riding his bike and exchanged downhill skis for cross-country skiing and snowboarding. Although the sport caused him a seizure from time to time, he never gave it up completely. He even fulfilled his dream and finished the Spartan Race, but together with a friend who was always in sight to help him in case of emergency.</seg>
<seg id="5">When Honza was 15 years old, his parents decided to try to change doctors and turned to experts at the University Hospital in Motol. After a series of examinations, the doctors there decided that Honza was a candidate for surgery to remove a lesion from his brain - a source of epileptic seizures. "I had to have 2 surgeries in a row, first the doctors operated into my brain probes that sensed his activity, then they could remove my bearing. It was a hell of a few weeks for me. I just had to lie down and hardly move, wires stuck out of my head that were connected to a computer, "recalls Honza.</seg>
<seg id="6">The operation was successful and the doctors removed a relatively large deposit. "The first days after the operation it was very mentally demanding, Honza was apathetic, confused, sad and almost did not speak. Unlike how normally he is alive and communicative, it was a scary change, but fortunately everything returned to normal after a few days," he describes. mother and adds: "A month and a half after the operation he had 1 seizure, but according to doctors it happens. Since then he has been without a seizure for 3 months."</seg>
<seg id="7">This school year, Honza will be graduating, he enjoys languages ​​in addition to sports, and he has started cooperating with Company E, with which he travels around schools to discuss epilepsy. Honza is not yet fully engaged in sports activities, he is starting to return to sports gradually. "I'm learning how to play sports properly, how to breathe well so that I don't expose my body to sudden stress, which is quite a problem with my competitive nature," explains Honza.</seg>
<seg id="8">This year, therefore, they will not yet actively participate in the traditional EPPI boating triathlon, where patients with epilepsy and healthy athletes meet and which takes place this weekend on September 28, 2019 at Veselská pískovna. But maybe next year.</seg>

There, too, the transaction must be authorized by the antitrust authorities. XXX Lutz announced the purchase of 22 foreign branches of the Kika chain from the Signa holding in May. Signa took over the bankrupt Kika last year for a symbolic price.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Kika chain entered the Czech market in 2005 and is number two after the Swedish company IKEA. Before it was taken over by the Austrian company Signa, it belonged to the South African company Steinhoff International Holdings from 2013. She faced problems when she discovered discrepancies in her accounting. Kika has nine stores in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="6">XXX Lutz has been operating in the Czech Republic since 2010. In addition to IKEA, Sconto, Jysk and Asko-Nábytek and Kika, it is one of the largest furniture retailers on the domestic market. The Möbelix brand has the same owner. Following the acquisition of Kika's foreign branches, XXX Lutz will operate more than 300 department stores in 12 countries. According to the company's website, its annual turnover is 4.4 billion euros (about 114 billion CZK).</seg>
